Novelty beverage

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,592

Zaroxolyn

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,296
I know a lot about Alex Jones

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:28,160
I don't know anything about Alex Jones and clearly you don't know a lot about

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,744
Bringing the heat some emotionally deflated because I opened

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,048
The door today and Jordan had brought over

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Hard cider

11
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,752
Myxovirus

12
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,824
Alcoholic beverage

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,848
I don't know dude

14
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,384
This Is A Dangerous Game

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,432
For AAA to be engaged

16
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
Is it the most

17
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,088
Seltzer game is

18
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,136

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,208
Information

00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,424
You can catch me on the street freaking taquiza catch me out there the Bartles & Jaymes

You know I used to f*** with eczema

00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Whatever that metal phenomenon

23
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,808
Why is this a punishment I love this delicious elixir

24
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
That last part's not true

25
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,952
We are we're doing another episode

26
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Wow

00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,000
Wow coming out

00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
The gate

29
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:42,912
Do navigate with energy you know what I'm just I'm in a position where I'm still a little bit rough

30
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
From our

31
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:49,824

33
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
I'm going to get there

34
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,624
A little bit of I got some Rust in the gears

35
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,232
Today my brain was

36
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
Dying on the inside but

37
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,144
During the show man I got it

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
Yeah for my friend

39
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,800
Unprofessional professionalism

40
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:26,688
Hey we're going to be talking a little bit about the April 2nd 2018 episode of Alex's show and then we'll have some

41
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:32,064
I'm fine afterwards I don't like the way you put that was inspecting like

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
Talk on

43
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,416

Hilarious

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
His Monday episode here on April 2nd and Sabine look really interesting on a couple levels

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
Haven't really boring for the rest of it

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
Start off texting your professionalism

49
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,904
Little boy

50
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,232
Your professionalism out the window

51
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,328
Sarcastic

52
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,288
Steve people treating him when he was younger

53
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
He wasn't supposed

54
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,432
Can you sort of saying it in the voice of the people picked on him

55
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,760
But still

56
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
So on a episode Alex

57
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
Does a lot of talking about

58
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
How's cell phones are going

59
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,008
So you the lot of that everything all of the s*** that's coming down on

60
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Call Emma's hardest

61
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,080
Possum or less

62
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
He gets in

63
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
To this

64
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
He starts

65
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
Talking about the Parklands

66
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Survivors

67
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
David Hogg

68
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,808
Course

69
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,928
In the past Alex has had like a really

70
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,000
Awful but sort of defensible position in bike

71
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
Hey everyone saying that I said he was a crisis actor I didn't I just implied it very heavily

72
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
People who did say

73
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
EXO

74
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
This is where things take a little bit of a

75
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
If somebody says

76
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,895
David Hogg is a crisis actor in your life

77
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
That is saying the David Hogg is a Christ

78
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
If I were to say

79
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Do you

80
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
Hmmm you define the term

81
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,095
I kind of think you're saying that before

82
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,703
But this is where on this April 2nd show

83
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,007
Turn

84
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
A bit about David Hogg

85
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Is trulieve

86
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Disgraceful

87
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,479
This weekend

88
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
Article about it

89
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Headline

90
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
David

91
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
Shooting

92
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,535
Not just a little Clips but the longer

93
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,935
It's not out of

94
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,519
I wasn't home when the shooting happened

95
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,359
Androgyny

96
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
He does

97
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,487
I was at the school in the class when the shooting started

98
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,559
What the teacher said we heard the shots we close the door

99
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,727
Other

100
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Closet

101
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
Away

102
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
The shooting

103
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,991
In class when the shooting starts you close the door

104
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
So

105
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,575
This is a real big problem

106
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
I don't

107
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,327
Okay around on the world

108
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,423
Particularly on redstate.com

109
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,727
Sad

110
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,799
This news about the interview with David Hogg

111
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,847
CBS

112
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
Piece of paper together where you says

113
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
That's all

114
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
You got on his bikes

115
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
From his house and went to the school to shoot dinner

116
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
Okay

117
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
How is it

118
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
There's no way

119
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,023
School shooting

120
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
You heard about it

121
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,607
Then it couldn't be happening during the

122
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,911
The shooting itself there is no

123
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,055
Oh okay okay I got to figure that you got to tell me more about this this isn't.

124
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
He was talking about the evil

125
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Alright

126
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Alright

127
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Perfect

128
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,855
How about I was at home and then I went

129
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
To the school

130
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,719
He's talking about after he had already gone home after the shooting

131
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
He left his house at 6

132
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
P.m.

133
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
It's very clear the timeline is

134
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
Incredibly consistent

135
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
Throughout all of the interviews that he's given

136
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,007
Interview after the shooting I took my camera got on my bike

137
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
I wrote it based

138
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Twilight

139
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,615
My bike 3 miles down

140
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Find my way to

141
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
The school as I've done in previous years

142
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,503
All the way I was making sure my camera bag

143
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Is it a certain way

144
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
A falls out note

145
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Be destroyed

146
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
I start shooting b-roll and ice

147
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Sea Fox News over there

148
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,975
I knew I wanted to talk on the news and make sure there was ads

149
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
Especially with so many people from

150
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
The NRA

151
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,607
Different gun-toting Americans who watch Fox News

152
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,167
I went on the day of the shooting and said quote

153
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
There cannot be another mass shooting

154
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,079
I think that's partially why but I also but also other people started saying that

155
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
It's insane

156
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
The fact that there's more bullet holes in those windows

157
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
Better been proposed

158
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Impastor

159
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
To save these kids lives

160
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
So

161
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,279
Alex is taking the CBS

162
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
Completely out of context

163
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,655
Fit during the day

164
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
Right now

165
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Problem

166
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
Because now is Alex's pushing this narrative

167
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Think that

168
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
He is a completely fake

169
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Implanted

170
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
Realized

171
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:55,807
I'm supposed to be at work faking being a rectum of a crime today

172
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
And this

173
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
He's a real real serious problem

174
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
Continues down this road

175
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
He will be

176
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,767
Very very deeply into the crisis actor

177
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
Wow bundle

178
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
Or whatever

179
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
Interesting Lee

180
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
I mean to work

181
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
Does that even f****** matter

182
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,007
Even if even if this were the case

183
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
It's unfortunate

184
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Even if Alex

185
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,431
Veritiv and these these f****** alright assholes is 100% correct

186
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,015
Then the school shooting still f****** happy

187
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
But that's the larger

188
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,279
It's unfortunate if he is saying that he was there whenever he was

189
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
But people were there

190
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Who gives a s***

191
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
He's right

192
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Interesting

193
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,031
I don't know I don't know how I would address that but I would say that red-state

194
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Their story

195
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,431
And I've said quote I am sorry for the error and have updated the post according

196
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
GPS included a very confusing

197
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Without context

198
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
Not really you guys just don't care

199
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Define pecan

200
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
Ready to say I want to act

201
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,791
Super fun Alex goes with it

202
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
We got an article I mentioned it

203
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,031
But I'd already been banned off YouTube videos block

204
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,903
I realize why they were so scared

205
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
What went on

206
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Didn't want you

207
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,959
Defraud

208
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Yes you at

209
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,479
Paul Joseph Watson found his Reddit

210
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Not

211
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
To-die-for depopulation

212
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,911
The perfect globalist leftist religion

213
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
This whole program

214
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
So he takes this

215
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
These two pieces of information

216
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
Are both either

217
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
Completely misrepresented or not true

218
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,735
Like

219
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,319
The school does inconsistencies in his story is just not true

220
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
The Reddit

221
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
Things that

222
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,415
I don't know

223
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
It's joke

224
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,743
But being willfully

225
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
Misrepresented

226
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
The two of them

227
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
To be like

228
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
Of course

229
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,143
He wants depopulation

230
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
I imagine these globalist

231
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
They also want a population

232
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
He's

233
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
Perfect person for them to have groom beforehand

234
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
Not good

235
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Again

236
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
I'm the only person

237
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Legitimately

238
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Cauliflower

239
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
You should attack you

240
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:18,815
Also on this episode of mad because the pope has an article about he said that they are

241
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Angel

242
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
The hell does

243
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Exist which

244
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
You're going to go with a biblical

245
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,359
Interview

246
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
Eugenio scalfari

247
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
And he said

248
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
They are not punished

249
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
Those who repent

250
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Forgiveness and

251
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Take their place among the ranks

252
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
To those who

253
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
Complete him but those who did not return

254
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
Cannot be forgiven disappear

255
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
A hell doesn't exist

256
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
The Disappearance of spending Souls

257
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
So that's the quote that Alex

258
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
It's f****** hot and bothered about

259
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,935
Fart

260
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
The Bible more than

261
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
But hold on man

262
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
The Vatican

263
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Denies

264
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
Did this interview even

265
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
Took place there's no recording

266
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
The guy is notorious for not

267
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,223
He's a 93 year old journalist

268
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:14,623
According to the guardian Eugenio scalfari

269
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:19,999
His quotes to Pride himself on not taking notes are recording high-profile interviews

270
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,327
Right that's that's a weird thing to take private

271
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
Sodapop

272
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
Stefan

273
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
No one knowing if anything

274
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
He says it's true

275
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
It's like Michael Wolff

276
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
The Vatican

277
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,639
Comments were quote the fruit of scalf Ari's Rica

278
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Construction

279
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,735
And not a faithful transcription of the Holy father's words

280
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
Suggested he did do the interview

281
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Confirm that

282
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,975
For denying what they just said was

283
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
He did do the interview any use

284
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
Creating that hole

285
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Yeah

286
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,167
So so the Vatican did confirm that

287
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,239
Bro alright

288
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
The Vatican is denying that he said these things

289
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
Isn't that it's not accurate

290
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
To the vet their beliefs

291
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
Or Pope Francis

292
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
This belief

293
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
That is not stop Alex

294
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:20,159
From screaming about how he's the devil for

295
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,695
About how very elite

296
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Oh no

297
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
They love to do DMT

298
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:30,143
Speak to little beings that they find on the other side

299
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Somebody bringing

300
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
Some rationality

301
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:41,407
The little bit they talked to Dee and Ayahuasca and in their hallucinations they get program

302
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,711
Instructions

303
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,063
From the Otherworld entities that are running globalism

304
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,695
Listen to Regal for being somewhat

305
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,023
So so not even the bad guys

306
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,607
No. It's the little beings that they contact

307
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:05,983
They're the ones who are coming up with the sort of game plan of the globalist

308
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
What what happened

309
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
Railing against big guys from the

310
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,359
I don't know man

311
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
Discovered the issue is like

312
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
You're stupid

313
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Because

314
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,015
She's not you

315
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Alex

316
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,855
Super good friends with Joe Rogan

317
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,695
He is literally the biggest DMT proponent in pop culture

318
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
Hosted a documentary about it

319
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,071
The cult The Spirit Molecule

320
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
You're right

321
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
He is a big advocate of Colusa

322
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
The gym

323
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,103
Probably

324
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,479
People

325
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,831
There's a mention below and above

326
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,391
Whether it's real or not

327
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
You have the Spirit guides

328
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,863
Mescalito and all this

329
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,895
Okay Alex

330
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
I do like wait

331
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,343
Whether it's real or not you do have spirit guide

332
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
I don't know what that

333
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:32,511
Mathematics believe it or not

334
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,327
I don't know you're saying but I do

335
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
If a little goat man comes up to you

336
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
She is not your friend

337
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Cool

338
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
I mean

339
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,847
Is that what's going on later

340
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,431
Mr. tumnus

341
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
I like

342
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Alright

343
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
You got to work on your too babe babe

344
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:05,023
I don't I can't take Kenny Rogers and the first edition

345
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
I thought it was going to

346
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:10,399
As I started saying the name of the band I thought it was going to end eventually but it's Edition

347
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,239
Look man I'm right

348
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Give me a higher.

349
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:26,271
That's it for the 2nd

350
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:30,111
Alex about the pope and Alex

351
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
Launching fun what will become a

352
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
Potentially

353
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:41,375
Slanderous narrative about David Hogg it will turn into

354
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
You're committing life

355
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
What's another guy to now

356
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
Man

357
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
Give us a call dude

358
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,551
He was one of the guys

359
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
From

360
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
There whatever

361
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,695
Alex

362
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,999
Mischaracterize as the shooter

363
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
And Daniel's article that was on

364
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Infowars

365
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
It's doing Alex

366
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
I don't think

367
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
If that's going to work

368
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
I think it's absolutely

369
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
Will you take

370
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,031
The stand and testify

371
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
Cuz that's not a crime

372
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
Adjusted bad reporting

373
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
Depressed

374
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,503
Is protected assuming they're using good faith

375
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
You know it

376
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Hip roof

377
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,415
Fly in court the ability to be like

378
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,487
To say intentionally

379
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
Did bad work

380
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,839
The reason why I like slander laws

381
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
Very difficult

382
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Very difficult

383
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
To prove intent

384
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,471
In terms of slander cuz he want to err on the side of

385
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
Awesome amazing honest

386
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
Mistaken we don't want to punish them for it

387
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
Alex uses

388
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Abuses

389
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
That leeway over and over

390
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
This will be another case

391
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
The case will be thrown out

392
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
I don't know I think if

393
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,295
You can establish a pattern of behavior

394
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
Then you can

395
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,135
I think you can generally prove intent in this

396
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
In this Arkham

397
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,975
Difficult

398
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,999
You can't improve

399
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
You can't prove it

400
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
Intent against

401
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
This guy

402
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,143
Like you can prove his intent

403
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Deceive

404
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,727
Yeah prove his intent to destroy

405
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,311
I don't think you can prove that he even gives a s*** about this year

406
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,871
It'll be tough to prove malice directed at

407
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
Who knows

408
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
Now to the fun

409
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,039
Okay

410
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
Burbot mouth

411
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
The right around the corner

412
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
To get to the matchups

413
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
In the drop bracket

414
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Any moment

415
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:47,071
And I realize I was telling you about this

416
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
What are the parts

417
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
To the bet

418
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
Of my old bracket

419
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
But I did

420
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,215
Was I intentionally didn't do them in March

421
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Because I

422
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
Thought it was really stupid how somebody

423
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
F****** blogs

424
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,663
Alarm

425
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
I got a I got to push

426
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
Is this off until April

427
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:14,207
So now we're in April

428
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,023
April and so far

429
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
The matchups

430
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
From the guest

431
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Division

432
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
We have

433
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,775
Giving Alex Jones Mariners last night

434
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
To the next round

435
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,383
And then also we had for Alex

436
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
It's time to pray

437
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Versus

438
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,759
Alex saying he has to leave a rally to go pray

439
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,207
There's a lot of love for the big guy in the back of that rally screaming

440
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,535
Showed up for that

441
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,863
It's time to pray has made it onto the next round

442
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
And I should say that we are doing this

443
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
And we will

444
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,007
Only be going over the first round today

445
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
But I am ready

446
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
The entire

447
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,687
Yep all right and I am ready

448
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
To reveal all of the

449
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,111
This podcast that we've done in the last year-and-a-half herself

450
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
We've looking through a lot

451
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
They actually

452
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,960
They were very very polite

453
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:34,336
They had some bad idea but you're not a friendly character

454
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
I think if I did DMT

455
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,528
Hospital

456
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:48,928
There's something wrong with my subconscious clearly I'm not going to listen to a hallucination that's telling me to kill people

457
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Kind of

458
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
Hockey

459
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,768
How big

460
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,816
How big do you think is a little GoPro

461
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,168
Some size would be

462
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
The little gold personal beast for four-and-a-half

463
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,968
Lucy and children

464
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,016
Wasn't that much taller

465
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Well that's

466
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,320
True but I think you had a hunch

467
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,624
The f****** dope guy

468
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
Look if you can't if you have

469
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,888
Reversible

470
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,960
Reversible nieces that truck

471
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:36,544
Flamingos need for the doctor's call it

472
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,664
A little goat guy for

473
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
I would say

474
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
I was a little goat guy to me

475
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
Almost almost pocket

476
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,464
Hi Nico.

477
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,120
Episode

478
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
I would like to

479
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
To keep them in a little bag

480
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,824
Like a like a Paris Hilton dog specially if it's broken

481
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,920
My girlfriend

482
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,504
We got to go into parties

483
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,344
Number one

484
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,464
Pieczenik manners license has moved on to the next round but now it is time for us

485
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Closeout

486
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,328
The division in a reveal what the other end

487
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
The number 3 seed in the guest division

488
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
Is

489
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,824
Rodger Stone interviewing Rick derringers wife

490
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,224
Infowars

491
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:55,392
The real American very proud

492
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,768
It sounded 280 estime so I told Rick and

493
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,144
He said it's to 80s and then I came up with the idea of having

494
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
Space Oddity

495
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:14,336
So alright controversial choice to be in the number three seed but let me explain

496
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
Why does selection committee put it in there

497
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,808
Here's why it's 3:00.

498
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
Alright

499
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,696
It's possible it should be in the number one spot

500
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Or whatever

501
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,072
The number 3 seed Rodger Stone interviewing

502
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,864
Rick derringers wife

503
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,936
Is deserving of the number three seed for two reasons

504
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
It's absurd

505
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:47,360
Yes second claim to come up with the most important part of that song

506
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,664
Like it's 280

507
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,064
But the reason is because episode where Rodger interviews Rick Derringer and his

508
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,368
Is the episode where

509
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,696
Jerome corsi was supposed to reveal all of the stuff

510
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:08,096
But he had learned that would have gotten him killed

511
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:14,752
Rodger Stone shows up half an hour late

512
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:20,640
Just for contacts that is that is gorgeous

513
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,688
Unfortunately it's going up against

514
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
Incredibly strong competitor

515
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
It's all we spoke

516
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,344
Into it is Larry Nichols

517
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,912
And they were they went to a church

518
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,960
For witches

519
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:58,016
Lady that was trying to run sometimes

520
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,808
Place where they did

521
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
Wichita

522
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,880
Hillary went to a church

523
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,904
Worship

524
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:10,304
Which also artery artery meditates the three witches tickets babe

525
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
Linda bloodworth-thomason

526
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
Which Hillary Clinton

527
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
Delta Burke

528
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
Three witches of Designing Women honorable mention also to Larry Nichols

529
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
Focus was based off

530
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,664
The song Hocus Pocus by Focus

531
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,456
Honorable mention

532
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
What are nickels

533
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,296
I wish there was room for all of his stupid comment

534
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,368
But President Obama

535
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
Is about as ready

536
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
Leave office as I am

537
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,512
To be a duck

538
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,608
I would almost throw in our interview where he says

539
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,824
I felt like our own stuff and Project Camelot stuff

540
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,200
Larry Nichols going up against Rodger Stone featuring Rick derringers wife rounding out the force

541
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
Received

542
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
Of the guest division

543
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
Very exciting

544
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,368
The natural

545
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,952
All about it

546
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
Soap

547
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,024
Clips

548
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
Those come from the religious

549
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,632
Right before seeds in a religious division

550
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,960
And he's already moved on the ones

551
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,264
I'm here are

552
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
The other entry

553
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Now you know we have

554
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Alex

555
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
To clip saying

556
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,688
It's time to pray

557
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,224
I got to leave this f****** place

558
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
So it might surprise you

559
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
The

560
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
Number three

561
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
Does not pray everyday

562
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
Strong

563
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,408
Strong review of Prayer

564
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
It seems to help me

565
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,320
Is there a

566
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,696
Four out of five star right right

567
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,768
The dessert place

568
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,352
Maybe because of how contradictory it is to

569
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
All the other

570
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Prayer clip

571
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,704
But that will be going up against the

572
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,240
The number to seeds

573
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
Is it like

574
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:35,200
Does he think he's still bragging about doing I think he is

575
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,528
I don't do it every day I still do

576
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,600
Which is better than you

577
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,416
I just did it

578
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:52,096
Yeah so my little girlfriend

579
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,888
Tiny little Doughboy

580
00:28:54,656 --> 00:29:00,032
Like a little Jim Breuer

581
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
Definitely not your friend

582
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
M4u

583
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,968
The number two seed

584
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
I can't help it

585
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:28,192
I'm picking that one to go to the cemetery that's not better than it's time to rise

586
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,544
That's true

587
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
Red Alert Red Alert

588
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Come on

589
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:43,040
I didn't feel better until I called the pope a devil wears a great I had a headache

590
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,368
But I called the Pope the devil worshiper and

591
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
Jubilant

592
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,744
Just B calling the popo

593
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
Can Hugh you much like juice

594
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
Therapeutic

595
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
I don't know

596
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:03,776
People think I think that's a that's a pretty even

597
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,104
App Store

598
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,968
All right we'll see who see how the people vote

599
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
So in the neck

600
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
The next

601
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,600
Division division

602
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,624
Stop

603
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,416
Is a 16-seed bracket

604
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
Quips and all the religion

605
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
Just Clips

606
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
And that brings us

607
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
To the next division

608
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Alex

609
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
Swearing

610
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:38,592
So it is the first matchup from the alligator wearing division

611
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,872
Where he talks about

612
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
Somebody pissed in

613
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
You'll notice

614
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Where can I get

615
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,576
4th Street excuse me

616
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:53,184
You will notice I think all of these do ended

617
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,280
This should be literally no surprise to anybody

618
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
It's going up again

619
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
It's number one seed

620
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,656
Fill your hand Adam Schiff hell yeah

621
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
Okay I love the gray fox

622
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,008
But Chef looks like the ark

623
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,824
Archetypal c*********

624
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,408
With those little deer in the headlight eyes and all his stuff

625
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,456
And there's something about this fairy

626
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,808
Bossing everybody around

627
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,600
Tell Congressman Schiff

628
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,880
And all the rest of them

629
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,672
Hey listen a******

630
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:29,024
What sing Rodger and I never use cussing in 22 years without the gloves are off

631
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,560
What's inside of a b****

632
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,192
You want to sit here and say that I'm a goddamn f****** Russian

633
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,776
You get my face without I'll beat your goddamn ass you son-of-a-b****

634
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
Listen Buckhead

635
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,992
Get that through your goddamn f****** head

636
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,784
Pushing your s***

637
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,136
You're the country over

638
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
Yeah

639
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,288
From the first moment we heard it

640
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
Poetry

641
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,344
You son of a son of a b**** you piece of s*** calling me a Russian feel your hand

642
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,744
It brought feel your hand into our lives

643
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,792
There's so much

644
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,328
Going on there

645
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,936
I mean it's over a minute for him screaming obscenities at Adams

646
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
It's

647
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
Poorly poorly

648
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
For Lake

649
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
She's really bad it's where

650
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
It's tough man

651
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,896
It's time for anything to

652
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
Be a number one

653
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,712
Is in the

654
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,504
Consideration

655
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,296
In the swearing section like

656
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,112
I don't know what you're going to do

657
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:02,464
Might have a chance know what I'm going to I'm not going to lie I think that one

658
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
That I don't

659
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
I think that one is going to go that far

660
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,424
I do not think it's going to get beat by your bucket of rotten pissed

661
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
Filter whatever

662
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,776
That's the first matchup that's

663
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
What's the number one verse

664
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
4C

665
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,872
And that brings us to the number to versa

666
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
The number three

667
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
Who's better

668
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,528
Conservative

669
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,904
That's not the best

670
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,184
But it

671
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
It's fun cuz of the b****

672
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,792
Feel like Alec

673
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
Do you like

674
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,376
Conservative

675
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936
About how I think of him

676
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Almost

677
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
It's almost

678
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:52,640
You would say that like that seems to me like something I would say

679
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,016
Brightright

680
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:04,160
That's going up against number two seed and swearing division

681
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
To unsee

682
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
I feel your hand

683
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
Adam Schiff but that is

684
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
Because this

685
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
This is profound

686
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,608
The Andersons of course

687
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,400
From a very drunk Special Report

688
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,776
American flag

689
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424
Yeah

690
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,984
About the reason that I think of that his

691
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,776
The potential to eclipse

692
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,056
Refill your hand clip

693
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
It's because like

694
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,152
There is so much more real anger there I think

695
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,968
Now I think he was he was doing is Dianne Feinstein

696
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,624
Right

697
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:20,448
Then his Italian mafia what's going on here

698
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
I think

699
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
I think

700
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
The

701
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,032
Like I don't think

702
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:29,664
Especially every form of the time that we've been doing it we don't have any other clothes of Alex just directly

703
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
Q

704
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,968
And that's pretty wild

705
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,528
Yeah cuz that's direct whereas

706
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,344
Iceman

707
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,648
That's some championships wearing right there

708
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,744
It's amazing how bad he is like

709
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:49,632
F****** piece of s*** f*** it like the drunk at a bar that makes you feel

710
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,656
I swear

711
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,264
But if I was at a bar with a guy swearing like that

712
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Grow up

713
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,872
Yeah reaction

714
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
Are you a child

715
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,368
Is this podcast we decided to move on to something else

716
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,184
Alex

717
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
Tragic

718
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
State of delay.

719
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,888
Yeah that's what's going on is that of a child

720
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,680
That's why he doesn't understand anything

721
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,728
So you don't understand anything he reads

722
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,520
Yeah we got a f****** tell him about the rabbit

723
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,896
Brutal thankfully can't read that book so you didn't get the reference

724
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
Otherwise I'd be really mad at us

725
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,992
That brings

726
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,296
Division

727
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
This last division

728
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
It was incredibly difficult

729
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
Figure out

730
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,184
Should be laid out

731
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:49,280
And so I decided

732
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,584
It is it is a miscellaneous

733
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,424
There was there were some other thoughts I had but like

734
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,984
Legitimately the idea of the amount of work it would take

735
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,776
To do a 32c bracket

736
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,848
Just beyond what I have bandwidth for at the point

737
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,176
So here we are we have these for seeds in the miscellaneous section

738
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,456
We will start

739
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,272
With other number for versus the number one

740
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,576
Number for

741
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,096
Yeah

742
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,936
Do you want to do baby

743
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,544
I don't know how to

744
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,824
Steve the miscellaneous

745
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,152
50 how you seated it

746
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,176
Because

747
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,968
Is gold my friends gold

748
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:44,320
You rock and roll band it's gold as a drop I tried to Wavy like

749
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
Drop versus like

750
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,648
Weird

751
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,208
It's difficult

752
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,744
Sort of standing in place

753
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,304
A lot of the other times you saying

754
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,144
The best example of him singing something

755
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,472
It's immediately unclear that he's trying to say

756
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,240
Cat song

757
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,848
Is that hot

758
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
He sounds a lot worse

759
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
You bring back a

760
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
Did you bring back our ludicrous

761
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
No

762
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:20,928
No I should have

763
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,744
Whataburger amazing listeners

764
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,048
Play student it's too regular

765
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
He says it all the time

766
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:33,728
Think about that but he doesn't even sing free-for-all all the time

767
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
Decagon

768
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
The Rhythm

769
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
The rhythm of it was perfect

770
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:50,624
If I if I had this all to do over I probably would have an entire section

771
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,672
Yeah but yeah that would be

772
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,440
But

773
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Nova delay

774
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,304
Chatroom the

775
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
Embellishment of his listener numbers

776
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,544
This next turn

777
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:14,432
Is actually 2 clips

778
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Depression Bragg

779
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,600
I feel like that's actually grandfathered-in

780
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
In the

781
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,000
Don't tell your mother you're brilliant

782
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,792
I feel like that's been

783
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
We come

784
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,240
I took stuff out of context

785
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,032
4

786
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,896
Jar Jar Binks thing in the the policy walk drop

787
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
He's actually saying

788
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
Isn't that funny

789
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:54,880
Like it's just commenting on the character of Jar Jar Binks

790
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:59,488
Exactly what the rest of it

791
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:03,840
I just imagine backlash

792
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
Jar Jar Binks

793
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:09,216
It's drop ulcer what makes it fun is the way I cut it

794
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,752
Together to make it sound like you

795
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,824
You saying the Jar Jar Binks baby

796
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,152
He was yelling about Colin Kaepernick

797
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
Them together

798
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,992
Splice together

799
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,808
Are funny but the actual things that come from Arkansas

800
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
That

801
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
Technocrat

802
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:30,976
As a

803
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,280
We'll see they take him out of context

804
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,096
Isn't a single bracketeering is.

805
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:40,960
Before

806
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,496
I respect that but

807
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
There's reason

808
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,336
Eclipse

809
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,944
I couldn't decide which was representative of

810
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,296
Valve

811
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,072
Really

812
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,056
So there's that event here is the second part of

813
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,384
He's doing.

814
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
Suffrage

815
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,456
There's a different flavor of it too I think

816
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,248
I think the number one seed is Oliver

817
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,928
What I do

818
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,976
Liberal Liberal

819
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
Soap

820
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,520
Flipside of the liberal coin

821
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,128
Like Smeagol or some s***

822
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:58,271
But that also we are also going to add a

823
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,295
Bracket

824
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,831
Chirp

825
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,903
It's important

826
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,975
To remember to that like that click you heard of the beginning there was

827
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,303
Opening a switchblade

828
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
That should do

829
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,887
A boat

830
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:17,215
Liberal vs number 46

831
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:22,847
Navigate to number 2 and 3 seed and this was difficult a little difficult

832
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
The parameters of

833
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,663
The miscellaneous

834
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
Division is

835
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
It's wide open

836
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
Not just religious

837
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
Foursquare ringer

838
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,855
Gassed up your setting this up

839
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
I'm trying to get my cell

840
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,695
IPad

841
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:43,327
Here's number three Alex Jones talking about making a startling confession about his sexuality

842
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Contacts

843
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,711
Belongs and

844
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,807
Partially because of the end

845
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,599
That clip is never going to end

846
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:11,743
This joke is never going to end because that's almost a cry for help there

847
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,303
If you like the o.c.

848
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
Alex

849
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
Please

850
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:20,959
Well yeah

851
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,007
Julia something

852
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,847
Capitalist

853
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,407
I believe he was also hitting on her

854
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:33,759
Shuffle look at things without that prism very flirty

855
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,551
I think he actually lets her house

856
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
For a good

857
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,927
Couple segments on that shows

858
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,719
But so that's

859
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,255
Number three

860
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,559
What's the number to Z

861
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,143
And it's probably is in the number two seed because it's

862
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
Gross

863
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,495
Something that doesn't say

864
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:58,079
If we talked about this I'm not sure if we did

865
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
It doesn't get enough

866
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,407
P***

867
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,991
Please

868
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,415
You know what I like

869
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,511
Girl

870
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,071
From the 50s

871
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,375
Women

872
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,215
Like a waitress in a

873
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:37,759
A representation of Alex being gross

874
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,039
Boudreaux's

875
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,087
I like just sitting

876
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,391
For an hour and looked it up girls

877
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,975
Like multiple or just

878
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,743
Just the one

879
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,535
Probably

880
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
Multiple I think he likes

881
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,375
Selection

882
00:44:53,887 --> 00:45:00,031
He has to have the calendar that had like 10 up shots of me and McAdoo on it back and

883
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,103
Find

884
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:09,759
Swimsuit pictures of her on the internet because of that kind of takes away from some of her

885
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,319
Credibility

886
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,647
You know I don't know I'm not judging her for it.

887
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,719
That's a tough question to ask

888
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,535
Who has no journalist

889
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:27,935
The credibility via their own journal

890
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:37,919
Go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

891
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,735
That would be up on Wednesday

892
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,039
What do you think what would you pick as your winner

893
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:48,415
I don't know how things are going to break but I mean because

894
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,719
Your personal like

895
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
Can you dance

896
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:59,679
If you were going to vote for the ultimate winner

897
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,959
Kind of

898
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
Flavor of

899
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
Alex Jones

900
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,567
I don't know but I think it's

901
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
Tumi

902
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,431
I can tell you what I think is going to

903
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,223
We should win out of each division

904
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:16,063
Let's say

905
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,903
My prediction for these final four is

906
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,439
VR

907
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
Screaming f*** you

908
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
Act liberal

909
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:35,007
I think is a religious vision

910
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:41,407
Probably Pope

911
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
Compact

912
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
And it get to the point

913
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,039
It's time to pray

914
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,831
I think that is

915
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,367
I meant from the gas division

916
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
I mean I'm biased

917
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:58,559
We talked to him but I got to go with Larry Nichols

918
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
No

919
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,887
Weather

920
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:04,959
It's just like it

921
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,983
In the brick

922
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
Well that's

923
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:18,015
I don't know I don't know the reality of it not really particularly care

924
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,807
I have a soft spot

925
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,623
For Larry Nichols photos gone

926
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,695
He's up there is my favorite crazy

927
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
Going to be tough

928
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,767
If it makes it to the next round

929
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,071
Steve pieczenik manners lesson versus Larry Nichols

930
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,679
I don't know how that's going to break

931
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
I know

932
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
I thought you were

933
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,543
Going to ask me how I'm doing

934
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,871
I know what about you what are you what are your

935
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
Wood ear pick

936
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:51,807
Make any impression that he does

937
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,343
Automatically kind of something

938
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,879
Think that I I like I don't think

939
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,159
Italian

940
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:02,559
The only reason I'm partially his Impressions because there's nothing I love more than

941
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,119
Making fun of his impression

942
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,703
Then calling it something else I don't know how I can enjoy that

943
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,239
So that's that's your pic

944
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,031
Yeah

945
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:16,383
Little Goat

946
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,967
I was outside of the time frame

947
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,015
Imma go with us

948
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,135
I'm going to go with that as the as the ultimate winner

949
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,743
It's a really perfect encapsulation

950
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,023
Alex is about

951
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,839
So those are those are the seeds my friends

952
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,655
Visa that get the voting I hope everyone
