00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Holding

00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
I am Joy

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,760
You were trying to sell the show

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,808
You were not talking to a tank

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
Michael Corinthos

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
Okay

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
What would you describe

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,464
You should get into Tango Court

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,304
Podcast

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
But I do know Tango

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:40,960
Anybody is not a tangled cord enthusiasts

13
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,240
Have you heard about Chris

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:47,872
Flights

15
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,408
And that twist makes things

16
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,712
Absolutely

17
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
Like at angle

18
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,184
Episode for a while

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,584
I thought you were leaving for a month

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
Where can I go

21
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,168
I told you before the show I got

22
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,728
Confused cuz you're doing the month at Zanies

23
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:20,128
In the future in the near future and you're going on vacation now and I combined the two into a

24
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,712
I don't listen well

25
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
It is only because of Jamie's month coming up that I'll be able to afford the vacation I'm going on now right right

26
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,304
This is our last live episode

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
Or two like possibly fit into be a delightful time

28
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
Before we get going

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
I'd like to give a shout out to

30
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
Strong people

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,904
Affect

32
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,512
Like to give a shout out and thank you to do

33
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
Natalya brilliant someone sodomites Italy a bucket of poop

Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean

35
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,152
Loser

36
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
I don't want

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,344
Jesus Christ

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,744
Go to our website

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,144
We would appreciate it mean a lot that I wanted to do

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,520
On Thursdays and then are broadcast on Friday

41
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:58,176
These are the week episode figured out

42
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
That we should do a wrap up

43
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Episode

44
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
So we did that was last time

45
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,856
Towers in

46
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
That was a disaster

47
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,232
So what I was badass

48
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:16,096
I was up until 5 or 6 in the morning editing effects

49
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,192
So I was kind of hoping to avoid something like that

50
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,264
Who is do a

51
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,104
Top 10 things you missed this week on Alex

52
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:35,552
I f***** up

53
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:41,952
I wasn't keeping track of anything that's just

54
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,024
No you are not on 10

55
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
No sir

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
Nor like

57
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
The pro wrestler

58
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,616
Gimmick is the number 10

59
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:04,736
20 about it a little bit

60
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
And

61
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,112
Interesting and other things

62
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,208
Some of it is very exciting to start with Tuesday March

63
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
20

64
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Meacham

65
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,935
On the show trustworthy

66
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,799
Is the guy from the United Kingdom who got in trouble with the law because he made a video of himself

67
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
Teaching his dog how does Zeke heil

68
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:42,623
The dog was trained to Heil when everybody Kyle or gas the Jews

69
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Right

70
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
I know one that bothers me

71
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
I think

72
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,095
Especially the Jewish organization

73
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,935
He goes on Alex Jones a show and they try and cry all this first amendment nonsense

74
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
American Constitution

75
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
So that argument

76
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
In the sixties

77
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
He would have been on Johnny Carson

78
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,927
That's true

79
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,023
Gravy out of Alex's argument I wish I had this clip now regret it

80
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
The craziest thing

81
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
He's like

82
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Angel comedy

83
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
He's better than

84
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
I mean

85
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:37,151
Now that's when we get into what. John Cleese

86
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,967
Towers I'm going to murder you Alex

87
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
I'll be also said that he's funnier than Chaplin

88
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,927
Because Chaplin The Great Dictator B and

89
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Necessarily

90
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
Straight up comedy

91
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,911
Pretty sure that was actually incisive satire

92
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,519
Use a lot of that nonsense I'm just really work

93
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,335
And the other thing that marks defense

94
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
This to annoy my girlfriend

95
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
Cuz she doesn't like Nazis

96
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
I'm so I sit back

97
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
And I think

98
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
I think there's first of all this isn't a great relationship

99
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,535
Break up with him

100
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
Well I don't like

101
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,935
But I am okay if my boyfriend teaches

102
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
His dog how to fix

103
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,543
He was teaching your dog this as a prank

104
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
On the girlfriend

105
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
Respond

106
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
How is that ever going to

107
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:47,295
The payoff when are you going to just casually say gas the Jews another dog Hyles

108
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,367
When you walk in the door in the the

109
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
The

110
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,695
Singing waterfalls on your head is just like that

111
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:58,047
Like she walks in the door and he's like

112
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
Need to leave you now

113
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
Now you've turned this into

114
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
Not on the dog

115
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:14,175
Raining on the job on the girlfriend

116
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
Certainly

117
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,039
The point that I'm trying to make is if I train

118
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
My cat

119
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Suzy Kyle every time

120
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,695
Sumit said gas the Jews and you and I were sitting around I was

121
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Just waiting

122
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
It would never happen

123
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,815
Hayward

124
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,399
Do accidentally coincidentally come up like

125
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,799
We're doing the show and talking about Alex Jones anti-semitism

126
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:46,943
Just got to be like if he said gas the Jews and then

127
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
That would be not a prank that would be the most

128
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,367
Terrified

129
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,767
Where did you accidentally get a nut to cat neutering cats

130
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,911
Here's my other problem Mark meechan defense self

131
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:12,031
It's terrible and stupid he's appearing from the UK and there's someone else in the room

132
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
And that guy's name

133
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,615
Is Tommy Robinson

134
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:28,415
Another guest on his show that is a little bit more

135
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:34,047
From geopolitical perspective that is a gentleman by the name of Alexander

136
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,399
This guy is a former and I put this former and quotes

137
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:44,543
Possibly heavy? Kremlin political advisor

138
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,127
You generally don't get to be one of those like

139
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,991
Former anything near the kremlin's are dead

140
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
It's working with the Russian

141
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
For approximately 20

142
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:01,439
Even like before you go

143
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,839
You know they just let you retire retire there like hey look I get it you don't want to do this anymore

144
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,679
You know a lot of secrets that other people could find out if they talk to you

145
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
But no big deal

146
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
About that he's written

147
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,847
For places like Al Jazeera another publication

148
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,175
That jumped over the Russian

149
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,223
Marine Le Pen is awesome

150
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
How it's no big deal

151
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,159
Ocean Bank gave her like $40 in The Lego Movie

152
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
Everything Is Awesome

153
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,535
Written by Alexander to dress up

154
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,935
Alex has him on Pharrell has a lot of weird friends

155
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,751
This is the sort of Journalism

156
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
Do Russians love Putin so much

157
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Great great

158
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
You know what's interesting

159
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
That's actually a very complicated

160
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
Good question because

161
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,623
Strangely enough does enjoy

162
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,207
Largely favorable view amongst Russia

163
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,023
That is something that is true like if

164
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,863
The weirdest part about that election that they had that was

165
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
Clearly f****** rig

166
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,215
Little later

167
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
Still want one

168
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
If possible

169
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,479
What I think is more interesting is

170
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,831
A little bit down the line with interview

171
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
Explains what

172
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
Used to do for the Russian government

173
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
ShopRite

174
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,399
Alarm bells in everyone but Alex Jones for some reason

175
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,719
Oh my God

176
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
What means that's a murder

177
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
No he's talking about being a public relations

178
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,263
Foreign media fixer work behind the theme

179
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,591
He's a propaganda

180
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,919
He just admitted on Alex

181
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:36,319
No I was going to go in the media

182
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
Putin and his associates would do things the International Community

183
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
Dab or in the loop

184
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,839
He was a he was a media dark arts master

185
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
You will

186
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
Another just like embarrassing example of Alec

187
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,543
Either just being completely oblivious of the people he surrounds himself with

188
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
Or just

189
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Epicly revealing

190
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,383
What his game is

191
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,711
And I mean I don't think I don't think it anyway that he works

192
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
Anything like that but

193
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
These pro-putin Tendencies are in

194
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,719
A big fan of how little respect this guy gives Alex's show

195
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
Is he's just like

196
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
I'm going to lay it all out there yeah

197
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
I would go

198
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
Especially media quote people who ask me questions

199
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:31,359
Tired tired

200
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,175
I like it let's say you were

201
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
What I would do

202
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,623
Before you ever even got close to talking about Putin

203
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,951
I would go to you and I would assuage your fears

204
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
So you would be more Pro Putin

205
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Alex

206
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
I would never do that to you

207
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
Absolutely

208
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,983
The show our Alex gets a little bit in

209
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
To the Cambridge analytica situation

210
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,847
I assume he does so very hard with a lot of

211
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:08,479
Data behind the bad guy

212
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:13,087
Perspective but

213
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
It's it's correct

214
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
Public

215
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:25,119
But that's

216
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,959
MMA

217
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,335
Also on the 20th the day before or I believe in the early morning hours

218
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
We sure exactly when it happened

219
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
Antonio

220
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
Yes

221
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
Tries to pretend

222
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,831
That this doesn't undo all of his narrative

223
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
About his secret sources

224
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
About the author

225
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
Because all that stuff by like

226
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
It's built on the porch

227
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,047
It takes 20 minutes on the porch

228
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,863
Weather

229
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
It's all that stuff is

230
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
Famous FedEx

231
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,847
The FedEx hang out on the porch

232
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
Sit on a rocket

233
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
King chair next to the other FedEx porch guys

234
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,783
Imallexx continues a little bit of like that we got to use covert action

235
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
Actually advocating

236
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,927
Sing for Trump like working behind the scenes to like

237
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,767
People out a little upset

238
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Batshit

239
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
Language

240
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
The video uses

241
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,399
Possibility politically

242
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
The 20th

243
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,519
21st which would be

244
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
If you're nasty

245
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
Before we get to that

246
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
Witness day

247
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,831
Before we get there

248
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
From the 21st

249
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
Well you can be sure that you're going to be

250
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,631
See if you like it

251
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
How's that sound

252
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,263
Oh no

253
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
I dude started sucking up there

254
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
Is that a is that is Ruth Bader Ginsburg

255
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
No that's

256
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
But I always like

257
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,743
Opportunity is SNL real

258
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,399
$1000000 to say that audition

259
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,519
That's closer to the acceptable price

260
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,823
A couple years in the ground

261
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,639
And Lauren just kinda was like

262
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,479
We're just going to give everybody I would watch that audition

263
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Type so fast

264
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
Xenophobia

265
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
So good

266
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
On the 21st

267
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
Piece of advice

268
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
Alex

269
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
We got a red wine

270
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
21st

271
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
I got to say

272
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,823
I did a lot of talking

273
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,615
In explaining over

274
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
The 20th because

275
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
It's not that

276
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
The 21st

277
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,735
10/22

278
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
Feature some

279
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,063
Hi and bulshit

280
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Like

281
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:30,975
Like some of the stuff

282
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,047
This stuff is like it's kind of in

283
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
The league of

284
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
Stuff that I've liked

285
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
I wait for

286
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Bulshit like

287
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Because it okay

288
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,239
It's just it's

289
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
The kind of b******* you can think

290
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,335
Your teeth m-28

291
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
I like

292
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
What are you doing

293
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,223
And it's the kind that made you read six different book

294
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,599
Very kind of stuff where you can

295
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
You can look at it and you can do that

296
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
He knows he's lying

297
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,719
And then you can look at it and be like

298
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
Which is about two more inches

299
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
Easton conversation Orange

300
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Interesting like

301
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
Train of thought

302
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,727
Is he lying about the hello do you know he's exactly

303
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,823
Really been lacking in the present for us for so long it's just like

304
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:24,479
He's just pathetic pathetic lies about like strawman versions of his lawsuit

305
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,183
Yeah of course you're doing business is too transparent self-protection Ray

306
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,767
So Alex is found a story that's a couple days old

307
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
Are you shocked that he hasn't heard about yet

308
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
He delivers it with the most immediately

309
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,519
Anyone has ever told me stories

310
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
Are you know what I want to do

311
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,407
You know what I want to do at some point maybe you know who don't do this episode

312
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
But like

313
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
You rattle off

314
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
Like

315
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,599
Things that you think Alex should cover that like it's coming up or nope

316
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,207
Cuz there's a classic like

317
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
Yay or nay

318
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,839
OK Google

319
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
This one

320
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Is going

321
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
It just gets crazier

322
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
Daily Caller

323
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
It's a footnote

324
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
The top investigator

325
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
Murder was shot

326
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,063
I want to hold off because I I wonder what's that mean

327
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:38,463
I'm already wondering what top like the best

328
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,279
Team right

329
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Washington Post

330
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
The top investigator

331
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,031
Was shot twice in the back

332
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Once in the butt actually

333
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,871
He got away with his dachshund

334
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,431
Badgerhound in his arms

335
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,991
Yep over

336
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,527
Submarine

337
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
When the department of energy

338
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
Downtown

339
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,463
Yeah, that's that's what they are

340
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,279
A marine with the Department of energy and so

341
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,863
It's just that I want to get this individual lawn

342
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:24,031
But now the rewards investigating doing all this the family

343
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
Real quick will get back to Albany

344
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,503
Not Mountain

345
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,319
Conflated number of things could Seth rich and his ferret

346
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
I guess I've reached

347
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
Didn't his parents did

348
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,439
He was that at the time but his parents put out a reward

349
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:46,047
For information about people who killed him

350
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
Analysis

351
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:52,191
Conflating the two trying to pretend that they're the same reward as they're different

352
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,983
Cover option

353
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,343
Why Jones

354
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Was in the ass

355
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,951
Body was in a document pickup

356
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
Under the orange cone

357
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,679
Documents

358
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,311
What is dog in his arms

359
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
Didn't stop for that run over him

360
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,551
But between cars that were being rammed twice and lived

361
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,903
Screams about this narrative for pretty much the entirety of the show

362
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,303
Keeps coming up and he's like that's all the information he gives on it

363
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
Screaming

364
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:57,727
Like Groupon later and he screams

365
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
This is nonsense

366
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,247
Stories of scary

367
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
If I understand correctly

368
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,928
The top investigator right which is a nebulous idea to begin with

369
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,512
He was shot twice in Spanish

370
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
No

371
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
Don't even work for the police

372
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
No God no

373
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:37,152
We have his private investigator's license I don't think so

374
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,456
He's a lobbyist

375
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:46,112
He's a lobbyist and a hobbyist

376
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,464
It's not

377
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:56,608
And Alex is trying to pretend that he's working in an official capacity

378
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:01,472
He's not you just someone who decided to take it upon himself to start and

379
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Investigation into

380
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,312
The problem

381
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,360
Is that now we go from

382
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,920
It's a conspiracy to you getting shot

383
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
Twice in the back to like

384
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,784
Hey dude you're probably f****** pissing people off

385
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
Maybe you have getting shot in the back

386
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,624
Combination

387
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,840
I didn't look into that cuz I don't really care

388
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
I don't know man

389
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
I don't care

390
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
He's not involved in

391
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,288
He's a crazy dude

392
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,080
I know that because these

393
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
A guy named Kevin Dougherty

394
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
Pretend that he's an assassin

395
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,344
Kill him kill Jack burkman because he wouldn't stop

396
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Investigating

397
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Okay

398
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
However

399
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,744
If you actually read the articles about this it's not a political hit job but

400
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,792
It's a case of one crazy person attack

401
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
Another crazy person

402
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,912
Here is the arrears the quote about that

403
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:09,056
Jack burkman told the Washington Post that he had hired Kevin Dougherty to help him build a psychological profile of Rich's killer

404
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,712
Birdman fire Doherty in July 2017 investigated the FBI

405
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:22,368
In February

406
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
Andrew McCabe

407
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
Spoiler alert

408
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:30,048
Information

409
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,864
Is awesome

410
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:40,800
F*** it f*** everything but this story they told him my favorite I told you never had

411
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
Alright

412
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:48,224
Now instead of the top investigator getting shot twice in the back and running away with his Docs

413
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
Now we have

414
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
Who

415
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,416
Was hired to look up information on Seth rich

416
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,512
He was fired from doing that and then later

417
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
He was given a contact

418
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,704
Who said if you meet with me I'll give you information on Andrew McCabe yeah but it turns out that the guy who

419
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,984
Hired him in the first place

420
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,032
Was the guy who is sending him that

421
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,336
In order to murder him

422
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:20,992
I think you're some of your pronoun reference were generally

423
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,576
Decided to investigate Seth riches murder

424
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,624
Yes and he will

425
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,696
Might have had a reason to do so I would will get into in a minute

426
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:36,096
Hired Kevin Dougherty who probably was an ex-marine

427
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
Be at some point

428
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,472
But he's now a crazy person is beyond all that

429
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,264
Employed by those people anymore

430
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,336
They get to a little bit of a beef

431
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,872
Well they're working together

432
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408
Who is Jack burkman

433
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,480
And thinks the Kevin Dougherty is trying to turn the project

434
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
Into being about him

435
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,808
Himself he thinks that he's grandiose

436
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:59,392
Interviews and stuff like that is taking over the project

437
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:05,792
So he's seen out that something completely grandiose and paranoid person would say

438
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,840
Never investigate

439
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:13,728
Because they thought the other guy was getting too much

440
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
Right

441
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,664
That's a normal thing to do so that comes to head July 2017 and Birdman fire

442
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,248
Because there's not much

443
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
Do this that's rich

444
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:31,904
Conspiracy nonsense

445
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,976
A little bit down the road

446
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
Might as well take it all the way to stop

447
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
A little bit down the road

448
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
He gets contacted by an anonymous source

449
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:45,472
Spoiler alert

450
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,288
That's what's going on

451
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,968
Jordan what we call this is the cost of doing business in the computer

452
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
SeaWorld

453
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:00,320
You're going to end up working with dangerous crazy people

454
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
Might want to kill you at some point

455
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
That is

456
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,512
I don't I don't know the story of baby feel

457
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
Look I got it

458
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,840
I'm against people getting shot

459
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:18,240
But it's pretty hilarious cuz he lives in them cannibalize each other that's the only has like a

460
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
Broken wrist

461
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,568
Or something like that it's not even a big deal

462
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,528
Do you know what all the stories I could find

463
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,344
Don't even really confirm that he was shocked

464
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
Biggest say he says he was shot we can confirm means he was not shot

465
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,328
It was like a BB gun or something like that or pellet gun

466
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:48,960
I don't know I don't know it may not even have been a murder plan

467
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:54,592
This guy I don't know

468
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
What's cartoon

469
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
And I love

470
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:02,528
There's all sorts of unknowns about it but what I do know is this has nothing to do with Seth Rich the petty squabbles between

471
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,832
How do you get

472
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
Named a top

473
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Investigator

474
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:12,000
TV sets in the news Alex Jones I'll call you that

475
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,048
Alright so I told you the lobby

476
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
Yes

477
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
Important

478
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,960
Okay but it turns out the jack burkman is a trump connected lobbyist

479
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Who in the past

480
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,544
Has raised money for Rick Gates

481
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,104
If you don't remember who that is

482
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,224
Is Paul manafort Trump campaign manager

483
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
The United States

484
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
So

485
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Hoverboard

486
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
Yeah

487
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
The most

488
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,440
Trustworthy people involved with a story

489
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't know I don't know 100% if that's

490
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Schenectady

491
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Like that

492
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
It's certainly interesting

493
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,144
This point

494
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,936
It seems that seems like a

495
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
Like

496
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,800
How many stories did you read about this where they went in

497
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Into how

498
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
Insane and Ludacris

499
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
This is detailed

500
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
Oneida piece

501
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:08,320
Together from a bunch of stories

502
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
Is how I abbreviate washing

503
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Engine poster

504
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
Befriend

505
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,232
Story that was like

506
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,048
Crazy people doing crazy s*** like that

507
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,096
I'm f****** read that all day

508
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,448
We got to figure out how to do clickbait

509
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,984
So I agree with you

510
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
This story

511
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
Banana

512
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
Juicy

513
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,408
But unfortunately I don't really know how to make this suspicious

514
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,016
Because he can't

515
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:42,880
You keep you don't get your friend in a narrative if you've got guts

516
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,208
Because the reality of the situation

517
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
Point fingers at Trump

518
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
But Rick Gates

519
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:52,096
Why is this Trump connected lobbyist

520
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Being a

521
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,264
Top Seth Rich investigator in the first place the craziness

522
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:04,896
Between the two you kind of come to a damning indictment of the mindset that drives you down that road to begin with

523
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,176
Now here we go

524
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,992
Let's Go reverse reverse engineering

525
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,576
Let's rewrite the narrative for Alex Jones

526
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
False flag

527
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Alright

528
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,720
The guy who is associated dachshunds

529
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,352
The guy who is associated with Rick

530
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
Clearly being set up

531
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
In order.

532
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,984
Reddit anybody who's ever

533
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,032
Hired anybody who's ever worked

534
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
For Trump in the past

535
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,872
Narrative to go down

536
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
This is a fascinating

537
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:43,296
What you can do with your other narrative

538
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,856
You might be close to what he thinks

539
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,952
You just can't really figure out how to work

540
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,512
What your version

541
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
Here's his

542
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
WikiLeaks

543
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Not good

544
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,632
Re-bag

545
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,776
Julian Assange and said we don't know why sources but yes you should look at him as a source

546
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
Doesn't sound like WikiLeaks

547
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,504
He didn't say you should treat him as a sorcerer

548
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,088
Julian Assange did try to pretend videos the source

549
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Political trouble

550
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,976
There's an article that came out literally just

551
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,792
Before we started recording where

552
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
It's very

553
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:31,424
Clear now that guccifer 2.0 was a GRU Russia

554
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
Intelligence

555
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
Albuquerque

556
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,056
They went over all of the time

557
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:42,688
Clear-cut no no there's an article article in The Daily Beast

558
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,528
That just came out

559
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,184
All of the times the emails were sent or any IP addresses world

560
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
Every time

561
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,048
It went to VPN

562
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
Server that would Lodge

563
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
In France

564
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,400
To get around IP address.

565
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,704
But one time when he logged in

566
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
He forgot

567
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,008
To use the VPN setting

568
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,568
And that IP address link to directly back

569
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
Pgru

570
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
So

571
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,896
Yes so

572
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
It is now

573
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:20,320
Entira as long as that story is accurate

574
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,624
Right it seems like it is

575
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,928
I don't know we'll see how the reporting goes in

576
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Couple days

577
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
But if that's the reason

578
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,304
Then guccifer 2.0

579
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,352
Is a Russian intelligence cutout

580
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,376
Yep persona

581
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,912
Rodger Stone

582
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:39,776
Interacted with gusto employment very clear about it

583
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
The crimes have all been commit

584
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,200
End

585
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,504
The emails directly to WikiLeaks

586
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
A tweet that WikiLeaks

587
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
Themselves

588
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,856
Retweeted

589
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,648
The case then Russian intelligence

590
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,696
Gave the emails that they hatch

591
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,720
Text from the DNC

592
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
Directly

593
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
To WikiLeaks

594
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
Which Doug kind of complicate things

595
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
For Julian Assange

596
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
Nah

597
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:13,056
So people write the histories of Art

598
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,456
I've said this before but

599
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
Unqualified

600
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:28,928
Well I'm absolutely

601
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,816
Discovery that we can realize how great a job they did it pulling all of this s*** up

602
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:39,168
Like this is crazy this is movie levels

603
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,824
Tri-level

604
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,640
Committed

605
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
Treason

606
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,760
So forth

607
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,784
Like where at

608
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
Like

609
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:00,928
The more you learn about it we're kind of at Hot War level

610
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,120
Someone who has

611
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,680
Actively said the United Nations

612
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
Doesn't exist

613
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:20,128
It is much as we want them to our last

614
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:24,992
Live episode for a while every single episode

615
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,344
Insane person without

616
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,112
This is one of those

617
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,416
More f***** up staff decisions

618
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,976
You could have possibly made

619
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,024
Because I I can't imagine

620
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
Steve pieczenik won't be on the show tomorrow

621
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
Steve pieczenik

622
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
Furious

623
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,680
Oh yeah hates John Bolton's

624
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,472
From conversation

625
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,264
That I've had with with folks

626
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,640
Pro friend. Simpson

627
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,432
We Believe

628
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
If it doesn't have to be a Breaking Point

629
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,576
If Trump is in bed with Bolton

630
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
Hates John Bolton

631
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,672
So this could be

632
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,232
This could lead if there's one thing I've learned

633
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
Indeed

634
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
Past few years it is that

635
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,072
Nobody

636
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,400
Underwrite believe in anything

637
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
He's chaotic

638
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,472
Unusual

639
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,848
He could be I believe that pretty wholeheartedly

640
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,152
AAA been convinced

641
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,224
Guiding principles are being

642
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
Violated

643
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,808
Behavior the Trump is

644
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,600
Using and he'll have to

645
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,392
Steve will have to turn on Alex

646
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
I can't wait

647
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,464
If he's not on tomorrow going to be

648
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
.

649
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
But anyway

650
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,096
I was trying to leave this

651
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
If you brought the WikiLeaks

652
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,424
Sparta now we've discussed why that's pretty stupid

653
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,728
Line

654
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,568
Maine discovered spinning a yarn

655
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,384
Shot multiple times in the back

656
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,688
Once in the bus

657
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,248
Family

658
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
Held up pictures

659
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,648
You want to find out who killed our son

660
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,464
Very suspicious behavior for a family

661
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Oh yeah

662
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
From this week

663
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,096
Headline Fox News Alex Jones

664
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Z

665
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,760
Set a rate ducato

666
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,320
So bad but he's trying to

667
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
Compare

668
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
Inflate the to reward

669
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
That were offered

670
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
Family

671
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
Parkman

672
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
Berkman

673
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
Berkman Jack Burke

674
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,616
21

675
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,408
So they are you saying

676
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,480
I'm just loving his rhythm of speech right now

677
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
Bassy

678
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:12,160
He's like a beat poet

679
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,232
No idea

680
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Nothing

681
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:21,376
He's trying to figure out a way to

682
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Call

683
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
The time

684
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:32,896
It'd be very annoying and I hope you stopped right now

685
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:39,296
Like they came out and offered this reward people started investigating

686
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
Investigator

687
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,160
I would argue that people give rewards

688
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:49,792
They give rewards for information that is already had by people

689
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:55,680
Not as a coal for investigative vigilantism believe actually they hired

690
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,240
It's not like

691
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,848
You know it's not a call for amateur sleuth

692
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:09,248
You guys want to make your name in the game but I can get out

693
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:20,768
Chords for going to be fake investigators coming out

694
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
So ridiculous

695
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,704
People start looking into this

696
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,664
Get the family.

697
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,040
People change their stories

698
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:47,392
Because who you're talking about is Rod wheeler

699
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,440
Who was the guy freelance

700
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,744
For Fox News who has been

701
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,376
Fox News

702
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
He sue them

703
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
For using quotes

704
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
That we're not

705
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,472
From him

706
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,240
The Heat

707
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,032
He they falsely attributed

708
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
Information as to coming from him

709
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:12,480
And that's why his story changed because foxnewslive the first time you've got

710
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,552
Got legal action

711
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:21,952
Why are all these people who were finding evidence of the clintons being involved in this

712
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:27,584
Story with a f****** lie

713
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,984
Investigating

714
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,544
Thousands and thousands

715
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
Right

716
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,640
Completely within their legal rights

717
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,456
R.a. Petoskey

718
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,784
Mooyah Zimmerman and Executives at Fox News for a

719
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,320
Conspiracy that they

720
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
Nearly engaged him

721
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
You know

722
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,904
Priest on email

723
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,488
The lawsuit that are jamming

724
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,280
If you are

725
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,560
One of these Republican

726
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
Right

727
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:07,520
Number of lawsuits being filed against you kind of like

728
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,080
And look at all of the people you support

729
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,408
How many lawsuits have been filed against them

730
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
Recently

731
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,968
Shouldn't you start to think

732
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,272
Maybe

733
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,296
You're an idiot

734
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:25,696
Okay you said it's a good defense what you should do you should see that is proof that you're in the right direction

735
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,400
Call the time he uses like the analogy of

736
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
World War

737
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,216
1 bombers

738
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,752
Didn't have a radar

739
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,336
And they would only know that they were above the target whenever they're getting shot at

740
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:47,200
You know it's like the payload whenever I'm getting shot

741
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:53,856
You said this in so many different ways like whenever people are attacking me that's where I know I'm doing the right thing

742
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,904
Sometimes because you're way out of line

743
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,184
Interesting fact

744
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,280
Do you know the whole carrots

745
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,328
Improve your vision

746
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,864
Spirits of rabbits

747
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,264
No it was put out by the British government discovered

748
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
Started using radar

749
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,616
I'd like in order to make sure that

750
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,200
People know in order to kind of so doubt into people about whether or not

751
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,248
Radar actually existed

752
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,832
Planes they said that their best Pilots were eating a lot of carrots

753
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
That's why they're vision

754
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:31,488
Fastenal

755
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,072
I appreciate it

756
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,704
Such an ass

757
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,384
Has your farewell show

758
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,064
Especially

759
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
We're sort of done with Alex

760
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
Two separate bulshit narrative

761
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,512
It goes on throughout the show but then I wouldn't

762
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,792
Took care of it up top

763
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
Into a narrative

764
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
He has

765
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Stick with that

766
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,240
Like there's so many of those narratives

767
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
Just won't go away

768
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
Genuinely

769
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Nothing

770
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,616
Like literally have nothing

771
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
They have so much

772
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,432
Nothing

773
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,992
Can't even come up with a new fake narrative

774
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,344
Because every narrative back to the reality of

775
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,368
Wegotsoccer

776
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
There were spies

777
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,720
Everything is Jerome corsi Style baby

778
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,744
They made

779
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
Running with the band

780
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,072
Mem

781
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,888
Alex jumps to another man

782
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:48,032
And if you ever listen to our show or ever lived Alex Jones Show end

783
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,455
You will hear a lot of familiar stuff in this

784
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:00,063
Pretty much every other week or so Alex Jones will start screaming about how the globalist

785
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,159
Airplane to their armored redoubt

786
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
Here the 21st

787
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
2018

788
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
No exception

789
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
Here's the deal

790
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,095
What

791
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,911
I should be in Montana or something

792
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,519
Digging in with transmission

793
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:25,151
These are going on a rant about how if you can't afford to get to New Zealand or Kauai then people are going to

794
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,431
Montana Utah

795
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
Alex

796
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,247
You should not be in America

797
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,063
If you are if you are at all worried

798
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:38,975
Go to a place where there's poor extradition laws

799
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
Urban chaos

800
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:48,191
Weaponized diseases and stuff like that

801
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,799
That's fun

802
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,103
They talked about

803
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
Weapon X

804
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:00,223
Or not Weapon X

805
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
Jesus

806
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,343
They talked about disease X

807
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,647
Nicked my Fred dad

808
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,719
Do you know about disease X

809
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:19,423
The World Health Organization

810
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
Morning about

811
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,495
Breakout

812
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
Doctor group says he's on a lottery

813
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:31,711
Chiropractic

814
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,295
Does alot of research

815
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,831
They have a bunch of conversations

816
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:40,159
It sorta leads you to believe that they think it's a thing

817
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,207
When it's not it's

818
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:46,303
The designation for everything that's not on the World Health organization's radar

819
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,703
It could be a deadly they put out a list every year of life

820
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,495
Yeah playing the field

821
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
By the way

822
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,615
Whatever

823
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
Oh

824
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Yeah

825
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,199
Unknown unknowns yet

826
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
Rumsfeld

827
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,575
He's such a he's one of the most

828
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,671
Evil Psychopaths I think of the history of the

829
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,231
World so I agree but back to disease X

830
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:21,631
Sorry about that chief executive of the research Council of Norway and Scientific Advisor to the world

831
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,447
Explain these acts.

832
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:29,567
History tells us that is likely that the next big outbreak will be something we have not seen but

833
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,383
Before it may seem strange that adding an X

834
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:37,759
But the point is to make sure we prepare and plan flexibly in terms of vaccines diagnostic

835
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
We want

836
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,855
Plug-and-play platform

837
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,391
Developed which will work

838
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,439
For any number of diseases

839
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,975
Systems that allow us

840
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,767
Create countermeasures at speed

841
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,351
So what they're just talk about is the ability

842
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,887
100 / 6

843
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,519
These people are so bad at naming

844
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:06,175
Now it's perfect

845
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:20,255
This is we're planning for we don't know cuz historically humans don't know everything

846
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:27,935
Well now it's also talks about how like clearly there's like vaccines and like you're going there trying to create a superbug

847
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,151
Human Habitat

848
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,943
He's jumping from animals to humans

849
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
It's a natural process

850
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,015
Is vital that we are aware of

851
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
Probably the greatest

852
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,623
Yeah of course they go on to explain that like be

853
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,439
Because of the way the climate's changing because the way the thing

854
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
Becoming more comp

855
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,791
We run the risk of

856
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
Being much more

857
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,863
Contact with animals

858
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
Diseases that

859
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,399
We haven't

860
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,959
Experience before mini Bolas an example

861
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
There's 100 examples

862
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:06,079
Terrible diseases that have jumped over from animals

863
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
You think about

864
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Most

865
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,895
Currently

866
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,943
The one of the

867
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
There was a

868
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
Doctor

869
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,831
I can't remember when I can't remember his name because I am

870
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,391
But he was the first doctor

871
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,415
Kind of started doing re

872
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
Why it is

873
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,255
Eye doctors

874
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
Killing somebody

875
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,911
Legitimately directly from

876
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
An autopsy

877
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,799
Going directly

878
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Other s***

879
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,383
And he's his solution was like hey

880
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
Guys

881
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
Wash your f****** hands

882
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
Now

883
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
That

884
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,319
Of course

885
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,879
Destroyed his career because doctors

886
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:56,511
We're insisting that no you don't need to do that and you never need to worry about it because doctors are the best

887
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
People in the world

888
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,327
And so they spent their entire f******

889
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,631
Like his entire life was destroyed

890
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:05,983
For coming up with the single best idea and Doctor maybe has ever come up with

891
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,311
In history about something like disease

892
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,871
That's that guy going to be like

893
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,663
We know

894
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,687
We f***

895
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:19,807
We know that there's something that we need to do because something is coming around the corner

896
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
Always

897
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,391
So maybe plan ahead for what

898
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,975
And guys like Alex Jones are the same guys who are like

899
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,767
Don't worry about it

900
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,327
Put all your bodies in the same thing and then poop

901
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,607
Next to where you live

902
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,423
Well well said

903
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:42,079
Now back to the part about how the globalist

904
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,639
Do I them off on keratin

905
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:54,879
Sort of sidetracked started with talking about doctor group and disease access

906
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,159
Explaining that Alex Jones

907
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
Pretty convinced

908
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,463
That

909
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,751
Weeks

910
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,455
The globalist

911
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,015
They're going to then foment

912
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,623
Comedy

913
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,159
Italian police station

914
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,463
Social civilization breaks down

915
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,303
Bomb going off

916
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,351
We told you was it all coming

917
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,031
Wilson pool

918
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,079
Holyshit

919
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,407
Cam

920
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,039
What do they know that we don't

921
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
Swiss Lakes

922
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:01,695
Is links back to an article in the Washington Examiner

923
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,487
It's just one of these

924
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:09,631
You see these articles all the time if you follow such a huge fan of but what do they know that we don't know article

925
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:15,519
That's probably the Infowars headline I read over this and it's just basically

926
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,567
Describe it as

927
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,103
Buzz Marketing

928
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:19,871
Peace

929
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,175
For this guy's

930
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
What's it called

931
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,015
For the name of his

932
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,087
Place but it's some place where they sell

933
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,367
Studio

934
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
They sell bug at

935
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:35,231
S*** you know like her like a yeah yeah

936
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
Yeah you see this over and over

937
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,863
You see this over and over again if you follow

938
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
Some people have in the world to get free tanks

939
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:43,935
Just about it

940
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:49,823
Them stories will pop up about hey all the elites are buying a brat glows under the ground

941
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
You saw it with

942
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,943
Way back there now

943
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,575
She saw Alex pushing these narratives over and over and over again through the years

944
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,623
I read the articles exact same thing

945
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,647
The idea that

946
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,439
The officials are leaving

947
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:11,071
Based on the article it says

948
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
Have a vest

949
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,167
Inflating the importance could be

950
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:18,239
Could be any people from unnamed

951
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,031
Three-letter organizations

952
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:24,895
Are coming in

953
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,919
Spu

954
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,783
In the absence of any real information

955
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
Take this one

956
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:38,207
Before

957
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,487
Copy and paste this

958
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,023
Basically

959
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
But

960
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
But

961
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
This time

962
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,607
It's real

963
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
Something is different

964
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
What

965
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Timing

966
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:56,383
I wonder where he has

967
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,831
Obama is in New Zealand

968
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,927

977
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,887

978
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,167
As an escape

979
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:56,799
That's right it's not exactly that is not a huge leap at all

980
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,335
He's working with your bottom

981
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,199
Who is building him a huge

982
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,991
Escape water in New Zealand

983
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:11,135
This is really popular in the conspiracy world

984
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,927
A ton of land in New Zealand

985
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:19,327
As a murderer if you're a mass murderer article

986
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:29,823
You should not have.

987
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,175
I will not be allowed to run for any kind of off

988
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,735
Stephen alderman

989
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527

Vlone

992
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,391
A huge plot of land

993
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:49,791
The New Zealand and he said that it's as a sort of backup Last Resort kind of thing

994
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,815
Society collapses

995
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,631
This has become sort of a man

996
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:56,959
In the conspiracy world that everybody is making

997
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
Bees

998
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,543
Fortresses

999
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,871
I find very little

1000
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,151
Compelling evidence

1001
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
Is behind it

1002
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,711
Other than this one story about Peter

1003
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,479
Teal

1004
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,087
Well I drank paranoia

1005
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,159
In all honesty I have

1006
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,487
I have asked myself the question

1007
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,255
Of like

1008
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,839
The massive disaster is

1009
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:30,751
Regardless massively

1010
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
Structure of the war

1011
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:35,615
Regardless how bad you think it is going to be

1012
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
Right

1013
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:43,039
I would want to figure out where it is that I would put my

1014
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,807
Doubt

1015
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
So to speak

1016
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,599
And you want you want

1017
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,367
Freshwater

1018
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,159
You want

1019
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,439

00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:03,263
Yeah that's fine though

00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:09,663
Find an Aldi in New Zealand the matter Amazon is drone delivery

1024

Look

1028
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,791
But my position on all that stuff is

1029
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
I don't know I don't want

1030
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,351
I get too deep into this but

1031
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,191
As all that stuff comes becomes more and more

1032
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,983
Importance that people who are

1033
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,543
Be around

1034
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
Don't run away

1035
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:40,127
So I don't care about all of that

1036
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,663
So the conversation

1037
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,199
But where are we going to hide

1038
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,271
Re-hide in the shed of it and try and help you

1039
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,295
That's kind of

1040
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,063
My perspective

1041
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
And I hope

1042
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,623
When things get bad

1043
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,927
I can walk the walk

1044
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,975
That I'm very casually talk

1045
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,767
I don't know

1046
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:08,543
There's no f****** way for me to know what my reaction will be but I pray and Hope

1047
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,567
That it is

1048
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,615
Help people that I can help

1049
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,151
Enfield community

1050
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,455

00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:21,599
I'm out cuz everytime somebody's like

1052
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,695

Incredibly different

1054
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,047
Galvanizing in unifying

1055
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:36,191
Because climate change is not so much a like

1056
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,215
It's not like

1057
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,263
If you get hit by a rogue wave

1058
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,103
Like an errant wave you know it's not like that

1059
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,663
Or is it

1060
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:51,807

1061
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,879

He's on there talking about how

1074
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,423
Your pineal gland

1075
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,959
Has a crystal in it

1076
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:45,055
Cuboid vaccine

That's not good with everything around you

1081
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,759
Pretty much

1082
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,527
Crystal

1083
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,087
It hurts that Crystal but you know what can help

1084
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,647

Colloidal iodine

1087
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,631
Now he says that iodine is

1088
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,655
The only thing

1089
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935

1090
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:18,847

Researching all this.

1094
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,855
No one says the iodine is

1095
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,391
Can you use its turmeric

1096
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:38,303

00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:34,271
But just wait by the way I'm starting a new line of Crystal called the pine Neil Brand

1137
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,063
Crystal I mean like let's

1138
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
Just

1139
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,623
Blue sky this

1140
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,951
This idea

1141
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,999
If it is the case

1142
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,303
I am hearing a if then state

1143
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,095
Meant being sad

1144
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:54,239
How blue-sky thinking works all right there about Edward group

1145
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,799
Noted chiropractors ideas

1146
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:00,127
And keep saying that your cell phone

1147
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,943
Modern technology

1148
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,479
Fluoride in the water

1149
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,015
And vaccines

1150
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:09,087
Are the things that are inhibiting your pineal gland

1151
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:09,855
Then

1152
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,903
What we should see

1153
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,719
Is telepathy in human

1154
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:18,559
In the 1600

1155
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,471
We should see telepathy you're out your luck

1156
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:30,079
Of course it is

1157
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,127
Pictures of the phone

1158
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,663
Where the guy was in the

1159
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,479
17. Was

1160
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,527
16

1161
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,855
I retract

1162
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,951
And I was not from 1700

1163
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:50,815
Earphone

1164
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,119
Argument

1165
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,655
Splat for me because

1166
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:04,383
Maybe because I've gone down so many of these stupid New Age Road

1167
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
And I found

1168
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,687
So much

1169
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,711
Asterism

1170
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,991
I found so much

1171
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:09,759
Con man

1172
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,087
Behavior

1173
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:19,743
There are so many people are trying to sell you on these like super human capabilities that you're able to achieve

1174
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,791
You weren't being held

1175
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:24,351
And I believe in human potential I think our conscious

1176
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,655
This is way more powerful than we think it is

1177
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,191
I don't think

1178
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:28,959
Didn't we

1179
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:37,151
Washed off our pineal gland Crystal by not drinking water not being around Electronics

1180
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:41,503
Having a cell phone not taking vaccine

1181
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,551
Scores odds and somehow we be able to

1182
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,319
Telepathy

1183
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,087
Ethically communicate

1184
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,415
It is Muddy in the water is like

1185
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,719
Fun new age

1186
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,255
Stuff with new-age b*******

1187
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:59,423
Is the the bodhisattva like ultimately when you get down to all of this

1188
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,703
End up being a

1189
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,983
Rehashing of

1190
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,799
The Buddha went to the f****** Mountain

1191
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,823
And meditated

1192
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:11,967
A 6-month right my favorite

1193
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,135
For so much

1194
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,439
This s*** it just all goes down to that

1195
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:25,791
That guy who goes into the middle of nowhere and cleanses himself of

1196
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:30,399
Humanity reaches Enlightenment and then so on and so aesthetic

1197
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
Lifestyle

1198
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,727
If that's what you want to do

1199
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,751
F****** fine

1200
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:39,103
But if you're somebody who is doing that and then coming back to other people

1201
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:42,431
There's no explanation for why you would come back

1202
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
Two other people

1203
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:43,967
Right

1204
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:46,527
Like that's the thing that always breaks it down

1205
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,367
My favorite

1206
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:55,487
My favorite Buddha my favorite boat is off of my favorites guy who ever reached enlightenment

1207
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,535
Weather in Elgin

1208
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,071
Who

1209
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,351
Famously

1210
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,143
I reached enlightenment

1211
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,167
Whenever

1212
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,703
Crow dropped a rock

1213
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,239
In the middle of a lake

1214
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,823
And then was given the head of a

1215
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,103
Buddhist monastery

1216
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,639
And after nine days

1217
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,199
He said f*** you guys you're all corrupt

1218
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,503
You can find me at the brothel

1219
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,783
You can find me in the woods

1220
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,831
Brilliant poet

1221
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:21,855
That's that's Wonder

1222
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,879
That is my man

1223
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,327
That's my guy

1224
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,655
Jesus Christ

1225
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
Could be

1226
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,727
So Jordan now things are going to get

1227
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:43,359
Mercure 21st does not end well

1228
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,127
54 l

1229
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,687
Because in one of the commercial break

1230
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:50,783
Towards the end of the show the article where he's being called a race

1231
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,063
For someone

1232
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,855
Mets that he's made about

1233
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
How

1234
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:01,279
We've covered a lot of it in the past but what it boils down to is a lot of these ideas about how white should

1235
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:04,351
Police South Africa and let the blacks destroy themselves

1236
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,679
Of course he has that idea in his head

1237
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,567
He's been weaving in imagery about Black Panther

1238
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,151
About like this

1239
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:20,223
Very good this idea of a black

1240
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:25,087
Utopia happened without the whites there

1241
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,159
A great-aunt

1242
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,183
But love it

1243
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:31,999
Publication

1244
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,023
Have been taken

1245
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,583
But out of context but also

1246
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:39,423
Again it's what we deal with all the time it's like when people take him out of context

1247
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,471
Generous

1248
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:44,287
They don't actually deal with the reality what do you think

1249
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,567
And thankfully

1250
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,127
In responding to this article that

1251
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:50,943
He says

1252
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,015
One of the worst f****** things I've ever heard him say

1253
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,063
Might also be on lockdown

1254
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,623
I was just reading during a break

1255
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,671
Blackstar

1256
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,911
And then they don't tell you that the same

1257
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:18,335
Eclipse on the Communist leaders number three in the government Market

1258
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:25,247
I'm just saying that's racist

1259
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,295
That's stupid

1260
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:31,391
Zimbabwe

1261
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,191
Play the clip

1262
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,215
You didn't

1263
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:49,311
This goes back to Cliff misrepresent

1264
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,967
He played a clip from it was like 1

1265
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:59,295
South African

1266
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:03,903
Julius malema the leader of the radical Marxist opposition party

1267
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,439
Fighters

1268
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
In the clip

1269
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,023
We talked about this already in the past when he played it

1270
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,071
Yeah, says

1271
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:14,655
Specifically is not calling for the slaughter of white people at least

1272
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,423
For now

1273
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,447
I was going to say

1274
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:19,263
That was talking about

1275
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,055
Slaughtering White

1276
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,455
Marxist opposition's

1277
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:33,855
But they're talking about an equitable redistribution of land that didn't happen after the apartheid state was ended

1278
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:36,415
South Africa we've been over this a hundred f****** tonight

1279
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:38,975
Now the reason that this clip to me

1280
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,511
The most fuc

1281
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,839
Nothing I've ever heard Alex say

1282
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:48,447
Whites are being exterminated in Zimbabwe Rhodesia you name it

1283
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
You name it

1284
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
You name it

1285
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:53,823
You name it there's so many f****** problem place

1286
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,383
Rhodesia autoplay there

1287
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,919
Not another place

1288
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
Studio

1289
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,735
Persia

1290
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,015
Do you know Rhodesia is

1291
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,623
No you don't

1292
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,903
I know

1293
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:14,303
But I don't know if what I know is then going to be revealed to be f****** stupid

1294
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,095
Reveal myself to be f******

1295
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,375
I'll tell you a little story

1296
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:20,191
Supposed

1297
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,751
Recently come into the Public's

1298
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
2015

1299
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,823
Because

1300
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,847
Dylann roof

1301
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,151
After he shot up the black church

1302
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
Killed nine

1303
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,479
People pictures of him

1304
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:35,295
Came out burning American flag

1305
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,319
And also with

1306
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
Flags

1307
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,463
Of the apartheid government in South Africa and Rhodesia flag on his shirt

1308
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,743
That's one of the reasons

1309
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
Brought to the public

1310
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,863
People don't know what Rhodesia axe

1311
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,631
Actually is

1312
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,703
Rhodesia is an internationally

1313
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,727
Ignited state

1314
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,007
Hasn't existed since

1315
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
79

1316
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,871
It's a literal symbol of the white supremacist White

1317
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,895
Nationalist

1318
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,431
Exist to this day

1319
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,967
Okay and there's a reason for

1320
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:06,015
Because I

1321
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:10,367
I was legit terrified that like when you started when you started saying like

1322
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,415
Do you know what Rhodesia really is I was like

1323
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,695
How do you spell white

1324
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:20,351
Is it is it a real place like I don't I don't

1325
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:23,167
Zimbabwe

1326
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:32,383
That's why I got scared I thought it was a very simple and straightforward

1327
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,967
So in 1965 Rhodesia broke away from its existing

1328
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,759
Status is part of the United Kingdom

1329
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,039
UK would not record

1330
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,575
Denies their apartheid government

1331
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:45,183
We're 32 4% done clear exactly where the number was

1332
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:51,327
Population was about three to four percent and they control the entire apparatus

1333
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,863
Controls the government

1334
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,191
Wars with black liberation group 2 broke out all over the place

1335
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:02,591
And the regime incredibly horrific means to stay in power included

1336
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,175
How did article from the 60s in New York Times

1337
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:09,503
Describing some of the torture that they employed Electric

1338
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:15,647
Electrocuting people limbs

1339
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,415
Extremes

1340
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:20,255
We also engaged in incarceration to Black leaders

1341
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,839
Never heard of in 1979 the government collapsed

1342
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
But the racist myth

1343
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,959
This white supremacist utopian state of Rhodesia remains to this day

1344
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,519
Idea that they have is

1345
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,287
Communist

1346
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,311
Horses

1347
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:36,895
The black people who are like why are 3% of population oppressive

1348
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,431
Lee governing over us

1349
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:43,039
Create

1350
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
Assholes

1351
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,599
Have been like

1352
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:52,255
Then they could have had a white supremacist Utopia and rotation

1353
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,935
It's unfortunate because you end up with

1354
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
Picture

1355
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,567
And that's not right

1356
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,591
And

1357
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,919
This is this is something that I put a lot of thought into

1358
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,455
Because

1359
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,503
That's kind of what we need to happen here

1360
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,575
What do you have an oppressive government

1361
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,391
The people it's the French Revolution

1362
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,183
Over and over and over again

1363
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:22,975
Historically

1364
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,255
You have this

1365
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,023
Oppressive

1366
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,559
B******* f****** government

1367
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,839
And people are finally like

1368
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,375
We can't handle this s***

1369
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,727
And then they wind up making the same mistake that everybody else does where they go

1370
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,775
Will this guy will help

1371
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,567
And then

1372
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:42,943
Democratic well-meaning leader who became the dictator himself

1373
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,783
Yeah you get your you get your Castro out of a

1374
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,551
Your f******

1375
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:53,439
I would posit deposit first of all that Mugabe

1376
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:57,535
All that terrible to begin with but he got terrible

1377
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,095
But I would also say that you unfortunately

1378
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:06,751
He serves as a tool of the white supremacist propaganda about Rhodesia because it like if he hadn't come

1379
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,311
Buddies

1380
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,103
An overthrown the white

1381
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,639
Great government

1382
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:16,735
They could have been doing great there and because he is so terribly

1383
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:20,063
Props up their argument

1384
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:26,463
Right after the French Revolution

1385
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,023
Revolution

1386
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,887
You f***** up and eventually paper like we need to f****** solve this problem

1387
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,191
And a charismatic leader shows up

1388
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,751
And then discovers that

1389
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
Powers

1390
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,543
Really f****** great

1391
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
Big

1392
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
Big

1393
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:43,871
Problem

1394
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,919
Is the Alex Jones

1395
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,711
Drops Rhodesia

1396
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:49,503
Like it's a real thing

1397
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,599
It only exists

1398
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,647
Two white supremacists

1399
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:56,927
And white National

1400
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,719
The idea that

1401
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,999
He is bringing it up

1402
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:05,631
Whites are being exterminated in Rhodesia

1403
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,167
Is one of the most

1404
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:07,935
Dammit

1405
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,215
Possible sentences

1406
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,495
A person can make

1407
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,263
Because

1408
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,543
Like

1409
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,335
Even if you thought that white

1410
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,639
We're being exterminated in Africa in someplace

1411
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,687
You wouldn't say that no

1412
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:25,087
You would never say Rhodesia well but let's put you in the position of somebody who

1413
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:32,255
Isn't a hard yes on white genocide

1414
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,815
The show reason that it's f*****

1415
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,095
Is this

1416
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,887
Rhodesia was never

1417
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
It was

1418
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,959
Literally never

1419
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,751
Accepted as a country

1420
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,287
It existed

1421
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,615
From 1965 to 1979

1422
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,919
And the entire time was

1423
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,943
Sickly just

1424
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,759
Small white minority

1425
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:56,063
Beating the s*** out of him torturing

1426
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,855
Black people who demanded right

1427
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:01,439
And then stopped existing the only

1428
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,743
Any reason to ever have it in your head

1429
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,303
Is because you identify with that

1430
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,607
You are a f****** white

1431
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,375
Supremacist

1432
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:13,727
If you bring up Rhodesia in a conversation if it's a thing

1433
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,007
Alex Jones

1434
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,567
Played himself so f****** hard there

1435
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,591
It's embarrassing

1436
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,383
And you know what's even more embarrassing

1437
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,407
Media Matters

1438
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,687
Rightwingwatch

1439
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,967
All of those f******

1440
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,735
Chicken places

1441
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,039
They don't talk about this

1442
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,855
They don't talk about the how he brought up a rope

1443
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,623
Asia

1444
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:36,511
I got no response

1445
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,887
I don't think we've ever said before

1446
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:48,543
Is it confirmed white supremacist

1447
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,079
Call for calling him a racist

1448
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:56,223
Write a Tom hit up your boy I'll get you right out of that lawsuit

1449
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:56,991
Absurd

1450
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,527
At this point Alex

1451
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,831
Get really defensive cuz people are calling a race

1452
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,903
Cuz he's a rank

1453
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:12,095
We're all under attack and there's.

1454
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:24,127
Much more with

1455
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:28,991
The syphilis vaccination all the different vaccinations blacks have been used for

1456
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:33,343
Multiple top-secret testing projects which we expose

1457
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:41,023
All all

1458
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:47,423
Are you kidding me Alex.

1459
01:14:55,359 --> 01:15:01,503
Black urine

1460
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,271
You got that

1461
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:15,839
What's the reason why we need to control our stress levels

1462
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,119
Alright that's

1463
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:21,215
What is the weather deck

1464
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,007
Okay

1465
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,847
What is the black KKK

1466
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,919
Farrakhan maybe it's the Black Panthers

1467
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:36,831
Black Panthers

1468
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
Historically

1469
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,159
Hung

1470
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:40,927
Lynched

1471
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,695
Murdered

1472
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,023
Did everything that they possibly could to

1473
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:45,791
To destroy

1474
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,095
Black before Thor run them out

1475
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,679
Created a program

1476
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,727
Breakfast

1477
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,263
Two people who couldn't

1478
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,639
Now we now we have our equivalent

1479
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,919
Caloric balance

1480
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:02,943
On that

1481
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,295
Scrambled

1482
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,063
Toast

1483
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,367
Nailed it

1484
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,415
V

1485
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,183
Target

1486
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,719
It's the Providence

1487
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,511
Problem light not Providence

1488
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,535
Providence

1489
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,327
It's like weird where the

1490
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,631
Like what is in response to what

1491
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,983
Black KKK groups

1492
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,519
He does this about

1493
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
Skins with like La Raza

1494
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:32,639
Separatist

1495
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:35,455
Racist organization

1496
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,223
Translate

1497
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:43,647
Like he does the same thing with like historically black fraternity

1498
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,671
And stuff like that

1499
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,487
You're not looking at

1500
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,023
Is the dees organization

1501
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,303
Only exist

1502
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:51,839
Because of

1503
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:54,399
The history of violent exclusion

1504
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,215
By the way organization

1505
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,495
Those things

1506
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,775
Would not exist

1507
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,311
If we had a history

1508
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,591
They didn't have

1509
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,615
Violent

1510
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:06,175
And murderous segregation

1511
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,199
So

1512
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,991
We're not saying

1513
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,295
Every white person

1514
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,087
Should be punished for that history

1515
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,367
But everyone

1516
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,159
Well you're not really

1517
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,951
Your debts that's for comedic

1518
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:18,719
Perfect

1519
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,303
Alex

1520
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,887
Everyone should be aware of it

1521
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:29,215
Absolute and if you're willfully obtuse to that

1522
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,031
That means that

1523
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,079
That you have some sort of underlying belief

1524
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:37,151
There is much more than just I want that Bruce out

1525
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:40,479
I want everyone to be fair it's more that you're like

1526
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,503
Cannot deal with

1527
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,271
The fact

1528
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,319
It's someone that looks like me

1529
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,367
Was so awful

1530
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,159
Two people who didn't look that good

1531
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,695
Exactly

1532
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,511
This situation where people who look like me

1533
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,327
Had to create their own resources in order to

1534
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,143
The situation

1535
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,167
There is that

1536
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:03,775
Defending it and denied you are tattoo

1537
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,543
Simply admitting

1538
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,823
But yes it did

1539
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,591
Happened

1540
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,383
And you are guilty

1541
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,759
Let's jump off

1542
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,807
I think we've nailed that he's a white supremacist

1543
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,343
Nikki

1544
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,135
Exactly

1545
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,231
Yeah he plays himself

1546
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:23,999
Like a fiddle

1547
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:28,351
We have one more clip here from the 21st and it's really funny and consideration

1548
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399
You had this

1549
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
Russia

1550
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,959
Fixer on his shows

1551
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,751
The media fixer on his show

1552
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:37,567
Cuz at the end of the show Rodger Stone comes on

1553
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:42,431
And even Rodger goddamn Stone living the best life he can possibly live

1554
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:46,015
Knows that flat Amir Putin's stole that goddamn election

1555
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,807
And Alex cannot handle it

1556
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,975
He's been briefed by the

1557
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:59,583
Leah

1558
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:03,423
Rig the election which he most certainly did it's a choice.

1559
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:16,223
It's really popular

1560
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:31,327
I guess what I'm saying is that

1561
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:35,935
Really

1562
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:41,055
Frozen in jail has their supporters

1563
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:43,103
Petition carriers beaten

1564
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:49,247
So this wine Alex Alex

1565
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:53,599
This is really fun, again

1566
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,647
Just

1567
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,439
It's just f****** Loki

1568
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:00,255
He's just sowing Discord

1569
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,583
There is absolutely a piece of it that is like

1570
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
He does.

1571
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,631
Give

1572
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,911

Is it is amazing

1576
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,055
On many levels

1577
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,336
II

1578
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,200
Everybody knows this is this election is rigged

1579
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:24,576
Otherwise

1580
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,880
That's so great because

1581
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,160
God I

1582
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:34,816
If if Rogerson was never allowed anywhere near power and was just allowed to give interviews

1583
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:35,840
He would be the best

1584
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:40,960
No because he got kicked off of like Fox and CNN know that for

1585
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:42,752
Want to race

1586
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:49,152
People equal opportunity hires insurance

1587
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:55,296
REI tent gloss over the worst of Rodger stones

1588
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:59,904
Is a terrible monster when he is working again

1589
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:00,928
What his

1590
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,488
Wendy's

1591
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,072
He's the funniest f****** human cutting through the bull

1592
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,352
Because he's not

1593
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,704
Damn well what's going on

1594
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,032
No so this brings us to the end of the 21st

1595
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,336
Right we will get into the 22nd

1596
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,640
Here in a second but I need

1597
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,712
To reinforced my belief to anybody who is

1598
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,992
Rodger Stone

1599
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:28,064
Should be f****** but headed butts

1600
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,624
True he deserves the death penalty

1601
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,952
Almost as much as Joe Arpaio 25 years of the past

1602
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,768
Exactly

1603
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:39,072
Cuz I got to open up that window

1604
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,656
And I got to go to the bathroom really quick

1605
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,192
Open up that

01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:46,240
Show me back in about 3 minutes

1607
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:53,664
The memory of oppressed people is one thing that cannot be taken away

1608
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,480
A such people with such memories

1609
01:21:56,736 --> 01:22:02,880
Revolt is always an inch below the surface

1610
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:05,696
Achievability boban jalebi go

1612
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:14,400
So when does it begin

1613
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,960
I'm going to faucett AutoZone

1614
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,496
I walked into the lobby

1615
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,312
I got like two steps into the lobby

1616
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,896
When the the apartment door open and I sorted

1617
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,176

1628
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:42,976
If we must die let it not be like all confident ending in Inglorious by

1644
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,992
The 22nd

1645
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:16,576
Is a delightful day

1646
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,904
This

1647
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:22,720
Boy

1648
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:27,328
You said a lot of stuff that's not true and a lot of stuff that is very easy

1649
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,864
Poke holes in

1650
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,632
But

1651
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,912
Unusual for him

1652
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:36,032
He also ended up spending about an hour of the

1653
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,568
More than our possibly

1654
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,848
Of the show Jessie

1655
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:40,640
Talking to his gun Buddies

1656
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:47,552
A lot and we'll talk about here in the Sun

1657
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:50,624
They have a lot of company

1658
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,904
First gun Buddies

1659
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:57,792
I got somebody's back in Missouri like shootout guns

1660
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,328
You just never been to the range

1661
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,936
And it's fun I should

1662
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,984
Because I'm going to need that scale eventually

1663
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,776
I don't like

1664
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,568
This uncomfortable position that I have

1665
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,104
Have to live in where it's like

1666
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,896
I guess I get all of it

1667
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:16,480
I get all of it and you know what the right answer is done

1668
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,504
Control

1669
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,064
I get all of it though to

1670
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:26,720
And I think that gives unique position to be in where I think I can call out b*******

1671
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,280
More capable

1672
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:33,888
It's Direction Story whenever it's like

1673
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:37,728
Is this actually trying to the oppressive or is

1674
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,752
Just trying to

1675
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,288
How is this benign

1676
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:42,336
Or whatever like

1677
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:45,152
You're very much on the side of Hemet

1678
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:48,480
Like I get that a lot of people likes you.

1679
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:52,064
Recreational area

1680
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:57,184
All ready to do this right now

1681
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:04,608
Unnamed people

1682
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:11,008
That's a good place to stop right there a little bit

1683
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:14,848
Cuz you've been filing the serial numbers off of yours I don't have any

1684
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:16,640
I have a vacuum cleaner over there that I could

1685
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:19,456
Turn into one though cuz I'm crafty like MacGyver

1686
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:23,296
Richard Dean Anderson from his bed

1687
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,064
Alright

1688
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,856
Absurd

1689
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:28,928
Because the varsity narrative Alex Jones

1690
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,768
Is him misrepresenting

1691
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,304
A new rule

1692
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,328
That YouTube

1693
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,864
Has put out about gun video

1694
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:40,704
And we will hear his take on it

1695
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,472
Tell you what the

1696
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,240
The truth is

1697
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:52,224
More

1698
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,648
Here's Bloomberg

1699
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:03,232
YouTube videos

1700
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,584
The First Amendment

1701
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,424
Hollywood Runner trailers of all the shoot'em up

1702
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,728
They're going to put out

1703
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,480
Three sponsors

1704
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,440
Also on Twitch

1705
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:35,232
You bring my sweater

1706
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,192
Incredible

1707
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,568
First Amendment

1708
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:54,432
People playing video games

1709
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,760
All the other games

1710
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,184
Play some street names

1711
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,488
Death wish

1712
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:09,536
Trailers

1713
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:18,240
Arm shan'l doesn't even sell guns

1714
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:24,896
Hold on The Military Arms channel with the guy who runs that channel

1715
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:27,712
Later

1716
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,648
And then

1717
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,440
These are showing firearms

1718
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,232
All selective attack

1719
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:45,888
On the 1st Amendment

1720
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:56,384
Assault

1721
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,920
The war baby

1722
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,968
Sprawling like crazy over there

1723
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:05,088
What's up taking a lot of notes

1724
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:05,856
I'm just thinking

1725
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,392
About how Alex Jones

1726
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,416
Conception

1727
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,184
Of what

1728
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,208
The First Amendment

1729
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:11,488
Isdin

1730
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,768
Apparently aunt

1731
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,072
What freemark

1732
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,376
Interesting

1733
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:19,680
Okay

1734
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:23,008
So first amendment is the government

1735
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,032
Cannot

1736
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,056
Control speech

1737
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,080
Yes

1738
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:31,968
Free market capitalism

1739
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:39,136
Especially the journalism and you're allowed to gather together no matter what

1740
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:45,536
What does not understand that those parts at all gather are paid together

1741
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:49,632
Actually

1742
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,448
Which allows you to regulate

1743
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,728
Speech

1744
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,264
Exactly the way

1745
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,032
He is again

1746
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:56,800
Stem

1747
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,568
Those

1748
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,848
Amara

1749
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:01,664
Tackle and he doesn't understand that they are

1750
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:08,320
They are the reason that he's angry but one of the things like if you just want to take it to a dumb

1751
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:10,624
F****** way to resolve this argument

1752
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:12,416
There's no p*** on YouTube

1753
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:16,768
P*** is legal well I know it when I see it

1754
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:23,168
Right but there's no there's no point on YouTube like pouring is legal they've decided we don't want that on our plan

1755
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:27,776
Do you want a cup that Free Speech battle

1756
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:31,360
What is it

1757
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:34,944
No it's not

1758
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,992
Gun videos are still

1759
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:37,760
Cool

1760
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:40,064
They're still totally cool

1761
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:42,112
From Bloomberg

1762
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,136
The problem is the

1763
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,672
The title of this f****** article

1764
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:49,792
Guys named things better

1765
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:55,168
Think I had one of the article is YouTube and Firearm demo videos

1766
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:57,216
Entering the gun control debate

1767
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:00,032
And that is an absolutely unfair title

1768
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:03,104
Based on the reality of what YouTube has done

1769
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:08,480
So here we go I'll just read to you from this article cuz Alex Jones didn't make it to the second paragraph

1770
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:13,600
YouTube will ban videos that promote or link to websites selling firearms

1771
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:14,368
Accessories

1772
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,136
Including pump

1773
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,696
Which allows semi-automatic rifles

1774
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,720
To fire faster

1775
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:23,584
Additional YouTube side of a print videos with instructions on how to assemble fire

1776
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:26,400
The video site owned by alphabets Google

1777
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,936
His face intense criticism

1778
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,728
Frozen videos about guns

1779
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,752
And other deadly weapon

1780
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,104
Basically what the new rules they've come up with

1781
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,152
If you sell gun

1782
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,968
You cannot have videos where you

1783
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:41,760
Advertise those guns

1784
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,344
If you don't sell guns

1785
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,416
But you were supported by someone who does sell gun

1786
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,976
And linked to them for direct sales

1787
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,768
Can't post those videos

1788
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:55,584
Also if you are putting up videos

1789
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,120
Where you show how to

1790
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,912
To create a silencer

1791
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:02,240
How to create a higher-capacity magazine

1792
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:04,032
You can't put up those videos

1793
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,080
My personal take on this

1794
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:06,848
Is

1795
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:07,616
Good

1796
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,920
This is going to be impossible to enforce

1797
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:13,760
Good that isn't that is a good rule to have you should have had the

1798
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,576
Long time ago

1799
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:19,136
I don't I don't know what realistic

1800
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:19,904
Steps UK

1801
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,672
Can take

1802
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:25,024
Now Alex has two guests on the ship is.

1803
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,560
Right

1804
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:30,144
You're not going to e.r. you're never going to be able to

1805
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:32,192
Plug

1806
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,032
Once once a week starts you're never going to be able to plug all the

1807
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,336
And pretending that you can

1808
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,104
Is

1809
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,152
Lip service

1810
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:43,968
Do I get ice like I support

1811
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:47,040
The idea that they're trying to do it but they're never going to

1812
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:52,160
To do it the first amendment argument is absolutely out the window cuz they're not being arrested

1813
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:54,720
You know like that again

1814
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,000
The First Amendment

1815
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
Control what the

1816
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:57,792
Government

1817
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:03,680
What a private organization

1818
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:10,080
Can control which you should have a boner for you would think again the first amendment is antithetical

1819
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:10,848
To free market

1820
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:11,616
Capitalism

1821
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,152
And somehow he believes he's

1822
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:13,920
He supports both

1823
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,504
Song to talk about this

1824
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:23,648
And these are the gun buddy I was talking about for about an hour worth of

1825
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:29,024
Show David murderbox

1826
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,840
Skeeter

1827
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:34,912
One of them

1828
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:37,472
My notes were not pulling up there for

1829
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:41,056
One of them

1830
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:43,616
The guy by the name of Tim harmison

1831
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:46,176
Who runs the YouTube channel Military Arms

1832
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,200
Channel do I mention

1833
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:49,504
The interview that

1834
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,040
He runs a gun store

1835
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:57,440
So that kind of put some afoul of the selling gun provision of YouTube's new rules

1836
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,464
Conditions argument

1837
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:01,536
Also you goes into a pretty big argument about

1838
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:07,424
How is the Southern Poverty Law Center is a radical far-left

1839
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,704
I'm bored you hate to see that

1840
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,496
Can't handle it

1841
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,520
Other guests

1842
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,288
He has

1843
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,568
Kitco

1844
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,104
This guy runs this

1845
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,640
Most

1846
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,432
Southwestern

1847
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:20,480
Villain name I've ever heard

1848
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:22,528
Skyrun

1849
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,552
Colt

1850
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,832
Fourteen-year-old that

1851
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,880
Quick Draw better than anybody else

1852
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:33,280
Gun maker and seller business

1853
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:35,584
Auto Florida called

1854
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,352
Spiked

1855
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,912
Tonasket

1856
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:42,752
Alex just reference them is having their YouTube channel taken down

1857
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,824
During the day while the steps was going on

1858
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,592
Google dich

1859
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,640
I found our YouTube channel is it was up

1860
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:56,320
Also the Military Arms channel

1861
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:00,160
The issue the bigger is that

1862
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:02,208
Spike's Tactical is an advert

1863
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:03,232
Kaiser on Alex Jones

1864
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,000
The show

1865
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:06,560
Yeah

1866
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:08,096
Fox say

1867
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:11,424
The whole thing just turns into a commercial basically

1868
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,192
No

1869
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,472
It's just a

1870
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,152
Sharia law

1871
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:24,480
There probably is making up a law that

1872
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:25,760
Restricting

1873
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:28,832
Advertising

1874
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,136
4 and they come on your show saying

1875
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,416
They're restricting

1876
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:38,816
Even though there's not a restriction what I said they're not allowed to say that there's a restriction on it I think there's not

1877
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:41,376
SEC violation because he doesn't

1878
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:42,912
Hide the fact

1879
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:46,752
Is there a sponsor like even plays a commercial for them in the middle

1880
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:49,312
Of their hour-long argument about

1881
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,360
No absolutely it is

1882
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:54,944
It's it's a it's a hot load

1883
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,528
Is that in the middle of copse interviewed explained

1884
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,088
Flames eat behind my eyes

1885
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:05,440
Burning in the middle of

1886
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:10,816
Kerosene on you because in the middle of his interview

1887
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:11,840
Expresses

1888
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:13,120
He believes that most

1889
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,144
Mass shootings

1890
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:19,776
You specifically said

1891
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:20,800
Yeah

1892
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:27,200
The thing that I was just pretending that he doesn't support one of his sponsors comes on Aaron says I think

1893
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:30,016
You know what it's not even the shootings that we know of

1894
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:31,552
It gets even more of them

1895
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,856
That's what I said

1896
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:34,880
Crazy

1897
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,208
Also this is

1898
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:40,512
This is really fun

1899
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:44,096
Beyond the I'm beyond like

1900
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:46,144
Oh you shouldn't Advocate that

1901
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,424
These guys

1902
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:53,056
On.com amazon.com

01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,592
To this you can find it there

1904
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:56,896

Kit cope

1906
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:02,272
Skip for a second it's kit

1907
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,296
Kickoff

1908
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,344
Kitco

1909
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:14,304
Piece of s*** I will never do that box of things but

1910
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,072
Doodle

1911
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,608
That's

1912
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,144
Whitlock with your issues

1913
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,424
A kit of coping

1914
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,360
Hot water a little while back

1915
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,664
Because he created this

1916
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,016
For his business

1917
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:35,552
I don't like

1918
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:36,576
Say

1919
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:41,696
He presented it as standing up to antifa

1920
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:45,024
Already bad slogan was not today

1921
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:45,792
Antifa

1922
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,072
And I

1923
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:56,032
The picture was for white dudes with guns with

1924
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:59,104
To the camera it's not it's not a picture but like

1925
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:00,896
To the

1926
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,688
Whatever the lamb

1927
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:03,968
And then

1928
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,016
Steve guys in math

1929
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:09,856
Like we're going to shoot you down

1930
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:12,160
And then in the corner

1931
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:12,928
That has

1932
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:13,952
Boston

1933
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:18,048
I get my buddy other ones

1934
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,096
Charlottesville

1935
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:26,496
What is that one of your four in the list we had to use

1936
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:31,360
No

1937
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,128
Christ

1938
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:33,152
People

1939
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,176
Nope

1940
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,456
What are they what is it

1941
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:41,344
Doordash it like there's a genuine part of me that wants

1942
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,416
Be able to experience a level of a

1943
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:48,256
Eeyore or understanding but like

1944
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,072
And literal empathy of

1945
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:53,120
Can I see through there

1946
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,912
And I have

1947
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:57,472
No ability to see the world through the way.

1948
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:00,800
Created is

1949
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,616
For Alex

1950
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:08,480
Video game the video game

1951
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:13,344
Created a literal

1952
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:18,464
No one else does and I want to be able to see it I promise you

1953
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,488
Stamp it out with a

1954
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:25,632
Giant f****** boots I promise you I'm going to explain some of it at the end of this episode

1955
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:27,680
Alright

1956
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:34,080
But I think they're actually created by part of the reason they

1957
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:36,128
You can't emphasize

1958
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,920
Is because I can't

1959
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,944
Well no I mean

1960
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,040
Difficult

1961
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:43,808
Cuz

1962
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,136
What you're trying to emphasize emphasize with is

1963
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,696
Weebly scared

1964
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:51,232
And come

1965
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:53,024
Pleakley externalize

1966
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,048
Worldview

1967
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,072
Like everything is

1968
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:55,840
Red

1969
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:57,376
And all these threats are connect

1970
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:59,936
Is very difficult

1971
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:08,128
That's sure any of the movies

1972
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,456
The thing is

1973
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:14,528
If you don't fall under the sway

1974
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:19,392
I actually think you should emphasize a little bit I think you need to look inside yourself a little bit deeper

1975
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,416
Because

1976
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,208
What were looking

1977
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,536
With a lot of these people are people who have fallen under the

1978
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:27,840
This way of very charismatic conman

1979
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:29,376
They use politic

1980
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,400
As opposed to

1981
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,936
People who was abused

1982
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:32,960
Necessarily

1983
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,032
And it's the same game

1984
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,312
I feel like

1985
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,336
You should be able to

1986
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,104
To take a stab

1987
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:44,224
It might be difficult but look at it from that prism

1988
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,760
I'm see how

1989
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,320
Done protectionism

1990
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,856
White supremacy

1991
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:53,696
A lot of those things are there religion

1992
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,720
That they've been

1993
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:55,744
Abused with

1994
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,024
And they just haven't escaped

1995
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:57,792
The church

1996
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,608
It doesn't it doesn't

1997
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,168
Come voronin

1998
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,728
You're right

1999
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,032
I see where you're coming from I think

2000
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:12,640
The reason I still rather laugh

2001
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:14,432
Because I didn't come from a desk called

2002
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:16,224
I just came from a regular

2003
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:18,784
Kind of situation

2004
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:25,184
Problem in translation

2005
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,464
Everything

2006
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:28,512
And then they kill themselves right

2007
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,048
Or others

2008
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,072
So you

2009
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:32,864
And and or others

2010
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,400
I would like

2011
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:37,984
To explore this more but I'm not entirely sure.

2012
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:38,752
Episode

2013
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:45,152
We're going into for our territory a 9-hour long episode of just you and I

2014
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,176
By figuring out called

2015
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:54,368
She wanted to do episodes not about Alex to that I say

2016
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:58,208
I don't eat enough Jordan F have a job and then we will

2017
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:01,536
And then we'll go right on into a radio show

2018
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:05,888
Abbott Jordan I want it I want to get back to this idea that Alex was spitting about

2019
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:07,424
VR like video games

2020
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:10,752
Stop

2021
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:13,824
He really tries to make hay out of the idea that like

2022
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,616
All We Do

2023
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:19,456
People using guns responsibly

2024
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,552
Hollywood as people using guns responsibly

2025
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:26,112
And video games of blasting people away

2026
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,904
I'm not trying to say we should

2027
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,184
Sensor

2028
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,976
And I agree

2029
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:34,560
But the problem with the comparison

2030
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,096
Is he's responding to a

2031
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,656
Fake version of YouTube's rules

2032
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,960
I meant comparing it to

2033
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,264
Fiction

2034
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,568
Makes it all meaning

2035
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,104
Yeah I'm saying

2036
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,128
Ansel

2037
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:55,296
I don't know it's a bummer it gets worse in this next clip where Alex Jones talked a little bit more about video game violence

2038
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,320
It's like he's

2039
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:58,112
He's creating a straw man

2040
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,672
Comparing it to a virtual man-made

2041
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,024
Yes

2042
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,328
I agree neither of them are real

2043
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,864
What is a straw man

2044
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,400
One is art

2045
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:14,496
What else is a virtual man made of

2046
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:15,520
Tearing up

2047
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:17,824
Anyway it is night club Alex has some

2048
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,848
Weird f******

2049
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:21,664
Sing ideas about the history of video games

2050
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:29,856
But

2051
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:36,512
Haven't the 60s

2052
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:47,520
Do you have any idea as a video game

2053
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:53,920
Like they were inaccessible to people

2054
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,832
Two projections

2055
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,376
What developed

2056
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:18,752
For the military wasn't developed developed for the military

2057
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,056
Instinctive shooting training Edge

2058
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,224
All of that

2059
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,320
That's the dumbest

2060
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,344
Let that

2061
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,880
That dumb

2062
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,672
Like

2063
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:38,720
I hear like

2064
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,024
I just think like

2065
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,048
I wish I was in

2066
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,072
Sketch comedy

2067
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:47,680
Cuz like that character Leah will cuz that character right there is a good like

2068
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:49,984
Professor who's about to get fired

2069
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,032
Character

2070
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:57,408
All of that is so off base in Turkey

2071
01:46:57,664 --> 01:47:00,992
Monster bull facts about the history of video games

2072
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:04,064
When did when did humans

2073
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,088
Computers were made

2074
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:06,368
What if

2075
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:07,648
Which

2076
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,672
Can you think of

2077
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:10,464
Ultimately

2078
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,000
Bring Me Back To Life

2079
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,024
What is heat

2080
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:13,792
Even think of

2081
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:14,560
Computer

2082
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:19,168
Rocky thinks the computers were created by Thomas Watson in order to help with nausea

2083
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:21,216
Alright Google says that

2084
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:24,544
He's not a big fan

2085
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:26,592
Also by the way

2086
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:31,968
So

2087
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:33,248
It's a little bit of a problem

2088
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:38,624
Yeah maybe a little bit though I played donkey

2089
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,928
King Kong Country cuz I like to jump on heads

2090
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:41,952
I like cartoon

2091
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:43,744
Tune violin when was like

2092
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,768
Even then

2093
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:46,048
First video

2094
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:50,912
Was the 1962 video game but it was

2095
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:56,032
Computer

2096
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:57,056
Game where you go

2097
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:06,784
I believe is named!

2098
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,808
It was

2099
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:10,624
Giant computer energy like

2100
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,648
Circular

2101
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,464
Scream

2102
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,280
It was just a boy

2103
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:19,840
And then you move things in life

2104
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:22,912
I guess it sort of a precursor to like Space Invaders

2105
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:26,496
The arcade

2106
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:27,776
Sure

2107
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:29,568
Is to dehumanize

2108
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:31,616
Okay

2109
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,432
Good good stuff

2110
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:39,808
Bingo if you are playing towards

2111
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:40,832
Alex's

2112
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:42,112
Clearly older

2113
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:43,648
Rural audience

2114
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,184
Where in you

2115
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:51,584
All your butcher video games cause violence

2116
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,888
Doing is just another version of the like

2117
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,424
Millennials

2118
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:58,240
Millennials are ruining this

2119
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:02,848
Marilyn Manson and video games

2120
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,408
It's a fun game

2121
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:11,296
Play Alex is smart enough to know that like I can't play this game I have to play the I'm not playing this game

2122
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,832
And then play the game

2123
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:13,600
So

2124
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:19,488
Cuz if he was a Call of Duty Black Ops

2125
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:23,328
Do you remember that where you kill all the Nazi zombies

2126
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,608
Oh man I would kill

2127
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:27,680
Maybe got decent

2128
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:33,824
Can't speak to this

2129
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:34,848
From my own experience

2130
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:36,384
Cuz most of my gaming

2131
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:37,664
Life has been

2132
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:39,456
10 doz.

2133
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:45,856
Skyrim

2134
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:48,160
Ezell's

2135
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:49,952
Jesus

2136
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,232
I wasn't thinking

2137
01:49:56,352 --> 01:50:01,728
Underground

2138
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,544
What are they called

2139
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,592
No

2140
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,384
They don't exist

2141
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:15,040
Who are the people who are all around it though those shity assholes were all around it were they called

2142
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:22,976
I have

2143
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:25,280
Play

2144
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,816
Alright

2145
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:33,216
We can't stick on Skyrim for the next

2146
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:34,752
If you could come up with that race

2147
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:36,800
Skilling

2148
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:39,872
I think I might be right I think they were called

2149
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,736
We got to quit the show

2150
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,016
Alright

2151
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:52,160
Over exaggerate

2152
01:50:55,488 --> 01:51:00,608
The volunteer for Revolutionary War

2153
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,680
Infowars audience

2154
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,496
10% of the United States

2155
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,288
30 minutes

2156
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,824
Denver Center sell worldwide

2157
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:19,040
Percent of the world

2158
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:22,880
7770

2159
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:27,744
So that means that like

2160
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:30,304
Roughly a billion

2161
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:31,840
Alright

2162
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:35,680
Exactly right

2163
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:37,984
I agree

2164
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,264
Literal lunacy

2165
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,800
And you heard that soft

2166
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:42,080
Guitar playing in the background

2167
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:44,128
Cuz this is

2168
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:48,224
After the Revolutionary War

2169
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,576
Also it Bears mentioning that is

2170
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:56,160
Fifty-three percent of the population was involved

2171
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,440
In the Revolutionary War

2172
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:59,744
Is a specific reference to a group called The

2173
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,512
Be 3%

2174
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:03,328
I bet it's cut ties to white supremacy

2175
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,352
Might not

2176
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,120
Not

2177
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,544
God on the 22nd

2178
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:15,104
Alex spent a lot of

2179
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,152
The time on his show talking about

2180
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:18,688
How Trump

2181
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:20,736
Is putting these tariff

2182
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:22,016
On

2183
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:22,784
China

2184
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:33,536
That's a really

2185
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:39,936
Important things to talk about whether or not

2186
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:41,984
As as husband

2187
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:42,752
Reported

2188
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,544
Whenever China says

2189
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:46,592
Put a tariff on our porch

2190
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:47,360
Sale

2191
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:48,384
China own

2192
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:52,736
Most of the pork Market

2193
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:57,088
So really what their responses is a

2194
01:52:58,368 --> 01:53:00,160
Yourself when you talk about terrorist

2195
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:04,512
If they are responding in such a way as they know that

2196
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:05,536
It's not really going

2197
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:08,352
What is that mean

2198
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:09,888
Two trumps

2199
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:10,656
Saying that

2200
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:11,424
He's going to

2201
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,960
Pateros on there

2202
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:13,984
You know

2203
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,008
That there isn't really a

2204
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:15,776
Tariffs are

2205
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:16,800
I'm sure Alex

2206
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:17,824
Cousin incisive

2207
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:18,848
An important

2208
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:21,408
This

2209
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:27,552
Facts but we're not sure what this really mean I actually think that you generally speaking

2210
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:29,344
Figure you're right on butt

2211
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:31,648
In this case I think we're dealing with a

2212
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:32,416
Entirely too

2213
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:34,464
Situation

2214
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,000
He plays a bunch

2215
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:38,048
Eclipse

2216
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:39,328
Streams live Trump

2217
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:43,936
About this putting these terrorists on China

2218
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:47,776
I would say to know that anything Trump says live is going to a disc

2219
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:50,080
Desi's going to disavow his own

2220
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:50,848
Actual

2221
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:52,640
I would say

2222
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:53,664
From

2223
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,456
Unable to read

2224
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:56,480
Angeline

2225
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:57,504
This is

2226
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,552
Probably going to cause a trade

2227
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:00,832
U-Haul

2228
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,160
Glasses

2229
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:05,696
America

2230
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,464
Incredibly hard

2231
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,232
Hooter

2232
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:08,256
That's going to be a disaster

2233
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:14,912
I can't imagine doing that would hurt the middle class in the lower class

2234
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:17,472
I base this song is

2235
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,008
When it was

2236
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:19,776
Coming up

2237
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:21,056
To the point of making this amount

2238
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:24,640
Kind of like people were talking about maybe Trump is going to do this

2239
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,200
The Chinese State newspaper

2240
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:28,480
Chinadaily War

2241
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:29,248
Quote

2242
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,552
History has shown the pinpricks of

2243
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:32,320
Protectionism

2244
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:35,904
Can ultimately lead to the Shoppes of War somewhere down the line

2245
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:38,720
Great that's not subtle

2246
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:43,072
Definitely something that you want a state-owned newspaper to say

2247
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:44,864
Yeah as a warden

2248
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:49,984
Awesome also Jordans

2249
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:50,752
This is so gay

2250
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:52,032
God dammit

2251
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:55,104
Less than a month ago

2252
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:56,384
Z champagne

2253
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:58,944
Declared himself supreme leader for life

2254
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:02,016
What is a big move

2255
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:04,064
And wait

2256
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,624
Anybody declaring himself dictator for life

2257
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:12,256
That's just a regular that's the course of human events

2258
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:14,304
He can't afford to look weak

2259
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:18,144
Oh no

2260
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:21,216
Is Levi these tariff

2261
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:23,264
You have to assume

2262
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:24,544
But he's going through

2263
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,312
Respond

2264
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,384
Now the fun part about this is the

2265
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,152
The China has

2266
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:32,992
Options how to f*** with us

2267
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:35,040
Without doing anything

2268
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:37,088
They can just slow down costumes

2269
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:37,856
Sforno Reed

2270
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:39,904
I'm making increase security inspect

2271
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:44,256
Slow down trade that way they can Levy export taxes

2272
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:50,144
Just random like they can do that one

2273
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,192
Paperwork

2274
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:53,984
Screw up

2275
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:58,592
We lost my paperwork

2276
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:00,640
Where do you get these sort of like

2277
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:02,688
Little tiny things

2278
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:04,224
And aren't illegal

2279
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:06,016
And only f*** with us

2280
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,808
Are the reasons that we Arkham

2281
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:09,344
Completely outgunned

2282
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:11,136
In terms of a trade War

2283
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:11,904
With giant

2284
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:14,208
They're much bigger

2285
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:18,816
Some of them sold most of our business them overtime

2286
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:22,144
But I would also a regulator

2287
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:23,936
I would argue

2288
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,520
The most likely what Trump is doing is posturing

2289
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:28,288
Shoestring

2290
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,896
Negotiating that will eventually end up leaving us back to exactly where we

2291
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:33,664
We started

2292
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,688
He's doing that

2293
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:35,968
To use Alex Jones

2294
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,784
To Virtue signal

2295
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,088
To his base that he's hard on China

2296
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:44,416
He's doing all these things

2297
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,440
Comes back to the beginning

2298
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:48,256
I think that's probably what's going on

2299
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:50,048
Is the other possibility is

2300
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:53,632
True of

2301
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:54,656
You don't have a lake

2302
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:56,704
The same is true of G-Eazy

2303
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:58,240
Insofar

2304
01:56:58,496 --> 01:56:59,008
He has

2305
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:01,568
Appear to be the same strong

2306
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,848
His dumbass

2307
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,408
I think Trump has to be

2308
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:10,016
That's what I'm talkin about with you I just called myself supreme leader for life

2309
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:14,112
Present himself

2310
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:18,208
And I don't I am not going to go down the Alex Jones root of saying like

2311
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:22,048
They got together and figured out this was the best way to both look strong

2312
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:25,888
I would say it's more like the

2313
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:27,168
I don't think

2314
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:30,496
It's one of those things where you talk about

2315
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:31,264
The difference

2316
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:32,544
Collusion

2317
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:36,640
Working at Mutual benefit

2318
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:39,712
Like I'm sure they talk to each other and they were like

2319
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,248
Hey I have

2320
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,016
To do this

2321
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:42,784
And he was like

2322
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,856
I have to do this in response to that and they're both like

2323
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:47,648
Okay cool well then we're going to do that

2324
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,512
Thought about terrorists

2325
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:54,048
Trump is

2326
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:54,816
Islay

2327
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:57,376
Varying Lee reported as 50 billion

2328
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:58,400
60 billion

2329
01:57:58,912 --> 01:57:59,680
It's unclear

2330
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:01,728
But

2331
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:03,264
Take on it that I find

2332
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:06,592
More troubling than any ideas

2333
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,872
About China

2334
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:08,640
.

2335
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:11,712
Industrialization

2336
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:13,248
Post-industrial era

2337
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:14,528
Tucson weather

2338
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:18,368
Agenda 21 agenda 2030

2339
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,304
Do all this before I was ever on air

2340
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:29,376
Was a huge dumpster John Birch Society

2341
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:31,424
His lawyer

2342
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:35,264
Boykin was the head

2343
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,592
Both of them

2344
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:44,224
Best friend

2345
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:47,296
Throne

2346
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:55,488
Am Healthcare

2347
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:58,304
Everything before the contract

2348
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:01,120
It's a classic

2349
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:11,104
It is just mind-blowing right now

2350
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:13,920
So before you agree

2351
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:17,760
I agree before you leave it's just mind-blowing right now before you respond

2352
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:21,088
I just want you to keep in mind with Alex Jones free

2353
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:23,904
He's the opposite of a Russian agent

2354
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,928
Where you at

2355
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:28,000
All of the stuff

2356
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:29,536
He said is the most

2357
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:32,096
Damning stuff you can say about Trump's dick

2358
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:41,312
Look okay was a f****** b*******,

2359
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:44,896
Like that is where they f***

2360
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:47,968
Can come from their entire existence

2361
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:52,320
Just add in that timeframe being a large donor to

2362
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:58,720
To the John Birch Society Society was founded by Fred

2363
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:01,280
Who built

2364
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:02,048
The third large

2365
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,840
Oil refinery in the third right

2366
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:08,192
He has a literal operator alphabet

2367
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:09,216
Yep

2368
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:10,752
Mikey is

2369
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:13,824
His children are the Koch brothers

2370
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:20,736
Created the Tea Party Movement

2371
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,088
Now

2372
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:27,136
About

2373
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:28,672
The house on American

2374
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:32,512
Nothing but great things

2375
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:35,328
Jordan

2376
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,352
The Bedford

2377
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:38,400
They got rid of all

2378
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:42,752
Do you know the house on American

2379
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:44,288
Went down in history

2380
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:45,568
As being the most

2381
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:47,360
Great

2382
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:48,128
Committee

2383
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:54,784
Do you know how the the McCarthy version of the house American Onyx Havanese committee started

2384
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:57,344
Square

2385
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,160
It wasn't McCarthy

2386
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:04,000
Strongarm

2387
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:13,728
Joseph McCarthy in the house on American Activities Committee grew out of the McCormick dickstein special Committee of

2388
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:15,008
Automatic connectivity

2389
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:18,336
Which spent most of its time harassing left-wing organizations

2390
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:23,712
Unions in particular but also trying to drum out Nazi influence in America

2391
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:25,504
There's a little bit of good

2392
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,552
Stuff in there possibly

2393
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:30,880
Death started in 1934

2394
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:32,160
According to records released

2395
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:33,440
By the Russian

2396
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:34,208
KV

2397
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:36,512
EB the precursor to the KGB

2398
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,792
As early as 90

2399
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:39,328
1837 Samuel dick

2400
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:41,632
Spain was literally a Russian spy

2401
02:01:42,144 --> 02:01:43,680
Taking in monthly payments

2402
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:50,080
That by 1940 had totaled $12

2403
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:55,200
$133,000 adjusted for inflation

2404
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:58,016
The Russians had a code for dickstein

2405
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:58,784
It was

2406
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,832
Crook

2407
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:07,488
That sounds from the Auntie nkvd files quote

2408
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:08,256
Crooked

2409
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:10,304
Completely justifying his code name

2410
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,352
This is an unscrupulous type

2411
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:13,888
Greedy for money

2412
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:16,448
Can send it to work because of money

2413
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:18,752
A very cunning swindler

2414
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:21,056
Hey

2415
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:23,872
Hey if your code name is crook that's

2416
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:26,688
If the people who codename do crocus like

2417
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:30,528
This guy's a crook is a swindler real

2418
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:32,832
That's really bad

2419
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:33,856
Special committee

2420
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:35,392
On American activities

2421
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:37,696
Through into the house on American

2422
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:44,096
Have you so much I remember that quote he grew into the Martin Dies

2423
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,888
Joseph McCarthy

2424
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:48,448
Person who was

2425
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,728
Jet Li

2426
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:52,288
Literally a Russian spy

2427
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:57,152
When the house on American Activities Committee landed under the leadership of right-wing Bart

2428
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:57,920
Dies

2429
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:59,968
Sam dickstein on the outside

2430
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:01,760
He was no longer useful to the Russia

2431
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:03,040
So they cut off payments

2432
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:06,112
5 more years in Congress

2433
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:10,464
Service New York

2434
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:15,328
Really American history is filled with s***

2435
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:16,864
From an article in the guardian

2436
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:18,144
Courtyard

2437
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:19,168
Yes

2438
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:24,800
The committee itself stumbled on until 1976

2439
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:26,336
When Congress finally killed it off

2440
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:29,920
The Damage Done to American society is still visible today

2441
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:31,968
Sample

2442
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:37,088
In the almost almost physical horror of socialism and social democracy

2443
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:40,160
After all these years if somehow fitting

2444
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:42,208
To discover that it was the brainchild of a

2445
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:42,976
Traitor

2446
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:47,840
All of the root Coffeehouse

2447
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:50,656
And set it on American Activities Committee

2448
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:52,192
Comes back to

2449
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:57,568
And so that's why it makes it funny that Alex is like

2450
02:03:57,824 --> 02:04:00,128
This guy was McCarthy's best friend

2451
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:06,528
And you think he's a Russian it well I mean literally

2452
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:12,928
$33,000 from the

2453
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:14,720
Note to mean figuratively

2454
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:17,792
No literally in the sense of the word literally mean

2455
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:21,120
Literally he was a Russian f******

2456
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:23,936
And as far as I can tell

2457
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:27,008
Barring whatever might come out about Dana rohrabacher

2458
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:29,056
Dickstein is

2459
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:32,640
Legitimately the only Congress person who is

2460
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:34,176
It's proved

2461
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:36,736
Was on a foreign governments payroll

2462
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:39,808
Like acting as a foreign spy

2463
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:44,416
For the house on American Activities Committee

2464
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:46,464
The history is a bit problematic

2465
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:49,536
Quote in the book Harvey

2466
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:50,816
Matusow

2467
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:52,608
You wrote this book called.

2468
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:53,376
Witness

2469
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:57,728
He claimed that he was an FBI agent who's been paid to lie about his former friend

2470
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:59,008
And some of the people

2471
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:02,592
But he knew who used to work at a communist bookstore back in the

2472
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:04,128
Back in those days

2473
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:11,296
Some of those people were in prison because of his testimony where is others were black everybody

2474
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:14,112
What books they could

2475
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:15,136
In return

2476
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:16,416
Received what books

2477
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:17,952
Is a communist

2478
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:18,720
Book Hangout

2479
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:19,744
More than anything

2480
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:25,120
So some of the people that have testified against were in prison and some of them

2481
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:26,144
Because of his lies

2482
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:28,192
He also named Joseph

2483
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:28,960
McCarthy

2484
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:31,520
Android

2485
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:32,544
To give false testimony

2486
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:35,616
Madison was a paid Informer

2487
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:36,640
Who'd want to

2488
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:38,432
All of his testimony

2489
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:40,480
Mostly because it was all bulshit

2490
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:44,832
He claimed to know 126 common is to work for the Sunday New York Times

2491
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:46,880
Although they only employed

2492
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:47,904
100 employees

2493
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:48,672
At that time

2494
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:50,464
His false testimony LED

2495
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:52,512
Do union workers being wrongly imprisoned

2496
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:53,792
And the blacklisting of

2497
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:54,560
Many

2498
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:55,328
People

2499
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:57,632
Including folk singer Pete Seeger

2500
02:05:58,912 --> 02:05:59,936
O'Mara

2501
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:01,728
Waheed at 1

2502
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:12,992
So

2503
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:15,552
Involvement that's the that's the worst betrayal

2504
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:18,880
To hear this eager was

2505
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:19,648
The traitor

2506
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:20,416
He wasn't

2507
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:22,464
Heartbreak

2508
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:23,744
The traitor was dicks

2509
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:26,816
Dickstein created the Committees

2510
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:29,632
It became the Witch Hunt

2511
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:30,656
Committees

2512
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:31,936
Yeah of McCarthy

2513
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:33,984
Under the tutelage

2514
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,080
Complete monstrous a****** reykon

2515
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:48,576
You know it's not Gradle nobody knows about this

2516
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:51,136
Yeah

2517
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:51,904
Ignore it

2518
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:52,672
Yep

Show it

2520
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:57,536
Did the

2521
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:00,352
Is because

2522
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:01,888
We won

2523
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:02,912
To believe

2524
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,704
Yeah Leggett

2525
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:09,312
Heartbreaking

2526
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:10,336
Ultimately

2527
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:11,616
When you get down to it

2528
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:14,176
The history of America

2529
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:15,456
The history of the

2530
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:16,224
Worst

2531
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:23,904
You don't want to believe that it was just like just like with white people and

2532
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:24,928
Concept of

2533
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:30,304
You don't want to believe that

2534
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,328
Every part

2535
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:32,864
Of who you are and

2536
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,680
Led to you

2537
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:37,216
Dominating

2538
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,240
Envy

2539
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,776
Free p

2540
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:43,104
To the murder of millions of on Billy

2541
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:48,480
Ultimately what it is right like isn't that isn't that what

2542
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:54,112
Isn't isn't being a white dude

2543
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:55,904
Every morning you wake up

2544
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,720
If not conscious

2545
02:07:59,232 --> 02:07:59,744
At least

2546
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:01,280
Beneficiary

2547
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:03,584
Of the fact that you have destroyed

2548
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:06,144
Millions upon Millions upon millions of

2549
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:12,032
How do you how do you say to yourself in the morning

2550
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:14,848
I deserve what I got

2551
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:17,152
Before I learned anything

2552
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:18,688
Kush Collective response

2553
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:19,968
Possibility is b*******

2554
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:22,784
Nonsense

2555
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:24,320
Like did you didn't

2556
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,344
Do any

2557
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:30,720
You are not responsible for that

2558
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:32,256
So

2559
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:33,536
You can work

2560
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:34,304
On that

2561
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,072
Bye

2562
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:40,192
Killing all white people nope that's the wrong approach the wrong approach

2563
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:44,288
At least number to you can work on it by recognizing

2564
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:45,056
The argument

2565
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:47,104
People in underprivileged

2566
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,128
Which positions are making

2567
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:50,688
By understanding

2568
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:52,480
To help

2569
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:55,040
As best you can Elevate their voices

2570
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:58,624
I think is the best

2571
02:08:58,880 --> 02:08:59,904
Duke and

2572
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:02,464
Recognize the places where your

2573
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:03,488
Antisocial

2574
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:04,256
Advantage

2575
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:06,048
Because of coincidence

2576
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:07,584
The other stuff

2577
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:08,352
The guilt

2578
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:13,984
Do you like I should kill myself because I'm white that's what all these minorities want

2579
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,776
Those sorts of things are all just

2580
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:22,944
It's the equivalent of taking an argument to the wrongest possible

2581
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:25,248
Conclusion on the roadway

2582
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:26,528
Too far and you end up in

2583
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:27,808
In Steubenville

2584
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:28,832
I don't know

2585
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:36,000
I brought up stupidville for a reason

2586
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:40,864
Vista has like a great transition about to happen

2587
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:41,888
Our next

2588
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:48,288
We're in the middle of a great transition happening Dan we have one last guest Jordans

2589
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:49,312

Is

2591
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,896
Absolute resident

2592
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:55,712
This

2593
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:56,992
Person

2594
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:02,624
Here we go

2595
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:03,392
She's a

2596
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:06,720
She's not a collar she's about Seussical

2597
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:11,584
She's on to talk about that good sign

2598
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:12,608
Is the

2599
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:18,240
Boy she's a problematic figure no matter where you go I'm in the alt right

2600
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:19,264
What about the West

2601
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:21,568
The alt-right doesn't even like her

2602
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:23,872
Alright

2603
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:31,808
Deceive I found a bunch of articles that I don't

2604
02:10:32,064 --> 02:10:33,600
Laura Loomer I know her name

2605
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:40,000
She's been on before she's talked about all Muslims are terrorists

2606
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:43,328
SD

2607
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,632
Monster we deal with Sean everyday

2608
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:49,472
Hillary Clinton for a little bit too dumb dollar book signings

2609
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:56,128
Butthole

2610
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:58,176
I found a bunch of articles that like

2611
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:58,944
I don't suck

2612
02:10:59,200 --> 02:10:59,712
You know how to eat

2613
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:02,016
But like

2614
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:04,064
Cassandra Fairbanks

2615
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:05,600
And Lauren Southern

2616
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:07,392
Work using

2617
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:09,696
Laura Loomer of raping a dude

2618
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:13,024
No idea how to engage with it

2619
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,072
Because everything is to like

2620
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:16,864
No words

2621
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:18,400
I don't know what's going on

2622
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:19,936
And not because it's a woman

2623
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:22,240
Being accused of raping man that's absolutely

2624
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:23,008
It does happen

2625
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:24,288
But it just because

2626
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:25,824
Characters

2627
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:28,128
Like

2628
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:30,176
I don't know what to do with

2629
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:43,232
Whatever the reality of that stuff is

2630
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:49,120
Is absolutely outside of the scope of our

2631
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:49,888
Is pitchy is a

2632
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:50,656
Monster

2633
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:51,936
Islamophobe

2634
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:52,960
She sucks

2635
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:54,496
So hard right

2636
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,800
Hitter now

2637
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:58,848
I'm trying to

2638
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:00,384
To research the

2639
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,664
Las Vegas shooting

2640
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:05,760
Research

2641
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:08,320
And those are bad words

2642
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:09,088
No no

2643
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:11,392
I got to give her one tip of the cap

2644
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:13,184
Like legitimately

2645
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:14,976
Cheese

2646
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:16,512
Set a bunch of balls

2647
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:17,536
Absolutely not true

2648
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:18,560
But she

2649
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:21,632
She did make a video that demonstrated that

2650
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:22,656
She could get into

2651
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:23,936
Freight elevator

2652
02:12:24,192 --> 02:12:25,216
At that hotel

2653
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:26,496
And

2654
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:27,520
Great

2655
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:29,312
No it is good

2656
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:32,640
No it is it is telling on some level because

2657
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:34,944
The people at the hotel had said that

2658
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:36,224
No one could get access

2659
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:37,760
To the elevator that would lead

2660
02:12:38,272 --> 02:12:38,784
From

2661
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:39,552
The ground

2662
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:41,856
Florida employee elevator to the 32nd

2663
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:42,880
Can floor where

2664
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:45,952
Play okay

2665
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,488
You could that could be

2666
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:51,328
Beyond the other conclusions that you make

2667
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:52,864
Other stuff

2668
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:54,912
Is Wild Bull Shake

2669
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:56,192
Conspiracy

2670
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:57,728
Alright

2671
02:12:57,984 --> 02:12:59,264
That's it

2672
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:06,432
Should send that to

2673
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:08,480
The hotel

2674
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:10,528
Come to Beef It Up

2675
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:15,904
Secure

2676
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:22,304
I've always wanted to do this as if I was like writing a tweet

2677
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:26,912
It's sweet on air I've never been able to do like meme stuff to play out of me

2678
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:29,216
I I don't like the way you pronounce

2679
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:31,008
Pronounce

2680
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,032
Bubba

2681
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:33,568
So today

2682
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:36,896
Laura Loomer comes on

2683
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:37,664
2

2684
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:39,200
Talk about

2685
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:40,480
Coover investigation

2686
02:13:45,856 --> 02:13:48,672
22R listeners who are not watching the livestream

2687
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:49,696
10

2688
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:50,720
Looked at his

2689
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:53,280
Hand the park ironically

2690
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:56,864
No

2691
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:05,312
Parkland

2692
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:06,592
Real quick

2693
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:10,688
Laura Loomer used to work for James O'Keefe

2694
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:14,272
For project veritas

2695
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:16,320
I think she got a sub

2696
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:18,112
From him

2697
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:21,440
Organizers here in Florida

2698
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:37,312
Liberals just gathering together and dc2

2699
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:48,576
Giffords Foundation

2700
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:50,368
Foundation

2701
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:55,744
Gabrielle

2702
02:14:56,256 --> 02:14:57,280
The former

2703
02:14:57,536 --> 02:14:58,560
Nope

2704
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:01,120
Gabrielle

2705
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:04,448
Giffords that the lady who was shot in the f******

2706
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:09,056
Head Start in Arizona

2707
02:15:09,312 --> 02:15:10,080
Chrissy's

2708
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:15,712
All right sounds

2709
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:17,248
Forget about that event is

2710
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:19,552
Shooting

2711
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:23,648
And remember that the federal judge

2712
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:27,232
Killed four other people beyond that

2713
02:15:27,488 --> 02:15:28,256
6 people total

2714
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:34,656
Gabrielle Giffords

2715
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:36,704
Song of miraculously survived

2716
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,776
Oh and since then has dedicated her life to

2717
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:43,616
To trying to figure out a way that we can have more sensible gun control measures

2718
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:44,640
Yeah

2719
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:45,920
F****** real

2720
02:15:46,176 --> 02:15:50,784
Good wife f****** love Giffords Foundation would be involved

2721
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:54,368
With these Parkland kids

2722
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:56,928
I also it

2723
02:15:57,184 --> 02:15:57,952
Bears mentioning

2724
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:59,232
That the guy

2725
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:00,256
Who did

2726
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:01,024
The

2727
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:02,048
The Killing

2728
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:03,584
In Arizona

2729
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:04,608
2001

2730
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:07,168
He was a guy whose name

2731
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,032
Jared

2732
02:16:12,288 --> 02:16:12,800
Lee Loughner

2733
02:16:13,568 --> 02:16:17,408
Broke I don't understand

2734
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:19,712
He's a guy who also

2735
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:21,248
Unfortunately last

2736
02:16:21,504 --> 02:16:22,272
Bunch of blog post

2737
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:23,296
In his wake

2738
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:24,064
Jeffrey died

2739
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:26,112
Is it carry a bunch

2740
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:27,136
Infowars

2741
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:28,160
The rhetoric

2742
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:32,000
He says stuff like quote the government is brainwashing

2743
02:16:32,256 --> 02:16:32,768
People biking

2744
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:34,048
Trolling

2745
02:16:34,816 --> 02:16:35,328
Sounds great sound

2746
02:16:36,608 --> 02:16:37,120
Marion

2747
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:40,704
It's weird at all that

2748
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:41,472
Foundations

2749
02:16:41,984 --> 02:16:42,496
Involved in

2750
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:43,520
To help out

2751
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:44,288
Provide grounds

2752
02:16:44,544 --> 02:16:45,568
Support for children

2753
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:47,360
Don't know how to organize

2754
02:16:47,872 --> 02:16:48,896
Interstate

2755
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:50,944
Rallies of Their Own

2756
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:52,480
It's f******.

2757
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:53,248
But this

2758
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:08,608
I want to just talk about that really quick

2759
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:11,168
I think that's more an issue of

2760
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:13,472
As a parent

2761
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:15,008
Students

2762
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:16,544
Who are 60

2763
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:18,336
17 years old

2764
02:17:18,848 --> 02:17:19,360
To know

2765
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:21,152
There's going to be people f******

2766
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:24,480
Here are the talking points

2767
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:27,296
You don't want to go on TV and act like an

2768
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:28,064
Masshole

2769
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:29,344
And then become a laugh

2770
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:34,720
This wasn't a concern do people need to have 20 years ago 15 years ago

2771
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:37,024
But now there's such a manipulative

2772
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:43,424
You know you'd better to stuff with the Sandy Hook people who were like this guy was laughing right before he

2773
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,960
He came on and gave his speech

2774
02:17:45,472 --> 02:17:46,752
He's fake

2775
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:49,056
Like you don't want to have those bad

2776
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:50,080
X moments

2777
02:17:51,104 --> 02:17:51,872
I don't think it's

2778
02:17:54,432 --> 02:17:55,712
Debbie Miller is her name

2779
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:57,248
Future

2780
02:17:58,016 --> 02:17:58,784
It don't matter

2781
02:17:59,040 --> 02:17:59,552
No

2782
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:00,320
It doesn't

2783
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:12,096
Responsibility

2784
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:14,144
It doesn't matter what reality

2785
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:17,216
It doesn't matter if every single f******

2786
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:17,984
Thank you say

2787
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,264
Israel

2788
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:25,664
Because they're going to even if you say everything perfectly

2789
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:29,504
Perfectly they're just going to create a hole

2790
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:30,528
Separate

2791
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:31,808
F****** reality

2792
02:18:32,832 --> 02:18:34,112
Pretends It Whatever It Is

2793
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:35,136
F*** you said

2794
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:41,024
We don't live in a world where reality

2795
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:43,328
Matter

2796
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:45,376
Reality

2797
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:47,936
Jordan

2798
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:51,520
PR f******

2799
02:18:51,776 --> 02:18:53,056
Gill's whenever they don't even

2800
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:56,896
They don't even realistically matter for the bath

2801
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:58,432
It doesn't matter

2802
02:18:58,688 --> 02:18:59,712
It couldn't hurt

2803
02:18:59,968 --> 02:19:02,016
In their f****** hands and then

2804
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:03,296
And they be like

2805
02:19:03,552 --> 02:19:06,112

It doesn't matter it's not going to change it like why are we putting it on me

2807
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:15,840
Children

Everybody is wondering

2812
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:27,360
Everybody is wondering

2813
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:34,016
What you're screaming about

2814
02:19:34,528 --> 02:19:35,040
Why aren't

2815
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:36,832
Parents and adults showing up

To try to help

2819
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,096
Because you know I know and is trying

2820
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:49,632
I know right

2821
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:50,656
It's just

2822
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:53,216
I don't understand.

2823
02:19:53,728 --> 02:19:59,360
I'm not trying to quell your passion I just I know I know

2824
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:01,408
The Giffords organization

2825
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:02,688
This

2826
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:04,992
Laura Loomer

2827
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:07,040
His caught on video

2828
02:20:07,296 --> 02:20:08,576
Or manifestation

2829
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:09,600
Of adults

2830
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:10,880
Who are trying to

2831
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:11,904
To help these kids

2832
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:13,952
Express themselves

2833
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:16,768
Accurately right

2834
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:19,072
And in a way that's not good

2835
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:24,192
Here is the only thing

2836
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:25,216
That I

2837
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:27,008
Feel about what's going on

2838
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:28,288
With

2839
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:30,336
Especially in regards to

2840
02:20:31,872 --> 02:20:32,896
All of these kids

2841
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,944
Staying very

2842
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:39,808
And it doesn't matter

2843
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:43,392
It doesn't matter

2844
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:45,696
My point

2845
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:46,976
Continue

2846
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:47,744
Tubi

2847
02:20:49,536 --> 02:20:50,560
Why are we

2848
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:53,120
For what these people are

2849
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:55,168
You mean the the right

2850
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:57,472
These were

2851
02:20:57,728 --> 02:20:59,008
Why bother

2852
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:01,056
Why bother acting like

2853
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:02,080
We need to have a

2854
02:21:02,336 --> 02:21:04,384
PR strategy

2855
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:10,272
What is white matter

2856
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:11,296
Okay

2857
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:12,064
Because there

2858
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:14,880
Who cares

2859
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:15,648
No no no

2860
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:16,672
Because

2861
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:18,720
They have the rest of their lives in

2862
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:20,768
Who cares

2863
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:21,536
Don't

2864
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:23,840
No no no

2865
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:28,192
This meeting

2866
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:30,752
Ostensibly easy

2867
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:32,544
The teacher in Broward County

2868
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:33,568
Talking to

2869
02:21:33,824 --> 02:21:34,592
Two students

2870
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:36,896
Write better going

2871
02:21:37,152 --> 02:21:37,920
To go on this

2872
02:21:38,432 --> 02:21:39,712
What I would assume is

2873
02:21:39,968 --> 02:21:40,480
Field trip

2874
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:41,248
Flash

2875
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:42,528
Protest

2876
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,064
Rally

2877
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:49,184
They have a responsibility

2878
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:49,952
Adults

2879
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,232
2

2880
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:53,536
I don't

2881
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:55,072
Think of it when they're talking

2882
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:55,840
Think about talking

2883
02:21:56,864 --> 02:21:57,376
It's like

2884
02:21:58,400 --> 02:21:58,912
Used

2885
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:01,216
Right

2886
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:01,984
More like

2887
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:03,776
Stay on message

2888
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:05,824
Reggie you agree with this

2889
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:08,128
If not do this

2890
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:15,296
Keep your dog. Make sure you know

2891
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:17,856
Escape now that there

2892
02:22:19,904 --> 02:22:20,672
Play it on the show

2893
02:22:21,184 --> 02:22:23,232
In one of her Undercover videos

2894
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:24,768
She's like

2895
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:26,048
Broward County

2896
02:22:26,304 --> 02:22:27,584
Teacher Debbie Miller

2897
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,912
There should not be any kids

2898
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:32,192
Alone

2899
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:34,496
And I would say even if

2900
02:22:35,776 --> 02:22:37,824
Where you're going

2901
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:40,640
Ulta

2902
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:41,920
It's a field trip Bass

2903
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:44,480
Physically

2904
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:46,784
She might as well

2905
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:52,928
Use the buddy system

2906
02:22:57,792 --> 02:22:59,072
They want to make

2907
02:22:59,328 --> 02:23:00,864
Supported by

2908
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:01,888
The Giffords

2909
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:02,656
Innovation

2910
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:05,728
The Run by a woman

2911
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:10,080
Here's my argument against that which is that

2912
02:23:10,848 --> 02:23:11,616
Who

2913
02:23:12,128 --> 02:23:12,896
I'm sorry

2914
02:23:13,152 --> 02:23:13,664
I'm sorry

2915
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,456
Argument against that is just

2916
02:23:16,992 --> 02:23:18,016
F****** care

2917
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:19,552
It doesn't

2918
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:24,672
There is no right there is no longer a conversation

2919
02:23:24,928 --> 02:23:26,464
That is not a thing better

2920
02:23:27,744 --> 02:23:29,536
So if you want to if you want to say

2921
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:33,632
We should get rid of all guns in the history of ever

2922
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:34,656
We should go back in

2923
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:38,496
During the American Civil War

2924
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:44,896
Or the American Revolution

2925
02:23:45,152 --> 02:23:46,176
People who care

2926
02:23:46,432 --> 02:23:47,200
About Gunn

2927
02:23:47,456 --> 02:23:47,968
Are going to

2928
02:23:48,224 --> 02:23:49,504
Twist and turn

2929
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:58,976
I forgot to tell you one of the most fun things about this

2930
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:01,024
That that whole YouTube and

2931
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:02,304
What's going on

2932
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:06,656
The gun videos of it

2933
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:11,008
Slingshot videos of Germany

2934
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:16,640
Slingshots

2935
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:18,432
He's concerned it like his

2936
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:19,456
Brights are going

2937
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:21,248
I'm construct

2938
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:23,296
Could you say this in a German

2939
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:24,320
Accent I would make me feel better

2940
02:24:24,832 --> 02:24:27,136
I'm not Alex I don't do shity accent

2941
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:30,976
But his was stopped

2942
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:38,400
Is

2943
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:41,728
Something and his

2944
02:24:41,984 --> 02:24:43,264
Response to it was

2945
02:24:43,776 --> 02:24:44,544
We should Union

2946
02:24:46,336 --> 02:24:46,848
Yeah

2947
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,944
Which is a reasonable or like idea

2948
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,808
World collide with Alex

2949
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:58,112
Could never deal with a guy who makes

2950
02:24:58,368 --> 02:24:58,880
Gun

2951
02:24:59,136 --> 02:25:01,440
Construction

2952
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:04,768
Contact your creators

2953
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:08,096
For YouTube we should unionize

2954
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:14,496
We should make a union because they're encroaching our ability to make gun videos on YouTube

2955
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:16,544
Now think about this

2956
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:19,872
The only arguments that Alex

2957
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:20,640
And his ilk

2958
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:22,432
Have at all

2959
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:23,456
In terms of REM

2960
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:24,736
Either

2961
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:26,016
Unionizing

2962
02:25:27,808 --> 02:25:30,368
Putting regulations

2963
02:25:31,392 --> 02:25:33,696
They have to go against themselves in order to

2964
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:38,560
Anyway

2965
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:40,864
I'm sorry I'm furious 4 sucks

2966
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:44,192
It will cause us to get off track

2967
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:45,728
Jordan is.

2968
02:25:46,496 --> 02:25:47,520
You're so much

2969
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:55,712
Jews control the politicians in Washington

2970
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:03,392
She said oh this is super off-the-record

2971
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:27,456
Literally

2972
02:26:27,712 --> 02:26:33,856
Students to break the law and storm the White House and March to the

2973
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:34,880
Lighthouse Inn

2974
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:36,160
Raise Hell

2975
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:37,696
So

2976
02:26:39,488 --> 02:26:41,024
Permits and permits are

2977
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:42,048
Really important

2978
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:44,096
Where are the really important

2979
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:48,960
But the people shoot people

2980
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:49,984
Ahead

2981
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:50,752
Really

2982
02:26:53,312 --> 02:26:54,848
Just messed with it being shot

2983
02:26:55,104 --> 02:26:57,920
I had a little bit

2984
02:26:58,176 --> 02:26:59,968
Tulsa

2985
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:02,528
2018

2986
02:27:04,064 --> 02:27:04,832
So

2987
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:12,000
I watched a YouTube channel if you want it's

2988
02:27:12,512 --> 02:27:13,280
Very boring

2989
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:15,584
It also is very selective

2990
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:17,632
Edited in the same way that

2991
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:18,656
James O'Keefe

2992
02:27:19,424 --> 02:27:21,728
Project Veritas videos are

2993
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:27,360
I will give Laura Credit in as much as she allows.

2994
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:32,480
Supposed to happen I won't sometimes they end up leading into other senses

2995
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:33,760
Or unrelated

2996
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:35,552
I don't give her

2997
02:27:36,064 --> 02:27:36,576
Goddamn bit

2998
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:38,880
Credit address

2999
02:27:39,136 --> 02:27:39,904
First of all permit

3000
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:42,976
Permits to

3001
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:46,560
The First Amendment

3002
02:27:47,584 --> 02:27:48,608
Permits are huge

3003
02:27:48,864 --> 02:27:49,888
This part of the first time

3004
02:27:55,008 --> 02:28:01,152
Understanding of civil order in if you want to organize somewhere

3005
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:03,968
And I'm not I'm not coming down

3006
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,016
What Debbie Miller

3007
02:28:06,272 --> 02:28:07,552
In this video it's a

3008
02:28:07,808 --> 02:28:08,576
Is that

3009
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:09,856
They were unable

3010
02:28:10,112 --> 02:28:11,136
Fire app

3011
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:13,184
Not that they failed to

3012
02:28:13,696 --> 02:28:14,464
Acquire permit

3013
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:18,048
Given one

3014
02:28:19,328 --> 02:28:21,376
Different it's slightly different

3015
02:28:21,632 --> 02:28:22,144
Can understand

3016
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:23,936
But they have a permit

3017
02:28:24,448 --> 02:28:24,960
To have a rally

3018
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:28,288
So what they're going to do is have a rally

3019
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:29,824
And then she says

3020
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,616
Winking voice

3021
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:34,688
If we all leave the same direction

3022
02:28:36,736 --> 02:28:37,504
That sort of thing

3023
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:38,272
But

3024
02:28:38,528 --> 02:28:39,296
I would argue

3025
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:41,856
I've been to

3026
02:28:42,112 --> 02:28:44,672
100 goddamn Rally's in my life

3027
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:46,464
That's how they all go

3028
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:48,256
Everyone

3029
02:28:48,512 --> 02:28:50,560
Kind of just

3030
02:28:51,328 --> 02:28:51,840
The real

3031
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:56,448
It's not the right to

3032
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:59,008
That's not like a left right thing

3033
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:00,032
If you

3034
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:01,312
Permitting

3035
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:05,408
Right

3036
02:29:06,688 --> 02:29:09,504
I and I'm not I'm not I'm not saying that like

3037
02:29:10,016 --> 02:29:10,528
In Sumter

3038
02:29:10,784 --> 02:29:11,552
Kind of like

3039
02:29:11,808 --> 02:29:12,320
Flippant

3040
02:29:12,576 --> 02:29:13,088
Defending

3041
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:15,136
This protest not defending other

3042
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:16,160
Waze

3043
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:16,928
Like

3044
02:29:18,208 --> 02:29:19,232
When

3045
02:29:19,488 --> 02:29:20,768
The KKK has a permit

3046
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:22,048
Rally

3047
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:23,584
Alright

3048
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:24,352
Good luck

3049
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:32,544
I think I'm fine with that

3050
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:34,080
Is

3051
02:29:34,848 --> 02:29:35,872
Teacher in the CPS

3052
02:29:36,384 --> 02:29:37,408
When she was

3053
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:38,432
Sing about the

3054
02:29:39,456 --> 02:29:39,968
Walkout

3055
02:29:40,736 --> 02:29:41,248
That the students

3056
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:42,016
We're going to have

3057
02:29:42,784 --> 02:29:43,552
For the Parkland

3058
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:44,832
Weather like

3059
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:47,136
Everybody needs to f****** do something

3060
02:29:48,672 --> 02:29:49,696
The administration of

3061
02:29:49,952 --> 02:29:50,720
The school dance

3062
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:52,512
Okay

3063
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:55,840
It's already going to have a walkout

3064
02:29:56,096 --> 02:29:59,680
We're going to do 17 minutes of silence redo the whole thing

3065
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:03,008
Well then

3066
02:30:04,288 --> 02:30:05,312
Spore

3067
02:30:05,568 --> 02:30:09,920
So the people who are complicit in the shooting happening

3068
02:30:10,176 --> 02:30:11,968
Are going to lead a

3069
02:30:12,736 --> 02:30:14,528
Pointless meaningless protest

3070
02:30:14,784 --> 02:30:16,320
And then everybody's going to go back to

3071
02:30:16,576 --> 02:30:17,088
To school then

3072
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:22,208
F****** care if I think that's the grander conversation

3073
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:24,768
This conversation is

3074
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:26,560
Do you like

3075
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:27,840
Your student

3076
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:32,960
Your school is Soros operated

3077
02:30:33,216 --> 02:30:34,752
You're fine with The Rock

3078
02:30:35,008 --> 02:30:39,872
Your conversation is real conversation is

3079
02:30:40,384 --> 02:30:41,664
Why is anybody going

3080
02:30:42,688 --> 02:30:43,456
Mario

3081
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:47,296
Everyday you go to school

3082
02:30:47,552 --> 02:30:48,320
Your school gets

3083
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:50,880
Everyday your school gets money

3084
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:53,184
Your school is more susceptible to

3085
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:53,952
You getting

3086
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:54,720
F****** shot

3087
02:30:55,744 --> 02:30:57,536
Everybody should f****** shut

3088
02:30:58,816 --> 02:30:59,840
Shittown

3089
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:00,608
.

3090
02:31:02,144 --> 02:31:08,288
Like Franklin like I don't even want to go to work like a real thing where it's like if we all

3091
02:31:08,544 --> 02:31:09,824
Could just f******

3092
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:12,384
And we can't do it we can't do it because

3093
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,152
We all have to

3094
02:31:13,664 --> 02:31:16,224
Or we could we live with it

3095
02:31:18,784 --> 02:31:23,648
That's called Market live in a world where a union

3096
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:24,928
8

3097
02:31:25,184 --> 02:31:26,464
A real Union

3098
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:27,232
Is fuc

3099
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:31,584
Wow and that's not a world that we can ever that

3100
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:32,352
Comes back to

3101
02:31:36,704 --> 02:31:37,216
The consequences

3102
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:40,288
Goddamn Russians

3103
02:31:40,544 --> 02:31:41,568
Traitor

3104
02:31:42,592 --> 02:31:43,104
Created

3105
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:45,920
Visceral disgust

3106
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:47,712
Let me have

3107
02:31:50,272 --> 02:31:51,808
In the name of

3108
02:31:52,064 --> 02:31:52,832
Patriotism

3109
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:54,368
And protecting America

3110
02:31:54,624 --> 02:31:55,904
He created

3111
02:31:56,416 --> 02:31:57,952
Unintentionally or intense

3112
02:31:58,208 --> 02:31:58,720
Internally

3113
02:31:58,976 --> 02:32:00,256
A complete disgust

3114
02:32:00,768 --> 02:32:03,328
About the idea of social

3115
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:04,608
Democratic

3116
02:32:04,864 --> 02:32:06,912
Socialist democratic

3117
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:09,216
Lingers to this day

3118
02:32:09,728 --> 02:32:10,752
We just got to f******

3119
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:12,544
Find a way to deal with it

3120
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:14,592
The worst

3121
02:32:14,848 --> 02:32:20,992
Part about that clip no the listen to what they're saying

3122
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:23,040
This teacher Debbie Miller

3123
02:32:23,296 --> 02:32:23,808
Proclaimed

3124
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:27,136
The Jews run the politician

3125
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:28,416
Who hasn't

3126
02:32:33,024 --> 02:32:34,048
Batshit

3127
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:39,680
Flo's off me at this point like this point I'm like

3128
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:42,752
Run the politician me see if I can cut back too and find

3129
02:32:44,288 --> 02:32:48,128
Jews control the politicians in Washington

3130
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:50,944
Amazing

3131
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:55,552
Riddles

3132
02:32:55,808 --> 02:32:58,368
So I went and pulled the clip that

3133
02:32:58,624 --> 02:33:04,768
She's actually talking about

3134
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:08,608
YouTube when she clearly proves that she

3135
02:33:08,864 --> 02:33:10,400
Said that the Jews run the politician

3136
02:33:10,912 --> 02:33:11,936
Lowe's in McDonough

3137
02:33:28,832 --> 02:33:30,368
That's what Debbie Miller said

3138
02:33:31,392 --> 02:33:33,440
You heard that story

3139
02:33:33,696 --> 02:33:36,000
They say the Jews are in charge of the weather but the

3140
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:36,768
Clear Lake

3141
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:38,304
No

3142
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:43,168
That's not what you said that's not even what she said

3143
02:33:43,424 --> 02:33:44,960
Good job

3144
02:33:45,216 --> 02:33:45,728
She said

3145
02:33:45,984 --> 02:33:46,496
She said

3146
02:33:46,752 --> 02:33:48,288
I would say something

3147
02:33:48,544 --> 02:33:49,312
I'm saying about that

3148
02:33:49,568 --> 02:33:50,592
Politician

3149
02:33:51,872 --> 02:33:53,152
The Jews harp

3150
02:33:53,408 --> 02:33:54,944
Right

3151
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:56,224
Trayon White

3152
02:33:56,736 --> 02:34:00,320
A DC council member recently said

3153
02:34:00,832 --> 02:34:03,392
It started smelling out of nowhere this morning man

3154
02:34:03,648 --> 02:34:05,440
Y'all better pay attention to this climate

3155
02:34:05,696 --> 02:34:07,488
Control man just climate manipulation

3156
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,048
That's a model based off of Rothschild

3157
02:34:10,304 --> 02:34:11,328
Controlling the climate

3158
02:34:11,584 --> 02:34:13,120
Create natural disasters they can

3159
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:15,168
Paying for their own in these cities man

3160
02:34:15,424 --> 02:34:15,936
Be careful

3161
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,776
She's making a joke

3162
02:34:20,032 --> 02:34:22,336
About this guy who died

3163
02:34:22,592 --> 02:34:25,920
A week ago

3164
02:34:26,432 --> 02:34:26,944
Silica gel

3165
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:29,248
It's at the salad it's a salad

3166
02:34:29,504 --> 02:34:30,784
She's playing to the crowd

3167
02:34:31,808 --> 02:34:32,576
This is why this is

3168
02:34:32,832 --> 02:34:33,344
Is a great joke

3169
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:34,624
Why is it a great

3170
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:37,952
When Debbie Miller made that joke that meeting

3171
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:39,232
It was a air

3172
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:40,512
It's

3173
02:34:41,536 --> 02:34:46,144
There was like you could hear laughs because people had to read that story

3174
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:51,264
Response would read that story in the understood what she was talking about

3175
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:52,544
Yeah it's

3176
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,568
Funnier

3177
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:55,872
Because Laura Loomer was

3178
02:34:56,128 --> 02:34:56,640
There

3179
02:34:56,896 --> 02:34:57,920
He was not

3180
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:01,248
She was at the meeting secretly recording

3181
02:35:02,784 --> 02:35:04,320
That's how she has this audio

3182
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:06,112
She was secretly recording all this

3183
02:35:06,624 --> 02:35:09,952
So she's secretly recorded all of this

3184
02:35:10,464 --> 02:35:10,976
Then

3185
02:35:11,488 --> 02:35:12,000
Took it

3186
02:35:12,768 --> 02:35:14,304
Then misrepresentative

3187
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:16,864
On Alex Jones Show

3188
02:35:17,376 --> 02:35:23,520
Where they accuse Debbie Miller of making anti-semitic remarks about how the Jews run

3189
02:35:24,544 --> 02:35:25,312
Which isn't even

3190
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:26,336
Close to what

3191
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:27,104
She said

3192
02:35:27,872 --> 02:35:28,896
On a show

3193
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:30,432
Alex Jones

3194
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:34,784
Absolutely accused the Rothschild that haven't weather Rapids

3195
02:35:37,088 --> 02:35:37,600
Fix my

3196
02:35:39,136 --> 02:35:45,280
Doesn't matter why coach know this guy trayon white absolutely was inspired by

3197
02:35:45,792 --> 02:35:50,656
He's whether it's Infowars. Or a Infowars

3198
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:52,192
Surrogates

3199
02:35:52,448 --> 02:35:56,032
He's inspired by his head like it let me make clear what my point

3200
02:35:56,544 --> 02:35:57,056
Is that

3201
02:35:57,568 --> 02:35:58,336
Why bother

3202
02:35:58,848 --> 02:35:59,872
Why bother

3203
02:36:00,128 --> 02:36:00,640
Pretending

3204
02:36:00,896 --> 02:36:01,920
That there's a world

3205
02:36:02,688 --> 02:36:03,456
Coach

3206
02:36:03,712 --> 02:36:04,224
PR purse

3207
02:36:04,736 --> 02:36:06,016
Phrases saying something

3208
02:36:06,272 --> 02:36:11,648
Let the right-wing plan in a perfect world

3209
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:18,304
Cheetah nails in a perfect world no explanation

3210
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,584
Give a f*** about the

3211
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:22,144
These people need to be left

3212
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:27,008
Ain't nobody should ever know

3213
02:36:27,264 --> 02:36:31,360
That's what I get serious me about the idea of a Centrist

3214
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:32,128
Democrat

3215
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:34,432
Everybody

3216
02:36:35,712 --> 02:36:36,736
They are gone

3217
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:39,040
If you are somebody who is concerned

3218
02:36:39,296 --> 02:36:39,808
About what

3219
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:44,416
Misconstrue what you said into thinking

3220
02:36:44,672 --> 02:36:48,768
If you're somebody who's like oh well the Southern Poverty Law Center said this

3221
02:36:49,024 --> 02:36:50,304
Who cares

3222
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:51,840
Take me to go

3223
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:52,864
Put forth

3224
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:54,144
Actual

3225
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:55,168
Progressive

3226
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:56,704
F****** idea

3227
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:57,728
End

3228
02:36:57,984 --> 02:36:58,496
Go

3229
02:37:00,032 --> 02:37:01,056
Say it real

3230
02:37:01,312 --> 02:37:02,080
Say it loud

3231
02:37:02,336 --> 02:37:03,616
People should not

3232
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:05,408
People should not

3233
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:06,944
Pretend that there's a

3234
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:10,016
Third Way people should not pretend that you need to

3235
02:37:10,272 --> 02:37:16,416
Say things in the middle there's no middle there's these people who are f****** trying to murder it

3236
02:37:16,672 --> 02:37:17,184
There is a fuk

3237
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:17,952
Rectify

3238
02:37:18,208 --> 02:37:23,072
The middle is trying to live

3239
02:37:23,328 --> 02:37:25,120
Survive coming

3240
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:28,448
F****** Apocalypse in the middle

3241
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:29,984
Bill

3242
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:31,776
There is a compromise

3243
02:37:32,032 --> 02:37:34,080
Between

3244
02:37:38,688 --> 02:37:39,968
The idea that we should

3245
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:41,760
Find a middle ground

3246
02:37:42,272 --> 02:37:43,808
Compromise doesn't exist

3247
02:37:44,064 --> 02:37:46,624
When the other side

3248
02:37:47,392 --> 02:37:47,904
Compromise

3249
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:48,928
Cuzick

3250
02:37:50,976 --> 02:37:51,488
With

3251
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:55,584
The very very rare people who are

3252
02:37:56,096 --> 02:37:56,608
Shopkins

3253
02:37:58,144 --> 02:37:59,424
That compromise.

3254
02:38:00,192 --> 02:38:00,704
But

3255
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:02,496
Play we live in a world where

3256
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:04,800
Praying are we talked about the Alberta

3257
02:38:05,056 --> 02:38:05,824
Window so much

3258
02:38:06,848 --> 02:38:07,616
So goddamn

3259
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:08,896
How far to the right

3260
02:38:11,456 --> 02:38:12,736
It's basically compromising

3261
02:38:14,016 --> 02:38:14,528
Yes

3262
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:17,344
The battle

3263
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:18,112
Compromising with

3264
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:18,880
Orthocenter

3265
02:38:19,136 --> 02:38:21,184
Where to actually identify

3266
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:21,952
As

3267
02:38:22,208 --> 02:38:22,976
On the right are

3268
02:38:23,488 --> 02:38:24,000
Fairfax

3269
02:38:24,512 --> 02:38:25,792
At this point

3270
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:28,864
And you do what I imagine that

3271
02:38:29,632 --> 02:38:31,424
There's a hypothetical world that

3272
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:32,704
Exist where

3273
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:34,496
Things went a different way

3274
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:36,032
That maybe thing

3275
02:38:38,848 --> 02:38:40,640
Or something like that in our country

3276
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:43,968
We had a

3277
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:45,248
Yeah there's

3278
02:38:45,504 --> 02:38:46,272
Like

3279
02:38:46,528 --> 02:38:47,040
Leader

3280
02:38:47,296 --> 02:38:49,856
Who take

3281
02:38:50,368 --> 02:38:53,184
Alternate reality

3282
02:38:53,440 --> 02:38:57,792
I'm not saying that

3283
02:38:58,304 --> 02:39:00,096
Always fighting fascism is great

3284
02:39:00,352 --> 02:39:00,864
But

3285
02:39:02,144 --> 02:39:03,168
Right but

3286
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:09,568
There is a way there is a way that liberalism and leftism is exploited also

3287
02:39:10,336 --> 02:39:16,480
Like with Communist governments in the past it like if we want to go back to

3288
02:39:16,736 --> 02:39:19,040
Alex Jones is shity Rhodesia metaphor

3289
02:39:19,296 --> 02:39:20,576
Like what

3290
02:39:20,832 --> 02:39:21,856
Mugabe went bad

3291
02:39:22,624 --> 02:39:23,904
Like there is a point

3292
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:24,672
Where

3293
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:25,952
Like things are going

3294
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:26,976
That way

3295
02:39:27,232 --> 02:39:29,280
And then I imagine there are people

3296
02:39:29,536 --> 02:39:31,328
Who are on the right who are like

3297
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:33,632
I'm only able to compromise with

3298
02:39:33,888 --> 02:39:36,192
Epicenter I can't compromise with the

3299
02:39:36,448 --> 02:39:37,984
Right actually left

3300
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:40,032
Exist now but unfortunately

3301
02:39:40,288 --> 02:39:41,824
That is not our reality

3302
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:44,640
That is a hypothetical reality

3303
02:39:44,896 --> 02:39:45,408
And that's

3304
02:39:45,664 --> 02:39:47,200
That's my

3305
02:39:47,456 --> 02:39:49,248
I have a long-standing

3306
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:50,528
With

3307
02:39:50,784 --> 02:39:51,552
Anybody who uses

3308
02:39:51,808 --> 02:39:52,576
Is the word popular

3309
02:39:53,344 --> 02:39:54,112
Right cuz

3310
02:39:55,904 --> 02:39:57,184
Is not an

3311
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:00,256
Is always

3312
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:01,024
Associated

3313
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:02,048
With that fashion

3314
02:40:02,304 --> 02:40:03,328
Just leader that shows up

3315
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:08,448
May not always begin with but becomes it

3316
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:10,240
That's what you're popular

3317
02:40:10,752 --> 02:40:13,824
Associated with always always want something.

3318
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:14,592
Lake

3319
02:40:20,224 --> 02:40:20,736
The personality

3320
02:40:21,248 --> 02:40:24,064
It's that nonsense

3321
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:24,832
It's

3322
02:40:25,088 --> 02:40:26,880
The I care about you but

3323
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:29,440
The two most important

3324
02:40:29,696 --> 02:40:30,976
I care about you

3325
02:40:31,488 --> 02:40:37,120
What's up

3326
02:40:40,192 --> 02:40:42,496
Like we talked about

3327
02:40:43,264 --> 02:40:44,032
Those

3328
02:40:44,288 --> 02:40:45,312
Those Concepts

3329
02:40:45,568 --> 02:40:46,080
Sonos ID

3330
02:40:46,848 --> 02:40:50,176
The destruction of them always wind up being

3331
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:51,712
Miss associate

3332
02:40:54,784 --> 02:40:55,296
Might be a way

3333
02:40:55,808 --> 02:40:57,600
The association

3334
02:40:57,856 --> 02:41:00,928
With populist to the dictator that are right

3335
02:41:01,952 --> 02:41:04,256
Right leg the idea

3336
02:41:04,512 --> 02:41:07,072
Bernie Sanders had won the Democratic nomination

3337
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:09,376
Become a be president

3338
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:15,520
He would have been become Mugabe right like that's the idea of populism that

3339
02:41:16,032 --> 02:41:16,544
Associated

3340
02:41:17,824 --> 02:41:18,336
And

3341
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:19,360
It is

3342
02:41:19,616 --> 02:41:20,128
Always

3343
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:22,432
Always comes back to that

3344
02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:28,576
People doing f***** up so bad that they're willing to do

3345
02:41:28,832 --> 02:41:30,368
Anything other than what's go

3346
02:41:35,232 --> 02:41:37,280
Like the idea of a populist

3347
02:41:37,536 --> 02:41:38,304
Trump is not up

3348
02:41:42,912 --> 02:41:43,680
Parking

3349
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:52,896
Like our entire show is a demonstration of him being a victim of a con man

3350
02:41:54,432 --> 02:41:54,944
It is a

3351
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:55,968
Concentrate

3352
02:41:56,224 --> 02:41:57,248
Enforcement

3353
02:42:00,064 --> 02:42:00,576
VI

3354
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:02,112
Diaz that we should let

3355
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:06,208
No we shouldn't

3356
02:42:06,464 --> 02:42:09,024
We shouldn't know I kind of think they should

3357
02:42:09,536 --> 02:42:10,304
I kind of think we should

3358
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:12,352
I think we should drag them

3359
02:42:12,608 --> 02:42:13,376
Because there's

3360
02:42:13,888 --> 02:42:14,656
They're not there

3361
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:16,448
Alright nevermind

3362
02:42:16,704 --> 02:42:17,216
I'm going to let this

3363
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:23,872
I just I don't I don't I don't know what time we're going to come tonight I really don't even think I can

3364
02:42:24,128 --> 02:42:30,272
Incoherently make my point let's do I apologize

3365
02:42:30,528 --> 02:42:36,672
Southern

3366
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:39,232
But also Laura Loomer

3367
02:42:39,488 --> 02:42:41,536
The same first name

3368
02:42:41,792 --> 02:42:43,072
The first like 5 letters

3369
02:42:43,328 --> 02:42:49,472
But you can

3370
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:54,080
Like

Here's my dismount

So that's that

3374
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:09,184
Website knowledge pike.com we're also on Twitter

Where you can kill the rich group go home tell your mother you're brilliant

3378
02:43:19,424 --> 02:43:21,472
Lot of people get killed by the ridge there

02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:27,872
X over The download yes

3380
02:43:28,128 --> 02:43:31,968
Absolutely

3381
02:43:32,224 --> 02:43:32,736
And a lot of fun

3382
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:34,016
But

3383
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:36,576
I want to I want to give him more abstract

3384
02:43:37,856 --> 02:43:38,880
Shout out at the end of the step

3385
02:43:39,136 --> 02:43:39,648
Episode

3386
02:43:40,928 --> 02:43:41,440
No

3387
02:43:41,696 --> 02:43:42,720
I mean they should go f*** them

3388
02:43:43,744 --> 02:43:44,256
But

3389
02:43:45,024 --> 02:43:45,792
I would say

3390
02:43:46,048 --> 02:43:48,352
Alex Jones's beholding

3391
02:43:49,632 --> 02:43:50,144
To his
