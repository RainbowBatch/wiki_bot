In the next week

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
That will be very

33
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,464
Our political system

00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376

I'm going to be just

39

40
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,592
The narratives that Alex Jones is

41
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
Open pitching on

42
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
You're stuck in Dempster

00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
It's Friday August 4th

46
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,704
You and your girlfriend both have the same database delusion

47
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
Alex Jones on the last episode

48
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
On the 1st

49
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
He was

50
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Coming in

51
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
With some new Seth rich

52
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
You coming in with

53
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
Another Wrinkle in the Seth Rich case

54
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
On the 2nd

55
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
He goes even harder

56
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
He goes even further

57
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
And that is because

58
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
Some audio was released

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,328
Seymour Hersh

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
Award-winning journalist Seymour Hersh

61
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
Giving about how

62
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
The Russian

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
Stuff is all nonsense

64
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
Panino's

65
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,128
5 who has like pink

66
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,968
And that he has been told by high-level sources

67
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
That Seth Rich was the

68
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
He's the guy

69
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,368
He was the guy who gave stuff to WikiLeaks

70
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
But he also says

71
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
I don't know if that murder was related to it

72
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
Could have just been a murder what a crazy

73
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,471
In the Seymour Hurst tape you talkin about how

74
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
You're coming to possession of

75
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
These emails and what have you

76
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
He was trying to get money

77
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
From WikiLeaks

78
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
In exchange

79
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
WikiLeaks

80
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,295
And get indicated two people that he had given

81
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
A lock

82
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Dropbox

83
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
Write to some friends

84
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,463
Even killing him

85
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,023
The stop the dissemination of this information

86
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,375
That stuff would be very trackable under apart

87
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
In Central Park

88
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
Safest place

89
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
Absolutely like in the movies

90
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
His narrative

91
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
First of all Seymour Hersh

92
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,919
The last statement that he gave was that

93
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
He talked to

94
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
The gentleman

95
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Who

96
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
God is good

97
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Twisted web

98
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,623
So there was a republican fundraiser that donors

99
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
The big donor

100
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,719
Who had hired Rod Weaver the private detective

101
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
I am

102
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
Got the family too

103
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,631
To sign off on its efforts family.

104
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,703
And Wheeler is suing Fox News

105
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
For taking his words out of context and attributing quotes

106
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Court

107
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
Big Joe

108
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Is also the one

109
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
Apparently recorded Seymour

110
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
I'm sure he doesn't have a vested interest

111
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
Austin either direction

112
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,599
Coronavirus

113
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
About

114
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903
Getting the truth out

115
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,975
Yes and then beyond that Seymour Hersh

116
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
Has said

117
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
The only comment that he's made

118
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,607
About the entire situation

119
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
Is that all he's heard as rumors

120
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
The donor guy whose name

121
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Always slips my mind

122
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
I feel

123
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,871
But I actually

124
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
Just

125
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,967
I think the quote was either too into and put them together

126
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
I made his own

127
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Okay

128
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Seymour

129
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,951
Confirm that that was his voice and those were his recording he has not made a comment about the actual

130
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:27,839
Okay for him to make that comment

131
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:34,239
Deep caught what I mean if you do a voice comparison apparently it's pretty similar I don't know if I can scientifically say that

132
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,287
Yeah it's believable

133
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Him

134
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
But it is a real problem that he's

135
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Piano

136
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Making

137
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
The statements with Oliver's burgers

138
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,783
And then on this tape you saying

139
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
Something

140
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
Yeah absolutely

141
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
I mean the idea that Seymour Hersh somebody's

142
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Who does have a

143
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,887
A real track record in journalism

144
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Am I supposed to

145
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
You know all the people that we deal

146
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
The idea of him

147
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Given credence

148
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
To this

149
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Is it you know the Seth rich

150
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Conspiracy

151
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Huge deal

152
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
So if he isn't

153
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
Commenting on whether or not

154
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
It's his voice

155
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
And the audio comparison says it

156
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
It's him

157
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,111
I think he's probably the guy did it

158
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,159
Yeah yeah

159
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
Well

160
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
I mean kill Seth Rich that's what he

161
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Yeah

162
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
What are you talkin about

163
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
Killed Seth rich

164
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
That's

165
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:48,991
A couple of Pulitzer prizes historically respected journalist

166
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
He's also a guy

167
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Believe

168
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
Nonsense stories

169
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
From Anonymous sources

170
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
Repeatedly throughout his career

171
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
Okay there is a lot of criticism

172
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
You can find a people were like

173
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
This is absurd this is absolutely absurd

174
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
He is believing

175
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
Just telling him shed

176
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703
Laika

177
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
He's even said

178
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
Journalistic

179
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,383
He keeps himself to feed his writing and I don't like that

180
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
So if he gives a speech

181
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,247
He doesn't have to hold himself to the standards that he has to hold to write it

182
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
So he said quote

183
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,599
Sometimes I change events dates and places

184
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
I can't fudge what I write but I can

185
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
Certainly fudge what I say

186
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Traveling

187
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,655
Yeah when I publish things but I will lie all the time if I'm talking

188
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:44,287
Another was also a really high-profile things

189
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
Forget

190
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
You know maybe I

191
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,943
Mistranslated them he said fudge

192
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Lie

193
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,599
Is there is a pretty high-profile in

194
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
Incident of him

195
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Claiming

196
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
The

197
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
Abu ghraib prison

198
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,047
Soldiers were raping little boys

199
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
To terrorize

200
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Terrorized

201
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Detainees

202
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751
The soundtrack of the screams would play

203
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:20,639
Americans are raping little boys

204
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,247
Wow it turns out that when he was pressed on that

205
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
He

206
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
Pretty much

207
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
Back down to saying

208
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Look

209
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
Contractor

210
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
Might have

211
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
Rape the young boy

212
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
If someone might have taken a picture

213
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:42,399
Is there a difference between these two stories I don't know what like

214
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,287
Are they've done all the

215
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:52,639
You can do I'm not talking about what's true and what's not I'm talking about

216
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:57,247
Is mate what claims are made and then what explanations are given when asked

217
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
About those claims

218
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,879
Does have a good track record with like the My Lai massacre

219
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
Other things

220
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,999
He does also have a problematic history of embellishing

221
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
Admitting he embellishes

222
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:14,655
And believing Anonymous sources that are probably lying to him or unreliable

223
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
That has happened a bun

224
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
So I don't I can't take

225
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,543
Seymour horses were totally at face value

226
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
From this anonymous

227
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,687
Source clip is published on Cassandra Fairbanks as website

228
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,295
So it also has like a Providence problem

229
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
Ascending upcoming

230
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415
Yasso Alex Jones is screaming about this for most of the day

231
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
But I don't want to listen to that

232
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Cuz it's not

233
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,863
So I have this clip instead for you

234
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,959
He's still a little mad about John Oliver he's in the middle of a plug

235
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
Here's what

236
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
With just water

237
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Okay

238
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
With milk

239
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,759
Tell me it doesn't

240
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Filling

241
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,743
Ashley

242
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,815
Whipping

243
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,655
Yogurt ice cream or something

244
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
I think I'm going to

245
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:28,383
Absolutely

246
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
From

247
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:39,135
Wendy's if you're getting a frosty you're going to get it from someplace like Wendy from Wendy's

248
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183
Big Mac replaced with like

249
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,791
McDonald's from a place that's like Wendy's

250
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,119
Dairy Queen

251
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,519
I used to work there when I was 15

252
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,479
That's him skirting the line of safe as a weight loss product

253
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
It tastes so bad you never want to eat

254
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
Translating ho

255
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
You still it

256
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
Still just in his craw

257
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,095
The John Oliver insinuated that one of his products taste bad

258
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
Used his own reaction as

259
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
Furious about

260
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,079
I buy that would be shocked if you just moved on for

261
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
To him this is an affront

262
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
To his business

263
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,271
And this is a reason that people might not buy

264
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
Which is the only thing he cannot abide

265
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,487
So that's most of the substance

266
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Of the second

267
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,351
Is taken up with the the Seth rich

268
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Narrative

269
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,703
I want to be fully f****** clear about this

270
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,519
Infowars as an institution

271
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
Credibility

272
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,895
But they should have lost their credibility

273
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
Visa Visa

274
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:12,319
What they tried to pull that stunt where Jerome corsi might get murdered this week

275
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
That's right how quickly forget

276
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,719
Did they pretended the Jerome corsi was going to get murdered

277
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,511
Is Jerome corsi still alive

278
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,327
Just on the other day

279
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,655
Jerome corsi alive

280
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
This is Friday

281
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:34,591
If by Monday we don't know whether or not he's alive I think we know what happened another weekend

282
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
Bulshit

283
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,319
I got got a lot of gotta keep eyes on that hearse for the ghost of Seth rich

284
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:49,183
I will buy absolutely August 3rd

285
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,535
Is Seth riches bones

286
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
Weight loss

287
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
So

288
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,239
Surprisingly much to my surprise

289
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,359
He actually dropped the second

290
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,711
Because on the 3rd it came out to that infowarrior got fired

291
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,063
So that was the story where

292
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:22,463
Oh yeah that's right brother got fired from the National Security

293
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,047
Good Department

294
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,631
A paper that had to do with how the globalists were trying

295
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
To team up

296
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
With the islamist

297
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,799
So that overrun the country

298
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
You get out cuz you are crazy

299
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
Of course

300
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
Alex

301
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
HR McMaster

302
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
Is a f****** globulus

303
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
To keep our people out

304
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,415
And of course good as we all should

305
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,535
Party everyday I don't want to get a peanut buster parfait

306
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,607
Place like it

307
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
The thing that I think of

308
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Super fascinating

309
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
When is

310
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
If Alex

311
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
Himself believe

312
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
Was murdered by the DNC

313
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
His narrative

314
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Lychee

315
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
He wouldn't

316
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Talkin about

317
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:23,135
He makes a big deal out of days we can come back to it a week down the road two weeks down the road or whatever

318
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
Bored

319
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:30,303
Going down that road

320
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,679
The push too far you start to realize oh my God

321
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
Is other Russian alive propaganda store putting out this

322
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Information

323
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
Is really fascinating I think you're going to love this

324
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Is that

325
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
Alex's Menken

326
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Complained

327
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
Is that

328
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Circle Trump

329
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,415
They're trying to cut off all communication

330
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
With him

331
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,511
From people who aren't approved by HR McMaster

332
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,607
General Kelly and the third one I don't know

333
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Bad dog

334
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Matter

335
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
Is triangle of generals and hey

336
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
I'm with you

337
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
I don't want generals all over the place

338
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
That they're used

339
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
I don't want a military coup

340
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
Alex doesn't either

341
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
But we have very different views on it

342
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Cuz he think

343
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
The globalist

344
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
Are using these generals

345
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,511
How to get Trump out in a military coup

346
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,559
Rational Minds

347
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,983
He don't like he appointed all those generals this on purpose

348
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:48,383
Or maybe they will just maybe he's or Fraser Trump is a moron

349
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,783
Tell him what they want him to do and he'll do it have an effective too

350
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
The cabinet is all people

351
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
It's f****** dr. Strangelove

352
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
To some extent

353
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
So Alex believes

354
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,351
That

355
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
The Trump is becoming

356
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,935
Incredibly isolated from outside information

357
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
Sources

358
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
To say that I think is

359
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Fascinating cuz it

360
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
It belies that something

361
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
He's based his entire

362
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
Position on Trump

363
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Complete lie

364
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
And he knows it

365
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,743
Social Security

366
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
There's nobody in the state

367
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,519
Globalist

368
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
Al Gore

369
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,175
And of course George Soros

370
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,063
We're getting rid of using Muslims to do it

371
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,623
He is taking everything out of context

372
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
These people are not saying

373
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
But that's what they're doing

374
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,279
It's not Beyond I want you to

375
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
Keep track of

376
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
Soros

377
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Has been a globalist

378
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
Forever

379
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,359
And everything that has been doing is a been on record

380
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
It's not like

381
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
Last week he did something real globalist

382
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
Or something like that

383
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
Send the past that's important to remember his arrest

384
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,951
What goes on in Alex's lying about

385
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
Admitting the plan

386
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
And I don't want that thing giving out the government

387
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
But they've already admitted it

388
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,639
Pumpkin pops the president recently

389
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
Frozen Tupac tournament

390
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,527
I mean our long conversations

391
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
He's basically winking

392
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,855
A lot of this

393
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,159
Other isolated more and more

394
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,287
So beyond it being kind of alarming pinhole into the world is Sean Hannity

395
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,895
The only way he gets a window into the outside world

396
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
Is through Sean

397
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
Goddamn

398
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,039
Beyond doubt is that

399
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:40,415
He's talking about what this guy was writing in these reports about all this

400
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
Yeah I was just stuff

401
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
The president

402
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
That's Tuff

403
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:53,983
Which flies in the face of this clip

404
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,287
From January 19th this year

405
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527
He was on the whole communist

406
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,927
By the Congressional

407
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
Information

408
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,215
Show me want to stand exactly why Trump has been

409
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
A patriot Sleeper Cell

410
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,311
People

411
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
Went along with the system like the left

412
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Festive.

413
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
And it turns out

414
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:45,439
But he doesn't know who Peter Sutherland is or what his plan dating back to that always known about all of this

415
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
Since the 60s

416
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
What the f*** is wrong with you

417
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,327
What the f*** where is that what are you making

418
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,631
Of course

419
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,655
Of course

420
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
F****** course

421
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:02,335
Do you know them know about this cuz he needs this guy in the National Security committee to write papers for

422
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,151
Keep him abreast

423
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,479
He's a play Prince Ali but doing it's as easy but it's all this

424
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,551
We've got a patriot

425
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,087
That's what he doing

426
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
Cuz Trump

427
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
Cuz Trump

428
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,720
May have early onset dementia

429
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,792
I think that's what's going on

430
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
Exactly

431
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,752
Deep Cover guy doesn't

432
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
The digital drop

433
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
So

434
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
As it relates

435
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,384
To Trump being a secret

436
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
Anti globalist

437
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
Who's at the door

438
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,808
Lovelace

439
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:48,928
I forgot how to do it

440
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,976
You're busted Alex

441
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:56,352
We go on a little bit on August 3rd do you want to talk more specifically about

442
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,424
McMaster

443
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Matt

444
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,360
So you he's going to eat he says this

445
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,944
Look you can be a fighter pilot

446
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
You can be Maverick

447
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
The Iceman

448
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
You shouldn't be running

449
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:20,672
Country is much more competent and

450
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Sensible

451
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,512
But a lot of

452
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,912
But anyway Alex has a different complaint about them

453
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
And that you make

454
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,104
Bigger than you guys were Saudi deal or some five million dollar your defense contract

455
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,200
Go play golfing with your big fancy house

456
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,720
With a billion and a half Muslims and really sell us out to him what's going on

457
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048

458
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,400

You must join with prosperity you must join with Christianity you must join with common sense

462

Which ones

464
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:33,120
Confederate 100 traditional military

465
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
Honorable

Call Papa

467
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:47,712
The genetic family bloodline

468
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,112
Image big multi-dimensional complex system

469
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,704
Wants to destroy the West

470
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,104
It wants wants to enslave everything you do not.

471
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,296
Prevents

472
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,416
Do you think he knows what he saying

473
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
Basically

474
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,168
Liberty of keeping black people away from Eddie right

475
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:51,456
It's like that's what he's unbelievable

476
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
He's a f******

477
00:24:54,528 --> 00:25:00,672
Absolutely no other explanation beyond the dog whistle

478
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:07,328
Harsh oh yeah

479
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,400
Coward families or something like that

480
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:14,240
You your family fought for the Confederacy dickweed

481
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
You f****** prick

482
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
Call

483
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,408
It means only one

484
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
Explicitly

485
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm used to amuse

486
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
Obviously

487
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:40,864
But this is f****** this is a Step Beyond this is unbelievable whenever you get into like

488
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,912
This is profoundly eugenics

489
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
Even

490
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Want to go back to the

491
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
The beginning of the clip

492
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
Were you saying like

493
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
You have to come

494
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
With us

495
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
You could join with us

496
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,920
You're the join with prosperity

497
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,480
Get the join with Christianity

498
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
So it's like

499
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,696
Rhetoric

500
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
A hundred percent

501
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
Yeah

502
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792

And Alex Jones

504
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
We'll just piggyback

505
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,752
What's your start throwing it will have a listen to start

506
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,800
Crossing things out as what is ice

507
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
Ascend at this point

508
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,992
This isn't even as bad as ice

509
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:33,088
Smell of Alex

510
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,184

511
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,768

00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
Going to get boring a little bit towards

515
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,216
Middle of this clip

516
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,008
But it's worth it just to hang with it

517
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Fans

518
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
I've not edited this

519
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,896
At all this is exactly what happened

520
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:01,760
At the end of that clip we just listened to where he screamed about good families

521
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,576
And you have to come with God

522
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,880

00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,192
In its entirety because I think it's fun every now and again

532
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
Take a nice

533
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,520
Look at his literal like how he does

00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:02,176
Who's John Oliver did a good job of covering a lot of the sale stuff actually play like a full commercial

535
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
And I want to point out a couple things

536
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
This is the beginning of our

537
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344

Dora Halloween that I want to make everything is always

542
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,752

543
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,080
Free shipping specials

544
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,384

545
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
Show me

546
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:40,832

548
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,560

00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
Percent off

550
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,032
That 1776

551
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,688
B12 synthetic garbage under the tongue highest-quality

552
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
Secret 12% off

00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,024
Everything normally cost 35

554
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,424
First of all these are not that different than the sales they had

555
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,472
Before

556
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,544
Except he's made all the prices 1776

557
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,128
If you want to turn yourself into the

558
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,688

The tree of patriot blood

564
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
I think I

565
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,424
I think this really should

566
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,448
Highlight

567
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
Desperation

568
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,080
Because I don't know what kind of markup they actually

569
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Play do

570
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
Can't be much more than like

571
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,176
200%

572
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456

573
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
You think it's much higher than I do

574
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,136
Anytime you're talking about business

575
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,952
MSRP is usually 3.5

576
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,768
Okay

577
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,560

We have ended

607
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,104
Hell yeah

608
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:21,760
It says free shipping

609
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,488
We'll see how long that goes

610
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,960
I wonder if it'll continue beyond

611
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,288
Will keep you posted

612
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:48,896

00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176
Oh maybe we

614
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200

615
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
1770

616
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,784
Search for everything you're imagining there's a marketing

617
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,160
And f****** Alex Jones snorting

618
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,208
Super male Vitality crystals

619
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:09,632
Football and ideas Buckley's got the good stuff

620
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
Call U-Haul

621
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:15,264
Pulled out a little sack over a little baggie of Superman

622
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
Got to love it

623
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,432
It's supposed to be sublingual but I like to snort it like poppers

624
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
Now George

625
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,808
Yes we have to move on

626
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
To August

627
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,600
Fourth

628
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,160
Narrative

629
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,256
There's no real need to dive too deep into it

630
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,280
Reminder

631
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,840
Perspective I think General Kelly is largely

632
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
Just trying to do damage

633
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
Control

634
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,472
For now

635
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,496
Control

636
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,104
Narrative is nonsense

637
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,688
It is just a real desperate attempt

638
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
The triumph

639
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
Cover up

640
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,016
And really reinforces

641
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,296
This idea that it wasn't Russia

642
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,344
All that game is

643
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
And they're doing it

644
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
And

645
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:13,376
But everybody knows that it was like the family the the private investigator all were like

646
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
This is unrelated

647
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
This is just a murder

648
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,496
Oh yeah I'm at the Russian

649
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:25,920
Call Alex h-2b the leaker because if not

650
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,456
It exposes that

651
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,504
The the Russian tank

652
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,064
His complaints about it not being the Russian

653
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,088
Fall Apart

654
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
And the

655
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,672
Leader in the clubhouse is far as explanation

656
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,232
Is what everyone else is saying

657
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,024
I bet it is

658
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,096
Beyond the fact that Julian Bond

659
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,888
Has been playing into

660
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,192
The idea that it was Seth rich

661
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
Who was he

662
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
Assange is gone

663
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
If this

664
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,152
To fall like I said

665
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,944
Episode

666
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Julian Assange

667
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,992
Is ink

668
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
Incredibly

669
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
Vulnerable

670
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
He's very

671
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
Exposed

672
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,952
But I mean he's exposed in terms of like

673
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
The geopolitical game

674
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:18,912
Corollary, gyro is Chelsea

675
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,800
And he'd be nothing without her and

676
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,712
All the triangles

677
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,784
No I mean the graders

678
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,904
Spear of the import of Liquors

679
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,720
Snowden did and the ensuing conversation

680
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,000
Turn led to a lot of

681
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
Pro Julian Assange Center

682
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:51,680
Not necessarily that they had anything to do with each other

683
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Not Snowden

684
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,432
Stonehenge

685
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,784
Episode

686
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,136
You may remember that I made some

687
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
Claims

688
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
Or some assertions

689
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
Speculation

690
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
Things about Alex Jones

691
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
Having a

692
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,304
Pro-russia stamp

693
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,864
That might be more important to him

694
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
The new Pro Trump

695
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,264
Yeah responded with a lot of skepticism

696
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
Your arguments are

697
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Hard to argue

698
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:33,664
Guy who gets really nervous

699
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,760
Whenever I make a claim that might sound stupid

700
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
I'm sofa

701
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
For the better part of the day

702
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
I was feeling like s***

703
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,352
That didn't help know everything

704
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,424
Amaya f****** dumb dumb am I an idiot

705
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,264
Listening to Friday's show

706
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
I Came Upon something

707
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,824
That made me think

708
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,872
That maybe I was more right than I did

709
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
Then even you had

710
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
Yes

711
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
For the rest of the episode

712
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
First hour of the shows boring

713
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
I discussed it all I don't even think I took

714
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
Notes on it I was just

715
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,512
He's just yelling about stuff

716
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:25,376
I think it's more just McMaster is trying to isolate Trump

717
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:29,472
They're going to kill him I think there's some of that

718
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,240
You've got to get him

719
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,080
They're isolating him in order to prepare the public

720
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,968
Emily's also

721
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,040
Assassination bus probably not

722
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:48,160
Whatever second-guessing himself to positive

723
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,440
Bro

724
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,976
He wouldn't if he had

725
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,768
Actual sources

726
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,352
I'm sure Donald Trump jr.

727
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
It's going like

728
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,824
Pictures of very smart

729
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:10,688
McMaster is a genius not troubling approved

730
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,016
Well I mean unfortunate for us cuz if Donald Trump

731
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,808
Junior size Dad we would get

732
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,880
More Wackadoo bulshit from every angle

733
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,928
Block me

734
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,024
The second hour starts up

735
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,584
Tower of

736
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
August

737
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
Fourth start

738
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,424
This is what I hear

739
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
And

740
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
Perked up

741
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,568
Ears ears raise hackles up heart rate starts

742
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
Glutton

743
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
A little bit

744
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,896
And I start to realize

745
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
We've got a name

746
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:48,832
Alexander Dugan advisor is coming up

747
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,624
Not good

748
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
No not going to Subway

749
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,768
Wait we're doing Duggan's coming on info

750
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
Dugan

751
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
He does

752
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
Jewelry a myth

753
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:08,800
Chances are Russian collusion situation of Alex has the balls to have him on

754
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
Wow

755
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:13,920
I want to say that Alexander Dugan

756
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,200
Is

757
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
Tea as an advisor

758
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:22,368
We're getting into a lot of the details

759
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,160
Of why it's really problematic

760
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,696
Yeah that he is on

761
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
Infowars

762
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
.

763
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
Alex Jones

764
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Is platforming

765
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
To speak his

766
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
Bulshit

767
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
Over American Airways

768
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,728
Encourages Alex Jones doesn't have the fear of sponsors or anything like that

769
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,264
He can do whatever he wants

770
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,312
Good on you it's free speech

771
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,384
But him

772
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,688
Choosing to is very

773
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,736
Very seriously a problem

774
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,296
The last time he was on.

775
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,088
Free shipping

776
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,928
The last time Dugan was on I swept it under the rug

777
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,512
Because there was that whole after Trump got elected

778
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
Dugan came out in

779
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,584
NSAID

780
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,400
Alex Jones is the greatest

781
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,936
Example of an American

782
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:11,776
He is a great human because of him we don't hate America anymore

783
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,568
All this b*******

784
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,104
Blowing smoke up his ass

785
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
But he said he wasn't

786
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,920
Alex

787
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,504
Alex had him on his show

788
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Made sense

789
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,808
Is just sort of like

790
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
You suck my dick

791
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
Again is

792
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
Led me to think

793
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Especially

794
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,536
Now

795
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,840
Wouldn't you want

796
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,912
From that is possible

797
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,192
If your argument

798
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,496
Is there's no possibility of Russia

799
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,312
Conclusion

800
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,848
Why would you have one of

801
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,640
Advisors come on your

802
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
Show

803
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,224
It's it's incredibly weird I don't know

804
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
I don't know

805
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,808
Stitches effect

806
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,624
Is there suggest that you are involved with the

807
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Totally

808
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
Yeah

809
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,208
Big time

810
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,744
What did you get in

811
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
Email like hey

812
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
Somebody got it that the records

813
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,632
It is not true

814
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
And then we'll leave it

815
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
Look

816
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
It's baffling to me

817
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,312
Are over the course of the rest of us episode

818
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,360
I hope to layout

819
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
How much of

820
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
A problem this

821
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,296
And in order to do so I don't know if I should just get into Dugan up top or if we should let him

822
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,832
Talk and then get into it

823
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
What what do you think

824
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,672
What is the best gyros

825
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,696
We got to let him say his piece

826
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,744
Okay we got to let him say his piece

827
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,536
Here's the first clip

828
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,840
Globalist

829
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
State Russia

830
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
Geopolitical. Argue

831
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:45,728
Do you got the for my friend.

832
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
What their names are

833
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,824
Why they hate the United States and Russia so much

834
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,951
PlayStation will detect

835
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,487
Willow

836
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,767
That is not as realize

837
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,607
Is Russian accent

838
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:18,751
I want to broadcast in the United States

839
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,823
Is because on the 11th of March in 2015

840
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,431
The United States Department of the treasury as well as his organization

841
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,223
Just called the Eurasian Union

842
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
Do it the list of Russian citizens were section

843
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
As a result

844
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,855
Involvement in the Ukraine

845
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,695
Exactly what his involvement was

846
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,743
A little bit later

847
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
Yeah

848
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
No cancel

849
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,399
He's not paying him to be there

850
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:52,287
It's the Department of Treasury I don't think you can be safe I don't I don't

851
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:58,687
That's true no other like media organization with

852
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,967
Never going to

853
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,295
I'm not entirely sure but they certainly wouldn't allow him cloth

854
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,575
Just to say whatever you want

855
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,879
There would be like an interview

856
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
Cuz I know that he's done

857
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,695
Johnson interviews like the BBC

858
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,719
And stuff like that

859
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:15,327
Where are they

860
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,375
Push back again

861
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,215
Empties ideas

862
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,495
Has its own unique truth

863
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
Because

864
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,615
Because every truth is really relative and subjective

865
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,991
Capital T truth

866
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,807
And then they started to get into while like

867
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
Between Russia

868
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,791
But I was just in the United States

869
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
Seems that way

870
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,399
Seems well

871
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:56,543
You Are My People

872
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,591
F***** up stuff

873
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,407
Cuz that would work there we go

874
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,199
Great Cheese's

875
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,271
Part of his big philosophy is the destruction of the world

876
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,671
Exactly

877
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
The same thing as Jesus

878
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,583
There's a shocking amount of overlap

879
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:25,983
So let's not let him get into it after his kissing ass of Alex for ignoring

880
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
Here we go

881
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,871
Your station

882
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,599
202

883
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:54,655
Right

884
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,503
Michelin

885
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,871
Usher

886
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,687
So

887
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,247
Dugan dentist

888
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:47,903
Yeah you can absolutely smart guy

889
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
With satanic

890
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:53,023
He's going there dealing with The Wrong Enemy Russia

891
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,863
As a

892
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:03,263
F****** phone is also gilding on to add

893
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:09,919
Doesn't talk about any of the other much more problem

894
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,943
Because he is

895
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
Tricking Alex

896
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,759
He's incredibly smart

897
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,807
Alexander Dugan is a philosopher

898
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,855
Social science

899
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,159
And Alex being played like a

900
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,183
F****** Jeep

901
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,463
Violin

902
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
This is so easy

903
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,279
It's like

904
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,815
It's like

905
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
He's reading off

906
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
Script

907
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,143
Is pathetic

908
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,751
Is Alice Vale four-door is Alex just

909
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:39,871
Alex gets flattered

910
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,151
I'm hard-pressed

911
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:44,479
To say that Alex is falling for it as much as he is on board

912
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
A hundred percent

913
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:56,511
Absolutely insanely hateful

914
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,887
He's been cutting back the corruption

915
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:08,287
Wow powering programmes for the family has been promoting Christianity

916
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,639
He's been exposing through National shows

917
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,735
Technology being used enslaved people

918
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:21,087
The wicked

919
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Human

920
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,791
But this isn't something he got from Putin

921
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,887
At what we face

922
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:39,007
I wanted to stop at there cuz he's a really horrible about women

923
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,567
I wanted to give us a chance

924
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,895
2:30 compress on that part of it before we get to the

925
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,175
Part that's just ugly

926
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,735
So what

927
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
Of Putin

928
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
Magical

929
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,367
It's magical nonsense

930
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,695
Analysis

931
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,743
The Putin

932
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,583
2 Russian TVs exactly like propaganda Outlets

933
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
Yeah

934
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,935
Glorious leader

935
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:13,567
Absolutely

936
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:16,127
A little bit of tyranny is a good thing

937
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:21,759
Absolutely

938
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,063
Especially with dictators

939
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,343
You know how they're always

940
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,391
Proceed with restraint

941
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,463
You know how they're always like

942
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,511
Let's not go too far

943
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:38,911
We're going to do we're going to get it we're going to get out we're going to save the world

944
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,239
Are you living in a dictatorship

945
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,847
Are they restrained in their action that's a dictator right there

946
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:50,687
At least

947
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,783
Is just lionizing

948
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,855
Like anything he's done a ton of research

949
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
Persian

950
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
8

951
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
That's not

952
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,487
That's absolute nonsense

953
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,095
He's getting on his show and

954
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,631
Being a Russian propaganda

955
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,935
Yeah that's true he's putting on the Hat

956
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,983
So we can hang out with Alexandra Dugan

957
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
They are fun

958
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:22,175
Comforters

959
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,759
Tezos earflaps

960
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,551
In August

961
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
Nice massage

962
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,703
They're also obsessed with him I mean

963
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:48,287
Weather in Westlake

964
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:58,271
I want

965
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
What the f***

966
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,855
Megyn Kelly

967
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,159
But make it clear

968
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,231
Alexander Dugan for all of his problems

969
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,023
And being an awful person

970
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
Out-and-out

971
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,351
Russian

972
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:16,191
Probably doesn't think that Megyn Kelly wants to f***

973
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,983
He is still asleep

974
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,519
Substantial individual

975
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,383
What is Megyn Kelly

976
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,919
Like that's disgraceful

977
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:31,807
I would like

978
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,927
Listen you're talking one to one of the true monsters in this world

979
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,207
Dial it back

980
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:44,607
He's at least give him the respect that a true monster desert he's created like philosophies that have created a lot

981
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:48,959
Water damage in the world

982
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,495
Don't don't do that

983
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:56,639
At least have it like it's clear that Alex is not read his book it clear he doesn't know what he's saying

984
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,711
Because if you did

985
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,271
Is very big into the destruction of the United

986
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,831
Not a good guy to have on your

987
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
Patriot base

988
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:06,879
Yes

989
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,415
One of the most

990
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:11,743
Explicit things he's argued for in the course of his career

991
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,511
Has been

992
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,535
The destruction of the United

993
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,583
The destruction of

994
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
Hegemony

995
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:20,703
Well yes and really is just

996
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,495
The freedom

997
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:29,407
Individuality deeply against the idea of individuality

998
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,455
Yeah because individuality

999
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
Takes you outside of the

1000
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
The collective

1001
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,319
I takes you outside of normality

1002
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,599
And it makes you

1003
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:40,927
I accept things like homosexuality

1004
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:44,255
He's right up in that like culture wash it

1005
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,303
That a lot of the conservatives are now

1006
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,351
It's deeply troubling

1007
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,631
2cv overlap

1008
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,959
Nobody is more ideologically aligned

1009
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,711
People in France

1010
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:07,551
And hateful heart rate brackets in

1011
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,855
Britain like all of these people

1012
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,159
Don't realize that they're on the same side

1013
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,719
Like the only thing that's protecting us

1014
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,535
Is all of these idiots thinking that they're fighting against

1015
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,607
Cuz if they actually United

1016
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,911
Like like brexit like

1017
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,215
Cambridge analytica

1018
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,263
They really did push all of these

1019
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,799
These people together on the Nash

1020
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,847
And that is

1021
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,871
A very bad

1022
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
Like

1023
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,967
It's like the f******

1024
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:43,135
It's like the old Batman and Superman

1025
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,463
But these people are insane

1026
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:52,095
But also if you'll recall that last clip

1027
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:52,863
Ended with a question

1028
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,679
Why does Megyn Kelly get to

1029
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,983
Hard yeah

1030
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
Dugan a bit of credit

1031
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,543
What's this

1032
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
He does not

1033
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,687
Engage with that partial pressure spiritual

1034
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:18,975
Porter

1035
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,311
Defender Defender exactly

1036
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:46,367
Obstacle

1037
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:55,071
Dream to be installed on the planetary level

1038
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:11,711
Technocracy

1039
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,527
American Russian collusion is

1040
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,575
It's the same spirit

1041
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,071
Alex

1042
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
Does Alex

1043
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
Realized

1044
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,727
Is the last defense against

1045
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
Christian tiger

1046
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,519
Yep

1047
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,567
I think he doesn't know that

1048
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
I think

1049
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
Cuz that's what he's

1050
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,895
I've been saying for years

1051
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,479
He's the lad but he's the only defense against the f******

1052
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:48,575
Antichrist in 2015 he was saying

1053
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:52,159
That was the only person who is standing

1054
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,695
Against the New World Order

1055
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,231
Against the globalist

1056
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,023
On the world

1057
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:02,655
Before he supported Donald Trump at all believe globalist

1058
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,263
Transitional to bringing in a one world government lead

1059
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,543
By the Antichrist

1060
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:14,175
Of course he agree

1061
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,479
Putin is what's going to save us

1062
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
From

1063
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,527
Hell on Earth

1064
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,831
Ran the ascent of the evil one

1065
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,135
I'm just that we were talking

1066
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,159
More about

1067
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:29,023
We were talking more metaphorically about you would have believed he would help

1068
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:32,351
He goes directly into Christian orthodox

1069
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,191
Greek Orthodox beliefs

1070
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:39,519
That he is the defender

1071
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,823
I did not expect Alex to be like

1072
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,639
Throw out all the Christian should I be

1073
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,663
Pretend to believe

1074
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,783
F****** is the only one keeping the 7th

1075
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,063
Steal from being open

1076
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,087
Yeah

1077
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:59,743
F****** unbelievably might be getting a glimpse into what Alex Jones is actual version of Christianity

1078
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,791
Because words

1079
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,215
Understand Christian

1080
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,263
It may not be the key

1081
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:16,639
It may be that there are some similarities.

1082
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,711
Greek Orthodox people in my day

1083
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:23,039
My dad's a religious studies professor at newsom's orthodox

1084
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,831
When I was a kid

1085
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,367
I don't think

1086
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,207
I believe all this

1087
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,487
Wacky nonsense

1088
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,023
But be that as it may

1089
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,095
You're seeing like this

1090
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
Between the two of them

1091
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,287
Alexander gifted manipulator

1092
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,823
She knows what

1093
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,359
Sort of things to say

1094
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,919
To make Alex Jones be like I'm on board

1095
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,455
But then at the same time

1096
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,527
Documented this over and over again with Leo zagami

1097
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,807
Lord monckton

1098
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,855
And now Alexandra Dugan

1099
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,903
Anybody with an accent Alex

1100
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
This is like yours

1101
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,791
Alexander Dugan

1102
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,815
Incredibly smart

1103
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:10,143
Therefore far more dangerous

1104
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:18,591
The entire internet should be banned

1105
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,919
I think that the internet as

1106
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:25,759
As a phenomenon is worth prohibiting because it gives nobody anything good

1107
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,039
Beyond

1108
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:31,903
In June 2012

1109
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:36,511
An orthodox Russian around the president of Russian Federation

1110
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,559
In the last battle between good and evil

1111
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,375
Following the example of Iran and North Korea

1112
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:45,215
He added quote if we want to liberate ourselves from the

1113
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,103
It is that we liberate ourselves from textbooks on physics and chemistry

1114
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
Totaltrack

1115
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,943
In Zaire

1116
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:57,247
If we want to liberate ourselves from the West

1117
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,039
Alex has a boner for the West

1118
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:03,647
He's saying that we should follow in the example of Iran and North Korea

1119
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,183
A12

1120
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
REI

1121
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,023
I will give it to Alex

1122
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,047
Never ever

1123
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
It's life red.

1124
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,119
I don't

1125
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,655
Not even one

1126
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,983
It takes a Google search

1127
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,287
Which is

1128
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,055
Never read it

1129
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,335
It takes more than once.

1130
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:27,967
So now I want Google search to remember what it is he's looking for

1131
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,271
Which is his next guest with

1132
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,343
Click on

1133
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,903
One of many results which is just too many

1134
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:39,487
Yeah so I want to I want to say

1135
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,255
That

1136
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,863
Earlier that Alexander

1137
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,143
By the department of

1138
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:46,911
The treasury

1139
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,447
Because of his eyes

1140
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,471
Activities

1141
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,751
In the Ukraine

1142
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,519
Crisis

1143
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,823
I want to touch on that for a second

1144
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,127
Cuz I feel like weed

1145
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,151
Should be specific

1146
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,199
People know what he's been up to

1147

I love it I love it when people add in you do your raisin used

1150
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,863
Hitler use like all these programs are really good programs

1151
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,679
Organization that has a youth component

1152
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,007
Children do not understand politics

1153
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,591
They should not be indoctrinated

1154
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,127
But be that as it may

1155
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,407
On March 31st

1156
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,199
2014

1157
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:35,807
March 31st 2014

1158
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,831
Bahia

1159
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:41,695
A member of the Eurasian youth Union of Russia founded by Alexander was arrested

1160
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,999
Did the group of about 200 people to

1161
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,791
Cease Parliament another government building

1162
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,607
According to the Secret Service of Ukraine

1163
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,679
He was basically training paramilitary groups

1164
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
To go College

1165
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,495
Trouble in Ukraine

1166
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,519
It is on

1167
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,799
Clear how many of the

1168
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
Attack

1169
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,103
And

1170
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,127
Bombings

1171
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,735
Result of that impossible to tell

1172
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:11,135
There were going to seize the Ukrainian

1173
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,207
So it is not low scale stuff

1174
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,047
But you know

1175
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,607
24 more than 200

1176
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,399
Parliament I don't know

1177
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:29,823
Situation there's there's ongoing Strife all around 200 people are well-armed

1178
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,639
You could do

1179
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,431
You can do some damage

1180
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,479
EXO

1181
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,527
You see

1182
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,063
Benign

1183
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,111
He's training

1184
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:46,463
And I'm not around personally training time

1185
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,767
Reggie created this organization

1186
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:54,655
He's responsible for that troopers from Star Wars

1187
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,679
Showed up

1188
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
McLaren

1189
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,103
Belief

1190
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:07,967
The right side of history on that one

1191
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
I got

1192
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,527
So

1193
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,599
Like that was just sort of a flip

1194
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:18,207
Here is Alexander

1195
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,231
That

1196
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:19,999
Stop antique

1197
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:26,655
Sharks score

1198
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:33,055
Superficial interest

1199
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:45,599
Because wow

1200
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:57,887
Yes exactly

1201
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:07,615
Spotify

1202
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:16,319
So this is also the probably based on the uranium

1203
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,343
Bulshit

1204
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,159
Did Hillary

1205
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,695
Beyond

1206
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,487
You can't really find a whole lot of

1207
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
Concrete

1208
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,535
Examples of people being

1209
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:28,095
Pacific about

1210
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,119
Supporting Hillary

1211
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,911
Alex

1212
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,727
On the episode

1213
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,031
He plays an interview with Julian Assange

1214
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,847
Where Julian Assange

1215
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,639
And for my end

1216
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,407
All like

1217
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,455
Can tell is that Hillary had contact with Russia

1218
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,503
Ed Financial

1219
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,295
The uranium one deal

1220
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,831
Which was not with the Russian

1221
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,391
That was with a canadian-based company

1222
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,951
Russian

1223
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,511
Those words are uranium right

1224
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,559
She didn't make the decision it was the

1225
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Gibbous

1226
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,399
Organization

1227
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,679
Had no involvement

1228
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,959
Always been over this

1229
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,727
A whole bunch

1230
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,519
Evangeline song

1231
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,567
The only other piece of evidence

1232
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,847
Is

1233
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:15,199
Podesta

1234
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,319
It's crazy

1235
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:29,279
Russian uranium deal

1236
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:34,655
Yeah that doesn't mean nothing and the Alexander

1237
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,191
About how you heard

1238
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:38,751
They were supporting Hillary

1239
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,799
You got to kind of believe it's something like that

1240
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:52,319
He's good he's throwing in that camp that idea of getting rid of physics and chemistry

1241
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,343
Rid of the internet

1242
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,159
He doesn't mean that what you means is getting rid of it

1243
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,695
Yeah

1244
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,231
Mickey and his cabal

1245
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
Keep it

1246
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,047
But that's what he's doing

1247
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,327
Can lie straight

1248
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:07,167
Hey dumb dumb you're on the internet now

1249
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:14,847
You couldn't you couldn't get your propaganda to the United States without the internet

1250
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,615
Effectively

1251
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:21,247
Not in this day and age no one read smartphone

1252
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:24,319
Umbrella

1253
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,111
Shoots and they made it all the way.

1254
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:32,767
What

1255
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:37,631
American soil hold on

1256
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,935
Did they launch them from the ground

1257
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,959
Like they just tossed

1258
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:47,359
With an umbrella cuz that's crazy

1259
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,271
Okay

1260
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,575
Join another fun fact about Alexander

1261
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,927
In an interview with the Anna newsagents

1262
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:04,255
The Alexander Dugan describing the alleged atrocities

1263
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,047
They were perpetrated against the Ukrainian

1264
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,839
Cold for them to be killed

1265
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,423
In the 18th minute of the interview he said referring to the Ukrainian

1266
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,703
The following

1267
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,495
Kill kill kill

1268
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,287
There should be no more talk

1269
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,079
As a professor I think so

1270
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,383
He's not a good for

1271
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:24,223
No entiendo came fire force

1272
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:30,111
Usually advocated

1273
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:34,719
Especially would you like

1274
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:39,071
Yeah yeah

1275
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:45,471
Tarnish his credibility or his position in Russians

1276
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,239
It would only

1277
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:52,383
We have in place already we have

1278
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,431
He started a Youth Organization

1279
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,711
Turn based on Eurasian is

1280
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,247
In a little bit

1281
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,063
As an offshoot

1282
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,087
Situation

1283
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,111
Ukraine started

1284
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,135
2014

1285
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,439
They were

1286
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,743
For it and went around cause trouble

1287
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,303
When interviewed

1288
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,351
He advocated for the state

1289
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,399
Going in and killing granny

1290
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,215
Which is a war crime

1291
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,031
The advocates for war crimes

1292
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,639
F*** frog

1293
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,735
Livin On borrowed time

1294
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,759
What's going on

1295
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,039
This is unfair

1296
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:31,807
King real

1297
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:35,647
Holyshit

1298
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,695
Beside myself

1299
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:43,839
Yeah this is great I don't like how this is

1300
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:49,471
America at least Alex and Alexander

1301
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,263
Finished

1302
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,031
Another show

1303
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,823
Where they're going to talk about how great

1304
01:06:56,383 --> 01:07:00,479
But I know that you are kind of a spiritual advisor to Trump

1305
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,439
I just want to try to get an idea

1306
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:16,095
Also lives in Russia about the real mindset of poop

1307
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:20,191
Ethan Farmer or whatever

1308
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,495
Oligarch South

1309
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,799
Getting shot

1310
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,383
He was a child

1311
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:45,023
Birth rate backup

1312
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,071
Abortion

1313
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,863
The family

1314
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,191
Who is killing all the journalists

1315
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:58,591
Please call the Starbucks

1316
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:03,455
A specifically a spiritual advisor and can you give us a view into

1317
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,015
Vladimir Putin

1318
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:26,239
I hope not but also I lied

1319
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:29,055
They're not nearly done talked about our great food and

1320
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,359
That's that's crazy

1321
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,407
The eve

1322
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,199
He's just doing

1323
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,991
Freddie Gray

1324
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,551
I love a bumper

1325
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,599
What we should do is put together a

1326
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,159
Long clip of all the X Alec

1327
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,439
What's makes a mistake

1328
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,975
Mock him the same way he tries to

1329
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
To do Pelosi

1330
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,839
He was an advisor to Trump I mean

1331
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:55,167
Like either he's an idiot the same way he thinks she is

1332
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,191
Which means

1333
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,239
You can shut the f****** about that clip

1334
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,799
Or that's the most Freudian slip there could ever be

1335
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:07,455
Absolutely

1336
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:13,855
Do you have absolutely.

1337
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:24,095
He just wants

1338
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,143
What happens after that

1339
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,423
Maybe goes on

1340
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,215
To talk about how

1341
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,239
Putin is

1342
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,055
Indicative of the soul of the Russian people

1343
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:37,919
As much as

1344
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,711
It is a representation of

1345
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,759
People any pragmatic

1346
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,671
I don't want to become a dictator

1347
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
That's

1348
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:53,791
Just Alex Jones allowing this dude to spit

1349
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,327
F****** straight up

1350
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,887
Putin propaganda on his show

1351
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,935
He's turned his show over

1352
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
2

1353
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
Russia

1354
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,751
For an hour

1355
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,311
But there's no other way to put it

1356
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,359
Bucked up

1357
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,151
What

1358
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:12,735
I don't know what to say

1359
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,343
Of all the things

1360
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,623
I could have imagined

1361
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,415
Uncovering the

1362
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,463
Alex is

1363
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:24,767
Russian

1364
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,535
Again.

1365
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,815
Is not what I was expecting

1366
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:30,911
Like if we if it like all the stuff you know it like I talk about

1367
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,447
RNR opening

1368
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:34,495
It's like I don't know anything about Alex G

1369
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,383
At the all I knew about Alex was he was a lunatic

1370
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:43,967
Then as we gone through this the whole time it's like

1371
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:47,295
Detroit

1372
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
Is bigger

1373
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,903
Spencer's

1374
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:56,511
So I didn't know that that's what we were dealing with

1375
01:10:56,767 --> 01:11:01,375
He's a Russian on the way learning videos this weird

1376
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,447
The religious thing going on

1377
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,215
Make slime

1378
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,007
I meant getting to the Russians

1379
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:11,103
And I'll tell you this I listen to Alex Jones a B in my

1380
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:17,503
Younger years

1381
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,367
To do another investigation of

1382
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,135
When did

1383
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:25,183
Alex become a Putin shell

1384
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,719
I think we already are

1385
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,071
You think so yeah I could I think we've already gotten because

1386
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,351
When we started the

1387
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:35,679
June in June of 2015

1388
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:40,287
Over the summer of 2015

1389
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,311
Yeah they came in

1390
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,591
Trickling a little bit

1391
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:45,663
And then where we are now in September

1392
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,967
End of September beginning of October 22

1393
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,527
15 he's going Whole Hog

1394
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,807
If we were called

1395
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:52,831
Justice

1396
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,927
Call me

1397
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:57,951
In the summer of

1398
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,743
15 the Russians really ramp

1399
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:00,767
Information

1400
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,047
Influence

1401
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,607
Campaign and stuff

1402
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,631
Holyshit

1403
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,655
Yeah yeah

1404
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:09,727
Funnily coincides with

1405
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:10,751
His campaign

1406
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:14,335
It starts to become a picture where

1407
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:16,895
It dumbass

1408
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,431
Chicago we don't know anything

1409
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:23,039
Look a lot like there's something going on here

1410
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,623
I'm supposed to believe someone's investor

1411
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,159
I don't know

1412
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,719
But I have to believe that we aren't the only people who put

1413
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,767
Two two and two together

1414
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,559
It doesn't

1415
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,911
You put that together with

1416
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
With Trump

1417
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:43,007
When did the Russian start support

1418
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,055
Is maybe the best question

1419
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,079
For when Alex

1420
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,383
Supported him

1421
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:53,759
Before even started running for president as much as made

1422
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:58,623
Yeah money-laundering and what-have-you instances that have been

1423
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,647
Pointed out of

1424
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
Tears

1425
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,975
For example

1426
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,327
Russian people with weird connection

1427
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:10,655
Buying some of his property for inflated prices

1428
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,727
Never moving into the house and then selling it for Less

1429
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,287
Seems to happen a bit

1430
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:19,615
And it appears that they bailed him out of being

1431
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,151
4

1432
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,503
Beyond that

1433
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,783
There are indications

1434
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,319
Is going back at least

1435
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,087
The 90s

1436
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,623
Possibly even earlier

1437
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,647
Of him having

1438
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,415
Fro

1439
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,439
Russian

1440
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,463
Or at least

1441
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,999
Pro-russian businesses

1442
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,815
Yeah we have we have

1443
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,839
He took out an apple

1444
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,631
Right

1445
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,311
The Central Park five should be hung

1446
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,127
No that was a very different one

1447
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,431
Another quote from Alexander

1448
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:59,295
2007

1449
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:01,855
There are no more opponents of Putin

1450
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,623
Of course

1451
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:05,951
And if they are there mentally ill I need to be sent off for

1452
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,231
For clinical examination

1453
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,791
Putin is everywhere Putin is everything

1454
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,071
Putin is absolute

1455
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,351
And Putin is

1456
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,887
Play I do not like

1457
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,655
That language

1458
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,423
I don't at all

1459
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,447
That's really bad

1460
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,055
Priority of History

1461
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,847
Where is that was a

1462
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,151
Interstate about anybody know

1463
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,199
U-Save right before genocide

1464
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,087
Yeah here's another quote

1465
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,367
Here's another quote from

1466
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,671
All Is Dead with modernity

1467
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,951
So what should I do

1468
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,487
We are going to end

1469
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,607
Unabomber sketch

1470
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:50,239
He hates the idea that the world is becoming modern

1471
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:56,639
Yeah if you are the boring guy at a party

1472
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,735
So Jordan I told you that

1473
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:04,063
Where that clip was going to go Dugan

1474
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,623
Was going to explain that Putin is

1475
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,391
Pragmatic

1476
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,487
Through I mean

1477
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,535
If he's the only single person

1478
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,583
Who knows what's

1479
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,351
Going on and if you

1480
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,887
Agree with him

1481
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:21,983
Killed

1482
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Then

1483
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,335
It's the only way you're allowed to

1484
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,151
Absolutely

1485
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:29,919
Start

1486
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,223
Alex Jones

1487
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,759
I'm coming too

1488
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,807
Conclusion

1489
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:54,495
Doesn't stop this feeling this emotion and Country

1490
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:20,607
Nationalist with a y

1491
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
Yes

1492
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,959
Amanda

1493
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,239
That's fun because

1494
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:32,639
Then making it abundantly clear that they are comparing the two men as being very similar

1495
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:35,199
And whenever they looked like his reveal

1496
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,479
He is rational

1497
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:45,183
What, you trying to say that I do that's fun there

1498
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:48,767
But what he's trying to say is he's rational but at the same time is

1499
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,839
His priority is the fact that he's Russian

1500
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,655
For Trump the priority is Betty's America

1501
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,239
I don't

1502
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,055
Yeah

1503
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:03,871
It works great works great

1504
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,639
To kill us

1505
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:09,247
Well now they're trying to kill a lot of people that is fairly URI

1506
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,343
Not yet will probably be

1507
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,879
You know collateral damage

1508
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,671
Cuz I want to

1509
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,719
So bad

1510
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:20,255
That you may have your chance

1511
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:24,607
I want to be perfect without a little bit

1512
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,143
Down the line

1513
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,935
As this episode goes on but

1514
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,495
Dugan is Angela

1515
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,519
For a war

1516
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,543
Between the United

1517
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,567
Russia

1518
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,871
I don't know why

1519
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,919
Alex Jones would have him on his show

1520
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,199
Because

1521
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,991
That is part of his worldview

1522
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,807
I don't know how else to put it

1523
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,087
Like

1524
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,111
Alex Jones

1525
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,415
The Supreme

1526
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,183
America

1527
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,463
Can Patriot he comes

1528
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,743
From America

1529
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
Connor

1530
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,535
Royalty

1531
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,071
Bloodline

1532
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:58,399
Confederate in his version Americana royalty

1533
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,215
He's having a guy on the shows

1534
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:04,031
Expressed opinion is

1535
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:06,079
Destruction of the United States

1536
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,359
Destruction of the West

1537
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,407
You're staying United

1538
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
States

1539
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:15,551
This is how we

1540
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,087
Alex just wants Texas

1541
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:23,487
If you don't want go to work and even play that game because Alexander Dugan is very specifically said

1542
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:29,119
So is his branding or like

1543
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,167
Semantics games with that

1544
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,703
He said that the West

1545
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,519
And liberalism which doesn't mean liberal

1546
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,543
In this case

1547
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,311
Okay

1548
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,871
I'll just give you umbrella version

1549
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,151
Of Alexander Dugan

1550
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,431
A big book

1551
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:47,807
His biggest book is called the fourth political ideology

1552
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,599
I believe Harry Potter in

1553
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:54,463
I apologize it's a very moderate political Theory

1554
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,535
The argument that he lays out in that book is

1555
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:01,119
Is that liberalism communism

1556
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,679
That have been the warring ideologies

1557
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,703
Of

1558
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,471
The world

1559
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,007
And liberalism is one

1560
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,031
That's very rude.

1561
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,311
Did way of putting it

1562
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:14,431
But over the course of recent history you have those three they're coming up against each other

1563
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,735
Liberalism destroyed fascism

1564
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,527
In World War II

1565
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:24,927
Liberalism communism with the breaking up of the liberalism

1566
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:28,767
Has become bored I guess he's fighting with itself

1567
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:31,071
And that's why you end up with these positions

1568
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:35,167
Like political correctness

1569
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:37,983
Well

1570
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,007
Because

1571
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,287
A Within

1572
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:45,407
In his in his freedom within his term

1573
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,687
Liberal

1574
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,247
Generally it's eating away by fascist

1575
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,015
ISM with it

1576
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,807
That is

1577
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,599
That is a fairly good

1578
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
Assessment

1579
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,927
Assessment

1580
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,743
Right so he proposes a fourth

1581
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,071
Political Theory

1582
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,607
Elements

1583
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,167
Traditionalism

1584
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,447
He takes element

1585
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:13,311
Some some Elementary believe liberal

1586
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,848
Look I haven't read the book

1587
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,152
In its entirety I don't know how to break it all down

1588
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,176
But from

1589
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,712
All the reviews I could get

1590
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:26,112
Most of it seems like there is just a lot of Proto fascism

1591
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:26,880
In his world

1592
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,488
And incessant

1593
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:37,888
Do that

1594
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,936
Ideology

1595
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,472
Yeah I can't be

1596
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:46,592
I wrote a book about a fascism is one of those right

1597
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:51,456
He says that fascism is bad even though he says a little bit of

1598
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,736
Is good

1599
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,272
Fascism is bad

1600
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,576
3 reviews of like his worldview that all looks

1601
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,600
Express

1602
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:00,160
Against fascism but is a fascist

1603
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,912
Into that that idea

1604
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,448
Who's going to stand against the

1605
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,288
Can rust be killed

1606
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,824
No too big of a dick

1607
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,848
Too big of a dick

1608
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,128
Guess what happens

1609
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
Alex loves big dick

1610
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:24,736
Alex loves big dick

1611
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:31,136
Showbox

1612
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,512
That's actually why he loves to BBC interview because

1613
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,400
Dugan

1614
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:44,448
It's possible he's got a beard problem-solve

1615
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,032
Because

1616
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:51,616
The restaurant

1617
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:56,992
He's called that because of his sort of Mystic elements that he has

1618
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,552
His worldview and then the fact that he has a beard

1619
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,648
So

1620
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,416
The Antichrist

1621
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,720
You're going to get some you're going to get some

1622
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,304
Send his

1623
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,840
Is larger philosophy

1624
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:15,424
Which will get you in the moment but here let's get you another clip

1625
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
The Spear of Destiny

1626
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:23,104
Go look up

1627
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,128
The movie

1628
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,432
Our greatest living

1629
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,200
Keanu Reeves

1630
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,248
I like the movie

1631
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,528
I thought leaders

1632
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,320
No I haven't seen it

1633
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,856
Since the 2005

1634
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:38,464
But I liked it then I might have been highest

1635
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,392
To the nation to the culture they're not soulless

1636
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:10,208
Globalist who noticed have never have children

1637
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:16,608
Are totally about destroying anything

1638
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,376
Arnot

1639
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,144
Satanic

1640
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,936
Wow.

1641
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:24,800
So now Trump America

1642
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:32,480
A good thing the Alex Jones Show

1643
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,504
No

1644
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,088
You doing this now

1645
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,440
Cuz cuz he doesn't think it's weird

1646
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,512
He thinks that the globalist

1647
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:48,864
The did all this shooting Ukraine not realizing the guy he has on his show

1648
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,936
Legitimately was training a paramilitary organization

1649
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,496
Attacked

1650
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,568
He doesn't realize that it's very clear

1651
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,360
Russia did

1652
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,408
He thinks it is a globalist

1653
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,944
So all of his

1654
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,016
All of his premonitions all of his ideas are like

1655
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:08,064
All this Russia stuff is b*******

1656
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,136
Because he believed the stories that come to him from official

1657
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,696
Russian state

1658
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,744
That's a big leap.

1659
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,512
Like

1660
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,816
I'm sure that the

1661
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,584
GOP

1662
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,632
Who are all on that

1663
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:24,704
There's there's no Russian collusion

1664
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,496
They're different

1665
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:32,640
If you are dealing with them

1666
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,920
Even those guys

1667
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,736
Possibly be okay with you saying

1668
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,272
Trump is an American

1669
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:45,696
Nothing that's okay Alex hates the Republican establishment as much as

1670
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:50,048
He doesn't give a s*** they don't they can disapprove of him

1671
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:56,448
Me too like I said if that's what you're saying no cuz he's radicalized

1672
01:24:56,704 --> 01:25:01,568
People are still bulshit the Russians story is nothing

1673
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,616
Thing is very different from saying

1674
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,384
Trump

1675
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,176
Is the American

1676
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,480
Journalist murdering

1677
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,272
Country invading

1678
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,576
Billionaire

1679
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,344
Tucker

1680
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,624
To use Alex

1681
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,208
But here's one thing that you're missing

1682
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:20,512
He's been prepping his audience

1683
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,304
For this for at least a year and a half

1684
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:28,192
That's true not like this is the big reveal or anything like this I think this is him showing his cards way too much

1685
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:31,008
To someone like me who's listening critically

1686
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,056
But I think that

1687
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
He's been

1688
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,152
By talking about how the globalist

1689
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,176
Organic snacks

1690
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:40,480
Your kids out of the backyard want to drink their blood

1691
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,760
Call Vista

1692
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,552
Defending

1693
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:49,184
Talk too much about that for a while now

1694
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,208
With the same

1695
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Gold

1696
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,536
The same goal being that this is

1697
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,352
What's Co-op Alexander Dugan language

1698
01:25:56,864 --> 01:26:00,704
You know the the he is the guy who standing between the Antichrist and you

1699
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:06,080
Idea on and applied at the Trump

1700
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,872
And now the audience is ready

1701
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:09,920
Ford

1702
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,688
Between

1703
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,736
That man the Antichrist

1704
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,784
It's incredibly f*****-up

1705
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,552
That's

1706
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:18,112
It's deeply and profoundly f***** up

1707
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,160
I think it comes

1708
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,208
Entirely down

1709
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,000
To the fact that Alex Jones has been

1710
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,304
F****** he's lost his mind

1711
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,584
And you just believe

1712
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,632
Outnet propaganda

1713
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,960
He's been in a propaganda whole for so long

1714
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,496
Yelling about the globalist

1715
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,544
Believing nonsense stories

1716
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,336
Again it's because he has brain damage

1717
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,616
Mitch from these things that we've

1718
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,176
Ring uncovered from his own story

1719
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,248
The heat doesn't understand where truth and

1720
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,528
Reality

1721
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,832
Mixes into fantasy and lies

1722
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,880
And he's been lied to

1723
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,672
He believes that lie narrative

1724
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,976
Because he has too many people around him

1725
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,000
Who are aggressive

1726
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,584
Look it comes down to I think also

1727
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,376
The fact that we talked about

1728
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,168
What's going on this show

1729
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,216
Who the f*** is actually going to

1730
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:06,496
Spend time talking

1731
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,520
This dick hole

1732
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,056
He's a racist f***

1733
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:12,640
The oldest of it's been demonstrated over and over again how

1734
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,664
Much of a

1735
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,432
White

1736
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,712
Identity bias

1737
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,480
He has yeah

1738
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,528
So who's going on

1739
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,576
Credited alienated show

1740
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:23,136
That maybe has a million listeners baby

1741
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,672
That's entirely possible

1742
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,440
But

1743
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:27,744
Do you want a million bigots on your side

1744
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,536
The people who are going on to that

1745
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,584
Are people

1746
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,864
Good question

1747
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,960
I don't I'm so alone

1748
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:42,336
They've got way more than a million I'm certainly happy with the about butts

1749
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:45,664
You know less than that policy walks that we have

1750
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:46,688
I'm thrilled with it

1751
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,600
About Alex Jones

1752
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,904
Discover the craziness

1753
01:27:56,416 --> 01:28:02,560
And let's be clear let's be clear let's be clear we

1754
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:07,424
If not necessarily uncovered it believes we've seen very strong indication

1755
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,216
Alex Jones

1756
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:15,872
Not that he's a Russian agent again I'm not saying that he's on board with this stuff

1757
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,920
And is beholding to because he

1758
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,200
He does not understand the differences

1759
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,480
You tripping reality

1760
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,248
Propagate

1761
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,016
Yeah

1762
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,296
Spreading

1763
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,832
And here's the thing

1764
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,112
I get

1765
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,928
I know if you know this or not but

1766
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,232
During the run-up

1767
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,680
There were a lot of APA American newspapers

1768
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,448
Supporting Hitler

1769
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:46,848
Yeah in a bunch of stuff about how Hitler will calm down once the elections over until

1770
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:51,200
There a lot of people normalizing and being like to blow over

1771
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:56,832
I want to say this but Media Matters I don't think they're necessarily dumb or evil or anything like

1772
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:59,904
But they are an organization that relies on

1773
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,464
Clicks in traffic

1774
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:03,744
And we aren't

1775
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,024
Because we are just

1776
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,840
Doing this we don't expect to make a living office

1777
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,632
Who be great

1778
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:14,496
Expect to do that we're dumb asses you're a comedian I quit doing comedy

1779
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:16,288
Did like once a comedian always

1780
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,592
In my bones

1781
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:21,152
But we're doing this because

1782
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:27,296
The reason you couldn't cuz I drink your adrenaline in my blood

1783
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,112
We're doing this because we

1784
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:32,160
Stumbled into something and we believe in

1785
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:39,072
Bullied you into it

1786
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:45,984
And I'm just right here

1787
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:50,080
Palatable I need someone to Bounce It Off

1788
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,872
The back to Media Matters

1789
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:52,896
Radar

1790
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,432
They're really

1791
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,200
2

1792
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,480
Getting attached

1793
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,272
Whenever this

1794
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,040
This came out

1795
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:00,320
This interview is on the 4th

1796
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,856
On the 3rd

1797
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,160
Milo yiannopoulos

1798
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,464
Gay Bash

1799
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,232
Glenn Beck

1800
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:09,024
What you talked about last night

1801
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:13,376
Article about and

1802
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,704
People were complaining about

1803
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,752
Milo and him talking about Glenn Beck

1804
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:19,776
Text gay sweaters

1805
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,800
And stuff like that

1806
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,104
This is so much more important

1807
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:28,224
No I don't know I don't go to Media Matters all the time so I don't know what all their articles are

1808
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,272
But in the past I have gone and looked

1809
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,552
Like what are they cover

1810
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,088
And I know

1811
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,136
That in the past they have covered

1812
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:37,440
Not stories like this miserly

1813
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,488
But more substantial stories

1814
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,768
Robert Glenn Beck

1815
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,304
About Alex Jones

1816
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:45,888
Look at the shares on it not as high

1817
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:46,656
Isolo

1818
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,960
So it's just that most people don't

1819
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:51,520
Engaged

1820
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:52,544
Yeah

1821
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,104
That's because

1822
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,896
I would say

1823
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,456
Before before this

1824
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,224
For me

1825
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,272
There was a lot more complications

1826
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,064
It was a lot more new

1827
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:09,184
Right Alex Jones

1828
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,208
Situation

1829
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,536
If you are really trying to

1830
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,304
Parks that

1831
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,120
There are a lot of different elements that could come in

1832
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:19,168
You don't just like you and I have talked about

1833
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,984
I've I've consistently been

1834
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,032
Skeptical of your

1835
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,056
Of your kind of

1836
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,592
Gestalt

1837
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:33,248
So did I

1838
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:38,368
More for me than for you cuz I want people to realize

1839
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,392
I'm not lying

1840
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,672
When I say

1841
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:43,232
I didn't come into this with an agenda

1842
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:46,560
Other than laughing at Alex Jones dumbass

1843
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:49,120
So you were saying

1844
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,680
So I would say that it is

1845
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:53,216
Much easier to be sky

1846
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,264
Because there are so many

1847
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,288
Coming into

1848
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:59,104
If he's just saying you know

1849
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,640
Putin the strongman

1850
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,920
You can say well he's

1851
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:03,968
Who likes

1852
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,272
As you might imagine

1853
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:09,344
This is kind of unequivocally

1854
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,184
He supports Russian

1855
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,000
Russian

1856
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:20,096
Would like

1857
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:21,888
So but

1858
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:24,960
Let's be clear for about a year-and-a-half

1859
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:29,568
Screaming about how Donald Trump is our only hope

1860
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,592
Anna Baba

1861
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:32,384
Art Van on this the Oggy

1862
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,432
August 4th 2017 episode

1863
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,456
Kilauea

1864
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,992
An associate of poop

1865
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:37,760
Who is

1866
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,296
Propaganda

1867
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:42,368
To come onto his show and say that Trump

1868
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,904
Is the American food

1869
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,696
And Putin is the Russian Trump

1870
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:46,976
And Alex Jones

1871
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:47,744
Agrees

1872
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,048
Down on it

1873
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,864
So that means that everything

1874
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,912
Did he believes about Trump

1875
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,704
And has been saying in the past

1876
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:59,264
In some fashion he believes

1877
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
About Putin

1878
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,312
Trump is the

1879
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,128
That's genuinely what Alex

1880
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:07,200
So now I want to bring

1881
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:14,112
I'm sorry cuz I want to I want to okay

1882
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:20,256
What it is he's going for is or is he supposed is he just going on here to kind of spread Pro

1883
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:21,792
You want to talk about it

1884
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:26,144
Is Buck a little bit but then also the other thing was on

1885
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,680
Because Alex Jones is selling his

1886
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,960
His book on Infowars

1887
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
SoBe

1888
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:33,312
Call Silly primate

1889
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,360
B12

1890
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:41,760
The only outlet that would still sell

1891
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:45,344
Well that was secondary he went to the the f****** Mercer's

1892
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,368
Oh that's

1893
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,440
And he plays this whole game in the interview where it's like

1894
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:51,232
You know what I just had to rely on

1895
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,000
Supportive

1896
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:52,768
The people

1897
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:53,792
Looking for Q

1898
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,584
Right now we got Lake

1899
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,352
We haven't

1900
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:58,400
Easter sale on my bucket

1901
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:01,216
It's 55% off it's 1776

1902
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:03,264
You can get it at Infowars

1903
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:08,384
Question about most of it is you want to talk about his book a little bit

1904
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,688
He brings up his idea about the

1905
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:12,224
The fourth political Theory

1906
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,040
It's boring out

1907
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,320
Cut the rest of it is all just

1908
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,088
Just pro-putin

1909
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,672
Which is

1910
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:23,488
Cause of the nature of the enemy

1911
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,792
I think he actually does

1912
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,816
You think

1913
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:30,144
I can tell from his writing

1914
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,168
But

1915
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,960
I also think that it's a

1916
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:33,984
Convenient excuse

1917
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,264
4

1918
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,056
His eurasianism

1919
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:39,104
Siri which we'll get to in a minute

1920
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,384
But before we do

1921
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,664
IO games

1922
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:51,136
With the destruction of the Republic does interrupted by state

1923
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:55,744
This is the first time he's ever happened I have prepared a segment

1924
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:58,816
So at the end of that clip Alex Jones

1925
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,352
I know it's like 15 minutes

1926
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:05,216
Alex Jones globalist

1927
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:05,984
And you know this

1928
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,520
Because they don't have any children

1929
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,312
Now

1930
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,848
I pulled up a list

1931
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,640
Of some of his big globalist

1932
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:16,480
Okay and I'd like you to try and guess how many children they have

1933
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:17,504
Bill Gates

1934
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:24,160
How many children does Bill and Melinda Gates have children

1935
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,744
Jordan with 1.0

1936
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:36,704
Two children children

1937
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:43,104
That's correct

1938
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,640
Toppers

1939
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:51,040
Champion globalist zbigniew Brzezinski

1940
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,600
Mika

1941
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:59,488
Son who was a child

1942
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,144
Family business

1943
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:14,848
Does the baron of Rothschild whatever the 4th Baron

1944
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:21,504
His four children

1945
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:27,648
David Rockefeller who just recently died

1946
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,928
Hitstick

1947
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:32,768
Six children

1948
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:38,400
That's not 0 Alex billionaires

1949
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,192
George Soros

1950
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,264
PS5

1951
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,288
5 kids

1952
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,824
Five kids Soros

1953
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,848
You got to stop

1954
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:57,344
Has five kids David Rockefeller

1955
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,648
Those are big numbers

1956
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:00,928
Book Little House On

1957
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,000
You have a f******

1958
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,560
Global operation in banking

1959
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:08,352
Concern yourself with

1960
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,632
What are you doing

1961
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,960
Soros does have

1962
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,984
Do you remember that one

1963
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:25,248
It's another example out of nowhere

1964
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,928
Alex wants to play this game

1965
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:35,744
That wasn't actually bills kid

1966
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:41,120
I will say I don't care about your b******* narrative it's still Hillary's kids

1967
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,168
I don't give a s***

1968
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,192
Let's go f*** yourself

1969
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:47,776
Is the father of Meg

1970
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,544
Kelly's kid

1971
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,640
Got her all wet

1972
01:37:56,992 --> 01:38:03,136
Does Kelly have a child I didn't look into that

1973
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:10,816
Old-school globalist

1974
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,400
I mean you could make an argument that Brock Obama and the Clinton

1975
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,192
Things are just tools of the globalist

1976
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:20,800
But the rest of them likes the Alex Jones talks about how he is

1977
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,592
The agenda

1978
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:25,408
George Soros runs the whole f****** thing

1979
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:32,064
David Rockefeller was the heart and soul of globalism the Rothschilds family is what's all behind

1980
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:33,344
It's

1981
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,112
F****** nuts

1982
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:35,904
So stupid

1983
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:39,488
This should just be a small indication that everything he said is

1984
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:45,376
It says made up yours comes up with stuffy nose no one's going to look into it wasn't even something that he

1985
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,424
Like that was

1986
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,192
Just a thrill

1987
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:53,312
Yeah but it was a throw off reinforcing his idea that does low globulin

1988
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:57,408
Satanist to don't give a s*** about anything

1989
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,248
Like throwing out a bunch of s*** and then he's like

1990
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:03,296
We probably don't have kids

1991
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:09,696
I don't know hours on are complaining about George

1992
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:13,536
Cirrhosis

1993
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:16,864
Clinton over and over and over again

1994
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,632
I never

1995
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,400
A bunch

1996
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:23,008
Segments complaining about how Barack Obama's kids behave

1997
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:25,824
He was in that s*** man what they were talking about

1998
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,640
Maliah dancing it's a Lollapalooza

1999
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,688
He was onboard

2000
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:35,040
They're terrible

2001
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,904
Look the problem is that we're not normal

2002
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:45,536
Regardless

2003
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,072
You were weird

2004
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,632
Alexander and Alex

2005
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:51,680
Normal

2006
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,848
Normal

2007
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,128
Represent

2008
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:06,528
Specialized or special world

2009
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,696
So I hey

2010
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,744
Putin and Trump are normal

2011
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,792
Yeah there's a normal people

2012
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,864
Aldi's

2013
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,424
All all these people are just to evolution

2014
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,984
Normality

2015
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,520
Freak

2016
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:32,896
Him having love the the most average amount of children

2017
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:35,456
That's about

2018
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:39,552
All of our world leaders are not Norm

2019
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:45,952
Do you want to be a world leader some overlap between

2020
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:50,816
At least I got powerful personality powerful ideology

2021
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,608
You have backing

2022
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:54,144
Your principles that's not

2023
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:54,912
Not normal

2024
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:58,752
This guy

2025
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:00,032
Alexander

2026
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:00,800
Sing

2027
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:04,128
Who sang with the two of them are normal

2028
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:05,152
It's a good time as I need to

2029
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:07,456
To talk about what is normal to him

2030
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:16,672
So I looked into this a little bit options and I have to

2031
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,208
Pick out which one is normal to have

2032
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:20,256
No I'm just going to read some paragraphs

2033
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:22,816
From this

2034
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:25,120
Pink.com

2035
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:27,424
There's a bunch of sources I've looked into them they

2036
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,984
So I trust this

2037
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,544
Some Russian sources

2038
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,080
On this too

2039
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,616
Because Google translate stuff

2040
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,664
I've gone in

2041
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,456
My everything that you saying

2042
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,224
Mattress

2043
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,784
But he writes it up very well so I'm just going

2044
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,552
How to read hazard

2045
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,112
I can try

2046
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,160
I need to give a little bit

2047
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:52,512
He talks about a lot Alexander Dugan that is

2048
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,352
Couple

2049
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,120
Decade

2050
01:41:57,376 --> 01:42:00,704
We've had a unipolar world where the United States is the

2051
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,984
Only massive

2052
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,008
Power in the world

2053
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:04,032
Right

2054
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:05,312
What would like

2055
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,592
She is a multipolar

2056
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,384
Which

2057
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,408
Make some sense

2058
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,712
Bon-Ton on some level

2059
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,480
I don't disagree

2060
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:16,064
Bree I suppose I don't think the United States needs to be

2061
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,136
The only supreme power in the world I think that's

2062
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:21,184
Egotistical

2063
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:23,744
Little tunnel vision

2064
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,560
I think I would probably argue that there should be a

2065
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:29,120
Called as opposed to a

2066
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:32,704
Unipolar tri-polar whatever it is I like the sound of that

2067
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,520
I like

2068
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,360
Yeah

2069
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,128
Civilization

2070
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:46,784
Dubin likes talk about a multipolar world where in

2071
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,320
Russia become

2072
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:50,624
A superpower that is able to check

2073
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,648
The United States

2074
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,696
That's why he's really big

2075
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:54,720
Into what's going on

2076
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:55,488
Syria

2077
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,256
Because

2078
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:58,048
It is a situation where

2079
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:03,936
Well it's a situation where a sod and the United States

2080
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:04,960
Is there a soup

2081
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:05,728
Superpower

2082
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:10,080
But no Russia comes in

2083
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,360
Hold on

2084
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,896
You don't get to just say that

2085
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,200
Through the way Alexander Dugan wood

2086
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,480
Present that is

2087
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,784
AB massage

2088
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,600
The way you present that is

2089
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:24,672
Because we have nukes

2090
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:26,208
And because we aren't

2091
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,232
To be trifled with

2092
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:30,048
We can step in and say no you aren't the big

2093
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,144
Supreme leader of the world it's just on principle

2094
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:38,240
Like

2095
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:40,288
Nearest croc from the ark

2096
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,824
Dugan contrast

2097
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:46,176
Theory of a multipolar world with what he and conspiracy theorists worldwide

2098
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:49,760
Is the movement towards creating a global government

2099
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,320
Light by disingenuous globalist Elites

2100
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:56,672
Route to deprive people of a sense of identity and to subjugate them into their corporate need

2101
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:01,280
In this world have a number of regional superpowers what role would Russia play

2102
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:03,072
Dugan's tease Russia

2103
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:06,144
To be the leading nation in the Eurasian Union

2104
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:09,728
And is founded the international Eurasia movement to make that happen

2105
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,520
What is Eurasia

2106
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:14,080
Basically it's the territory of the former

2107
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,104
Soviet Union

2108
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,248
Really that's

2109
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,784
The berries

2110
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,576
Yeah

2111
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,368
Dugan

2112
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:31,488
Dugan fix the Soviet Union just took over the boundaries of a historical Union of people

2113
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:34,560
And ethnicities that were there for the Russian Empire

2114
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:37,632
Is Russia is a country of a unique culture and death

2115
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:39,424
It is admission

2116
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,240
Create a center of power that has elements of both Europe

2117
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,776
Asia the two continents

2118
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:45,312
Straddled by the expansive

2119
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,592
So

2120
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:49,664
Part of his philosophy is this thing called Eurasian ism

2121
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,760
The reason Union

2122
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:56,832
Alex Jones is really against those sorts of things

2123
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,600
Relieving

2124
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:01,184
Globalist organization

2125
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,232
He use that

2126
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:08,096
IJustine

2127
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:10,144
Alex know this

2128
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,472
I would say possibly

2129
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,752
Possibly

2130
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:17,056
Dumb that's not

2131
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,080
It's not the

2132
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:20,384
Evil or or some kind of

2133
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,992
Linkage

2134
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:25,760
Idiot

2135
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:26,784
Idiocy

2136
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:29,600
Like how no it's not no it's not

2137
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:33,440
It's a fine it's a fine layer of varnish

2138
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,208
Over

2139
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:34,976
Expansion is

2140
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,256
Yeah

2141
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,280
It is

2142
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:42,144
Good that's what I'm saying

2143
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:46,240
But it's good PR to put it in this sort of life

2144
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,544
In the same way

2145
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,360
But what are you saying is

2146
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,128
We want

2147
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,664
The Soviet Union back

2148
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:59,808
What kind of what kind of boron

2149
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,088
Would think that they would

2150
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:01,856
Stop

2151
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:04,160
At the f****** Soviet Union

2152
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:08,000
F****** believable

2153
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,280
There's no way that the

2154
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,584
Say they get the Soviet Union

2155
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:17,984
What else was part of the Soviet Union world

2156
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,520
Do you remember that

2157
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,360
Made up bulshit

2158
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:29,248
0 pictures of sorbet that at some point

2159
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,784
Nobody

2160
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,368
Buy it Publix

2161
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,792
You're having such a difficult time

2162
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:45,632
Stroke it is you're trying to accept

2163
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,936
Face value from propaganda

2164
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:50,240
I'm not I'm just trying to say that

2165
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:53,056
I just

2166
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:56,128
I find it so fast

2167
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:57,920
That these people

2168
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,968
Sociopath

2169
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:09,184
Twist reality version of this world

2170
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:10,976
And they can pull it off

2171
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:11,744
Like

2172
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,792
Really it on the show

2173
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,840
And this is old card

2174
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:20,960
Alex

2175
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:23,520
That's very fair he's well he's no fill heart

2176
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:28,384
I'm not sure which one

2177
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,408
Come on

2178
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,272
Like the thing about

2179
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,296
What do you want

2180
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:37,600
Do you watch True Crime at all

2181
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:41,440
I've seen some stuff

2182
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,208
And you think

2183
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,000
How can a human being

2184
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,560
How can a human being do something

2185
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,608
But these guys

2186
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,288
I know I've watched a lot of like cops in those sorts of shows

2187
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:57,568
Everyone

2188
01:47:57,824 --> 01:48:00,896
Whenever you're caught red-handed come up with an excuse

2189
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:02,688
And those are jumpy

2190
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:07,808
Dugan's a really smart person who knows he will be caught red-handed eventually

2191
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:11,136
And it's created an entire worldview based around

2192
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:14,720
Preemptively not having to make that excuse at the last second

2193
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,816
Between a human being and a cycle

2194
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:21,376
Like if you're if you're on Cops

2195
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,656
If you're on top

2196
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:29,312
Well I don't know if I would go person normal person and a psychopath

2197
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:31,104
To some extent

2198
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,896
A layer of intelligence

2199
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,176
Well I mean

2200
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,248
You're not wrong

2201
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,272
You're not wrong

2202
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:43,648
Serial killer usually gets away with

2203
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,464
So you have to be pretty smart to get away with that many

2204
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:49,280
Yeah so

2205
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:52,608
Alex Jones likes to talk about America being the new Atlanta

2206
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,680
Recall the number of times that are

2207
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,448
Investigation

2208
01:48:57,216 --> 01:49:02,336
And episodes where he's talked about that

2209
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:05,664
He's also talked a lot about Atlantis in terms

2210
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,200
Don't match up with Play-Doh

2211
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:12,832
On that

2212
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,392
About Dugan from Alex

2213
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:17,440
This is from that article for Big Thing

2214
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:24,096
Dugan digs even deeper into his very controversial historical analysis

2215
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,376
Does claiming Eurasia

2216
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:28,192
Opponent is not just the United States

2217
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,472
But Atlanta

2218
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,520
Cooperation

2219
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,800
Between Europe us

2220
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:35,360
Canada the crosses the Atlantic Ocean

2221
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:39,200
These Maritime liberal Nations value individuality and Market

2222
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:39,968
Forces

2223
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:41,504
Eurasia on the other hand

2224
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,528
Representative

2225
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,320
Conservative philosophy

2226
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,088
Continental

2227
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,880
Which according to Eurasian

2228
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:50,720
Has among its values a hierarchical structure Law and Order

2229
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:52,512
Traditionalism and religion

2230
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:55,840
The we have Atlantis versus Eurasia

2231
01:49:56,096 --> 01:50:00,192
In fact claims all history can be viewed as a battle between maritime

2232
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:01,728
And land-based Nation

2233
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:04,544
Very true

2234
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:05,824
He's written a bunch of

2235
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:09,920
To stuff about that a lot of words can't be traced back to

2236
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:11,712
Wild

2237
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:15,296
I mean the water vendors in the Earth

2238
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:18,880
That's what's good

2239
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:25,280
Freewheeling people I base alot of My Philosophy

2240
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:27,072
This is very important

2241
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:29,120
Yeah

2242
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,496
Water people versus lamp

2243
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:36,800
Was

2244
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:43,200
Fighting against the law

2245
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:45,248
Stetson standard

2246
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:47,296
Pretty dumb

2247
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,416
I'm trying to

2248
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:54,976
Complete sentences

2249
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:58,048
A little bit earlier he wants to end the world

2250
01:50:58,304 --> 01:51:01,120
It's a quote from my his book that

2251
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:02,400
Political Theory

2252
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:04,192
The end times

2253
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,984
Eschatological meaning of politics

2254
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,288
Will not realize themselves on their own

2255
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,848
We will wait for the end in vain

2256
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:13,408
The end will never come if we wait for it

2257
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,944
And it will never come

2258
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:15,968
We do not

2259
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:20,320
It is the fourth planet

2260
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:25,696
Unless we do it

2261
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:29,024
If the fourth political practice

2262
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,328
Is not able to realize the end of time

2263
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,120
Then it would be invalid

2264
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:35,168
The end of days should come

2265
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:37,216
But it will not come by itself

2266
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,520
That's not good

2267
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:41,568
But whatever

2268
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:42,592
That's that's

2269
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:45,664
Patton Oswalt

2270
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,688
George W bush

2271
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:47,968
Amazon

2272
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:54,880
Yeah but this isn't a joke no it's not this is a real guy this is a Russian philosopher

2273
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,648
Putin

2274
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,928
Who's on Alex Jones

2275
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:57,952
Who now has

2276
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,232
B e r of Alex Jones's

2277
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,608
Yeah who have been primed for at least a year to be sympathetic

2278
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,376
His views

2279
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:10,240
Because the globalist and the globalist controlled media are just lying about all this s***

2280
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,520
Bringing about

2281
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:13,056
The end-times exactly what the

2282
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:13,824
The Antichrist

2283
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:20,224
And what band kind of wants to do in terms of its nickel view of History

2284
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:20,992
Is

2285
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:22,528
Godby

2286
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:24,576
Crazy

2287
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:28,160
To a macro scale

2288
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:29,440
We talked about all the

2289
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:33,792
All the time we bring up how Alex Jones accuses people of doing what he's going to do

2290
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:35,072
So

2291
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:37,120
If we take it to the nth degree

2292
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:39,424
I'm talking about the New World Order

2293
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,448
And all that stuff

2294
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,984
Maybe that is

2295
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,800
Maybe that's our goal because clearly that's Dugan's

2296
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:47,360
Dugan wants the New World Order

2297
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:48,640
He's peddling this

2298
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:52,480
Yeah

2299
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:54,016
City of destroying the world

2300
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:58,112
Wouldn't reality what he's talkin about is creating that very new world order

2301
01:52:58,624 --> 01:52:59,392
That he is claim

2302
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:00,160
Aiming to fight again

2303
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,184
But he wants to do it

2304
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:01,952
Through like a

2305
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:02,720
A massive war

2306
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:06,816
Do you want to do it through and then I'll have more

2307
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:12,704
Yeah so here is the last bit

2308
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:17,312
I'm going to read in this have to do with the idea that

2309
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,872
It is kind of confusing to think

2310
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:20,896
Beyond

2311
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:22,432
Trying to hurt Hillary Clinton

2312
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:23,712
Why the Russians

2313
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,992
Wood metal in

2314
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:25,760
The election

2315
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:27,808
Exactly their goal is

2316
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,112
Enter this article this gentleman

2317
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:31,648
Lays out the

2318
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:33,184
Is Paul Ratner lays out

2319
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:36,000
Influence probably has some

2320
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,024
Role to play

2321
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:39,072
The actual

2322
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:39,840
Campaign

2323
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,912
To see what Dugan might advocate

2324
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:46,752
Specifically we can look in his best-selling book the foundation of geopolitics

2325
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:48,032
Pixar 1997

2326
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:50,080
Which had particular success among

2327
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:51,104
Russian military

2328
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:54,176
And according to foreign policy

2329
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:55,456
Is assigned as a tech

2330
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:57,248
Text book at Russian military University

2331
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:02,880
The book outlines a vision for Russia in the 21st century they would lead to eurasia's formation

2332
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,928
Is that you

2333
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:09,024
But also

2334
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:14,144
But also include specific strategies for defeating or neutralizing the United States

2335
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,192
These include destabilizing

2336
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:17,216
And disinformation

2337
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,496
Two campaigns using

2338
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:19,264
Special force

2339
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:21,568
And asymmetrical Warfare

2340
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,152
Splitting alliances between us and countries like Germany and France

2341
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:28,992
As well as fermenting division within the country itself

2342
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:31,040
Specifically singling out race relay

2343
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:33,088
On page 306

2344
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,880
57 of the first edition of the book

2345
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:35,904
Dugan explained

2346
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:36,672
Quote

2347
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:41,792
It is essentially important to introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity

2348
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:42,816
Encourage

2349
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,096
Encouraging all kinds

2350
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:44,864
Separatism

2351
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:47,168
Mix social and racial

2352
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:49,984
Actively supporting all dissident movement

2353
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:51,776
Extremist racist

2354
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:52,800
In sectarian groups

2355
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:55,872
Dusty stabilizing internal political processes

2356
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:56,640
In the United

2357
01:54:57,408 --> 01:55:00,992
It would also support isolationist ended

2358
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:02,528
In American politics

2359
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,088
Got to give it to

2360
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:05,856
They're good

2361
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:06,880
They did it

2362
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:10,464
Yeah yeah

2363
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:13,024
Like they did a great job and Alex's f****** help

2364
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:16,864
So even though it was like even if it's not out no collusion

2365
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:19,168
These people are

2366
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:20,192
For the Russians

2367
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:23,520
Running on a purely races

2368
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:24,288
This campaign

2369
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,056
And isolation

2370
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,616
Perfectly for the Russians

2371
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:30,944
And that's for 1997 he had these ideas

2372
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,504
Possible for us

2373
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,296
How to figure out exactly when Alex

2374
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:36,832
Became beholden to

2375
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:39,136
Russian propaganda I know I said that it's

2376
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:40,160
The summer of 2050

2377
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:43,232
But it's entirely possible he died in balances

2378
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,512
Beyond that

2379
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:46,048
It's just possible that

2380
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:47,584
When Russian

2381
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:50,144
Act like they became much more active

2382
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,936
In terms of their their behaviors

2383
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:52,960
They realized

2384
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:54,496
Do these goals

2385
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:55,264
That

2386
01:55:55,520 --> 01:56:00,384
Alexander Dugan clearly set out in this book that is now a textbook for Russian military operation

2387
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,664
Have universities

2388
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,456
Alex is already onboard

2389
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:08,576
He's really into creating race racial Strife he's really into all this stuff

2390
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:11,392
Yeah like legitimately reading that my heart flutter

2391
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:12,416
Because I'm just like

2392
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:14,976
So clear exactly what Alex

2393
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:15,744
Exactly what he

2394
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:18,304
Yep

2395
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,352
Nuts

2396
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:22,144
Yeah

2397
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:22,912
Do Dan

2398
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:23,936
We're going to die

2399
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:29,056
About that

2400
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:32,384
I believe that this is going to go

2401
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:36,480
It's not going to go well

2402
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:39,296
It's better that's definitely

2403
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:43,136
So I mean look

2404
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:45,184
Look at all the details

2405
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:47,488
Look at look at the stuff about

2406
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:48,768
In 1997

2407
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:49,792
Alexander

2408
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:51,840
Creation

2409
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:53,120
Of Eurasia

2410
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,656
Wedding vows

2411
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:56,960
Ortigia splitting of strong alliances

2412
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:58,752
Like with Germany

2413
01:56:59,008 --> 01:56:59,776
Like with France

2414
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:05,920
Coronavirus

2415
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:09,248
Bye and her candidacy

2416
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:12,064
Absolutely.

2417
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,344
Pacifically in their butt

2418
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:18,208
That's part of the alliance or whatever

2419
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:22,560
People elections coming up

2420
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:25,632
Insulted

2421
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:26,656
Germany and

2422
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:30,496
I've been very degrading about their willingness to accept Refuge

2423
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:31,264
Ugis and stuff

2424
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:36,896
Like

2425
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:40,480
Relatively

2426
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:44,832
The fact that most of the EU is really you tonight

2427
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:56,608
People think that we're saying or something like that

2428
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:03,264
So far it seems that a lot of

2429
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,312
Things have proved fairly resilient

2430
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,336
In this

2431
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:07,872
Sure

2432
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,176
Enter International

2433
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:11,456
Assertive

2434
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:13,504
Institutions theme much

2435
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,296
Stronger than our own

2436
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:19,392
Let's say internally I think we have much more to worry about

2437
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:24,256
In terms of our norms and values a rodent

2438
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,024
Was written.

2439
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,048
Turns out

2440
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:28,352
Lego

2441
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:31,168
The Assumption on so many of these things

2442
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:32,448
Before they were written

2443
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:35,008
People will like

2444
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:35,776
Comerica

2445
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:37,312
Yeah

2446
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:39,872
We were the founding they were way off

2447
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:40,640
Yeah

2448
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:42,176
So

2449
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:43,456
Attitudinal Congress should have

2450
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:45,760
Plan for America

2451
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:49,088
Yeah I want it I want to go back to this part of the quote to

2452
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:50,624
The direct quote from Dugan

2453
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:53,440
How about encouraging all kinds of separatism

2454
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:55,488
An ethnic social and racial conflict

2455
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,048
Actively supporting all dissident movement

2456
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,072
Extremists braces

2457
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:00,096
Sectarian group

2458
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:01,888
Dust destabilizing in

2459
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:03,168
Internal political processes

2460
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:06,240
I want to go back to that because

2461
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:08,288
I think it's really important for us to look at

2462
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,336
In the wake of the election

2463
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:13,920
There was a guy named who was in

2464
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:15,456
Toledo

2465
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,480
Secessionist

2466
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:17,760
In California

2467
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,320
Telex

2468
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:23,648
He was working on that and then he moved

2469
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:24,416
To Russia

2470
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:32,352
That's not true and then gave up on the collection campaign it is tell me that's not true

2471
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:38,496
I wish I could get one more time

2472
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:39,264
How not

2473
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,568
True that was absolutely true

2474
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:42,592
The collection

2475
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:51,296
Play Jingle but it's weird

2476
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:53,088
Weird

2477
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:54,880
But that was a

2478
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:55,904
Massive failure

2479
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:58,976
You were talking about

2480
01:59:59,232 --> 01:59:59,744
Propaganda

2481
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:01,792
To try and fund that

2482
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:02,816
That had

2483
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:03,584
No

2484
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,608
Fertile soil

2485
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:08,960
No but

2486
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:13,312
You cast a wide net you're going to not catch a ton of fish

2487
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:14,336
You're going to catch the rest

2488
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:15,104
Exactly

2489
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:16,640
I think what

2490
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:18,688
If we're if we're talking about that

2491
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:20,480
In terms of

2492
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:21,248
Maybe that's

2493
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,528
Plan

2494
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:26,624
Yeah

2495
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:30,208
What they've discovered is that are racist

2496
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,488
Are bigots

2497
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:33,792
Religious

2498
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,864
All of those people are far more easy

2499
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,632
U2

2500
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:38,400
Hoodwitch

2501
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:40,448
Then our secretary

2502
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,472
If you will

2503
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:48,128
So what who are sectarian

2504
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:51,200
The collective

2505
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:52,224
Secretary

2506
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:53,760
Alex

2507
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:56,320
Alex

2508
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:06,560
But he has more of a a nonsense bialigy

2509
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:08,864
As opposed to an ideology

2510
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:09,632
J or h

2511
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,936
Traditional

2512
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:13,984
Fair enough

2513
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,008
Dimensional being

2514
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,032
You're not really

2515
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,824
Slick

2516
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:18,848
Unfair

2517
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:22,432
You're right that was my fault

2518
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:28,064
I kind of agree but at the same time I want to be clear that like

2519
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:29,856
This is a book

2520
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:30,624
The hero

2521
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:33,440
Became widely adopted

2522
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:34,464
And became a tech

2523
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,024
Textbook for Russian military University

2524
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:44,448
I am supporting disruptive entities Within

2525
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,752
Our internal body politic

2526
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:50,080
You would if you go back

2527
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:51,104
Petula pain

2528
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,128
And those she was

2529
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:55,968
You know why Alex Jones

2530
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:57,504
49045 / 2

2531
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:59,040
It's a loss leader

2532
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:00,576
So sometimes

2533
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:05,440
You know you're Russia new support some movement but doesn't end up working out

2534
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:06,976
Yeah the Lost leader

2535
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:08,512
You got it you got a

2536
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:09,280
You got a

2537
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:12,096
Spread it out and then eventually something will sprout

2538
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:13,888
I think there's something

2539
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,168
The longest line

2540
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:16,192
It does

2541
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:16,960
It does seem like

2542
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:18,752
It does seem like they've thrown

2543
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:20,544
Whatever it is they cannot

2544
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,312
The wall

2545
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:23,616
Without racists

2546
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:24,640
It's stuck

2547
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,664
Good news

2548
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:28,224
What's your name

2549
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:30,016
No

2550
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:32,064
My good news is that

2551
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:33,600
We like to think

2552
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,904
You know Trump

2553
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,184
Putin

2554
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,464
Sky Zone

2555
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:40,000
Spell really

2556
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:42,048
We like to think that they're sort of

2557
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:42,816
Nabi

2558
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,888
And you know

2559
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,680
Think of them as

2560
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:57,152
You and Alexander Dugan Alex Jones have something in common

2561
02:02:58,944 --> 02:03:00,736
God system and play God

2562
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:03,040
They are

2563
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:06,368
Swadesh artificial synthetic

2564
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:09,184
World Government transhumanist movement

2565
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:11,488
Has openly declared war on

2566
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:17,888
Men and women in America and schools don't have men and women it's hurtful to others open

2567
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:25,312
Do you guys have her

2568
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,872
That's exactly why I kept

2569
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:31,200
Because it's like it's degrading

2570
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:32,480
It's degrading for you to be

2571
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:34,272
Speaking to someone

2572
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:36,576
Propaganda

2573
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:41,184
Right field a little bit murky giving him like

2574
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:42,976
Any sort of respect

2575
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:43,744
At all

2576
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,280
Time

2577
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:49,632
He is way smarter than Alex and that that isn't

2578
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:50,400
Example

2579
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:51,424
The way Alex

2580
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:58,080
Does the things in interviews where he says he's lying narratives and when the other person doesn't push back against who knows

2581
02:03:58,336 --> 02:03:59,104
Worrying good

2582
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:03,712
Yeah just let it slide

2583
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,784
Lebron James playing against

2584
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,552
College ball play

2585
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:08,576
I like this is

2586
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:11,904
The same in the same stratosphere

2587
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:15,232
Just a couple more clips

2588
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:16,000
To get through

2589
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:17,280
Next one

2590
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,888
Sister pretty Tarot

2591
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:40,576
Which has meaning their normalizing its

2592
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:41,600
Sky's the limit

2593
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:43,904
Russia

2594
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:46,208
Psychotic

2595
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:47,232
Alex

2596
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:48,512
Your guest for

2597
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:49,536
20 years

2598
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:52,608
Has been angling for a war with us

2599
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:53,632
Yeah

2600
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:56,448
Why are you talking about the Deep State trying to

2601
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:57,984
To create a war with Russia

2602
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:02,336
You have a Russian on your show who has the hero of Putin

2603
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:04,640
Or at least has for years I don't know what the current

2604
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:05,408
Situation is

2605
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:07,712
But he's been trying to

2606
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:08,992
The off on the week

2607
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:11,552
He's been trying to start a war with us

2608
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:14,880
Great

2609
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:16,672
Great it's

2610
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:17,440
Crazy

2611
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:24,096
When they actually do assassinated

2612
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:25,120
Yeah witches

2613
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:25,888
A witches

2614
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:33,312
Normalize would reunite the Soviet Union like and further Alex is trying to Norm

2615
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:34,848
Normalize also

2616
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:36,640
The idea of it

2617
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,688
They do

2618
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:40,736
And by the way I put agave in quote

2619
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:44,320
If Trump does get impeached or assassinated

2620
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:49,440
He's normalizing the idea that is all-out Civil War at that point

2621
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:52,000
Idea that we are

2622
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:52,768
Currently

2623
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:57,632
Hot Civil War

2624
02:05:58,656 --> 02:05:59,168
Savior

2625
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:01,216
Is taken down

2626
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:03,776
I'm looking for

2627
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:05,056
To tear down the Mexico

2628
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:05,824
Can border wall

2629
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:12,480
If you're if you're writing the history book

2630
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:14,528
Therapy

2631
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:15,552
Terrifying

2632
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:19,136
Terrifying

2633
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:24,000
Able to legitimately take some nights High Ground

2634
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:25,792
Not pleasant

2635
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:29,120
It's weird to listen to this episode in

2636
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:31,680
Because

2637
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:33,216
You don't like

2638
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:35,520
A lot of the terror that we deal with

2639
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:37,312
I can I can

2640
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:38,080
Can go home

2641
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:41,664
Processes

2642
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,200
Yeah this is

2643
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:45,504
Legitimately terrifying to the

2644
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:46,272
The point where

2645
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:48,064
It's deeply troubling

2646
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:52,160
I won't feel comfortable for days

2647
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:55,488
Yeah

2648
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,280
No you'll be fine

2649
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:01,888
Georgia Norway

2650
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:02,912
Whatever who cares

2651
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:06,496
Global us speaking like a globalist

2652
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:10,592
And this one is just

2653
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:12,128
Just a little bit of

2654
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:15,456
It's it's interesting cuz we're done

2655
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:16,480
Dugan now

2656
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:19,296
So a couple days ago

2657
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:21,600
Couple days ago back on the 3rd

2658
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:23,136
Mike cernovich

2659
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:26,208
Came out he released a video where he said

2660
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:28,256
That he is pivoting away from

2661
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:29,536
No longer on the truck

2662
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:34,400
So I'm glad I've been doing more gorilla mindset stuff

2663
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:35,168
The journalism

2664
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:38,752
I pivoted from a pro Trump unquote Journal

2665
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:40,032
I pivoted from

2666
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:44,128
Pro Trump guy to Amor journalistic guy and I'm going to keep making that pivot

2667
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:46,176
So whenever people think of me is like

2668
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:47,200
The pro Trump guy

2669
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:52,576
I don't want anymore guy

2670
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:56,672
A journalist commentator social media personality of filmmaker and author

2671
02:07:56,928 --> 02:08:00,256
But it's so far away from anything pro-trump

2672
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:02,304
I just got to keep going that way

2673
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:05,632
But lately

2674
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:08,192
I wish I told you

2675
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:09,984
And now the pivot is going to be even bigger

2676
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:14,336
Because what do you get from being a pro Trump guy right you sure

2677
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:18,176
He got in a fight with Alex

2678
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:19,712
That's what he said on the 3rd

2679
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:20,480
Yeah

2680
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:26,880
As you recall you recalled tell me

2681
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:31,744
Before this he was hosting the 4th once a week he was a very frequent

2682
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,536
Alex Jones

2683
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:37,632
He came up with the CNN is Isis

2684
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:38,656
Which Alex

2685
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:39,680
Blumaan

2686
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:40,704
Right

2687
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,752
Just got down on his knees

2688
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:46,080
I'd like to further.

2689
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:47,616
Pivoting

2690
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:51,200
I've been giving a little bit which I told you right

2691
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:52,992
Now the pivot is going to be even bigger

2692
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:56,320
What do you get from being a pro Trump guy got a shill for Trump all day

2693
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:59,136
I'm pivoting away from anything pro-trump

2694
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:05,024
No damn don't play the clip of him being on the show this is from August

2695
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:06,048
Forsook me

2696
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:13,472
Picture of Ash's house in the forest hours in a pop in without horses

2697
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,384
Of course than Trump

2698
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:25,504
Continue

2699
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,160
The first identified

2700
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:39,072
Don Jr

2701
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:43,936
The division between the two of them

2702
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:50,848
I don't want anyone to think of me as a pro Trump guy I'm going to

2703
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:55,712
Specifically reject any kind of brand pro-trump or whatever I'm going this way

2704
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:57,760
Big big pivot big big pivot

2705
02:09:58,016 --> 02:10:03,392
I've already made a bit of a little bit more now all the way over here that's where I am

2706
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:06,464
When the GOP Elite in the Deep State goes after Trump hard

2707
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:07,488
Who's going to have his back

2708
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:13,120
Do you gain anything by risking your reputation your career your business supporting Trump what's the upside

2709
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:15,936
So everything in life has an upside and downside

2710
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:19,520
So you go risky for Trump you might lose it all you a big downside

2711
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:21,824
Huge downside of trump what's the upside

2712
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:22,848
First of all

2713
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:24,384
Everything

2714
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,664
Mike cernovich

2715
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:29,504
I really just care about money I was just doing this for money the whole time

2716
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:32,576
I legitimately have no principles

2717
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:35,648
Secondly next

2718
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:37,184
4th power

2719
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:40,256
Queer propaganda outlet for Donald Trump

2720
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:44,864
And he's doing it to talk about how right he was about the McMasters lie

2721
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:46,656
And that's what brings me to my main

2722
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:49,216
It's not about

2723
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:52,032
The trouble thing was a way to make

2724
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:54,080
For Mike cernovich

2725
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:55,616
He just laid it out

2726
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:56,640
On his

2727
02:10:56,896 --> 02:11:00,224
F****** Periscope video that he put out where he pivots away

2728
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:00,992
From Trump

2729
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:03,296
Alex Jones made it clear in 25

2730
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:05,344
15 when we had that clip

2731
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:06,624
That episode

2732
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:08,416
We're f****** Joe Biggs

2733
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:09,952
Went to a trump rally

2734
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:12,256
And Alex Jones realize he could make a lot of money on

2735
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:14,816
The reason that Mike cernovich

2736
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:16,864
Is still doing the 4th hour

2737
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:18,400
To talk about is McMasters

2738
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,216
Because this globalist narrative

2739
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:22,752
Is more important to them

2740
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:23,776
Then

2741
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:25,312
Any of the little pieces

2742
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:27,104
Any of the

2743
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,128
Any of the details

2744
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,944
Doesn't matter about Trump doesn't matter about it

2745
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:31,968
Chatters about books

2746
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:32,992
No

2747
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:34,784
The book sales

2748
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:38,112
But the anti-semitism

2749
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:39,136
That wise be

2750
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:40,672
Behind the globalist Merida

2751
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:42,464
Is inescapable

2752
02:11:45,792 --> 02:11:47,072
It's metastasized into

2753
02:11:47,328 --> 02:11:47,840
Too full on white

2754
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:49,888
Like

2755
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,424
We walk hand-in-hand

2756
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:54,752
They do but anti-Semitism is much more

2757
02:11:55,776 --> 02:12:00,128
Picture of McMaster as a marionette

2758
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:03,200
And the person who had the strings of the marionette was Soros

2759
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:09,856
And then there was another marionette above bat

2760
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,648
That's all just

2761
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,208
Sucking this same nonsense narrative

2762
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:15,744
You really dig in

2763
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:19,072
Do not have nearly as much money as everybody for 10

2764
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:22,144
And the whole story of their Ascension to

2765
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,704
Our global banking

2766
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,496
Cartel that controls everything

2767
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:27,264
East

2768
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,032
Complete nonsense

2769
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:30,592
Historical

2770
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:32,384
And I am the same way that everyone

2771
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:35,968
It's right up there with everyone's anti

2772
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:37,504
Central Bank

2773
02:12:38,272 --> 02:12:39,552
Central Bank

2774
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:42,368
Is problematic as an idea but it didn't come around

2775
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:44,160
Just a way to be evil

2776
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:45,696
Same thing with Rothschild

2777
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:48,000
They were very successful for a bit

2778
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:51,584
And now their money has been diffused quite a bit they aren't nearly as rich as ever

2779
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:55,168
The greatest

2780
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,704
It comes

2781
02:12:57,216 --> 02:12:58,752
To anti-semitism

2782
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:00,032
The greatest lesson

2783
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:01,056
Nobody ever learn

2784
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:03,104
The death of G

2785
02:13:04,384 --> 02:13:04,896
Weather

2786
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:05,664
Don't

2787
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:08,480
Comes back to bite you

2788
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:10,784
Yeah 3 days later

2789
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:13,856
Well I mean

2790
02:13:15,392 --> 02:13:15,904
The Jews for

2791
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,184
No good reason

2792
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:20,000
I am firm in my

2793
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:21,536
Based on all the research

2794
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:23,072
What's that I've done about Alex Jones

2795
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:24,352
Does individual sources

2796
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:25,632
But he claims

2797
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:26,912
Approved globalism

2798
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:29,216
Just don't say what

2799
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:29,984
He says they say

2800
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,288
The things that

2801
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:34,080
Do you match up with the things

2802
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:34,848
He says

2803
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:36,640
Come from sources like

2804
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:37,920
The protocols of the elders

2805
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:39,968
Deeply auntie

2806
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:40,992
Systematic fraud

2807
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:41,760
Throughout history

2808
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:46,368
So I am over to mine

2809
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:47,904
Exactly

2810
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:53,792
I'm totally I'm of the mind that Alex Jones

2811
02:13:54,048 --> 02:13:54,560
Is

2812
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:56,608
Going it or not

2813
02:13:56,864 --> 02:13:58,656
Behold into a deeply anti

2814
02:13:58,912 --> 02:13:59,680
Do somatic worlds

2815
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,472
And

2816
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:03,008
A lot of these

2817
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:04,800
Johnny-come-lately

2818
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:06,336
The crnkovich is

2819
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:07,616
The jackdaw

2820
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:08,384
Episode

2821
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:09,408
Cassandra Fairbanks

2822
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,432
Is Lauren Southern

2823
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:11,968
These people

2824
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:13,504
Are falling right in the

2825
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:14,528
Gavin McInnes

2826
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:16,832
They're all just going along.

2827
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,112
The exact same ride

2828
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:19,648
There

2829
02:14:19,904 --> 02:14:20,416
Doing it

2830
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:24,000
Maybe more effectively maybe smarter

2831
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:28,096
Then Alex because there's the group

2832
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:32,448
Is just admitting it

2833
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:33,216
Out now

2834
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:36,800
But it wasn't good for Book Sales

2835
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:37,568
They are

2836
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:38,336
Much less

2837
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:43,200
You specifically says in that rent that

2838
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:49,856
The Trump mindset book didn't sell as well as a bog

2839
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:53,696
Trucking

2840
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:54,976
Have any

2841
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:58,304
Still fighting it

2842
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:01,376
Toxic masculinity identity sells far better than

2843
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:02,144
Then fighting Fortress

2844
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:03,936
Well because that's too much

2845
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:05,472
That's putting a hat on a hat

2846
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:07,008
Yeah you're

2847
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:09,312
Masculinity on top of toxic masculinity

2848
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:10,336
You don't need to do that

2849
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:12,384
That's a comedy error

2850
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:18,784
I don't know if I'm making my point fully

2851
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:19,808
Like

2852
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:21,344
This thing with cernovich

2853
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:22,880
Incredibly revealing

2854
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:25,184
But it exposes

2855
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,208
So much

2856
02:15:26,464 --> 02:15:28,256
It exposes a ton about Mike cernovich

2857
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:30,048
Like really meaningful

2858
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:30,816
For him

2859
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:32,352
The fact that he does this

2860
02:15:32,864 --> 02:15:34,912
Big big pivot away from Trump

2861
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:38,496
I reject all branding of me being pro Trump

2862
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:40,544
And then it rain later

2863
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:43,360
Doing the Infowars fourth hour

2864
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:46,176
Which is an out-and-out Trump propaganda

2865
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:48,224
Operation

2866
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:54,112
Like Alex had him stay

2867
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:55,904
Amway anti-trump

2868
02:15:57,696 --> 02:16:00,512
I'm free if I reject the Brandon

2869
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:13,056
Yeah but

2870
02:16:13,568 --> 02:16:16,128
Then I was 2 years back

2871
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:18,688
The long hangover

2872
02:16:19,456 --> 02:16:21,760
Rejecting that out of course or we still going

2873
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:30,208
I just I think that

2874
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:32,000
We never should have elected

2875
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:35,328
That's where it all began

2876
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:39,424
How we feeling

2877
02:16:39,936 --> 02:16:40,704
We doing okay

2878
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:42,752
You know where I'm at

2879
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:43,776
Here's where I'm at

2880
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:44,800
Where you at

2881
02:16:45,312 --> 02:16:46,592
I got too much going on

2882
02:16:46,848 --> 02:16:47,360
Inside my head

2883
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:49,152
In terms of a lot of these angles

2884
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:52,480
Very worried that I'm not laying it out

2885
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:54,528
In a way that makes

2886
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:57,344
I'm deeply worried that

2887
02:16:58,112 --> 02:16:59,648
It sounds like

2888
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:00,416
Rampant

2889
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,440
Conjecture

2890
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:02,208
And none

2891
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:06,816
There's no shortage

2892
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:08,096
On the internet

2893
02:17:08,352 --> 02:17:14,496
Right and I'm not trying to be Louise Mensch know I'm deeply critical of myself

2894
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:15,776
His much

2895
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:17,056
Even as I'm saying

2896
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:18,336
These things I like

2897
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:19,872
What are you doing

2898
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:21,408
And as soon as I post

2899
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:22,944
Post

2900
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:24,480
Course

2901
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:32,928
Used to get on everything

2902
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:33,696
Podcast

2903
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:40,352
Exactly what am I why am I hurting people

2904
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:41,632
Insecurities that is just

2905
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:43,680
From bad parenting

2906
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:45,728
Who knows and that's how we got food

2907
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:47,520
Who knows

2908
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:49,568
Let's not psychoanalyze everything

2909
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:52,128
Deeply

2910
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:52,896
Deeply

2911
02:17:53,152 --> 02:17:55,200
Deeply concerned about tooth

2912
02:17:55,712 --> 02:17:58,016
What is the big picture that we were talking about

2913
02:17:58,272 --> 02:18:00,320
About the Dugan and Alex

2914
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,112
Clear

2915
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:03,392
Pro-putin

2916
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:04,160
Possession

2917
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:06,976
That is incredibly troubling

2918
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:08,256
Because

2919
02:18:08,768 --> 02:18:09,792
Does matcha

2920
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:12,352
With what we saw in our last episode from 2

2921
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:13,376
Years in the past

2922
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:14,400
And there's a

2923
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:16,448
Chance that all of this has been

2924
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:17,728
Alex's

2925
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:18,752
Position the whole time

2926
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:19,776
And no one

2927
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:21,056
Realized

2928
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:25,152
Is not a Russian agent

2929
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:26,688
What is a Russian

2930
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:27,968
Mouthpiece

2931
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:28,992
More

2932
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:32,320
Maybe by flattery

2933
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:34,112
Because farison

2934
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:34,880
You know what

2935
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:35,648
He lived

2936
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:36,672
In America

2937
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:37,440
4

2938
02:18:37,696 --> 02:18:38,464
Top 2020

2939
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:39,744
Dean what would that be

2940
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:41,792
20 years 19

2941
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:43,584
Teen years doing radio and everyone thinking

2942
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:44,352
He's crazy

2943
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:45,632
Some Russian p

2944
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:47,424
People come around to be like your f****** awesome

2945
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:48,192
You got it

2946
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:49,472
You're so great

2947
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:50,496
Thanks

2948
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:53,056
Steve Russian propaganda that sounds a lot like him

2949
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:54,336
How is that not

2950
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:58,176
That's true that's super villain backstory

2951
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:01,504
Yeah so there's that

2952
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:03,552
Yeah there's that image that's in my head

2953
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:04,832
The honey pot

2954
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:06,368
Being told you're a good boy

2955
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:10,720
And then beyond that

2956
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:13,024
I mean the start of it s***

2957
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:14,816
I'm stoked

2958
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:16,608
I mean who cares really

2959
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:18,144
I'm torn between

2960
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:19,936
That whole pivot is fake

2961
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:22,752
That's all it's just absolutely

2962
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:25,824
Does a media stunt

2963
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:29,664
The other

2964
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:30,944
Maybe

2965
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:31,712
Yeah maybe

2966
02:19:32,224 --> 02:19:34,528
But it's possible that he's being since

2967
02:19:34,784 --> 02:19:35,296
Sear

2968
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:39,392
But then he still will be on Infowars because

2969
02:19:39,904 --> 02:19:41,696
He still believes in the globalist

2970
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:43,488
Anything

2971
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:45,536
But he can exist on Infowars

2972
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:47,840
And not be branded as pro-trump

2973
02:19:48,096 --> 02:19:49,888
Which I'm here to tell you you can't

2974
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:50,656
You cannot do

2975
02:19:50,912 --> 02:19:51,424
But

2976
02:19:52,192 --> 02:19:52,704
Heimlich

2977
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:54,240
If that is

2978
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:55,008
Case

2979
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:56,544
That's even more trouble

2980
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:58,848
Because

2981
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:00,384
How many globalist

2982
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:01,152
Are real

2983
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:02,432
And

2984
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:05,248
Don't give me that way

2985
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:07,296
You know damn well

2986
02:20:07,552 --> 02:20:09,088
It's an audio podcast

2987
02:20:09,344 --> 02:20:10,112
I just

2988
02:20:10,368 --> 02:20:10,880
Razor

2989
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:14,720
A raised Brown people's Brown

2990
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,792
I just I just don't know what to do with it

2991
02:20:18,048 --> 02:20:18,816
That I don't know what

2992
02:20:19,072 --> 02:20:19,584
To do it

2993
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:20,864
I'm not ready

2994
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:21,632
I'm not ready

2995
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:23,680
Need to deal with the idea of their

2996
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:24,960
Being jumped

2997
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:26,240
Out-and-out

2998
02:20:27,264 --> 02:20:28,544
Anti globalist

2999
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:31,360
Propaganda Network

3000
02:20:31,872 --> 02:20:35,456
Where is Alex Jones allows someone who's not pro Trump

3001
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:36,224
To be on it

3002
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:37,504
Like

3003
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:38,784
For me is

3004
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:40,064
It's scary

3005
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:41,088
But it's fast

3006
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:44,160
It'll be it'll be

3007
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:45,440
Be interesting to see how

3008
02:20:45,696 --> 02:20:46,464
Influences

3009
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:47,232
Who here

3010
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:49,024
So imagine cernovich

3011
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:49,792
Just pivot

3012
02:20:51,584 --> 02:20:53,376
Real not because he doesn't

3013
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:55,168
But just because

3014
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,216
Why would I align myself with Trump

3015
02:20:57,728 --> 02:20:59,008
Clearly disintegrating

3016
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:00,288
Right right

3017
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:01,056
So

3018
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:02,592
If that is true

3019
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:04,640
Then his argument to Alex

3020
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:06,944
Is one again of Craven

3021
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:09,504
Opportunistic

3022
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:16,672
So he and Alex have a conversation

3023
02:21:20,256 --> 02:21:21,024
Alexei

3024
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:22,304
My audience

3025
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:23,584
Show pro-trump

3026
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:24,352
I can't pee

3027
02:21:26,912 --> 02:21:28,704
It's a smart move money-wise

3028
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:29,984
In the long-term

3029
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:31,776
But I can't not

3030
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:34,592
You know like for me to sell books I have

3031
02:21:34,848 --> 02:21:35,360
Tubi

3032
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:36,640
Divorced

3033
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:38,688
YouTube

3034
02:21:38,944 --> 02:21:40,224
You have to be on board with

3035
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:41,760
You know what though

3036
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:43,552
This pivot didn't

3037
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:44,832
Come six months

3038
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:47,136
From cernovich

3039
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:48,672
Do you know what I bet

3040
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:51,232
I bet his book sales work great

3041
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:52,000
Initially

3042
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:53,792
And they're terrible now

3043
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:56,608
So they dropped off because everybody hate

3044
02:21:57,376 --> 02:21:57,888
Right

3045
02:21:58,656 --> 02:22:01,984
The argument that Alex could make about long-term

3046
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:02,752
Farm stuff

3047
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:04,032
Holds no water

3048
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:06,336
And I would argue

3049
02:22:09,664 --> 02:22:10,176
Long-term

3050
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,480
Yeah but Alex saying

3051
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:16,832
If I pay bills

3052
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:18,368
Everything is over

3053
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:24,000
To take months

3054
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:24,768
Stop it

3055
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:25,536
Cernovich

3056
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:26,304
Came up with

3057
02:22:28,608 --> 02:22:29,376
He is a Wonder

3058
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:31,168
In terms of like

3059
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:33,984
This guy is an idea.

3060
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:35,264
Alex Jones

3061
02:22:36,544 --> 02:22:37,312

3065
02:22:44,992 --> 02:22:48,832
Together they snort two lines that super male Vitality they can come up with

3066
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:49,856
Let's get out of this thing

3067
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:50,624
Real quick

3068
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:54,720
Because Alex Jones for the last couple years

3069
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:56,256
Has been beholden

3070
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:58,560

3071
02:22:58,816 --> 02:23:00,608

Representative of that

3074
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:09,312
I don't want this to be the truth

3075
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:14,688
Propagate likes about him

3076
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:21,344
That cookies the hold into stuff in the same way that Alex is but

3077
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:22,624
He's also just a s*** head

3078

3105
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:27,904
