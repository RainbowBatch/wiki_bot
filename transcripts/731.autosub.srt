00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Need money

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

6
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:03,488
Acknowledge

7
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,304
Worship at the altar of Selena little bit about Alex

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,912
Jules Jordan

9
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,240
What's up

10
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,288
Furious Furious spot

11
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
Nobody tell me

12
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
That guy

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,992
Here's a couple years ago alright alright

14
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,320
There was a movie version of the color out of space

15
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,720
Not my favorite HP Lovecraft story but it is a a lovecraftian tale okay

16
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,512
Nicolas Cage

17
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Play what's it called

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
The Colorado

19
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,864
How is it called that

20
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520
Webkinz lamb the story I know that but I mean like I feel like if it was the name of an HP Lovecraft property

21
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
I would have at least known it existed

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,712
You mean like the story itself one of the better

23
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
Lovecraft stories

24
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
All things

25
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Inconsiderate

26
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,856
Nicolas Cage

27
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
Starring in a weird craft movie did you see it no

28
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,840
No one told me

29
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
I mean

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
Look

31
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Clearly

32
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,800
Dicey in their own ways

33
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,872
A match made in regular space

34
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
Yes

35
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
Strike me as a

36
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,760
Is an arena where cage could really tee-off

37
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,136
Make a really bizarre performance

38
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,232
Cuz like you know all look nice in protagonist or sexually losing their mind

39
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,304
I'm going crazy to play

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
Yeah especially as time goes on they don't get better and not like a uplifting tale I'm sure it sucks

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
Good movies bad but I'm going to watch Adventureland on Madden 12

42
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:57,664
Anyway what's your spot is my partner and I we finally got into succession

43
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
That HBO show about the rich people

44
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
Battling Nicolas Cage

45
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,344
That'd be great I've heard a lot about that

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,744
I thought it said I think what's interesting about it is they're trying a thing I'm going to do like

47
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
Play if you think about the office

48
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
It's that kind of workplace

49
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,912
Please, do you know what's what's fun about it is that you have paid those for all the

50
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:24,800
The awkward situations only like affect you because you're like I care about that person

51
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Like they're playing is

52
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,896
Game of Auntie pesos where you're really here like

53
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,200
You watch something terrible happening to your like

54
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
That's pretty funny

55
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,576
All right you know but they're not falling down and said they're like losing money

56
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,976
Okay you know what I'm saying it's good clean fun

57
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,768
Volume

58
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
It's like all he lost a million dollars I f*** you

59
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,752
But I'm glad you're enjoying it

60
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,128
So Jordan today we have a situation that may lead to someone else losing

61
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,456
Million or so dollars or

62
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
Talking about the end of last week Thursday and Friday September 29th and 3rd

00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Big something big happened

67
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
On Thursday

68
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,375
It's it's it's not he's at he is a lunatic

69
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
I don't know why

70
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
I can build this up

71
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,615
A hundred times over and it is still unbelievable vampire

72
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
Amanda Friday

73
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
That is what it is

74
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,319
It's a little bigoted but hate look Thursday wouldn't be enough to talk about so

75
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,903
Attack on Friday

76
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
Monumental Monumental thing happens and then it's just a waste line

77
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
I want

78
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,471
I want to f****** AAA Jimmy Kimmel to walk out me like less

79
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127
We got one really good guessing that we had to pad out the show I'm sorry I look tonight

80
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,223
You know it and I know it

81
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
I feel

82
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,343
I don't know why you're so surprised I feel like I've said this many times before like

83
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,695
Most important surprise I enjoy it

84
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:23,071
Before we do Jordan let's say hello to the new one

85
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,911
The first Jordans

86
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,775
Play the show you how far back we are

87
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,359
Not great

So next to Becky I told you I would make you a supporter three exclamation points in a policy wonk

89
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,391
Text Mark Moran PhD

94
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:13,759

00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Like this much

100
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
You and I are attacked

101
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
I have

102
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Risen above

103
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
Go take a little break you down

104
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,503
A little breaking for me

105
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
And then we're going to

106
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Comeback

107
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
And I'm going to start the show over

108
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
F*** you

109
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
At the end of the day

110
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
F*** you and your new world order

111
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215

00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
Maybe today

114
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Check out of here tomorrow

115
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
And you never see me again

116
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
I never want to come back

117
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
Apologize

118
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
Yesterday that I

119
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,951
Was legitimately having break

120
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
Bounce on air

121
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
Better tomorrow he's not

122
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,863
Bono's real bad

123
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,935
So Jordan restart off on the Thursday show

124
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
Responding to

125
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,055
Some of the big news of the day obviously hurricane Ian

126
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,919
What is an implied right and also Kamala Harris

127
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Made some

128
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
Mistake

129
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,039
Images of shark swimming down the highways

130
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
Water flooding into the second

131
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
Floor

132
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
Hotels is

133
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Dramatic

134
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
We will be

135
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Going over

136
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Eventbrite

137
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,863
In Florida and then looking at

138
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Like The View

139
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,287
Saying that this happened because the Santos was elected

140
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
Now do you think that idiocy

141
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Cannot be taught

142
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
Kamala Harris

143
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
Not.

144
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Later on

145
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
Set of

146
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Dementia

147
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
Complete

148
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
Puppet

149
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
Has come out

150
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,559
I said that the United States relationship

151
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
With an alliance

152
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
Republic of North Korea

153
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
We are currently

154
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
War with North Korea

155
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
Since the armistice

156
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
The ceasefire

157
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Back in the nineteen

158
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
50s

159
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,407
Are we still at war with North Korea

160
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,247
Congratulations you just learned something I'm not sure if anyone

161
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,831
In the world let alone The View are blaming DeSantis for the hurricane

162
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
If you want to hear something crazy

163
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:06,047
Go back in time and listen to what dr. James Dobson thinks about what year was Hurricane Alex actually plays the clip

164
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
Map of The View later they're just

165
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
Saying that

166
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,703
He doesn't believe in climate change right Auntie is the governor of a state

167
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
It's just a b track hurricane not mean that he's blaming

168
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
Now he's being blamed

169
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
For it now

170
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:24,479
I wouldn't be too surprised it too it's like people were curious because going to continue kidnapping emigrants and stranding them in various parts

171
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,319
Parts of the country to own the libs during the storm or if you would wait until it it

172
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
To do another publicity

173
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
We stopped at Mox

174
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
Human rights

175
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,535
It's fun at all to point out that the Harris misspoke in his speech and I'm glad Alex can have fun pretending it was a sincere

176
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
Statement

177
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,447
I would just like to remind everyone how pumped Alex was when Trump went to North Korea and prowled around with Kim Jeong Hoon

178
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,031
House didn't seem to have a problem with Trump when he's

179
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,615
This about Kim Jeong Hoon at O'Reilly in 2018

180
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,175
Quote we went back and forth

181
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
When we fell in love

182
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,551
He wrote me beautiful letters and they were great letters we fell in love

183
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Yep

184
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
I remember that

185
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,023
Every time you think about those years that 2016 to 2020 and people tell you a thing that happened in Hugo

186
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,423
No it did this is maybe just maybe complete bulshit manufacture

187
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,263
Outrage on Alex's part about this

188
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,615
It is a really easy strawman for him to tee off against which is easier than him trying

189
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
How to do his actual job

190
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
I'm better off for him

191
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
I mean

192
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,551
She was in the DMZ three misspoke

193
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:37,951
I made it sucks yeah you'd rather someone not make a mistake but pretending that she actually thinks we're in a f****** alliance with no

194
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
North Korea's meticulous

195
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
Ed

196
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Is it that

197
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
That's absurd

198
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
That's absurd

199
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
I don't even know how to begin to like

200
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,263
Oh man look at that idiot I mean that's too obvious

201
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,895
Yeah man we're in alliance against the death robots from

202
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:03,039
Times that I could waste our time with like Alex misspoke

203
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
And like I just

204
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
I would feel bad

205
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,415
The level of Lake

206
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
Point that you're making

207
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
Early days he had that clip that he would play that bad

208
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:22,751
Nancy Pelosi Miss speaking like a like a ray of stuff you could do that in a heartbeat

209
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
4 hours

210
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
I just like I hear it

211
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,175
Say stuff it's like oh I know what he meant he just said the wrong thing

212
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
Bright and I don't even cut those clips

213
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
What is the time

214
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,295
Zacks wasting time

215
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Grayson Arts

216
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
Has big news also of

217
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
Non misspeaking

218
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
Types and that is pipeline news

219
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,863
That's happening every front now with the Nordstrom one and Nordstrom

220
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
To pipeline

221
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
Confirm to be attacked

222
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
Western control sectors Russian government

223
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
We sang

224
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
The I even had

225
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
Rusev

226
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,783
Ion

227
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
Commodus Russian anthem

228
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
Russian

229
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Peter Gracie analysis

230
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Clear

231
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
The New World Order blew up

232
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,095
Looks like northstream to they're saying can never be repaired

233
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,935
Economically to Europe will be Beyond devastating

234
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
It'll be felt here in a big way

235
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,383
Joel skousen doesn't like Russia that is true but he's also cripplingly addicted to calling everything that happens in the world

236
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,455
False flag so I really don't see how this is a meaning.

237
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
From Alex

238
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
We're from scouts and it's exactly what you would expect

239
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:44,927
Now the situation with the pipelines is an interesting one and it's something to keep an eye on but it would be unwise to fully jump to

240
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
Conclusion about it immediately

241
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
Which is what Alex and skousen

242
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Clearly.

243
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
And always

244
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,167
There were three leaks which were clearly not the product of an accident or coincidence

245
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:00,543
The odds of three independent incidents happening around the same time or astronomical so it's just

246
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,359
You know it it's not just Russia but saying

247
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,967
Probably isn't intentional act and NATO are also saying

248
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
Wow I mean one of the

249
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
Leaks was in the shape of

250
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:16,159
The Batman logo

251
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Rapoport

252
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,023
It was done by someone for some reason

253
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,583
But it's not really clear right now who it was or why

254
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,399
Most people think it was Russia for a number of

255
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
The first is that they have the capability and

256
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Capacity to do it from a technological

257
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Call Stan point

258
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,591
The second is that they would lose essentially nothing

259
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,687
And given that their oil companies are sanctioned in these pipelines are all but shut down curve

260
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
The third is that

261
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:46,623
Kind of gesture would send a strong message to the whole of Europe that they're not going to be getting Russia's oil in the future

262
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,951
Even if the war ends there at the mercy of Russia's energy

263
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Bee supplies

264
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:56,607
This is in line with act that Russia has carried out in the past using energy as a tool to apply pressure on Europe

265
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
To sway policy

266
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,055
Give me a minute this isn't going to make things that much worse it all per Europe in terms of energy supplies

267
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,895
Nordstream2 was never open so it doesn't really factor into things

268
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,479
Russia cut off Nordstrom lawn over the course of the war

269
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Can you cry

270
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,135
This is more of an omen than anything else in there were very few parties you could imagine having a reason to do this

271
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Other than Rush

272
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,255
Right right it is possible that this is the result of a wild coincidence

273
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:28,351
Or even a rogue actor that we haven't identified could be behind it but

274
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
The smart money

275
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
It's pretty clear well I will say that

276
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,007
My bachelor party got out of control and so we went

277
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
And I know

278
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,431
Sometimes you're you're out you're having a nice little walk with your buddies you see a pipeline

279
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,783
You're like I got to pee and then you poke at it cuz you're just f****** around and then bam

280
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
Sometimes your friends are like let's go to the strip club and it's sometimes friends are like let's go to the casino

281
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
Standard

282
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,815
Strip clubs name was pipeline

283
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:04,447
Plot of Hangover for I believe

284
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
Global global relations

285
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
But here's the problem like when

286
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
Start thinking about things being

287
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
False Flags

288
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
By the way Alex and skousen

289
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:21,087
From a neutral perspective you would have a hard time figuring out why the us or NATO would want to do

290
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
Something like a taxi pipeline

291
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,695
There really isn't a reason for them to do it

292
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,023
But Russia does have some potential reasons to

293
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
Carry this out

294
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
And now if you

295
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,935
You're addicted to false Flags you found a reason for the US tornado to do it

296
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,031
They have no reason to do it but Russia does and now they have a reason

297
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
Which is the frame Russia

298
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,895
This is tortured reasoning and it's based on Alex

299
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,015
Thousands intense hatred of our government because they think it's controlled by evil communist globalist

300
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
You know did they

301
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:58,207
And into these pretzels in order to create motive out of absence of motive

302
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,815
They create motive for party a even though party B has more poker

303
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
Just that it's torture

304
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,935
I made for their there they're like all argument for the globalist

305
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,495
This is like essentially cui Bono you know just like

306
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:16,895
Follow the money and it's like well the money points to Russia

307
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,711
That's how you know that it wasn't that because

308
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:26,111
Is benefiting Russia to trick them into thinking that

309
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Classic

310
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
Maybe don did it

311
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Somebody did it

312
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
So why Biden

313
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Also sucks

314
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,631
And everyone wants you to eat bugs

315
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
And we have a president

316
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
The month ago

317
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
Look like he had

318
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Leave

319
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
Second phase

320
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
Planet Nissan

321
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,807
But don't worry he's got control of nuclear weapons

322
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,391
This is where we live this is what's happening

323
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
And now there are

324
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Government

325
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
In the UK

326
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
Australia Germany

327
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
And now the US government

328
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,679
Is promising to put bugs in the schoolchildren food oh

329
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,007
You don't want to bug as an adult was a child you'll be made to eat it

330
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
Sheraton or the shell

331
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
There there there there there

332
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Shell

333
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
The

334
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Bob

335
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
Extremely toxic

336
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,951
Extremely bad for you and causes liver failure

337
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
Amongst all the other wonderful things

338
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,863
There's a Washington Post insects a nutritious ingredients

339
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
Rolled out

340
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,263
Eat the bugs UK school children fed insects to encourage

341
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
Nobility is for the Earth

342
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
Has bugs and insects

343
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
Horsefeathers children

344
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,455
1000 Australian Public Schools

345
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,527
The article that Alex's siding with the headline insect

346
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,111
What's a nutritious ingredient for school lunches is from the washer

347
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Canton post

348
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,463
But it's also from May 13th 2013 so close

349
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
It also ends with a?

350
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,655
It's just a write-up about a report released by the UN food and agriculture organization that looked at Edible insects around the world

351
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,239
World and what potential existed from exploring insect agriculture

352
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
It wasn't about feeding kids

353
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,847
The bugs a large portion of it is about raising bugs

354
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,455
To use as feed for livestock but as a headline

355
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,039
Provide a decade ago and he's using it to make s*** up to freak out izadi

356
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Yeah

357
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:38,207
The headline about u.k. school children is from a May 2022 article on Breitbart that Miss reports on a study that

358
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
Researchers were carrying out

359
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,583
To see if primary school children would change their opinions on alternative proteins

360
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
If they were given

361
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
Accurate information

362
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
About them

363
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
No one's being forced to eat bugs

364
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,215
Isn't there School lunch

365
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,775
What if we didn't lie to children

366
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,847
The wef headline Alex reads is even weaker

367
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,503
This is a newspunch article just trying to report to Their audience the class guava wfr tricking kids in Australia

368
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
Schools that enforce feeding them bugs

369
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:09,183
You can hear how Alex is reporting this story which is how the article wants the reader to experience

370
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,791
In the real world what's happened is that there's a brand of chips and snacks called

371
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Circle Harvey

372
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
And they use Cricket protein

373
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
In there

374
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,239
It's very prominently displayed on the packaging with the name of the product being

375
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Cricket

376
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,567
Chips

377
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,919
Circle Harvest has been holding presentations at school since 2000

378
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,247
7 about their intake protein business and their insect farming which

379
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,343
Weirdly is only now becoming an issue for Alex and all these other idiots on the right

380
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,999
This year they began selling their corn chips as an option in about 1,000 Australian schools at the canteen

381
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
Two kids want to eat them

382
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
Cam

383
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
They don't have to

384
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,167
Start a product they can choose to buy or not like Doritos

385
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
Sortino's

386
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,287
Feels to me like Alex is afraid of losing to bugs on the free market

387
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
You know

388
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,663
I just wish it's I think it's time I think we're grown-up enough

389
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,735
For everybody to just like come out be like listen

390
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
Eventually we're eating bug

391
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,623
Climate changes destroyed your food supply you f***** up

392
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
We've got nothing

393
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,695
But there's a lot of bugs

394
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,535
Just deal with it and also like

395
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
I mean not for nothing

396
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,887
A lot of these particles you can find make a point

397
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
You're already

398
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,983
Just based on how processing works

399
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
How big agriculture works

400
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
How

401
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
Packaging works

402
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
There are

403
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,175
Regulations in place yet but their regulations that are like

404
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Sorry, few but

405
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:41,855
0

406
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
It lives under the water a lot of stuff is culturally dictated please taboos and what have you

407
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Bug you're going

408
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:54,143
Now as far as keratin goes Alex's confusing the bug related form of that and

409
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
Keratin

410
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727
That's what prior is a food source

411
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
It's not toxic but the latter is a

412
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
The cosmological

413
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Treatment that uses

414
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
The cream containing formaldehyde

415
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Which can be toxic

416
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
60 people

417
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
Her cause negative

418
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:12,831
It's not the Keratin itself it's toxic it's the formaldehyde cream that's being used to treat

419
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,367
Human keratin like

420
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
A person's hair

421
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,976
There's been a lot of misinformation flying around about chitin

422
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,048
The polysaccharide founded bug exoskeleton

423
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,120
It's mostly about how it's undigested bull by humans and talk

424
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,936
It's not toxic but it is true that chitin

425
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
And itself may not be

426
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
Be fully digestible

427
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
What's so cellular

428
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
Switch doesn't stop people from eating celery

429
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
You can still get nutritional value out of eating something that contains parts that can't be fully digested and then you just passed those parts

430
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
It's actually good

431
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,552
For you like how people need fiber

432
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Just a regular

433
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,648
Yeah what would you rather like have to swallow Rock

434
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
And have

435
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,488
Them like deal with the food inside you and then

436
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,280
Speed up the Rock's like

437
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:59,424
Depends on if crazy right-wing people got into rocks

438
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:06,080
Yeah it's kind of hilarious to me they were in 2022 is becoming a core part of some people's identity and political ideology

439
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
They're mad about the idea of

440
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
Bugs being edible

441
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,688
Ridiculous

442
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Children

443
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
You're going to eat

444
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
You're just gonna

445
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
Whip whip

446
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:21,952
Is it in 20 minutes you only bug

447
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:27,328
Y'all. Lamented diets to the pills

448
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,120
And we'll just have two or three pills and will

449
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,704
Bring it to me

450
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,008
I will say though that

451
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
I'm a picky

452
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,384
You are and I don't eat fish now right

453
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,808
I'm opposed to eating bugs for a completely different reason

454
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,648
Mostly just eat chicken

455
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
Looking down the barrel of a bug

456
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
You're going to you're going to have different feelings

457
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,536
I guess actually if you

458
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,328
Just ground up bugs

459
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,728
And stuff like that the cricket is used in cricket corn chips

460
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:12,128
Flour substitute

461
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:18,528
Yeah I just feel like

462
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
I think the problem is

463
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,856
Give the problem is you can't

464
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
Like

465
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,744
For most people psychologically it's a difficult thing to get over the idea of

466
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Eating a bug

467
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:34,400
So the knowledge of eating the bug will influence the taste that you are experienced roof

468
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,752
When you're eating like a whole bug

469
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,336
Of course that's not great not appealing to

470
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,384
What if you were just to bite a chicken

471
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
Look like

472
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,016
It would believe you

473
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,064
That would be on Advertising to

474
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Sure

475
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:58,976
Prosthetic lie like a real bunch of

476
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,048
Cockroaches are the table there like a high these have been

477
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
Butchered correctly

478
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
That's true

479
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,192
PewDiePie

480
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,800
That's coming that is what they listen you're going to eat bugs you're going to have tiny hands

481
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,080
That's what's going to happen

482
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,152
Evolution will dictate that this is where we're going

483
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
That works

484
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:21,504
So we got the covid headline other day baby

485
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,040
I'm continuing

486
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
Massive

487
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,368
Poison shot down as the coven

488
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,952
Unbelievably powerful

489
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,256
I am more than 15 new studies

490
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
And match reports

491
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,072
Popsockets going public

492
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,168
I'm going to give you those headlines here's the first one

493
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,264
Increases infection Risk by 44% Oxford

494
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Study

495
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,336
Do that but it gets worse

496
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
Oh man

497
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,200
Does a dumb blog headline that Alex's reading it isn't accurate at all

498
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,784
The actual study that's behind this is titled

499
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,184
Associations of BMI with covid-19 vaccine uptake vaccine Effectiveness and risk of severe covid-19

500
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,488
How comes after vaccination in England

501
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,536
A population-based cohort study

502
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:10,656
If you understand the title you'll probably realize that this study would never be able to be used

503
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,704
To make a kind of claims Alex's reporting it

504
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
It's just not something they're looking

505
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:21,408
Lead stories reached out to the study's co-author and they explained that this interpretation of their data is irresponsible and in

506
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,760
There's one databox in the study that's being used to argue that vaccines

507
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,064
He's caused a 44% increased risk of

508
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,928
Infection and if you only look at the numbers and isolation and create your own interpretation you could

509
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,280
Maybe come away with that conclusion but it's totally out of context and wrong

510
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,632
This was an observational study which is to say it depends entirely on test

511
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
That I've already been taken

512
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,216
As explained by lead stories

513
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,776
Quote their data was depended on covid test

514
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,592
That were available to them and the people who chose to take them

515
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
In other words

516
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
A person who did

517
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,200
Didn't feel sick and didn't take a test wouldn't be able to

518
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,016
Provide with them with a negative test result

519
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,296
So the data is

520
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,344
Yulieski that is an issue

521
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:08,000
As we see everyday Alex has a new covid vaccine narrative that's easily dismissed

522
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
Innovative digging

523
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,328
He never looked for any explanation or context

524
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
Because he doesn't want it

525
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:17,216
That would ruin his ability to keep throwing out these vaccine narratives of the day which he needs

526
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Skip his audience

527
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
In a focused

528
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Scared stage

529
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:25,408
Constantly seeing new classy headlines scroll past them

530
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,992
It'll be forgotten tomorrow the next day that'll be something new

531
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,576
Imagine all the scientist get-together at

532
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
My conferences

533
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
Just kind of like

534
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,440
Start conversation with

535
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
How they lie about your work

536
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:45,376
What were the Levites Ally on this one all they couldn't read numbers yeah yeah yeah

537
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,776
Good read numbers how many times have you tried to operate in good faith and explain the people are wrong

538
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:56,640
Only for them to not listen and continue creating computers and theories out of your life's work

539
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
You know what I miss

540
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,944
Blow your mind

541
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
I thought if I

542
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
Explained it they would hear me

543
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,064
Hahaha what a fool I was

544
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,624
We were all young once

545
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,976
We got the pipeline

546
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280

547
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560

There are some things that are

564
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
What you say

565
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448

00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
Whiskey Barn bacon

569
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152

Just don't be lazy what happened

578
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Everything else they tell you is a lie

579
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
What

580
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328

The hot oil is what's the problem is that hot oil you want to bake it

587
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
And then you'll be healthy

588
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
You can eat your bacon

589
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,280
And be healthy if you bake

590
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
Yeah that was a little weird

591
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,680

593
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,056

594
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968
Wake up the station

595
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,272

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,768
Piling onto this tragedy

601
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,072

Just getting hit

606
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,616
One of the worst hurricane

607
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,456
Thanks to hurricane

608
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,248
Exxon climate change

609
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,112
This is superstition this is this is

610
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,952
That's why they've dumb people down the school system by Design it's in the garbage documents

611
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
Batman

612
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
I just I like

613
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:58,656
Be idea that Alex is trying to take some moral High Ground over alleged Superstition and hoodoo

614
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:03,008
Is misrepresenting what they even said on this

615
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,872
Idiots who would think that his beliefs on climate change are causing this

616
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:14,784
Weather weapons morons least weather weapons have a cause-and-effect

617
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,416
Relationship is supposed to his belief that God has doomed our planet because of abortion

618
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,440
Well you did

619
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:27,840
Remove his protection get a reprieve for a while I think that's over though maybe mother

620
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,400
Forever moved her protection from Florida because

621
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:34,240
Do scientists believe climate change the same thing

622
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,568
Do God and Mother Earth have different protections as they can

623
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,104
Are they like company

624
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,456
I'm just saying that I would screens don't spiritual cause and effect nonsense all the time

625
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
All ridiculous

626
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
Ridiculous

627
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,808
At this point Alex does devolve

628
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,600
Into a condescending lecture about weather

629
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
I'm not going to play it

630
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
Idaho

631
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,464
Feel like he understands weather

632
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,608
Did you know that a typhoon is the same thing as a hurricane in another place

633
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,656
It's basically just that

634
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
He's as this which I thought was

635
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,008
Time lapse of storms on Jupiter

636
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,872
Are storms maximum speed is about 170 miles an hour

637
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,968
The storms on Jupiter

638
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,040
Get up to several thousand miles an hour

639
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,856
Boy you would want to be in one of those

640
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,352
A lot of reasons I would want to be on the store and then to putter

641
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:38,752
I have not heard that

642
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:45,152
I have not heard the snow like a bit back in my day we just have to walk 5 miles at every

643
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,200
Directions to the Moon

644
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:51,552
With your climate change making storms worse nonsense you see Jupiter

645
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,648
Crazy God 11

646
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928

647
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,232
No I've no I would

648
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,560

696
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,968
They would start having people from the health services defect

697
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
That was wrong to do

698
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,576
Animal into years of releasing the deadly vaccine

699
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,928
Admit

700
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
That it didn't work

701
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,048
They would remove the heads of big Pharma

702
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
Punishment

703
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,144
But that there wasn't be a biomedical State brought in

704
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Two basic

705
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
We oversee all a big Pharma

706
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,128
Play describe the whole process and how they're going to hit us

707
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
Either going to kill us

708
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
Away with it

709
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:32,320
None of that is at all accurate about the sparse scenario exercise

710
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,672
How to just making up pretty much everything you saying about it there's a good reason why

711
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:42,560
He needs this document to be prophetic but more importantly he needs to be prophetic for his

712
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,584
Fake reality

713
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
But he's constructed for his body

714
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:51,008
The document doesn't say any of that stuff but these are the narratives that have gained prominence in Alex's world

715
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:55,872
So they're the things that he needs to retroactively applied to this scenario exercise

716
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,432
Roset doesn't really have that much use for him

717
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,272
Bars much like lockstep isn't actually useful

718
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,344
For Alex if you read them and understand what they are

719
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,904
They only have utility as ideas

720
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,976
Skeletons that he can build a body onto himself

721
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,560
It's one of the reasons that scenario exercises as a whole

722
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,376
Super popular among conspiracy theorists like Alex

723
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
They portray imagined

724
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
Future events

725
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,496
Explain the scenario using a narrative

726
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
These are things that Alex can exploit

727
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:30,688
He can take the actual document and lie about the Imagine future events and how they line up with

728
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
Current real event

729
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,624
He can write his own narrative to replace the one that actually exists in the document pretty safe in the knowledge that if anyone called

730
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
I'm out about it

731
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:44,512
It's just a matter of Storytelling to convince them that his narrative is secretly with the document is at

732
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
Chili about

733
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:51,424
None of this is real and it doesn't even match past versions of the sparse document conspiracy Alex's spread

734
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,752
Google just meaningless s*** whose end result is really just

735
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
Getting people hurt

736
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,384
Yeah if I was one of those secret agents or whatever

737
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,968
If I was one of those operatives who got caught with the plan

738
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
Right

739
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
I would be like

740
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:13,696
Isn't this plan so terrible no one would try it what a funny plan this is

741
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,000
What's a duck idiot would make this

742
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:16,768
Dumb

743
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:21,376
F****** plan-b standard conspiracy theorists

744
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
Scenario

745
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,216
Exercise kind of

746
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,240
Drill

747
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,264
Bass

748
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:32,896
The explanation the real Attack

749
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
Right right right

750
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,736
It's. So have you considered

751
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,552
The idea that this organization

752
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,856
Were they real would want to plan that work

753
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
Would have you would now

754
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,928
It does listen to me

755
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,208
Follow me on this

756
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
Maybe if after these

757
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
Decades

758
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
I suppose

759
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
Millennia it Alex's world

760
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
Of failures

761
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
They be like let's hire

762
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,192
Some Consulting

763
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,776
I'm just really streamline this process perfect

764
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
Perfect answer

765
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,616
They didn't count on Alex

766
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:07,456
Really don't think that's the case Alex has been too successful

767
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:12,576
I tried to recruit him when he was younger behind the devil can see the future in knew that Alex

768
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,368
Is going to be super successful

769
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
See if I'm the devil

770
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,976
With my plan

771
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Aibeile

772
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,304
I've been working on this

773
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,424
Spore but I got to go

774
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,984
Classic Disney's Hercules Hades had a problem with

775
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,568
What's Hercules didn't didn't die you just f******

776
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,640
Bail on your plant you already know you lost

777
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:41,504
Tom the fucken devil I can try again

778
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:48,160
I'll wait him out he will be dead soon Alex f****** my plans up I'm not going to keep it going with him

779
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Stupid

780
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
The terrible idea

781
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,256
So Alex

782
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,536
Some calls

783
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:57,120
And one of them has a pretty interesting point that Alex.

784
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Does not like

785
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,936
Hey what's up Alex

786
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,984
Brother

787
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:10,176
They didn't she get in trouble two weeks you're still promoting the big vaccine salesman the guy that fluent

788
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
Explain why you doing that

789
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,064
Oh yeah

790
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
And I've been really against Trump on that

791
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,464
He flew on a flight from New York to Florida

792
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
On a chartered flight with Epstein

793
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,536
He never flew

794
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:30,144
Whoa whoa whoa

795
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,592
Disagree

796
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,384
But I'm not going to

797
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
So you can talk

798
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,784
Cal flies you do through them

799
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,112
Trump did not ever fly Lolita Express

800
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,904
The little Saint Johns Island

801
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,184
He did fly

802
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
Once

803
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,976
In the 90s

804
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,024
On MCS plane from New York

805
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
People

806
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
To Florida

807
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,888
A lot more than that yes I was up staying

808
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,728
K baby there is no record of him going to the island that's entirely possible

809
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
But like Alex

810
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,288
Can't handle

811
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,824
Like anything

812
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,616
Annie push play

813
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,456
See the way that uses these cheap tricks to control the conversation

814
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:19,040
Pictures of the guy allying

815
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:23,392
Put them on hold it's just all the

816
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,696
Yeah it's a

817
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,536
The flexing of a guy who can't handle

818
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
Hold his own

819
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:36,192
Yeah you know I feel like I have the only really unassailable position on this

820
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Which is that

821
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,824
If we got rid of everybody who was on the plane

822
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
At least one

823
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Or above

824
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
We'd be better off

825
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
We be fine

826
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
And let me tell you something

827
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
No false

828
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:54,880
Interstate let me know let me know if your language just a tiny bit

829
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,416
It took them out of the public

830
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,488
The power

831
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,536
I'm not in the mafia

832
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:07,168
If people who are new to the standard that you're describing face

833
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
Consequences

834
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
Yes

835
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:16,128
I think that as long as we got to hit him

836
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,176
I would even go so far as to say

837
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,832
Ninety-nine percent of the people have never been on the plane and every one of them who was vast majority of the population has not been

838
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:31,744
If you're on the plane one-time get the f*** out of here unless you were on the plane and it wasn't your choice

839
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,680
Did another call here

840
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Well

841
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:47,872
This caller believes that a better version of The Alex Jones was right meme

842
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,432
Alex Jones

843
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Which

844
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,784
If I take issue could be an issue

845
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,136
Because where this goes

846
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
Bad time

847
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
So I think that

848
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,488
The meaning of house

849
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,024
I think that

850
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
There's a wonderful man but I see

851
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
Alex Jones

852
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,168
Who's telling the truth

853
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Because if

854
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
Wrong in something

855
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,544
Apologize first

856
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
Or you can write

857
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
Or more stuff

858
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Using wrong

859
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
And I see

860
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
To say

861
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,088
He was just telling the truth he was just reading the news

862
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,648
Telling the truth

863
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,560
And then later I said okay it happened

864
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
Now that I've seen the

865
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
The trials rigged

866
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
And how it all looks

867
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
I mean

868
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,216
It's definitely the whole thing's deep

869
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
That's all I can say

870
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,312
Publix original Instinct about it

871
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,080
What's rights

872
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
But it is

873
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
It is synthetic as hell

874
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,967
And I think that you're right.

875
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
Creeper

876
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
I just want to say thank you

877
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,303
For everything you've done

878
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
My God

879
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
What is

880
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,959
What is happening at legit want a personal apology

881
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:21,567
I want a personal apology from all of the media

882
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,615
S*** about how they've

883
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:30,015
Alex finally admitted something Alex finally apologized personal f****** apology

884
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:35,903
Remember God damn one of you got to get you back on Twitter if that right is outraged go

885
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
Yeah

886
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,743
This is

887
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
Bad

888
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
For Alex

889
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
Okay

890
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
So let's break down a couple

891
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,679
Dino Alex's language

892
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,959
And what things mean

893
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,519
Yes him saying that this is synthetic

894
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,799
Is very bad

895
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,127
Immediately after saying that the trial was rigged

896
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:00,479
Well but that's kind of normal for him

897
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:05,087
That my life at this point

898
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:09,183
Synthetic is a way that he described the event

899
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,231
When he was saying that everyone is actor

900
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,279
This is harkening back to that line

901
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,839
Now to make things even worse

902
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,631
When he says

903
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
The people

904
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,703
Instinct originally were right

905
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,263
Yep that is him saying that they were at

906
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,055
Yep that is

907
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,359
There's no way he describes

908
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:33,247
The theories that he just started to look at he was just looking at the suspicions that people had

909
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
When he uses that kind of language

910
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
He is

911
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,599
Definitely

912
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,975
Whether or not he actually believes anything he is definitely giving voice

913
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,511
Do this was all fake

914
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,583
This is

915
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,607
And I think

916
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,143
If I had to guess

917
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,935
It's based on anger

918
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:57,567
Well yeah Mark Bankston was first on the show

919
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
First time

920
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,175
He speculated that one of the things that drove Alex

921
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,967
Is anger at the end

922
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
Yeah

923
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
Really

924
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:11,135
Necessarily agree I thought it was an interesting perspective but it wasn't the way I

925
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,415
Necessarily looked at

926
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
Wright-brown

927
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,999
I'm coming more along to that

928
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:19,327
Because he has said things that were so

929
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:23,423
Disrespectful to the idea that there are grieving parents

930
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,239
Crying in court than you know

931
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,823
I I think there is like a just how dare you make me feel by

932
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Right

933
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,383
I am dumb

934
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,223
One of the things that I think is really telling about this

935
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,527
Is that Alex knows he f*****

936
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,343
Cuz here's the version of this that appears

937
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
On his own website

938
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,415
So I think that the

939
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,975
The meaning of Alex Jones was right I think that

940
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:51,071
Wonderful man but I think what would be more powerfully to me with these

941
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,119
Alex Jones was telling the truth

942
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
Because it's

943
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:58,751
You've been wrong in some things but can't even apologize for those things

944
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,567
Are you can write on far more stuff

945
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,127
Using wrong

946
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,431
And I think it's much more powerful

947
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,223
To say

948
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,319
She was just telling the truth he was just reading the news and he was telling the truth

949
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
Purslane

950
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,695
I just want to say thank you for everything you've done

951
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:21,535
He entirely cut it out every part of the

952
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:28,191
Yep you know if you talked up what he said if words mean things which I don't know if they do

953
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,495
If words mean things

954
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
Kingston what he said was

955
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,567
This happened

956
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,359
Didn't defame the families

957
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Then

958
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:42,271
They sued me and now that I've seen the trial is rigged and all of that stuff

959
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,599
First I said it happened I said sure it happened

960
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,903
And then he said but now the whole thing

961
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,719
Is deep State that's all I can say and I'll hold things

962
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:55,071
Totally synthetic and you're like so you just talked yourself into

963
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,119
Defaming the parents of again

964
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
Yep.

965
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,423
Santino's he f***** up

966
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,215
He edited it out for a reason

967
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,263
And the reason is because you was hoping

968
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:10,687
But unfortunately he's still like he did this on his show

969
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
And

970
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,551
It is on the

971
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,575
Diversion

972
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,879
Radio affiliates

973
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,207
Yolanda gcn feed of his show

974
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:26,815
And certainly this next week I believe this will be a problem in court

975
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,863
Texas

976
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
This

977
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
Is

978
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,959
About as bad of a thing as he could do

979
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,239
In the middle of this case

980
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
He

981
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
I was text

982
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
Sing you about this

983
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,871
You know cuz it's

984
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,663
Like I was

985
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
Flabbergast

986
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
Of course

987
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
One of the things that this does

988
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,111
Is it hands to the plaintiffs attorneys

989
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,903
Concrete evidence

990
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,695
Will never change

991
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,743
You can't learn lessons

992
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,791
There is nothing that will

993
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
Stop him from doing things

994
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
Like this

995
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,679
The very thing that he is in court

996
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,703
4

997
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
The very thing

998
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:09,055
This trial in this jury is trying to determine

999
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
The penalty of

1000
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,895
He will not ever

1001
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
Stop

1002
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,735
And that is very valuable thing

1003
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,015
For the

1004
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,575
The plaintiffs attorneys

1005
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
Well

1006
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,111
It's

1007
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,183
It's on a platter I mean you remember both of their opener

1008
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,743
Statements you remember Maddie

1009
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
Saying you know like

1010
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,327
We got to we have to stop him

1011
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
It obeys

1012
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,631
We have to stop

1013
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,911
The only way to do that is

1014
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,935
Is to take them off the air

1015
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,495
And the only way to do that is to take all of the money away

1016
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,287
You know and then normal

1017
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,311
Was like that's

1018
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,103
That's not how you should work

1019
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,895
You know you shouldn't just

1020
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:48,735
Do that you should punish him and then he should be allowed to go on his deck

1021
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,015
But this is just

1022
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,063
Every bit of why

1023
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,135
You know because the jury didn't really know why

1024
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,159
That he has

1025
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
To be stopped

1026
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,231
You know they've gotten all the shity

1027
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Done

1028
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,535
And you can punish him for the shity

1029
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,071
He's done and then say okay

1030
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,607
Now that you've been punished

1031
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,911
You know not to do this again

1032
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:13,311
But he's already been punished he's already lost a lawsuit and comes into court and does like this defiant

1033
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,591
Pendleton Act

1034
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:19,455
You know I question some things and my right to be able to question things

1035
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
Like you did

1036
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
This is

1037
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:25,087
Why so in the face of any kind of presentation he wants to make

1038
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
Kill himself

1039
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,415
I in court I think that did himself in

1040
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
Write a book

1041
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
The service

1042
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:35,583
I am like I think Norm sucks I got no sympathy for him

1043
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
Having to deal with this

1044
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,143
Is like

1045
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,423
How do you not

1046
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,983
Beg the court to put a gag order on him

1047
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,287
How do you not

1048
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,079
He can't stop himself from

1049
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,383
Blowing up his own spot

1050
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,663
I am

1051
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:52,479
Play amazing I mean

1052
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,111
Oh man

1053
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,183
I don't know man

1054
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,487
Pretty bad

1055
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
Honestly

1056
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:10,655
I think it's going to play you who works in court that he cut it out of the episode it's not going to be good

1057
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:15,263
We're wearing its of what you did

1058
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
Yep

1059
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,847
Sunright good luck

1060
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:23,711
You deserve every bit of what's about to fall on your face

1061
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,015
S'more calls

1062
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,831
This guy decides he's going to insult Chris Mattie

1063
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,111
And then they

1064
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,391
Balsam conspiracy

1065
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,927
Not about the case

1066
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:33,951
About smart

1067
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
About the pipeline

1068
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
Drawing the book

1069
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,607
Loving the supplement

1070
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,447
Love the way you handle that pencil neck

1071
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,007
Connecticut

1072
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:57,503
They're not getting any money on their asses

1073
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:02,111
Questions about the pipeline

1074
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,159
They're saying that it's not being used

1075
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
Gas

1076
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,719
Escaping

1077
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:10,815
Nordstrom 21 open

1078
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,375
They blew it up was it damaged so much gastro

1079
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:23,871
On the mainstream ever makes it easier

1080
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,455
They opened up that new pipeline

1081
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,503
Who owns that fireplace

1082
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
That's a good question

1083
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,623
I would like to know who owns that

1084
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,671
United States

1085
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,303
Clothes never open

1086
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,607
Gas in it why would it blew up

1087
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,631
Gas

1088
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,871
If nordstream2 didn't have gas in it

1089
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,431
Why when it blew up all that gas in it

1090
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:07,391
Nothing makes sense when you don't look into the things that are confusing you

1091
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,975
Like if you have questions and their sincere questions

1092
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,511
Find the answer to that

1093
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,559
But they don't care

1094
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,119
Question they don't care about the answer the

1095
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,143
Is a prop

1096
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,959
It's being used to justify their

1097
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:27,359
Disregard of any and all possible by actual reality

1098
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,639
To prop up and

1099
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,407
Decorate

1100
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,455
Their predetermined conclusion

1101
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,759
Nordstrom pipelines are closed

1102
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,343
No flow through them but they're still full of gas

1103
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,647
Estimated to be about 90% methane

1104
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:45,535
That's why the pictures that you see are of gas roiling to the surface as opposed to the classic image of an oil spill

1105
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,327
I could have found that out

1106
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,095
Within

1107
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,631
A minute

1108
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,447
I do appreciate the idea of being like

1109
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,751
I'd like to know who owns that pipeline

1110
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,799
We going to turn up volume

1111
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:03,199
Midstates need to look it up anymore I just decided

1112
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,479
Worry about it I won't but no

1113
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,527
Draw my question

1114
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,575
Answer for the answer is two up

1115
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,599
Sure

1116
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:14,719
Pipeline, the US

1117
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:18,047
Altec pipe which opened around the same time as the other ones began leaking

1118
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,327
This is of course

1119
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,399
That everything all of these are connected

1120
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:28,543
The pipeline is not owned by the United States it's a joint venture operated by the Danish company

1121
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,335
Danette

1122
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,639
And the Polish Oil Company gas

1123
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
System

1124
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,783
Since 2001 with long periods of dormancy but it's always been an attempt

1125
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,807
Decrease your abs

1126
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,343
Dependence on Russian oil

1127
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:47,999
As far back as the beginning of the year they were estimating October 1st as their partial opening date with a full capacity

1128
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,279
Be possible Bible

1129
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,071
Beginning of 2023

1130
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,983
Maybe interesting that this pipeline opened around the same time as those other ones were possibly sabotage but that alone is

1131
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:58,751
Not enough

1132
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,287
To prove that these events are connect

1133
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:05,407
It's enough to prove that an Infowars Lambo because truth is not a solid object there

1134
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:11,551
Well I mean it's understand the coincidental timing right but it is it is like

1135
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,319
Okay

1136
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,343
You made a pipe

1137
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,903
That nobody was getting oil from leak

1138
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,695
And this one's fine

1139
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
So

1140
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,255
What's the conspiracy there

1141
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
Like who

1142
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,583
Who benefits from this

1143
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
NATO

1144
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:29,727
Oh s***

1145
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:33,823
Yeah

1146
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,103
Just a tease

1147
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,383
Dumb

1148
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,271
Okay now it looks like

1149
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,551
It couldn't have been

1150
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,343
Accidental

1151
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
But have we

1152
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Giant spiders

1153
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
Those big

1154
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:56,351
Does big night and there's water spiders

1155
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
That sounds

1156
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:02,495
Good enough for me we have not accounted for we have not accounted for giant spiders

1157
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,567
Alex

1158
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:08,639
Russian spiders now we're in real trouble

1159
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,711
So we jump to Friday the 30th

1160
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,503
And here Alex is in

1161
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
Quite a mood

1162
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,551
At the beginning of the show

1163
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,287
When I come in here very frustrated

1164
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,407
Instrumental ability

1165
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,711
Because there's no way to cut

1166
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:49,343
Elijah Told part of the human process and all part of Cycles

1167
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,391
We go through and we're entering the bottom

1168
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,695
I want the most

1169
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,255
The most deadly

1170
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,791
Goodbye techno

1171
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Ron

1172
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,631
Service of this planet

1173
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:03,935
In the air

1174
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,727
What

1175
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,543
But why

1176
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
Get focused

1177
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
Find a place

1178
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
Clarity

1179
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,383
Standing

1180
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,967
Why the enemies

1181
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
Stop them

1182
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,831
The right now in one of those Focus places

1183
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,135
We'll see if I can stay there

1184
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,695
Call me over this because the gravity of all of this

1185
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,231
Is so unbelievably important

1186
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,255
I love

1187
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,279
First of all

1188
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,863
Set mistakes real high

1189
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:39,263
Undercutting the stakes by saying if I can even stay in this place it is kind of interesting

1190
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
Articulated so clearly

1191
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:46,943
How long could probably not going to make it to the commercial break I am not good

1192
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,015
Playing in this like

1193
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,831
So this isn't good it's

1194
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:56,671
Mostly the the argument here is that

1195
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,207
Demons

1196
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,511
Take children

1197
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,071
And then they messed them up

1198
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,351
And

1199
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,375
You know

1200
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:10,751
Some of it is keep going I'm going to give you a little bit of background music to really help you

1201
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,591
Some some of it ends up in Murder

1202
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:19,199
And some ends up with these kids to go and like

1203
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,247
I recruit more folk share

1204
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
Panties

1205
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,039
Baeza demonz

1206
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:23,807
Get the kids

1207
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,599
Through like the CPS

1208
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,159
Okay what have you drowsy

1209
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,975
In order to destroy the family

1210
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,535
And has to do without

1211
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,303
What does transphobia

1212
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,607
And that's basically how the globe.

1213
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,375
Yes that

1214
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:43,519
Unfortunately sounds like how the globalist do operate based upon what I know of the globalist

1215
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:48,639
They're not real

1216
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:52,223
Mostly this is going to end up being a bit of a transphobic

1217
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,015
Display

1218
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,575
Funny parts

1219
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,623
Long way and that is

1220
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,415
The first part at least okay

1221
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
Alex is determined

1222
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,255
That some people identify as alien

1223
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,327
It doesn't get much more evil than this

1224
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,375
And then you see that

1225
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,191
Showing the abject

1226
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:12,959
Freak Show

1227
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,543
Where

1228
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:24,223
There's this big moment our they go I'm not even a human I'm not a dog I'm not a cat

1229
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
I'm an alien

1230
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,551
One of my good friends

1231
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,831
Tonight's ago

1232
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
And they went down

1233
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,135
Wife

1234
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,255
Criminal

1235
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,887
All these creatures

1236
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,703
White wine in Spanish

1237
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,519
They couldn't tell what they were but they look like

1238
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,383
Weird green eyeshadow

1239
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,687
Clownfish looks

1240
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,479
Just like drag queen story time

1241
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
I said that

1242
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,767
Within 10 seconds they pulled up

1243
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,303
Instagram Facebook Twitter

1244
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,095
British groups go on together

1245
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,447
And they all

1246
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,519
Look completely like aliens they're into how they lost her

1247
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,287
Humanity

1248
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,079
Sexless

1249
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,895
This is what the globalist plan in Brave New World

1250
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,431
Publishing 1931

1251
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:31,551
I was out on the streets of Chicago and I have to report to you that

1252
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:36,159
There are large groups of people who identify as Santa

1253
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:43,071
Drunk people out

1254
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:46,399
He's like in Alex's world no one ever just gets f*****

1255
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:52,799
Can high for a night you act like nobody's ever just f***** up tonight like I got f*****

1256
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:57,407
Yep I did a little of MDMA and now I'm going to hit you like that might be fun

1257
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,223
Tonight or if like

1258
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:04,063
Some people on like an alien bar crawl or something like that

1259
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,111
Having some food right

1260
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:12,767
Like if he saw the Santa bar crawl or the zombie Bar Crawl The Flaming Lips still touring they could have been

1261
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,047
Go to Flaming Lips

1262
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:17,631
There's a number of possibilities but apparently this

1263
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:21,215
Is terrified I just wish that his

1264
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:26,335
Where's worldview doesn't ever encapsulate somebody just being really f***** up and having a good night

1265
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,359
Insane weird s***

1266
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:31,199
You know it's always got to be like an ongoing thing

1267
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,527
So

1268
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
Alex

1269
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:41,695
One of the things we know from watching his show and paying attention to a lot of the stuff

1270
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,463
These dates

1271
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,511
We

1272
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,791
Look at

1273
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:50,911
The satanic Panic that's going on now and the satanic Panic of the 80s is kind of

1274
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,191
Separate insensitive

1275
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,495
Sprite there was a flare-up

1276
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:59,103
And then it went below right and that's coming back as opposed to one giant long into

1277
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,895
And Alec believes

1278
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:03,967
I believe it's one of course and it's all real

1279
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,247
Bright sand

1280
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:08,319
The devil just was getting a guess

1281
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:12,671
Active

1282
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,719
The devil's a little bit like

1283
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,743
Earth

1284
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:22,143
Herpes you know it shows up every now and again and then it's like I haven't had an outbreak for a while

1285
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,703
Yeah

1286
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,495
So hard they possess

1287
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,823
Everybody energy

1288
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,103
Eons old

1289
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,895
True you know

1290
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:39,807
Yeah I mean I'm pushing 40 and I'm tired as hell

1291
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:44,671
All of the red horns and the tail doll that is more like an ENT

1292
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,207
From Lord of the Rings that you just like

1293
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,583
I got to go

1294
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,863
Satan

1295
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,935
Sai maybe that's

1296
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:02,079
That's why is gone from the 80s present

1297
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:08,479
So what are the things that feature of that is of course the McMartin School case

1298
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:11,039
Ted gunderson's involvement

1299
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,599
Alex

1300
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:17,183
Imagine being the first person to expose this

1301
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,975
And people think you're crazy

1302
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,583
Yeah that be crazy

1303
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,607
He left

1304
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:26,911
Expose this

1305
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:30,239
He discovered whole towns

1306
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,775
Run by devil worshiper

1307
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,711
Hiding behind science hiding behind

1308
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
Science

1309
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,271
Psychology and psychiatry

1310
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,719
So I have this

1311
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,255
I said I'll get to it later

1312
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,399
Remember when we're covering all this other

1313
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
Information

1314
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,727
That witches are real

1315
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,383
When you see these three judges and he's Democrat lawyers

1316
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,687
Like yours

1317
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,759

1318
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,039
Worshipping

1319
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
.

1320
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,671
That's why they look like vampires

1321
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,463
They're all these types

1322
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,023
You learn the look of them and then you see

1323
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,559

01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095

Bizzle castration children

Because they want the spiritual app

1328
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,775
I'm destroying innocence and the future

1329
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,127
But when you ask

1330
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,199
These people you see the deadness in their eyes

1331
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,735
You see what the other like race

1332
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,527

1333
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295

01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:06,751
No no that's how you demonize the entire group and that's really bad

1341
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,055
It's not even entire group

1342
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:13,407
Everyone here again everybody's anybody I decide today

The General Public

Years ago or 20 years ago

Daydream

Sleepwalking state

1370
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,351
So you got the zombies

1371
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
And

1372
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911

They're everywhere.

1375
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,799
Then you've got people that

1376
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,823
Trying to become

1377
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,615
More like

1378
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,407
Gremlin way

1379
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,479
Gremlin

1380
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,759
System of corruption

1381
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,575
Hey for the family and they love story

GMOs and they love whatever the system

1383
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,183
Worship the system

1384
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:07,327
Avant-garde Rebels when they're totally backed by the New World Order in the system says

1385
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,167
Get rid of their Humanity anyway they

I can

1387
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,007
To make themselves look as ugly as possible

1388
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,055
And I acted big groups and incoordination

1389
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,847
Zombies don't so much

1390
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,615
Incoordination

1391
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,151
Smell around my nose

1392
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,503
Mitsubishi

1393
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,039
Equal

1394
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,367
Globalist New World Order say

1395
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,903
What are the new saying is

1396
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,671
They're the

1397
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,743
Mpc's over-the-limit admission

1398
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:39,327
So what we got the zombos and the gremlin race

1399
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,375
I was kind of hoping we would get a lot more the

1400
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:47,775
Okay good cuz I feel like I'm writing down everything

1401
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:54,175
Need to break the cycle and I want his monsters

1402
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:59,295
What's your what do you see when you hear gremlin

1403
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,599
I see Alex not preparing

1404
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:07,487
If you wasn't just covered up with this off lock

1405
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,279
Pizza.

1410
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,079
So we'll go with that

1411
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,127
Alright

1412
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,663
And then the rate fight so it's

1413
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,199
It's Gizmo wearing a row

1414
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,223
Sure

1415
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,527
I guess I'll take that

1416
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,063
I want to join

1417
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,231

1418
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:45,631
Stir fry I got some little nugget I prefer oat milk to soy milk myself

1419
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:52,287
Hanger-on with the soy sauce

1420
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,591
I think everybody kind of likes it not right

1421
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,639
All right look I say on fleek

1422
01:06:56,895 --> 01:07:00,735
As a joke about how out-of-the-loop I am

1423
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:04,063
Alex I think it's sincere out of the Lupi as wealthy

1424
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,087
The right-wing talk

1425
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:08,671
Maybe maybe you guys didn't like sorry cuz you just didn't know how to

1426
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
A parrot

1427
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,791
So

1428
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
Zambo

1429
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:21,215
Pretty much everybody share that Alex doesn't like TV

1430
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:25,567
Unusual thing people do like Alex does all the f****** time

1431
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:31,967
Head start on the view all the time how much I don't matter Bill Maher

1432
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,015
They just waddle around

1433
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:37,599
They Mi about 10 or the Gathering group no

1434
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,415
Big groups

1435
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:46,815
I think that's the protesters basically on our end of the

1436
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
Visual that Alex doesn't like

1437
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,143
Then the gremlin race

1438
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,191
Are like protesters

1439
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,007
Organized

1440
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,799
Things that Alex doesn't like

1441
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,871
Right right but there's another level above that

1442
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,151
Involves

1443
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
The CPS

1444
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
Yes I believe

1445
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,711
I think they're the next level

1446
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,063
You have the zombies you have

1447
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,087
The gremlin

1448
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:09,855
Sherman

1449
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,159
And then you have the renfield's attacks

1450
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,439
Sure

1451
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,047
And there's a hierarchy in those

1452
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:22,399
There's 100 babies

1453
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:26,495
To Dracula who then gives it to his brood of women

1454
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,031
When he has sex

1455
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,567
Archives

1456
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,127
Wingfield's are

1457
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,663
Your corrupt CPS workers

1458
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,711
Winfield your threat Family Court judges

1459
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,759
Renfield's are

1460
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:40,063
The people in Germany in the US

1461
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,855
The orphanages that deliver children

1462
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:42,879
Pedophile

1463
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,951
Levels

1464
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,487
Low-level Renfield

1465
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,767
Grooming deliver show

1466
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,351
Then you'll have renfield's that keep children ready and

1467
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,935
And they're trying to transition

1468
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,495
Is Renfield his in the book Dracula

1469
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,103
Children

1470
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,407
And they're always bringing Dracula can we

1471
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,943
Can I take part in killing them

1472
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,479
Anna Dracula

1473
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,039
You got to really work hard and beg

1474
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,575
To get to the point where actually

1475
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,231
Wow okay

1476
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,535
So what are you

1477
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,327
Wow I mean we've jumped

1478
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:27,423
Pretty far from love soy and yes

1479
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:33,823
Kidnap babies that happened so fast to drink their blood

1480
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:40,223
Middle level in between there their well I mean I think if you're talkin about a hierarchy of demons essentially

1481
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,527
How to be a benign boring.

1482
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:47,135
Zombie has like some awesome regular

1483
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:52,511
A bureaucrat like a you know something might be in the hierarchy of vampires

1484
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,279
Dagwood's

1485
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,815
Steal your your blood

1486
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,631
Except they have to be worse than the Renfield

1487
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,935
Cuz they're higher up on the ship

1488
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,727
Well they don't have to be worse

1489
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,007
No no

1490
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,031
You're getting this backward

1491
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,567
They're higher up

1492
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,847
So they don't have to

1493
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,663
The Dirty Work

1494
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:15,039
Be bringing John if it weren't for them their demands I mean they just say things and then they appeared

1495
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,599
Are you making any hard demands

1496
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:23,999
It Dracula's not making hard demands of Renfield Alright good idea

1497
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:29,887
We we have an identification of Dracula Netflix

1498
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,983
Oh there's only one Jack yes okay

1499
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:38,591
Gotcha Covered already know who it is

1500
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:39,871
It's got to be

1501
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,639
Stelter

1502
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,663
Notes King Charles

1503
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
Zombie

1504
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,807
Gremlin

1505
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,623
And then you get

1506
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,463
Your low-level Renfield

1507
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:59,071
Mid-level Renfield Jairo rentals like five or six levels of Winfield

1508
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,351
Sure

1509
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,375
Why

1510
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,191
Justify the 4th level

1511
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,751
Get the king of England at the top

1512
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
Count Dracula

1513
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:08,799
So

1514
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,271
Researcher

1515
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,551
But it's wrong will

1516
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,623
I am

1517
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,159
Take these guys on

1518
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,767
And once you know they're sure I know there's a Renfield

1519
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:33,631
They're weak to Bo's

1520
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,287
CC

1521
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:44,895
Vampire

1522
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,199
Melee weapons only

1523
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,503
When you see a Prince Charles

1524
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,111
People that's who they are

1525
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,135
Get it

1526
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,671
This is how things work

1527
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:03,071
And that's just how it is nice to know we've got some bows I got Gremlin race we've got the

1528
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,423
And then we've got

1529
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:12,287
Regular vampires right Hillary Hillary and then

1530
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,079
The top

1531
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,359
King Charles

1532
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:23,295
The guy who is been essentially ignored for the past 70 years and clowned on largely

1533
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,319
Dislike

1534
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:27,647
Postpone

1535
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,927
That's Drac

1536
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:36,095
Zoe so he was behind like you don't understand Dracula myths

1537
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:42,495
One of the essential features as the Dracula had a wife that everyone like way more who died

1538
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,591
Regularly

1539
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:52,223
Okay so what was the queen doing did she know was Dracula previously

1540
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,063
You can't just pretend I think

1541
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,855
You can when you die

1542
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:05,023
Charles Baker

1543
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,559
Write imagine

1544
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:12,191
I think they would Alex is saying is the station of the king of England is the

1545
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:17,567
Is the the dragon dragon

1546
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,895
That Prince Charles at talked about how you like

1547
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:24,479
Transylvania Heritage Railway

1548
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
Huh

1549
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,295
So yeah

1550
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,575
So

1551
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:31,391
I mean it all makes sense now I'm glad that he was so Focus

1552
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,439
I'm still stuck on the gremlin right

1553
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,279
Because I just see a little Gizmo where the black robe

1554
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:40,863
Okay

1555
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,911
Highest ranking Gremlin Wraith

1556
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:43,935
Is that

1557
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,495
Equivalent to the lowest-ranking rent

1558
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:52,639
Prince Fielder always above fields are the Servants of the Dracula's in the vampire

1559
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,431
The gremlin race

1560
01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:01,087
Not really

1561
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:04,415
Maybe that maybe nobody gives them commit chaotic

1562
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,999
They're like the Goths just Roman about

1563
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:12,095
Tearing down Rome whatever they cry

1564
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,655
No.

1565
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,423
Yeah

1566
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:19,007
Yeah so unfortunately there's ways we can end up becoming a vampire

1567
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,311
Do I hate somebody that is

1568
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:24,383
Is gay better be my dad

1569
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,223
The Gateway

1570
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:32,063
Into this whole thing and it's heterosexuals are pedophiles as well

1571
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,647
Lgbtq P mobile

1572
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,951
Opera

1573
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Damn

1574
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,351
What a load of s***

1575
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,423
Show me the makes it less fun right I mean

1576
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,823
It's it's a lot of fun to hear Alex rambling about the hierarchy of demons in the world

1577
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:57,407
It's silly and stupid but then you realize

1578
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:00,223
Kind of at the end of the day that this is all

1579
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:00,991
Just

1580
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:05,087
Lgbtq plus narrative

1581
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,367
Vapes

1582
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,647
I mean it

1583
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,439
It is implied violence

1584
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,719
Absolutely

1585
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,487
Well your

1586
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,511
If maligning

1587
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,791
Anybody

1588
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:17,887
Essentially arguing that being gay can be a

1589
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,191
Gateway drug

1590
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,471
Or being a pedophile

1591
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,567
Of course heterosexual people can be pedophiles too

1592
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,615
Naturally anyone I disagree with

1593
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,151
Also a pedophile

1594
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:33,247
Regardless of what their sexual orientation may or may not be

1595
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:36,831
So basically everyone but Alex f***

1596
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:37,599
Kids

1597
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,623
According to Alex

1598
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:43,999
Yeah that's true

1599
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:49,119
Allegedly

1600
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:52,703
Perfect way of describing something I mean he does Amazon

1601
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,239
I'm a predator example

1602
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,055
I was trying to do it upon like

1603
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,823
But yeah

1604
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,359
So Alex

1605
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,663
I need money

1606
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,455
Cuz he's Van Helsing

1607
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,759
Right he's been he'll singing

1608
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:09,087
Nugent van Hellsing right yeah

1609
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,367
Alex

1610
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,415
And he'll grouse

1611
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:17,023
You want to fight you want to try to stand up the New World Order

1612
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,351
Broadcast

1613
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,887
Celtic runes

1614
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,935
An hour in the main battle

1615
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,471
Really a simple equation

1616
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,775
God keeps me humble

1617
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,567
But I'm going to tell you right now

1618
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:32,895
I barely have the money to pay my lawyers I barely have the money to travel connect

1619
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,199
Bankruptcy Court

1620
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:37,503
Me personally paying for my travel everything up there

1621
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,783
Whatever great

1622
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,807
I'm almost out of money

1623
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:44,159
Go to save infowars.com that's the URL to make

Personal donation Infowars

1625
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,511
Legal in our travel we need your help

1626
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,071
We're in the fight Rocky Alamo sending a letter out ask

1627
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,863
Whatever happened

1628
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,631
It's up to you

1629
01:16:53,887 --> 01:17:00,031
Is that a colonel Travis sending out a letter that I need $80,000 to get a private jet to go to Connecticut

1630
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:03,871
F****** a****** it is like listen

1631
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,639
Can I get it

1632
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,663
I get it

1633
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:09,503
You you realize that you can't just booked a Southwest

1634
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
Flight

1635
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,063
If I'm standing

1636
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,111
In f****** boarding Group C

1637
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:16,415
And I see Alex Jones in front

1638
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,463
I get it man

1639
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,231
That can't have

1640
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,047
But you could fly first class

1641
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:28,447
Gary Kirby you do you get your own little view get to show up earlier whatever the f*** it is really like 10

1642
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:34,591
People in their wig absolutely probably not get to harass

1643
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,383
You could go as

1644
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,455
Well I wouldn't recommend it

1645
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,503
Now that I think about it

1646
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:47,135
If he tried to do Madea it could be

1647
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:54,047
There is also probably a cheaper way to Charter travel

1648
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:54,815
You know like

1649
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:58,655
Even if he had to do that I think it'd probably be a cheaper option

1650
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:04,031
Hey somebody's flying Subway you know rich people really hate wait

1651
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,567
Play real quick take

1652
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:11,199
I like it's going to be a long trip it'll be a lot more than $80,000 to drive that take from

1653
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:16,575
Rally's along the way Owen pave the path I like

1654
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,623
So we got a headline here

1655
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:22,719
Just came out last week was interspeed goals in the German news

1656
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,023
This is what the great reset

1657
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
Looks like

1658
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:30,143
Germany's greens plan to ban native Germans

1659
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:32,447
Assertive jobs remote diversity

1660
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:36,799
It'll just bring it outside populations they then don't let you have a job

1661
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:41,407
German greens plan to ban Germans from a third of jobs for meth diversity

1662
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,943
This isn't true

1663
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:49,343
Member of the greens parliamentary group recently said quote by the end of 2026 a third of all

1664
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:52,671
All newly advertised positions in the city should be filled by applicant

1665
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,207
With a migration back

1666
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:57,791
This is a headline that I was reading from Summit.

1667
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:01,375
Paul Joseph Watson site

1668
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,935
The way this is being reported as convoluted

1669
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,471
Here's how the article star

1670
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:12,383
In the name of promoting diversity ruling Greens in the German in the German city of Hanover

1671
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:16,479
Citizens for applying for government jobs

1672
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,015
So they can be given to Mike

1673
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,575
Yes really wow

1674
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,343
How is

1675
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:27,743
City jobs ideally being filled by non german-born citizens the equivalent of banning a third of native

1676
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,791
Citizens from applying for those jobs

1677
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:35,679
That's just nonsense and Les Paul somehow believes that the only jobs available in Hanover are from the city

1678
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:42,591
They reported this way because it's too much more flashy headline then City aims for 30% immigrant

1679
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,359
Workforce

1680
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:47,967
Paul's version is easier for Alex to yell about get his audience nice and scared

1681
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:52,575
That's why he writes these completely nonsensical and dishonest title that he does

1682
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,367
It's because Paul's role is to

1683
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:58,207
Saturn outrage bait the demagogues like Alex can then used inside their audio

1684
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,279
Here's the part of the story that Paul doesn't

1685
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,047
Want to bring

1686
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,071
Nothing neither does that

1687
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:06,655
Hanover population is only 78% German

1688
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:13,567
Even for a city Workforce of approximately 30%. German-born individuals is really not too far off from Acura

1689
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,872
Currently reflecting the city's demographic makeup

1690
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,992
Considering that the 30% that they're talking about is a goal not Amanda

1691
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,808
It's likely that they'll fall short of that number and maybe

1692
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,880
Maybe they'll hit 22% immigrant hires

1693
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:30,720
Which would be exactly representational of the city as a whole

1694
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,768
This is outrageous based on.

1695
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,560
Actually based on less than

1696
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:37,120
Willful ignorance of Base

1697
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:41,984
Reality because that reality would get in the way of being able to add jatate against groups of people

1698
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,752
You don't like

1699
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,032
And you want your audience

1700
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:44,800
What's not to like

1701
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,336
Puritan

1702
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:50,432
You know it is it is that classic

1703
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,456
Race

1704
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:54,016
Saying though it is at Classic

1705
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:57,088
Just you know like if their lives get better

1706
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,880
That means your life

1707
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,160
Has to get worse

1708
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:03,744
And it's always that argument you know it's been that way for

1709
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,768
For so long

1710
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:08,608
It's been that way it's why you know that that unions couldn't integrate

1711
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,400
You know 100 years ago

1712
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,192
Edit always that like

1713
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,728
Nobody can really

1714
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,264
Drake through the

1715
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,056
Skulls of so many people

1716
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,360
That if everybody's life gets better

1717
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,152
Everybody's life gets better

1718
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,736
Every but that includes you

1719
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,552
It includes you

1720
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:30,112
Right you are also everybody

1721
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,928
Yeah but I think I think there's some people

1722
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:38,048
Who want other people's life not to be badass names are Paul and Alex

1723
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,072
And many others

1724
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,888
And this is weird

1725
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,424
And a John Birch

1726
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,704
Society was founded

1727
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,240
More than

1728
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,288
60 plus years ago

1729
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,848
When an army officer John Birch

1730
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:53,920
Along with the CIA in 1949

1731
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,224
Canning all the power to mousy tongue

1732
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,504
Shanghai Shack

1733
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,784
He was tortured to death

1734
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,832
And so the term the John Birch

1735
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:10,304
But my dad read the writings that woke up when he was young my grandfather his father was aware of it

1736
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,096
Radio broadcast

1737
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:12,864
Dallas

1738
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,400
Drive up on my Ranch

1739
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,008
Read the books

1740
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,056
Interviews of the speeches

1741
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,128
It all was right it all came true

1742
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,408
Show

1743
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,688
Alex Jones

1744
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,968
Tomorrow's news today

1745
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:28,992
Well

1746
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,296
50 years news today

1747
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:34,368
Is the John Birch Society in Robert Owens join Judas

1748
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:37,184
The bouncy our national council members

1749
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:43,840
Holyshit me on there to say the N word a lot to remind people of the John Birch Society

1750
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:48,448
I mean eventually they will get there

1751
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,728
Yeah

1752
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:56,128
So Alex is having a representative from the John Birch Society

1753
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:58,944
Thing and they're so great and apparently

1754
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:03,552
Not only was Alex's dad super into the cupboards

1755
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:09,696
Radio show ever at the problem

1756
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,000
I got some Flack a little bit

1757
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,048
After the

1758
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,352
We put out the Alex's War episode

1759
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:19,424
There was a part that Alex was

1760
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,960
Downplaying is

1761
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:26,848
Families Gilbert Society connection

1762
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:31,968
I think maybe had read a book but yourself

1763
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:33,504
Come the f*** off

1764
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,296
Alex selectively deploys

1765
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:39,136
Information about what his ideological background is because it's

1766
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:43,232
Advantageous like that f****** dumbass documentary

1767
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,024
It's not advantageous for him to

1768
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,352
Be like the John Birch Society or profit to the best ever

1769
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,144
He knows that he knows how to make it look bad

1770
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:56,544
Yeah Alex is back story is I think similar to a like

1771
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,128
Dark Knight when the Joker was describing how he got scars

1772
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:00,896
Any change

1773
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,944
Change the story every time

1774
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,480
Cuz that's the joke

1775
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,528
You shouldn't believe what he says

1776
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,808
Remind me about

1777
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,648
Alex

1778
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:12,928
Which is weird

1779
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,208
Why isn't

1780
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:18,304
Say the John Birch Society your founder have been Vindicated

1781
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,584
My friend

1782
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,120
Robert Owens is an understatement

1783
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:23,424
Why don't you start with history

1784
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,704
The JBS

1785
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,240
The original Alex Jones

1786
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,360
Why thank you I thank you so much I Alex for having me on the show

1787
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,688
And I wouldn't be much of a Berkshire if I didn't Begin by saying

1788
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,480
Edwards

1789
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:39,552
Let me invite you to join the John Birch Society

1790
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,576
Why won't

1791
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,624
I don't know maybe it would

1792
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,976
Make him sound f****** crazy because

1793
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:50,304
If you was a proud member of the John Birch Society

1794
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:56,704
Maybe that would come up when he's on Rogue you think you're maybe when he's trying to pass himself off as some kind of

1795
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,264
Crazy John Birch Society extreme right-wing

1796
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,544
F****** fanatic

1797
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,592
Then it will play against

1798
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,896
I remember him being above it

1799
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:08,480
I remember him being above that left-right paradigm

1800
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,296
Well you can make an argument that

1801
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,576
The

1802
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,600
But

1803
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,648
Fascist leaning

1804
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:20,256
In service of large corporations right

1805
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:23,584
Rooted in the National Association of Manufacturers

1806
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:29,984
Anti-communism because we all have huge corporations that would suffer

1807
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,776
Financially by workers having rights

1808
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:35,616
Terrible

1809
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:39,456
It is it is maybe a different Paradigm that they have

1810
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:43,808
Chopped out of a magazine and then put on top of ours

1811
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:50,208
Maybe it is above it all to be like the Civil Rights Movement with a communist conspiracy and I wish Rhodesia still existed

1812
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,304
A worm

1813
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,144
Either way Alex loves this dude

1814
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,680
This this Owens guy

1815
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:00,960
Power

1816
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,240
Robert Owen

1817
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,032
How much what you house arrest

1818
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,848
Don't you knock it out the park

1819
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,408
Robert Welsh

1820
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,200
Talk about the best serious

1821
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,760
Holyshit

1822
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:17,600
He doesn't actually hand off the show but this is some of the most glowing praise I have

1823
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,368
I heard him

1824
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,416
Publicly make four

1825
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:24,768
The Robert wealth admitting that he's aware who Robert Welch is

1826
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,536
Is wild

1827
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,328
No it's not

1828
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:31,680
Good on some fronts cuz at least it's

1829
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:37,056
F****** forthright yeah that's true I'm not playing some kind of a peekaboo mask

1830
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,360
The games the most I've heard anybody phrase

1831
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,664
The John Birch Society

1832
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:45,248
In public that's not going to be easy love.

1833
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,784
Oh man

1834
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,320
He's basically work

1835
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,392
That's why he's our miracle

1836
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:55,744
They have some by candidates they're really excited about this I have to JBS

1837
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,768
Hey you can go to college

1838
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,840
But here's the exciting part

1839
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:04,448
Unbelievable Warriors I'm going to give you a name Jr Majewski

1840
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,032
Marcy kaptur

1841
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
Congress

1842
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,360
He is killing it

1843
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:14,688
Kids on the Warfare fighting and battling an

1844
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
Taking the

1845
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,480
The stabs

1846
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:20,832
And the worst abs are from The Establishment Republicans Alex stabbed

1847
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:25,440
Republican

1848
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:34,400
You might recognize that dude's name cuz he's the guy who's been accused recently of Stolen Valor for misrepresenting

1849
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:40,800
Get service record in combat in Afghanistan but there are no records of that and his claim that his

1850
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,616
Deployment was classified has been questioned by experts

1851
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:46,688
Even if it were classified what he was doing there still waiting

1852
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,480
You could corroborate that deployment with cheese

1853
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,248
He's failed to do

1854
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,880
Also turns out he was dishonest about why you couldn't reenlist after his first stretch in the Air Force

1855
01:27:55,136 --> 01:28:01,024
You probably was stationed at a base in Okinawa and got popped for drunk driving beer days before 9/11

1856
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,608
Which led to him being demoted from Airman First Class to basic Airman

1857
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:09,984
This message resulted in the GOP not being really hot on him anymore as you know

1858
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:10,752
The stab

1859
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,056
From the Republican

1860
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:15,872
Yeah bye.

1861
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:22,528
He's running against Marcy kaptur who's been in office since 1983 so I don't know if I'm going to put too much of

1862
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,808
Money on Jr here

1863
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:26,368
The district that was widely read

1864
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:29,440
In 2020 which led to a much higher GOP voting

1865
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,208
Percentage

1866
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:33,024
But it might not be enough I'm not entirely sure

1867
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,608
You know it went from a heavily pro Democrat

1868
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,376
District

1869
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,400
In the cook

1870
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,448
Partisan index

1871
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:43,264
Slightly Republican won

1872
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,544
It's it's atossa

1873
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,336
So yeah so

1874
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,640
I wouldn't put my money on

1875
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:51,712
This level of a candidate with atossa

1876
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,016
You seems like you suck

1877
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:57,088
Fox yeah

1878
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,928
He was there

1879
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,232
Is it give you do that

1880
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,512
Olivia like you

1881
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,816
No

1882
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:09,632
No so like I said I

1883
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:16,032
Rarely heard Alex have like specific awareness about things in the JBS because

1884
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:22,432
Play fast and loose about my other ideas

1885
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:26,272
Right where I said something but not the Robert Welsh

1886
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:31,392
Grambling sexual Rim at Robert Wallace was just a Super Genius

1887
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:39,328
Well he he really was this was a guy that age 16 graduated from college by the time he was 20 in bed

1888
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,096
Send to the

1889
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,912
U.s. Naval Academy in Harvard Law School

1890
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:46,496
It was pretty accomplished but also he was a Candyman

1891
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,800
In the free market economy

1892
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,104
To cover the hole

1893
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:51,872
Candy mark

1894
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:02,368
He invented things like the the Sugar Daddy Junior men's

1895
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,744
So the company that well she was at invented those candies but without saying isn't really true

1896
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:11,328
Welch's business Oxford candy company went out of business

1897
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:17,984
His brother James also ran a candy company called the James o Welch Company which survives and after Oxford claps

1898
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,264
James hired Robbie

1899
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:23,616
He was the best business man ever any took over the candy Market single-handedly

1900
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:27,456
What was it what was the one we created it behind the bastards

1901
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,528
What was just the fuk stick is that

1902
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:36,928
Yeah probably

1903
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,768
That is there

1904
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:45,120
Look at what my squad. It's because I'm not interested in hearing this

1905
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:49,216
Goddamn recruiter for the John Birch Society on Alex's show

1906
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:49,984
It is

1907
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,776
Relevant to bring up

1908
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:53,824
Recruitment

1909
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,360
That is what they say

1910
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,408
And you can hear it pretty clearly

1911
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,224
What's Explorer Liberty

1912
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,248
So here's the thing

1913
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,016
What what

1914
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:06,624
My recommendation is if you mean business if you want to be part of

1915
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,904
An organization

1916
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:11,488
It is going to give you the absolute best information going

1917
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:14,048
Go to jbs.org and sign up

1918
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:20,448
They will put you in touch with a local field office or guys like me all over the country we have some with most

1919
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,472
Google men and women

1920
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,752
Professional

1921
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:30,432
In a specific action agenda chapter you're going to be doing things

1922
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,712
We are actually going to be

1923
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,480
Making

1924
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,248
Indifference

1925
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,016
Bushing

1926
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:39,904
Purpose of Liberty not Justin as an academic X

1927
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:40,672
Exercise

1928
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:42,208
What is a specific

1929
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:42,976
Wilbur soot

1930
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:47,072
This is kind of an interesting development in Alex's path

1931
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:49,120
Whatever the f*** he's doing now

1932
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:51,424
You have a

1933
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,472
JBS recruiter who's coming in

1934
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,800
Alex's showing more awareness

1935
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,592
Forgiving effusive praise

1936
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,872
About Robert

1937
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:02,688
Everything

1938
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,968
He's

1939
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:10,624
Insinuating himself and involvement the JBS far more than he usually does if anything's service

1940
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,696
Of leading to this guy pitching

1941
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:15,488
If you're serious you should join

1942
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,024
The John Birch Society

1943
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,560
I think it's weird

1944
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,352
It sound

1945
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,632
Like broker broker

1946
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
Yeah honest

1947
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:29,056
Now it sounds like a multi-level marketing scheme getting a an hour on a free Ricky

1948
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,848
There are

1949
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,640
Feelings like

1950
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,920
I know that Alex

1951
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:38,528
Like from everything that I understand from listening to as much of him as I have

1952
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,832
I don't think this is out of line with his

1953
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:47,232
No not exactly that he will take money

1954
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,512
He has been

1955
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,048
Far more cautious

1956
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:50,816
About

1957
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,608
Given too much public

1958
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,376
Airing

1959
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,424
To his love of the John Birch Society

1960
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,472
Yeah he has in the past

1961
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:58,496
Obviously

1962
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,520
Made some

1963
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:00,800
Overtures

1964
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,824
More

1965
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,104
And

1966
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:03,872
Impasse

1967
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:05,664
It was not always

1968
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,944
In the context of

1969
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:09,248
Interviewing a recruiter

1970
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,344
Yeah who's trying to funnel listeners to the recruitment phone line

1971
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,416
Yeah that one stuff that one stuff

1972
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,696
I wouldn't

1973
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,976
I wouldn't want to

1974
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:22,816
Maybe it's just that the ghetto I don't think the JBS

1975
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:29,216
Guys really known that well anymore right what stands for is in the little from Publix

1976
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:32,032
Yeah yeah I think it's I think it is more like

1977
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:34,592
You know you can say it now because

1978
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,152
Most people don't even f****** know what you're talkin about

1979
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:42,272
Yeah also absent in their discussion of the the past of the

1980
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:46,880
The baby I said don't talk about Fred Koch talk about reveal Opie Oliver

1981
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:49,952
Don't talk about the universe

1982
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:50,720
The connections

1983
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,256
Do you like

1984
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:59,168
Slightly different name at the National Alliance

1985
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,104
Yeah I found I found that to be troubling

1986
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:12,224
They also didn't talk about how the mythology behind the John Birch

1987
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,504
Yeah it not true

1988
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,576
People who knew the actual John Birch

1989
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:19,392
Say that he would not be in support of his name being attacked

1990
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,928
Maps to this organization

1991
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,512
Because why why ruin a good time

1992
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,816
Yeah you know

1993
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,608
What is it just disrespect

1994
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:35,008
Be a person were claiming into the inspiration

1995
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,592
You don't care

1996
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,616
Well I couldn't do that

1997
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:43,200
It's so important to do with the first casualties help

1998
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
Anyway

1999
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:46,784
Look there's some stuff to Tappan that is suck

2000
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:50,112
Yep put man

2001
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:52,928
There is nothing more like

2002
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:55,488
Him calling it a synthetic event

2003
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:56,768
Again I can't

2004
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:57,792
I can't can't believe it

2005
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:02,912
I can't even put into words how much I can't believe how stupid he

2006
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,448
I just I mean

2007
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,984
It is

2008
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,032
Eventually I mean it's just

2009
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,312
It's not even stupid

2010
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,592
He just cannot stop him

2011
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,128
Jazz no self

2012
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:14,176
Control whatsoever

2013
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:16,992
You want him to stop saying or doing something

2014
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,016
Either

2015
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,296
His entire audience

2016
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,344
Has to not pay attention

2017
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,136
Or stop giving him money for it

2018
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:29,536
Or you have to shut it you have to shut him down I guess I was going to say that it's kind of stupid to have no self-control

2019
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,072
And not work on

2020
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,864
Right

2021
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,888
I kind of

2022
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:36,192
You know if you think about it a little bit more

2023
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:41,568
That lack of self-control is essential to him being able to put on the show that he does

2024
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:47,712
He's made of half a billion dollars not having a lack of control and self-control

2025
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:49,248
And practice Atwood

2026
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:51,808
Probably hurt him more oh yeah

2027
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,088
Him just being like

2028
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:53,856
F***

2029
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,648
Ida saying these people again

2030
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,416
Totally

2031
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,696
But

2032
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:01,280
He's not so dumb that he leaves it doesn't matter that out

2033
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:05,888
Yeah you know it is I can help just like there is an entire

2034
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:06,656
Structure

2035
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,192
Based around making

2036
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:09,216
I'm sure Alex

2037
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,752
Continues to behave the way

2038
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:14,336
Weather weather the pressure is like

2039
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,104
All him

2040
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:17,920
Right but I don't think the pressure is direct

2041
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:21,760
It's like oh Alex you need to keep doing the Alex you need to do this or anyting

2042
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:23,296
Just so much as it is like

2043
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,368
Hey man if I stop for a second

2044
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,184
All of these people are going to

2045
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,256
Lose all of their money or whatever her job yeah

2046
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:36,864
Every photo Owen Shroyer I'll be out of work I mean I think his family in that

2049
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:47,360
If you will

2050
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:53,248
I am interested to see how the aftermath of this plays out in the real world in a courtroom

2051
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:59,648
Yeah and we'll see you there at court starts back on Tuesday so we'll see what we'll see

2052
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:00,672
Probably won't

01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,440
Be good

2054
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,168
