1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guy

2
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,552
Knowledge fight

3
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,632
Jordan

5
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
What's up

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Wow

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,288
I have

8
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,640
I've been noticing a bit stagnation on Alex's

9
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Is Bart

10
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,712
And I feel like

11
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,040
Because we are show the talks about Alex and

12
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,880
Do you know where we kind of have to just go along with whatever he does

13
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,720
A lot of the times it leads to our content Maybe

14
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,024
Feeling a little stake because

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,352
If if the source material is iffy

16
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,752
Right then I mean if it's a 8

17
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:52,384
Lead us into a situation where

18
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
And so I was trying to brainstorm and think about ways around isn't one of the things that I consider you know

19
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Murder

20
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
You nailed it dammit no

21
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:09,280
I was thinking about the past maybe we could do it live

22
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,312
In that spirit

23
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,552
Did we always have a phone no I couldn't afford it any

24
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,624
Idaho

25
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Sony on nip runaway no

26
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,216
We can get we can afford a phone last year and I couldn't afford it back then

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,384
Like to be able to do more of

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
Outside of

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
We are both

30
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:11,232
There are people who have other lived experiences I would love for their voice

31
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Has to be able to

32
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
I'll be heard on the show

33
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:18,400
But at the same time he's not really room for guests so tough

34
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
And

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,568
Bringing anyone else in isn't fair or right

36
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
One of those shows

37
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Anyway

38
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,456
Obviously they've never listen to the show

39
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
And everybody's like okay you're not caught up

40
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,320
That would be like

41
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
450 episodes

42
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
Sitting next to somebody and then being like what

43
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,336
Incorporate better but what

44
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
Call and leave voicemails

45
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
Here we go

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,071
Country code

47
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,727
773 Chicago area code

48
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Words

49
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:33,151
I bet lots of anagram

50
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:39,551
I wish that I was a child because I found a phone number that was 77

51
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
3 up

52
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:46,719
Penis

53
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
I can't say no

54
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
I can't do it

55
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,863
It not me asking if I was a child

56
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:59,263
Perhaps

57
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,271
Cat guys

58
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:25,119
Now my answer is murder that's the situation

59
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
You'd like to leave a message

60
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:32,287
I can't promise it will play all of them on the show given that the other may be a bunch

61
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:37,663
I've no idea how many people call the police but you are welcome to do that

62
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
Is that

63
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,831
We got to go we got to listen to voicemail so then we

64
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Voicemail

65
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:54,047
We're turning into maybe that maybe that'll be all I got is a phone number what's your

66
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:08,127
This is a situation

67
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,175
We got any of The Gift of the Magi Cirque

68
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,783
Do you have to have some sort of a gift for me that gets rid of a phone number

69
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,647
Taking away people's phones I ended electricity

70
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
The new album by washed out

75
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959

No

79
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
It's like chillwave

80
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Okay

81
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735

85
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,767
Looking into the middle distance

86
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
Some watch that starts playing

87
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:06,751

Okay same song

Splinter Cell

117
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,151
I guess I could remember that was one of the times it's so funny

118
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
I believe there's at least three

119
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
I don't remember

120
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:05,439
Jordan

121
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
Further business

122
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
To go over

123
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,839
To take a little peek into the mailbag Z

124
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
This is from

125
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
W

126
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,519
And also say I'm scared

127
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
Because

128
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,175
Oh boy

129
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:32,575
3 water filter

130
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,927
Parentheses sap as though it's a stripper name

131
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
You don't you don't

132
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
Cork a tree and then get water out of it

133
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Because that's not what comes out

134
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
Then maybe I don't know

135
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,703
I'm not a f****** Arboretum guy whatever

136
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
Arboretum

137
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,903
Narrow is the flavor which is a little terrifying I'm excited to give it a try

138
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,695
It smells pretty good I would have a taste

139
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
Myself here

140
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
That's not spicy

141
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,215
I'm not even positive I get an a habanero from that

142
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,615
I'm noticing something with shelters and the level to which there is great

143
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
Most of them

144
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
Really good

145
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,831
Very light

146
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:42,463
And then sort of mainstream Seltzer's Bill across the

147
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Polar

148
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:49,119
Those are more busy

149
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,167
Those are everyday sounds

150
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,263
Some of the newer ones

151
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
I tried those sanzo

152
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
I got sent to us

153
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
And I got to say

154
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Mind-blowing

155
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
Only in the sense that

156
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,343
Calamansi was one of the flavors the other two flavors are lychee and mango is there like I

157
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,671
Kind of headlights

158
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
The flavor is Sturgis

159
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
I know whatever

160
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,839
Ifucking mango is calamansi

161
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,935
Euro to dollar

162
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,335
I think I saw this on a cooking show title

163
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,943
I didn't look it up

164
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,295
Buddy's great 81 out of 100 from 2019

165
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Damn

166
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
I'm going to give this a high score

167
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,719
I think this app is really good little while though I need to think on it

168
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,535
It takes pretty good though thank you so much Charles

169
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,351
Alright Jordans get down to business

170
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
This

171
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
Episode on the 7th

172
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Sucks okay

173
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
August 11th is utter trash

174
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Okay

175
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
Doesn't belong on the air

176
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:09,247
Most of it is just Alex rambling about how come out and said this might be the last

177
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,391
Time you see me

178
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
You keep saying that

179
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
The first half hour of his f****** show is about that

180
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
Do I have a lot of enemies

181
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
This may be the last

182
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Time Yosemite

183
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Lot of very very rich

184
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,447
But they are not happy with what I'm doing

185
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,727
But

186
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
We have one

187
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
To do what

188
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
No other president

189
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Would do

190
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
A favored nation

191
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
Caribe

192
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
Dubai from Other Nation

193
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
Much less cost

194
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Nobody

195
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
And there's a lot of unhappy people

196
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
And a very unhappy

197
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,767
We got one shot to save the country they may kill me

198
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,095
Conversion

199
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
Use the military awning

200
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:06,335
News article say what Alex says they do but

201
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Is

202
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
Huge for our

203
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:12,991
Alex its most of his attention is on this

204
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,439
Yeah it alright I heard a really weird dude say something weird

205
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,303
I don't know why.

206
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:33,471
And I don't care

207
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
In order to escalate by something

208
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:45,759
It's not it's not organic in the beginnings of the on the 7th at least

209
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,879
Couple times about that

210
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:58,047
So the other things on Alex's mind is this New York attorney general of course who is

211
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,863
Pnra in Civic leadership of the NRA

212
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
Right Alex happens to be friends with the creepiest weirdo gross a****** monster

213
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Ted Nugent

214
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,871
Answer yes Ted Nugent come on and talk about

215
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
From the NRA are the attack

216
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Freedom

217
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
Freedom haters

218
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
They are

219
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Is the time

220
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
Everybody you know

221
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Because

222
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Tribes

223
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Haters

224
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Daddy

225
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,375
Make them go crazy

226
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,215
200 by 100 pushups today

227
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
100

228
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,223
Savannah Nugent plugs his website where people can now

229
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
Forget that the problem here was that the NRA was taking people's money and then using it on themselves

230
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,975
So by doing this you're just essentially

231
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,703
Princess so the problem is financial malfeasance and I really think that the solution is flooded with cash

232
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,591
Another way to solve this problem

233
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,895
So Alex

234
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,455
Tattoo complaining about General

235
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,015
S*** about Trump

236
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,671
Like one of them the photo shoot

00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:34,559
Yeah

238
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,119
Happy about that dude

239
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,215
He's complaining about these generals a little bit harsh pivot

240
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Real weird

241
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
Week 4

242
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,431
Another start shooting off their mouths against El Presidente

243
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
That means they're signaling

244
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
10 million-dollar

245
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
Tell me when they leave office

246
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
They wanted

247
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Domino's deals

248
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
Shot cam cuz their webs

249
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
Parade

250
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,287
Make it a little thing in the mail

251
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,639
General milley or whoever we know about your mistress

252
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:27,039
Jamal from your house we know about it to Buddy Boy

253
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:32,927
Turn down Oprah Winfrey politically

254
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,231
All right what you do to me

255
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
They want to eat spaghetti

256
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
Punch your butt.

257
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Pedophile

258
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Oprah Winfrey

259
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
Girls

260
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,111
12 13 14 15

261
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
Jeffrey Epstein

262
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
Anymore

263
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,535
But

264
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:19,775
From the generals into yelling about Oprah

265
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,871
Alex has been talking about Oprah a bit lately

266
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:28,735
Is that a thing we're still doing

267
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,087
It's been like over the last couple days before this he brought her up a couple times

268
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:40,767
I don't complain about her as much as I used to that kind of thing and I took notice of

269
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
But I was like

270
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
What is it why

271
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:50,495
You like I use complain about her a lot now I don't

272
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,847
You could randomly pick a date and criticize Whoopi Goldberg again because there are two things that

273
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,663
They have in common that he hates true yeah

274
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
Behar when it comes to the Alex claims The Joy Behar

275
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
Tried to have sex with him when he went on those two

276
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
I thought you just love

277
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
No

278
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Call Johnny

279
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
No

280
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,847
Developments on forston occupation

281
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
Better now all out the oven

282
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,247
Food

283
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:38,367
I feel like we shouldn't he should be in jail for something about

284
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,207
Had Del bigtree on like a couple again

285
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
Just couple days before that

286
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,327
Clearly some sort of coordinated

287
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,471
Quite frankly I didn't

288
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,287
He has any association with it

289
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,615
Andrew Wakefield kind of promoting a new

290
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Film

291
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
He's putting out

292
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,015
And so we work together on facts

293
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
They're related a mess

294
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Do it

295
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,375
I just checked on IMDb I have no idea there's not even a

296
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,703
Documentaries

297
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:30,847
I do not have the time or respect for his opinions we've already talked about in the past

298
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
I need some not doing that again

299
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
Should not be

300
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Allowed

301
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
Be on the radio

302
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
It's a mess

303
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,599
So we get to the eight

304
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Saturday

305
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Vincy broadcast

306
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
Things up

307
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,767
Going to be commercial free

308
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,119
For the next 2 hours going on our TV and radio satellites

309
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
But I know

310
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
Hundreds of houses

311
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
People tuning in

312
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
Right now

313
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:03,359
Alex Lee use an hour and a half into this special reports

314
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,991
Just a little bit of content

315
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
December

316
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
About child abuse

317
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,159
Additions coming up so if you're sensitive about those things

318
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
Please tread carefully

319
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:23,328
Alex has decided that he's going to do most of the Saturday show about Oprah Winfrey

320
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
And

321
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,400
A particular

322
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,216
What did you just say

323
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:33,568
And it's about a particular business

324
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,640
Representation that he's making that is monstrous

325
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
And

326
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
Religious

327
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,760
When I was reading about Oprah Winfrey

328
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,368
And all the reports that have come out over the years of her and not just being a lesbian

329
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Weather for that

330
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
Sounds like one of the hidebehind

331
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:57,632
But her being underage girls will then you have her hanging out with Harvey Weinstein best friends with him ever hanging out with

332
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,656
Jeffrey Epstein

333
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Hangout

334
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
With Bill Melinda Gates

335
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,056
Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein

336
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,688
And you have people digging into all the weird speeches she's given

337
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,504
Hold onto your horses here on play the moment

338
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
You get a car

339
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,136
Crocheting children enjoy being molested

340
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,440
Is

341
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,536
Representation of what she was saying

342
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,840
This is part of an interview

343
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:34,240
She did in September 2019

344
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Kind of sexual

345
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,616
Sure and so they're at they're having this interview

346
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,920
And it's in the context of

347
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
The difficult

348
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,504
Believe that survivors of abuse have

349
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
Surrounding their memories about it

350
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,880
Sensations

351
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,696
Can feel good

352
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,024
Experience even though it's a victimization

353
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,816
To understand that at the time

354
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:03,936
And it's also a part of the conversation that she's having a

355
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
The the

356
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,616
The victimizer will make the person that they are victimizing

357
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,712
Feel good

358
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,784
Are designed in order to make you feel good

359
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,624
Which makes it very difficult as you get older to put things

360
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,160
To the proper context

361
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,464
As you grow in your heel

362
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
It's

363
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,816
Honestly monstrous like I have no words for how disgusting

364
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
Sing this is

365
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,400
For Alex

366
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,448
Is that Alex yells about

367
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
Like Hollywood

368
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,288
Abusers all the time

369
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,920
And this is Oprah giving a platform to people who have accused in Hollywood

370
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,480
Someone very powerful in Hollywood

371
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,528
So why is he

372
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:57,696
He just doesn't want to see the ground or something because everybody

373
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,256
But him and Trump being

374
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:03,584
Into abusing children

375
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
You can deny the

376
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,216
Or you can go headlong into it

377
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
And just

378
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
F****** a Tackett from The Fray

379
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
You know

380
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Like of

381
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,336
Horse vets

382
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
But that's but she's

383
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,152
Victim

384
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,224
They're giving them to a platform but Alex

385
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
Doesn't f****** do at all

386
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:26,112
He's a monster

387
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
Something

388
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928
You know

389
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:35,328
So you can either be like know she's faking it and doing all of this stuff and all that or you can just go straight

390
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
Just like

391
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:43,520
What makes it sound like

392
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,824
Encouraging

393
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
Do children or something

394
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
And it's just it's disgusting

395
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,992
It's a lot of this episode

396
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
The Saturdays

397
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,624
Makes me like really not want to cover it because

398
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,696
You know it's beyond the pale

399
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,536
This is about where it's at

400
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:14,752
Milo yiannopoulos literally said those things on Rogan's podcast

401
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,872
But he was on this

402
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
Year

403
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,480
That's cruel I hate this f****** hate

404
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
Cruel

405
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:33,952
So that makes it really shity when Alex's stuff like this because I mean it's just an outright lie

406
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,256
Destroy Oprah Winfrey that she deserves it

407
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,560
Starting pedophile supporter bare metal

408
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
And where to go out to everybody

409
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,192
I want to take the gloves off and my buddy said Roberts

410
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,776
Call Don

411
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
And then you need to put

412
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
What's brass knuckles

413
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
That's right

414
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,176
Where the point now where I'm not just going to sit here and fight you my bearfest

415
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
The brass knuckles on

416
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,296
That'd mean I'm an exaggerated Ally

417
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,368
But it may hit you I'm going to hit you to break your ribs

418
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
And break your jaw and not

419
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Your eyes out of here

420
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,464
The butcher answer the ground

421
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,328
It doesn't mean you're going to exaggerate and lie but anything

422
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,728
You can't not exaggerating by

423
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
F******

424
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,544
Talk nonsense

425
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
Spa Q

426
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,408
What could you puff your chest up a little bit

427
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,944
4 minutes

428
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
The problem was

429
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,296
He's going to small

430
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,368
You know Alex

431
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,720
He's in this in the space where the globalist are making their move

432
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:42,048
They're about to take out all the Patriots

433
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
All that

434
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,472
It's kind of realizes if you listen to slip it's pretty clear that he realizes like I said this s*** 1000

435
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Sometimes in the past

436
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
Why would anyone believe me

437
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,944
Every second I'm thinking what are we doing supposed to leave State could what are we doing to expose our operation what do we do to warn America that this

438
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,224
Just like the past attack

439
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,784
They're just probing and conditioning us to stand down

440
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,088
Outrageous stop this is a big attack

441
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
This is a big Tech

442
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
This is a Big Mo

443
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
Well the biggest

444
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Waze alarm

445
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,560
The globalist are more afraid of this show

446
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,376
There any other

447
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Carlson is

448
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
Riveting very populous

449
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,496
He doesn't amazing job

450
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,848
Money's unable to get into the really hardcore stuff that we are

451
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
He recognized

452
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,152
Yeah because

453
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:35,040
People just ignore you and he would get the advertisers would go away

454
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
I think Alex

455
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,208
Framing is is so stupid

456
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
Dislike

457
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,096
Hey you know I said it's a big one bunch of times but this is

458
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,144
And now the only thing that you can

459
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
Do

460
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:54,496
Promote my show because the globalists are so scared of it

461
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:00,896
You know how I know I've told you what a bunny

462
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,200
I give you one Outlet

463
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Me

464
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Yeah

465
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
Here's my problem

466
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:12,160
When we have nursery rhymes that correctly outline the problem and the solution

467
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
Adult should not fall

468
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:18,560
Do you know what I think I cried wolf

469
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,400
Tons of them how do adults not be like

470
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:27,008
Oh I remember the nursery story that I heard when I was

471
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,104
Decided that I will ignore that.

472
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,152
Alex is getting bitten by that snake

473
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
Right now

474
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:41,088
We know from past experience that

475
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Pass

476
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,536
And then it didn't work and got mad at them thinks it's full of s***

477
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:54,144
Yeah man he sold a bumper sticker that said I am Cube and then

478
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,520
Threatened to expose the people who are doing Q at the beginning

479
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
And I never did any day from a week

480
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,360
Nothing happened

481
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
Arbitrary

482
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,736
I'm holding you hostage

483
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,296
I did not follow through it all because

484
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,600
You're a dumb

485
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:18,976
Liar but I forgot the return address so they don't really know

486
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,536
Contact us Oxo steel with it

487
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,680
I'm honestly

488
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,216
I told you I know who shut up

489
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,496
Chewing on a few years ago

490
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,336
One person us intelligence in a person

491
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
Their idea

492
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,688
Taken away from them they got pissed about it they told me that

493
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,808
Then it became his anti-israel thing

494
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
And and

495
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,648
But then it got taken away from those people

496
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
And became like a real movement against the pedophile ring

497
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,512
Months ago

498
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
About 3 months ago

499
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
Sticker out saying I was cute

500
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,656
Be careful to try to get you to do stuff

501
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,192
Make sure you know you're working with

502
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
Citizens getting involved in

503
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,544
Exposing conspiracy and rollers a good thing

504
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
About 3 months ago

505
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
It's becoming something positive

506
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,920
Started good

507
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,480
Because I looked at how I put outside of your children with you lady

508
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
All things that happen

509
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,880
They were positive towards me so I liked

510
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,440
How do we put out stuff about Spirit cooking

511
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
Devil worship

512
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
Child kidnapped

513
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,024
New World Order

514
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,096
Well we do it through 14 and 8

515
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,632
Alright whatever

516
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:35,776
Wayfair store in Alex

517
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,456
This is just so pathetic

518
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,600
And actually I honestly know exactly what's going on I knew immediately what was going on

519
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,232
Now it's gotten so huge and so Grassroots that I guess

520
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,792
The original creators of it thought it and fail

521
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,352
But then it got even more successful so I'm all for it

522
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,656
And the less said about it

523
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
But in your queue person

524
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
You should watch Arlington Road

525
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
And learn how

526
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,128
Spell trick YouTube

527
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,688
Sure Arlington Road

528
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,480
Now they'll use

529
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
You think you're with q

530
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,320
And make you think you're a secret agent to getting orders

531
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Another thing

532
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:31,072
So what's going on here

533
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,656
F****** nonsensical now there's so many options

534
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:38,752
Different groups and a bunch of people are being kicked off social media

535
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:45,152
To the point where there's going to be rampant decentralisation to be able to snipe some of the audience

536
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:55,648
Try and create this narrative like I know who started it and now it's back on the right track and

537
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:04,864
How many how many Cuckoos have we dealt with at least at least two cute

538
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
Yeah

539
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:10,496
Intelligence people

540
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,872
By who

541
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,408
Give it away

542
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:25,344
On specific who those people are there without no matter

543
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
Is it squatter's rights

544
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,648
Send someone

545
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Subway

546
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:42,496
Even is a fake story

547
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,312
And it's not real

548
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,712
Because I mean there's nothing ate mostly

549
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,784
Okay and I don't have time for it we don't care

550
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:01,952
Because one of his interns found that stupid clip from

551
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
Make it look like she

552
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,536
Supports child abuse

553
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,096
So good when your only job as a researcher

554
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,680
Just check blogs posted

555
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:18,080
I just find something on some sort of

556
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,688
Easy stuff

557
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,248
So we get in on the 9th

558
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
On Sunday

559
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
And

560
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,600
Alex is back

561
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,160
On the Trump said that you might

562
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,232
What's going on

563
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Man

During the attempt

00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,160
That's a nice reference

611
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
Very very cryptic

612
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,376
People's attention

613
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Are because

614
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,264

Sounds right

618
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,320
So they can trick a group to run a military coup against

619
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
Before the election

620
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392

00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,264
People were talking about

625
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,312
Whether or not Trump is going to respect

626
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:06,688
Results of the election

627
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
Things that are completely against

632
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
So great

633

This is where

674
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,536
Confused about

Something like that

689
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,640
You can't well now

Some areas by deeper water weather

710
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:05,695
What are we doing is my grandma telling me this story

711
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,231
This show is so weird

712
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
Saturday

Perfect

719
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:39,487
Sent this is such a good microcosm of Alex is taking personal issues and turning them into

720
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:43,583
Inconvenience temporarily at a park

721
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:50,239
This is all about the land Bible say about these in Austin

722
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,031
I knew it all along

723
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:56,127
Knew it all along and it just clicked when my wife was

724
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:02,527
Temporarily bother with her friends

Excited for that I was blown away I haven't laughed this hard it's Alex's done in

Yeah

732
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,479
This pathetic hilarious was a real palate cleanser

733
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:37,599
Is he doing like a a Redux of The Grotto

734
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
With nobody

735
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:43,231
In there what it what happens is

736
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,023
Giving too much away

737
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,375
Alex's wife got turned away or something.

738
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,447
Tu ik you tricked me into going to Parksville whatever

739

Alex goes back with a camera guy

740
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,103
I tries to provoke

741
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,175
Confrontation

742
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:08,575
With a tiny tiny

00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:12,927
He has a tiny Bulldog enough

744
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,767

745
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
Yells

746
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,143
A bunch

747

You can see them

748
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,567
Looking at their phones

749
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,735
Tiny bull horns that make your voice

750
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,015
Quieter

751
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,039
Do you know that

752
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:48,255
So Alex gets to talking about

753
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,815
Covid-19 death discrepancy

754
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,375
Maybe one of them

755
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:58,239
Important things that we could point out right now Alex is dancing around a really dangerous line

756
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
Actually Crossing it

757
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
Sort of casually

758
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,847
He better be really really careful

759
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,895
But all these regular people that died

760
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,199
You know all the rest

761
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,551
$60,000 US Post Office

762
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
Car wrecks

763
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
Gunshot wound

764
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
A seven-year-old boy.

765
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,719
He fell down in the shower

766
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,279
His head got a seizure in blood

767
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
And I get an Instagram

768
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,703
Existing condition

769
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,031
Existing until he hit his head and died

770
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,967
To create fear and all these gullible

771
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
Stupid

772
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
Sheeple

773
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,575
Weather

774
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,647
So Alex is lying about that seven year-old

775
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:53,279
This is a boy in Savannah Georgia

776
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,327
Utah State covid-19 numbers

777
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,959
I want to sing to the media claiming his death was covid related but in actuality fell in the shower and hit his head

778
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,495
Alex making that up

779
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,311
According to an August 8th article in the Atlanta Journal

780
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
Journal-Constitution

781
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
The child

782
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,407
Had a fever fueled seizure

783
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,943
While in the bathtub and brown

784
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,735
The article is

785
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,271
Pretty clear about the situation

786
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:20,927
The County coroner Bill wessinger quote cautioned that the full results of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation autopsy

787
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,695
You're still pending

788
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,743
And maybe a long time coming

789
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:28,607
But he said preliminary investigation suggests covid-19 gave the boy a fever which

790
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,631
Trigger to seizure

791
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,935
Bathing

792
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:38,079
How to investigate the circumstances surrounding a seven

793
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,871
Seven-year-old child's death

794
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,711
That's what I think is absolutely disgraceful there's no excuse for behaving that way

795
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,015
Also he might want to trade

796
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,831
Very carefully around the territory of quotes

797
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,647
Fake people being used to create the image of death

798
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,183
Why is that ever been an issue

799
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,511
That's very very close to crisis actors talk

800
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,583
If I'm being honest this is a really scary development

801
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
This covid -

802
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,679
His whole race specific bioweapon stuff was dumb

803
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:07,519
I'm either calling car crashes covid stuff is dangerous

804
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,079
Idiotic pursues this line

805
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:13,663
Conspiracy much further he's going to put thousands of people at risk

806
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:20,575
They're stupid but there's a distinct difference between conspiracies about covid deaths being mislabeled covid-19 and

807
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,879
Fake people being used to boost death numbers

808
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,183
Never be crossed without

809
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,719
Very good evidence

810
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,255
And specific information

811
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:32,607
You cross that line when it's just a matter of deaths being mislabeled

812
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
The villain is the nebulous global

813
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,215
It's the Fat Cats the elites the man

814
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:41,823
It's the people that the audience can shake their fists up and

815
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,591
Turn off

816
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,407
Triple M to direct your impotent outrage somewhere

817
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,991
Alex can take that directed the profit from their fears

818
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:54,367
Because it's real people dying real families grieving and then someone

819
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,647
Cheating the spread

820
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:01,023
Once you cross the line into the idea that it's fake people being used to boost death numbers

821
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,095
The victims and their families become possible villains

822
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
Which is super dangerous

823
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,471
It's what we saw was Sandy Hook and why the crisis actor a narrative

824
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,007
There were so destructive

825
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:16,383
If you believe that the victims were actors that you have to believe that the families were in on the whole thing

826
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
Probably

827
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:23,807
Alex suggesting they're fake people being used to boost covid-19 opening that door

828
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:28,159
And he better be super f****** careful because he could f*** around and courage of her ass

829
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
My campaign

830
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,231
It's almost unfathomably large

831
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,047
Vagueness here is one of the largest problem

832
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:41,215
If Alex's asserting that there are fake people in the covid death totals and doesn't speak very specifically about what names

833
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:44,543
He's talking about

834
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:50,943
He's introducing the idea to his audience that any of the names of victims they see could be fake people

835
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:56,831
Can you imagine a qanon type online community doing some research into covid death

836
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,903
7 dachshund people

837
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,743
People who they suspect of being fake covid

838
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,303
I couldn't imagine that a few years ago but

839
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,911
What Alex is doing here is the first step down that road

840
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,727
It doesn't mean that it necessarily will grow to that

841
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,031
That

842
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,567
This is the first step of

843
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,151
It's reprehensible

844
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,687
Especially considering

845
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,759
He's currently being sued for doing exactly this

846
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,527
As it relates

847
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,295
Sandy Hook

848
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
And yes he knows

849
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,903
You knows the effect that this kind of thing can have

850
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,463
He knows how he can read traumatize people

851
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:39,327
He has every reason to fully understand the consequences of his actions

852
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,119
And yet he refuses

853
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,911
To learn

854
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,679
Yeah

855
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:47,775
Yep you can't you can't do these these sorts of narrative

856
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,591
They're monstrous

857
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Yeah I'm

858
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:56,991
We are at the space now where the the default though is to assume that there's nobody

859
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,295
The default is to assume that

860
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
It will

861
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
Continue to ask

862
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,647
I have a hard time believing that

863
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,951
Taking that first step doesn't mean take

864
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,719
Taking all of this

865
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:13,119
It's hard to say right now cuz I'm a recording this on the same day as this episode

866
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,935
I don't know what he's going to do

867
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,751
You test that water and

868
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:24,383
You know if there's no reason not to Why not start yelling about how there's all these fake death

869
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,967
And that's not even that's what so many people want to hear

870
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,527
So many people want to hear

871
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,807
They want to hear that

872
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,879
Even look this was a try this is awful

873
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,927
Call even if you don't

874
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,695
Or anything

875
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,719
That you still have to

876
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:39,999
Zaful

877
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,535
And you have to account for it

878
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,607
In what you do that's why you see Republican leaders being like

879
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,143
Reopen School some people

880
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,423
Account

881
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,983
Just put it in our f****** numbers

882
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,799
What people really want to hear it

883
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,847
There isn't even a problem

884
00:50:55,615 --> 00:51:00,479
Well there isn't the problem isn't that people are dying the problem is that they're lying to us

885
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,039
I think I think if people would love that

886
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,855
I think it's unrealistic that anyone would ever

887
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,391
Ever really even accept that

888
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
What date

889
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,183
Can do

890
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,463
Is except

891
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,023
Anything that takes things down a degree

892
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:17,375
You know you take things down just a little bit

893
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,167
But it's less than you think

894
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
Take the ads

895
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:26,335
Soften the blow

896
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,639
70

897
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
I mean

898
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:40,927
It's pointless and it doesn't it doesn't get anywhere

899
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:45,279
Productive

900
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,583
And I only see trouble that could come

901
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,911
And I pray that it doesn't

902
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,959
Especially in the way that Alex has

903
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,751
Has been escalating is violence

904
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,775
Narrative

905
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:59,103
And the way he's been talkin about all the time

906
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,687
Take one for the team

907
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,991
If there are fake dead people

908
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:10,879
Are you not do not think that someone might put two and two together there

909
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,183
I'm thinking I should do maybe

910
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,463
You know

911
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:19,327
Sandy Hook victims families were harassed

912
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,863
Set verweij

913
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:25,215
Like it's not outside the realm of the behavior

914
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,263
Alex on this

915
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:30,591
Past behavior isn't the goodnight

916
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,383
Performance

917
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
So

918
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
I don't know

919
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,967
I mean the scale

920
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,295
Astana Dino Sandy Hook

921
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,831
There's there's a limited

922
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,439
There's like a relatively limited number of people that you

923
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,207
You can harass

924
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,487
But with this

925
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,279
I mean

926
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,815
How many people haven't been touched

927
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,911
Everyone's crazy

928
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:59,775
So Alex is mad at me cuz of course he is

929
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,847
And I've noticed that he's been complaining about

930
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,383
One thing kind of in

931
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,151
Particular

932
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,223
In the

933
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,503
In the past couple days

934
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,039
You got to think of

935
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,575
The vaccine

936
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,599
Is it true

937
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,903
To be able to get a

938
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
Pandemic

939
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,975
To no longer be a pandemic

940
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,791
But to be something that's well

941
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
Control

942
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,399
Well Control

943
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,191
Great rebuttal buddy

944
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Left field

945
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,407
Great rebuttal

946
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,687
Defraud

947
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,415
He's been really obsessed with the patch

948
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,695
The first pitch

949
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:52,767
Well I mean it was good

950
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,559
It seems really reasonable

951
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,631
To play a clip of a guy saying don't worry about

952
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,911
I get what you're saying but

953
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,471
It's just a tool to get things under control

954
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,287
That's hard to argue with

955
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:09,407
Wow.

956
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:15,039
Are you not even manly enough to throw 85 down the pipe 60 ft 6 in

957
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:18,111
How can I trust you with this vaccine information

958
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,927
Like a seventy-year-old

959
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,951
Doctor

960
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:26,047
Head of Department I don't expect

961
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,839
The 12th

962
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,119
I don't

963
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,167
It's on my list of qualifications

964
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,447
They demand we should have

965
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,983
Test for Every Federal in

966
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,263
Employee

967
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
What kind of gun

968
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,663
I can tell you that

969
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:47,039
Troubles me to show people he's kind of obsessed with it but

970
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,063
Study is not scary

971
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,159
Say something that I always say every 6 months

972
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:56,767
As well

973
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,327
26 years

974
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,375
Early on

975
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
People send me letters

976
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,191
You're scared

977
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:08,031
My wife or you're scaring my brother or my father or my husband or my son

978
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
You know that there

979
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,199
Change it

980
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,991
And why are you trying to scare my fam

981
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,831
So you understand why qanon is a problem

982
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,111
Are dogs barking

983
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
At 2 a.m.

984
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,255
That the house Nexus bonfire

985
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,839
And I was like 10 years old I got a body up

986
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,983
Fear-mongering

987
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,775
When the dogs bark

988
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,111
Even though their house is on fire

989
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,511
Some electrical fire

990
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,327
People

991
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,375
Yeah

992
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,655
He just you know like

993
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:11,519
He does metaphor

994
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:16,383
Saved his neighbor's house

995
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,455
I don't care

996
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,783
He's using the story to illustrate how he sees himself in the world

997
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:28,671
He's this kid who hears the dog barking and wants his neighbors at their house is on fire thereby saving their house

998
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,951
Very simple thing

999
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,767
Fires

1000
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,791
To the country

1001
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,327
It seems like he's never not

1002
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
The hero in his

1003
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:44,031
That's a great story if the house is on fire

1004
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:49,151
Must be on fire

1005
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:54,271
The fire marshal is secretly told him

1006
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:59,391
It has all the telltale signs of a neighbor's setting the fire themselves to scam insurance money

1007
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:05,535
The only information he has to go on his dogs barking and the rest of the story is infantile mind

1008
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,303
Writing

1009
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:10,143
Weird narrative textual eyes the dog barking

1010
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,703
In a way that fits the view of the world that he has

1011
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:17,823
Which is basically just from movies

1012
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,359
Is neighbor's house is on

1013
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,127
Inspire

1014
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
And he's like

1015
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:27,551
It's all fire that much look at that other house over there that's not letting go talk to that

1016
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:32,671
The first neighborhood

1017
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,231
When you metaphorically hear a dog barking

1018
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:37,535
You should not assume that your neighbor's house is on fire

1019
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,351
Because there's a ton reasons

1020
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,399
Princeton's by neighbors dog barks

1021
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,959
Whenever I come home and my keys

1022
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:50,335
When you metaphorically hear a dog barking you should check to see if the house is on fire

1023
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:54,175
This is the stuff that's missing from Alex's process which is basically

1024
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:59,039
You're what you're welcome to be worried that your neighbor's house is on fire

1025
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,575
And then gather evidence

1026
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,879
Other than a dog barking

1027
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:09,791
How to hunt for doesn't work because in his work in his career as an anti New World Order propagandist

1028
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,071
You've been able to find all

1029
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:15,167
Wilmot instances of dogs barking but there's never really been a fire

1030
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:21,823
Even so every time he hears a dog barking eats if you don't believe him

1031
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,591
Forties in the fields

1032
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,127
The fiery k9stud

1033
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,943
His career is all bark no fire

1034
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,223
And

1035
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,015
Yeah

1036
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
Covering up

1037
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,719
Undoubtedly

1038
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,791
So this is funny Alex

1039
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:47,167
But when you swear to God

1040
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,471
Blasphemy

1041
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,287
What is my witness I've never consciously lied

1042
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Anybody

1043
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,591
Politics and issues

1044
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,407
Have a lot to a girlfriend I'm cheating on her side like that Elliot

1045
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
What

1046
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,735
Are we doing

1047
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:04,319
What are we doing here what are we doing

1048
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,343
What are the

1049
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,671
Alex is 100% intentionally lied about

1050
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:14,559
I would be more worried that was true it's all of the lies that we heard him tell has been just like

1051
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:19,679
Unconscious for uncontrollable

1052
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,983
Purposeful life

1053
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,287
Yeah it would be like

1054
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:28,127
Have a neurological

1055
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:34,015
Because there's even just intention on this next to

1056
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,087
This isn't

1057
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,879
No it's not

1058
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:42,719
I mean we can talk about what the implications of that are later but

1059
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:48,607
He's rambling he starts talking about

1060
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,911
If you're a random person

1061
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,519
Pictures of LARPing the Susan

1062
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,079
Fantasy world where you're playing video games all day

1063
00:59:59,359 --> 00:59:59,871
For you it is

1064
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,455
America's first

1065
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,087
He said all they're bunch of wimps

1066
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,671
Intimidated

1067
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,487
Yeah well

1068
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,791
Roblox are you

1069
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
Somebody

1070
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:27,775
Shakira

1071
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,871
Quadriplegic

1072
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,687
F*** you man

1073
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,479
Disgust

1074
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:42,367
At the end there but also it's a lie

1075
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:46,975
Alex says a video but he's played a bunch of times and someone interviewing Foster earlier

1076
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,791
They were asking why you was carrying

1077
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:55,423
Yeah he explained that they had some friends who have gotten arrested and so like their first amendment

1078
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:00,031
Was being encroached exercise

1079
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,591
And the guy asks him

1080
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,639
Do you expect to have to use that

1081
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:07,711
And he said if I run into any police

1082
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,015
I won't need you to that would keep you I would be dead

1083
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,831
Yeah and the people who want to f*** with us

1084
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
Our pussies

1085
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
Yeah basically

1086
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,415
They're not going to start anything

1087
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,231
He's not saying that he likes to intimidate people

1088
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,767
This is Alex

1089
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,071
I mean

1090
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,607
That's an intentional

1091
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,887
Or else

1092
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,167
It's just

1093
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,703
So subconscious for him

1094
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,007
Making up reality as

1095
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:35,359
He assumes it is as opposed to how he knows it to be

1096
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,919
Bunch of times

1097
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:42,527
He has every reason to know what the Foster actually said

1098
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:47,647
Alex's version of reality experience

1099
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,719
Is experience to him as of Jack

1100
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,535
I think I have an experiment

1101
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,095
That I really think my

1102
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,631
BF might be a Luminator

1103
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,679
I would really like

1104
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,495
Too well that would

1105
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:09,919
The Great

1106
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,199
Exactly no

1107
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,527
What if he had to like sit down and just

1108
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,807
Transcribe

1109
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,575
A video

1110
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,623
Just like Plano

1111
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,671
Here we're going to play this video

1112
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,975
All you need to do is write down what

1113
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,511
What they're saying

1114
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:29,119
Choose to do it so I would like to see how he what what does he hear

1115
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:32,447
Does he physically here in his brain cuz

1116
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,751
Can't always be what people are saying

1117
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:38,591
Must not be able to know how much

1118
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:45,503
Depictions that he provides grocery store it's a month.

1119
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:51,903
You just f****** around or do you actually.

1120
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:57,791
I actually hear or experience is that like he takes this video of something

1121
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,863
As Gary Foster saying these things

1122
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,447
And he has turned it into I like to intimidate people

1123
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,239
And it should be

1124
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:12,639
Take all context away from it this is a guy who's at a black lives matter protest

1125
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,919
It's a guy with a

1126
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:20,319
Asserting the Second Amendment Alex should be 100% on board with this

1127
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:23,135
Cuz he's against the cause of whatever he's like now

1128
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,951
He hasn't gone he's trying to intimidate people

1129
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,255
It's it's nonsensical

1130
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:32,351
It's it's very worrying

1131
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:36,447
Who's going to take care of your quadriplegic roast yourself

1132
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,983
Piece of s***

1133
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,311
That's the type of s*** that you only see in like a f******

1134
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,639
Like that the level of psycho

1135
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,175
Required

1136
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,199
To say that s***

1137
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,735
It's really

1138
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,015
A person devoid of

1139
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,063
Of apathy

1140
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
Yeah

1141
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,159
I'll be the other thing

1142
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,231
Garrett Foster

1143
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,815
His new Facebook group

1144
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:06,399
We're going to put these terrorist attacks that never ended up happening

1145
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:09,215
Until you combined those two

1146
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,519
Eat like you single Foster was a

1147
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
The part of that

1148
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:15,103
There's no indication that that is the case

1149
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,151
And so you should go f***

1150
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,039
Scoop before we get into this really fun

1151
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,087
Trip to the park

1152
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,623
You got a big scoop

1153
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,671
Yeah this is fun

1154
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,207
This is the play

1155
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,047
You know like we were

1156
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,351
Look up the coach of the

1157
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,887
Patriots

1158
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,735
His party wouldn't

1159
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,087
He persuaded the governors of Wisconsin and Michigan

1160
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,351
President

1161
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,983
Media

1162
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:16,799
Military

1163
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:35,231
Mega

1164
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:38,303
Bigger

1165
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:50,079
Just like an hour out of breath

1166
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:57,759
New York Times article about some more games exercises

1167
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,831
Working through scenarios that a bunch of people

1168
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,623
Like a bunch of different stuff

1169
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:09,279
And I came out like early August

1170
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:13,119
The end of July was already an article about this in the Atlantic

1171
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:16,191
This isn't some kind of weird secret thing

1172
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:22,079
One of the scenarios they ended up laying out

1173
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,895
Esta played Biden

1174
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,663
And he does

1175
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,431
Concede

1176
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,343
There's a number of different scenarios

1177
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:38,463
Is fixating on a being like that

1178
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:44,863
Not that the one the one where Trump wins and everybody's fine he doesn't deal with that war games and wins and everybody

1179
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,679
Doesn't deal with that WarGames the only thing that he can

1180
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,959
Can fixate on it

1181
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,495
The most dramatic

1182
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,519
Almost

1183
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,543
Cinematic

1184
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:57,919
So

1185
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,455
Now

1186
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Take you to bark

1187
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,527
Alex Jones

1188
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:04,831
Has been

1189
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Kicked out

1190
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,927
Or something

1191
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:12,767
Try to pull over near my house in Plaistow Hill alive

1192
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,071
Quarter mile hill

1193
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,375
I should go down in the email from there

1194
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,911
He probably a 50

1195
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
Sunday morning

1196
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:24,799
Today

1197
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,847
Johnny O yang

1198
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:27,871
Greenvale

1199
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,895
And a big beautiful crazy

1200
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,663
Right now

1201
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:31,967
Like Jonah

1202
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,247
Good news

1203
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,271
Opposed to

1204
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,207
And they said we shouldn't have

1205
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,231
College

1206
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,767
Enforcing

1207
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,047
And they shut them down

1208
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:52,447
Dot-dot

1209
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,007
F****** college kids a lesson

1210
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,799
College kids

1211
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:57,823
Then the world

1212
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,383
So now Alex goes to a

1213
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,455
Special report about his trip to Barton Springs

1214
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,759
Worst is over

1215
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:12,159
Like I know that we've talked to the Past like Wayback that have Bad John bowne

1216
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:16,255
There's another guy he sucks even more

1217
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,047
Austin city mayor

1218
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:18,815
Steven Adler

1219
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,095
Is attempting to see

1220
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
Control

1221
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,399
He has erected

1222
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,167
Mixture

1223
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,471
Registration booth at Park

1224
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,263
And hired

1225
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,287
Lifeguards

1226
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,823
Who have lost their jobs

1227
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,871
As a result of the covid shutdown

1228
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,919
Vibing to this music

1229
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,199
And register the names

1230
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,223
Anyone who n

1231
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,295
Going on all over the Nation Ford

1232
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,343
The United Nations

1233
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,623
+ 221

1234
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,671
I'm not worried about it

1235
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,463
Public landfill by Ivan

1236
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,487
For their own private

1237
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,047
Entrances

1238
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,071
Have been set up

1239
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,863
Like this by the Austin Parks.

1240
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,911
It is unlawful

1241
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,959
It is nothing more than the edict

1242
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,519
A radical leftist mayor Adler

1243
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,943
Who produced that

1244
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:13,087
Who produced that music cuz they can't possibly fill royalty-free track

1245
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,439
Some BJ Emporium

1246
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:23,839
Not bad seriously I did not hear much of what he said I was just really like that

1247
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:30,239
Maybe Leo zagami did it

1248
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:39,455
The Parks Department

1249
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:42,271
So this is unlawful and unconstitutional

1250
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,551
Who's doing a gender

1251
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:46,111
21

1252
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,439
Be the president who's doing it

1253
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,743
Through the lifeguards

1254
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,023
Those f****** life

1255
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,935
So Alex yelling

1256
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:03,007
Of course with his tiny little ballora

1257
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,943
At this point he just has the Boulevard in his hand

1258
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,967
This is such a

1259
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:18,367
So pathetic like you came down here specifically brought your bullhorn

1260
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:24,767
Travis Boulevard

1261
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:31,935
It's a really sad

1262
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:39,103
Be one thing if you was going about his business that many at this interaction that happened organically

1263
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,639
As it is

1264
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:47,295
He's walking really fast like past these people who are set up outside the trail and Trey

1265
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,791
Cool

1266
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,095
And now you guys use your cousin

1267
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
Charging

1268
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,727
Started hot

1269
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:09,055
Yeah already gone Adam

1270
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,639
Illegal power grab

1271
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,407
Of the people

1272
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,175
Greenbelt

1273
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:36,447
There's a small part of me that wonders if this is a joke

1274
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:42,847
It's obviously not he's taking this very seriously really seriously

1275
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:49,247
Nothing he's ever done absolutely

1276
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,551
Few things that I would recommend people watch

1277
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:55,647
Watch this for the tiny bulb it made me laugh really hard

1278
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,207
I just here's what I keep my laundry Alex's like

1279
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:02,303
Covered in sweat

1280
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:06,399
I just I just keep picturing this evening The Sandlot where they're at

1281
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:12,799
The pool and the girl lifeguard give them out to mouth and right before

1282
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,359
Somebody with a bullet

1283
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,383
Who are you this is

1284
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,175
The grocers in Damascus

1285
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:21,247
Mr. mask man

1286
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:29,695
So this is where it gets personal about it everybody about how his wife was allowed

1287
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,191
They aren't you

1288
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:46,591
No crowd that you can see there is maybe one other person

1289
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:52,991
People who are like sitting in beach chairs

1290
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,599
Ridiculous

1291
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,367
Okay

1292
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,311
It sucks

1293
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:20,895
Is a little much

1294
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:26,271
Do Die Hard movies

1295
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
Wow

1296
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:34,463
Reservation

1297
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,743
The free country

1298
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:42,143
I'm using that at the next Chicago restaurant I go to Steakhouse

1299
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:46,239
Good table move on with my life

1300
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:51,871
Antonio shows up

1301
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:55,967
I think it turned away thankfully Alex

1302
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,039
While we were there a family from standings

1303
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,319
Antonio arrive

1304
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,855
Enjoy the day in the park

1305
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:07,231
After an hour drive

1306
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:27,455
The gentleman from San Antonio spoke to the Austin Police

1307
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,759
And was told that there is no law

1308
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,831
The police allow the family to enjoy the park

1309
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,623
Has the law permits

1310
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:44,863
Respect

1311
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:50,495
There is no reason for a Boulevard

1312
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:54,335
I can't stress that enough everyone could hear him

1313
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,455
Krowd

1314
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:02,527
Talkin people could hear him out doubted

1315
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
Comical

1316
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,647
So Alex is little bad breath cure

1317
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,207
And

1318
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:15,327
Certainly not but I realize like

1319
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:19,167
I've successfully got the San Antonio family into the park

1320
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,447
And now

1321
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:25,823
A g stand for a crowd has nobody

1322
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:53,983
I think Alex realized that this narrative doesn't work for what happened cuz the police site

1323
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,591
Oh no it's the

1324
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:06,015
I ever am I going with this

1325
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:12,415
So often as a City Police Station

1326
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,975
Have the police out here.

1327
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:16,255
Something

1328
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,559
Wait I like what you doing

1329
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:22,143
How do I do this I'm going to blow up the lifeguard station

1330
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,191
Alright

1331
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:28,031
I just think that was

1332
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,567
This is not going to

1333
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,335
Good2Go

1334
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:36,479
There's a few more people

1335
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:41,855
Tries to get people to barbarash

1336
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,703
Covid-19

1337
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:13,087
Fieldpiece

1338
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,111
Scuse me question

1339
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:18,975
What I find really interesting about this is that

1340
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,279
Very sad

1341
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,815
A real bummer

1342
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,375
Clearly like a

1343
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,399
Personal gripe

1344
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:31,007
What's that movie I can make a story out of it

1345
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,823
Not good

1346
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:34,591
Kind of

1347
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,687
Narrative

1348
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
Completion

1349
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,223
Like

1350
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,527
He started his career

1351
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:48,927
A guy alone

1352
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:55,839
And now he goes back to Barton Springs cuz his wife was asked if she had a reservation and

1353
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:58,655
I don't want to share music

1354
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:05,055
If I ever

1355
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,199
Doesn't have the cash

1356
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:17,599
She wants them to just like

1357
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,135
So Alex

1358
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,927
Comes back after this video

1359
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,975
I guess a little bit wistful

1360
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,999
About some of his memory

1361
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,279
About this Trail

1362
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,375
I know about that place

1363
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,263
That's a good times there

1364
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,079
Tell me what 20

1365
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,151

01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,223
College 20

1367
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247

1368
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,271
Girls down

1369
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:50,879
You told me this

1370
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,647
I thought you were

1371
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,535
Pretty sure you thought everyone was

1372
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351
Illustrate

1373
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,119
Everything

1374
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
Beer

1375
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,615
Really great products

1376
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:18,015
So yeah I didn't have time to get to some of these important news stories had to have a petty grievance with the

1377
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,551
The creek

1378
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,343
Man my wife she

1379
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:27,743
Drove over a pothole bitloft a little bit

1380
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:32,351
What was going on and I realize our destroying the roads on

1381
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:38,751
Stardust Crusaders

1382
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:43,871
He's going to go on a crusade

1383
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:49,503
Yeah that way too f****** nowhere Noel

1384
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,343
He hasn't brought it up since

1385
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,671
Campaign against people not being let in parks

1386
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,463
Is just about his own

1387
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,743
Personal problem

1388
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,303
This is all just

1389
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,327
Such rank

1390
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,095
Projection

1391
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:07,935
Just because

1392
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,959
Tempest

1393
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,239
Fieldpiece

1394
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,824
It made me laugh

1395
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:14,848
So hard

1396
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,224
Look horn is too small

1397
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:24,320
For an adult at Alex's of stick adult so

1398
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,368
Way too small for him

1399
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:30,720
If it's a manifestation of like downsizing and like

1400
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:33,024
Cutting expenses Infowars

1401
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,048
Genital area

1402
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:37,376
This couldn't Crush any kind of tyranny

1403
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,752
The

1404
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:48,896
Okay so I know you're all

1405
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:55,552
On the first day of course now we have to practice what you would do if a large man with a tiny bullhorn

1406
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,600
It's state

1407
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,136
State-required now

1408
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:02,464
That picture of Alex Jones up there we keep that

1409
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:06,560
Just to remind us what exactly it looks like and who it is who will be

1410
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:11,424
Greater Austin area

1411
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,728
I wouldn't say the old

1412
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,520
Certainly

1413
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:19,616
The old man willing to use it the way it was meant to be yours

1414
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
You know

1415
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,248
And when you get a tardy Boulevard

1416
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,784
Do you think that was a good purse

1417
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,600
It makes me think

1418
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,880
Betty has like

1419
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:37,280
191

1420
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:46,240
Like Rodger Federer with tennis racket like you've got them lined up and it's like

1421
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:51,104

Like 50 Cent all about the image that I have

1433
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,528
It's like in the movies

1434
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,576
You know where the guy's got the gun

1435
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:38,720
You sitting behind the desk and underneath the desk Alex pulls at the buck

1436
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,488
Fight back

01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,864
So it is like an office

1440
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,960
Alex's place

1441
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:56,640

David Icke

1448
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:15,328
Looks to the camera

1449
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,864
