1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them posing

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
Knowledge vype.com

4
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:12,192
Ojo

5
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,592
Oh my bright spot today Dan is a new album well it's not as new as I would have liked but I just caught up with

6
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
I wish it was yesterday so I could be even cooler actually when you find out the album

7
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,528
Otherwise

8
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928
New Radicals who is one of my favorite

9
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
Jazz pianist covid-19 70's from a couple months ago

10
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
Robert Glasper though is specific cuz he works in the R&B a lot he provides a lot of hooks he provides all kinds of stuff

11
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:50,336
Suffern all kinds of people but he is himself an incredibly talented

12
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,736
Jazz pianist and songwriter and I f****** love it

13
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
For you to enjoy always

14
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
Three-way mustard in it

15
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
At least not as unhealthy as rulers like

16
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,336
We'll meet in the middle. Every way too soft

17
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,408
Serve do ice cream it is the best

18
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,248
I will hear no other argument frozen yogurt better

19
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
Better than frozen yogurt better than ice cream better okay better than what other Frozen things are there

20
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,512
A popsicle

21
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,144
Welcome back.

22
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
In 600 something episodes we have never done what would you describe as a two-parter I don't think

23
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,944
According this directly after we should go to the Lassiter

24
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,344
I suppose the closest would be obviously our documentaries wherein we

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,928
Obviously why would Stan

26
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
Are episodes irregularly two-and-a-half 3 hours long why would we do a two-parter other people do to part as a good point

27
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:21,728
We do five parts reflecting on a two-party

28
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128
We will be getting into deposition

29
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,688
Blackjack

30
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,760
This is a fun thing about this is

31
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
It's to the Daria and Alex depositions that took place the next days after that

32
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,000
Unfortunately the timing didn't work out that I could have been

33
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
At the Owen deposition but it was it was right in that ballpark right around the same time

34
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
Watch the cock Destroyer be destroyed this was the nearest of mrs.

35
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:02,688
The legends

36
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,904
I'm so we'll get down to business on this year is deposition

37
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
New Wok

38
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,303
Alicia's or you walk

00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167

00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,311

I'm a policy wonk thank you very much thank you

47
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:17,951
The Kid Daniel's deposition Marcel Fontaine case

48
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,303
Being a targeted Lee focused to kit and his behavior

49
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,887
This we're back on the Sandy Hook business deep but

50
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:32,287
Owen Shroyer is the person who did the video that was defamatory towards Neil

51
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,359
In response to the Megyn Kelly interview

52
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,759
And so there is actually a bit more of an angle in that you're not really provided when

53
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Walking with a

54
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,927
Cuz it was actually Owens

55
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,255
He was on the ground that the prompted a lot of this

56
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,399
That's that's pretty interesting position I'm excited for a couple things

57
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
Particularly something we're going to get into pretty pretty early

58
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
But first

59
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
We must learn

60
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
As we always do with all these depositions

61
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
Hey bro

62
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
How much you make it

63
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,247
How much money do you make from Free Speech systems is a salary or hourly

64
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Celery

65
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
What's your salary

66
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
Give or take

67
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,951
Currently about just over 100,000 a year after taxes

68
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
After taxes 100000

69
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,863
I don't know the exact number

70
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
I think it's about

71
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:34,495
I think before taxes is just over 120 after tax I think it's just

72
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,335
When is not worth that

73
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,735
Text figures for Owen Shroyer I can't believe that he's bringing in

74
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:51,135
A commensurate amount of money I just can't believe it I mean come on

75
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,487
Over replacement is low that is brutal

76
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,631
All but that's I guess how it works over there man you just everybody makes about $100,000

77
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:08,031
That's it's just not fair it's got to be shut up money to someone something along those lines so

78
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
Sometimes you wonder about the how how did you end up in this place how did you get to

79
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,319
Bit of Owens backstory mechanics of it

80
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
Did you apply to Infowars or what did they reach out to you

81
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
They reached out to

82
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
And by day who is they

83
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,007
My first professional contact with Infowars I'm guessing would have been from Rob do

84
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
RAB do

85
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
From who

86
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Robert

87
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,015
And was that an email or call

88
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
Come meet you

89
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Maybe both

90
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
But the first request was to just do an interview on air

91
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,255
Then they asked if I wanted to come down for

92
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Hey

93
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,815
Interview for a job

94
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
When I came down to Austin for that

95
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
Summer of 2016

96
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
Goodyear job and I accepted

97
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
When you got when you accepted the job was was your job

98
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
What was your job

99
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
At the time

100
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
Field reporter

101
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
Every once awhile I would do live

102
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Feeling hosting

103
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
Live on air

104
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,255
I was doing a lot of video editing at the time then as well

105
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,303
So I would say it's hard titles

106
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Reporter

107
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Editor

108
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Journalist

109
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Yeah

110
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
And

111
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,031
Has your job changed since you started

112
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
Far as the day-to-day yes

113
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
But

114
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
There's never really been up

115
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,783
Professional title Persei slapped on me

116
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
Sit here today you're still a journalist

117
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,647
Yeah for the most part I've still been doing the same

118
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,255
You said for the most part other than being a journalist what else

119
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Thanks you too

120
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Longest

121
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
Referring to

122
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
I'm now live

123
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,703
3 hours a day versus back then

124
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,519
I may not have even been live one minute today

125
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
Depending on the day

126
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
This does not become as big an issue as it was me kick the argument about what is or is not

127
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,951
On-air a lot more now pretty clear

128
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,351
So as we know from listening to the show around this time. Before Owen got hired he was a guy who'd call into Allen

129
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,191
What's the show every now and again. Is a guest but is it just a random caller

130
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847
At the same time he was posting videos on YouTube where you going and probably way more

131
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,455
Important for his portfolio than any of the sports journalism work he had done in the past

132
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:00,063
If you go back to before he worked at Infowars to find some interesting things

133
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
You can find some coverage of him for protesting police tyranny in the wake of the Michael Brown killing in Fergus

134
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
Missouri

135
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
Just outside his home town of St Louis

136
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:14,911
Interesting Lee if you consult this press coverage including an article in the st. Louis Post-Dispatch

137
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,311
You find that Owen wasn't totally forthcoming when Bill in this deposition asked him about his previous

138
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,383
Employment before he got to working it Infowars

139
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,759
He was doing sports journalism some Youth Development some odd jobs like DJing

140
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
There's something you didn't mention

141
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:37,695
Probably not Material as an emission like he was hiding something but

142
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,303
Go from 10 to midnight on 1380 a.m. in St Louis

143
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,703
As is the case with a lot of radio stations 1380 a.m. went through a lot of format changes over the course of its lifetime

144
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,591
I'm sure it had stretches of the top 40 station a gospel Outlet in a couple runs a Sports Talk

145
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:59,967
But just prior to 2014 it had one of the most bizarre radio formats I've ever heard

146
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,879
This station with the call letters kfxn was a sister station with another talk station out of

147
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
St. Louis kfnx

148
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
These two stations decided to Brand themselves the man and the woman with each breath

149
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,887
They thought would appeal to either men or women

150
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
I am excited to hear the results and it was a bad idea that sounds pretty fast

151
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
Yes

152
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,991
Kfns was the man station but decided it would go back to his Sports Talk format after the flop

153
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
Kxfm

154
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,623
But they ended up syndicating just the Yahoo sports feeds

155
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
I've got a plan for you okay

156
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:46,303
How about we immediately exclude half of our Audience by the same people

157
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,703
Right okay so then how about let's immediately exclude half of their auditions it's a great idea

158
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,567
After this kfxn decided to switch it up again and they were branded themselves as BX

159
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
Extreme talk radio

160
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:06,015
The Hope was appeal to an appeal to like an edgier audience or at least do an experiment to see if the station geared towards

161
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,135
What's up like that could work for advertisers and break even or make a profit

162
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
This was when towing at a time slot on air if you take what he saying in the st. Louis Post-Dispatch article about his protest

163
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Face value

164
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:24,191
It doesn't seem like he's necessarily the worst person you would encounter on it extreme talk station

165
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:29,311
He was out at the I-64 overpass with a sign saying quote tyranny is here

166
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,663
The new goal was protesting the government overreach in the aftermath of the shooting

167
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,527
He told the papers at the protesters quote don't deserve to your gas and guns pointed at them

168
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:44,927
Which would sound fine if we didn't have natural suspicions based on where his career ended up leaving at 1.

169
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:51,839
Extreme talk station didn't work out at least partially due to the complete chaos of the person running the cup

170
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
Company that owned the station a guy named Dan Marshall would you say he might have been too extreme to

171
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
Put on their personalities were willing to go on the record by name and talk s*** to the Post-Dispatch like Jay Randolph Jr

172
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,687
Atmosphere at the station like this

173
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,039
Quote it's like nothing I've ever seen it like every man for himself

174
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
This was a guy with a job this was a guy with decades and radio

175
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
Behind him so the situation had been pretty sure I had to call my way out of a closet

176
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:30,495
That was because a fight your way out of there with Nick when you clock out completely insane

177
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:36,895
From there they were allegations of people not being paid a mother and other unsavory reports about Marshall's leadership

178
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:43,551
But some people sided with Marshall and there was a bit of a civil war that broke out between the two sides

179
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,879
What host on kfns a guy named Charlie tuna who is black

180
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,279
Became the target of some racially insensitive comments made by Nick trupiano at kxfm host who was upset

181
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,351
Tuna didn't like Marshall while trupiano did

182
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:02,239
Brian McKenna another kxfm hose to it spoke out against Marshall

183
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:08,895
This led to McKenna's showing up at kfns and trying to fight trupiano I love it security intervene

184
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:14,783
However a short time later McKenna and Marshall got into a fist fight

185
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:21,439
You can't follow him around the rest of the day he was appointed to fight the host and then ended up there

186
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
Fighting football

187
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Remarkable

188
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,351
The Host

189
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,935
Dogs got into a literal fist fight with the station manager

190
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,495
And when reached for comment Marshall said quote

191
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:40,895
I spent the night in the hospital he spent the night in jail you can draw your own conclusions about what happened

192
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,623
I'll give you that one

193
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
11 is it Owen's experience working in an environment like this made him think of the way Alex acts towards his employees is somehow

194
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,423
Normal or acceptable

195
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,823
I need to recreate the issues that I was born in order to

196
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,223
Owen wasn't there long because they didn't last more than like six months

197
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,319
For the station went back to his Sports format and then eventually just started leasing the airtime out

198
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
I meant eventually they'd outright sold to Salem media only

199
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:32,351
This story is a fascinating piece of Americana

200
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:39,007
Completely out of control work environment

201
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:45,407
Illustrate why he puts up with Alex's ethereal stock does it matter

202
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:51,807
I think the stories great explaining it was one of the only ways that I can introduce one of the greatest things I've

203
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
Sounded preparing this episode

204
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
When is been kicked off of online platforms but one that he hasn't been booted from and he probably doesn't even realize

205
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Is he still on

206
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
Is SoundCloud

207
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,703
As fate would have it in 2016 he posted a demo reel on Soundcloud do you like fishing for a job at ND

208
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,103
Do not tell me that this is his audition reel for Infowars

209
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:20,735
Ask him to do or if he did it just to get Rob's attention in the first place but either way this thing is amazing

210
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,015
One level

211
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,623
Painfully transparent as an attempt on his part to do and Alex impression

212
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:33,279
But on the other hand it's also recording of an idiot complaining about nothing getting mad for no reason for him

213
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:39,679
I honestly can't tell if he's our clips from his kxfm show or he just recorded himself in his free time but I choose to believe

214
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:46,079
Leave it to the ladder because I didn't adjust really funny like that

215
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,407
Is 20 minutes long and no one but me should have to sit through all of that

216
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,063
It's too long for a demo reel time and been like that

217
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,463
Going to the trash

218
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,583
5 seconds I remember when I was trying to get into voiceover work it was like you have a minute

219
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,983
If that no I went to had a whole recording session I did the whole thing and all the experience people were like

220
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:20,383
Like that was great you're never going to get hired by anybody stop it

221
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
So I will say one thing

222
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,575
When comes out the gate pretty hot for all of this because

223
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
Every game

224
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
They salute a veteran

225
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
They they they give him tickets for the game

226
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,935
And then during a break they put the camera on them

227
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,007
The fee IPA guy comes on instead

228
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
Salute to the veterans you know so-and-so

229
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,919
Just like the conditioning

230
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
Everybody stands up and cheers you know and if you don't everybody looks you weird or kind of your nose says you're a jerk or whatever

231
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,719
How about instead of just putting them on camera and standing up and cheering like a bunch of vapid moron

232
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,511
Why do we give him a mic

233
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,351
What's give him 30 seconds or a minute to beat their mine

234
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
How about that

235
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,703
Well we can't have that we don't know what they might say

236
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Oh

237
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:24,383
Political correctness speak at the game are you say you want to order

238
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
We don't want to see reading a transcript of Alex's show like two days before this I could have absolute

239
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,183
More transparent than his current work certainly

240
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,767
That's weird because it feels like he's doing impression now

241
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,167
But poorly disguised impression

242
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
How about we just tell him to do it

243
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:55,103
I don't know why you're mad

244
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:03,295
You mad on their behalf for a complete that I've never heard anybody make never ever once

245
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,647
So you're this next clip is proof that Owen is is Brave

246
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,463
He's a man of action

247
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,583
Trying to wake people up I'm sick of these cheer Annika Lindley

248
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:23,519
Butchers plays because they get to get where's my wallet

249
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,335
$1 bill

250
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,711
This is worth noting that a lighter in here

251
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,647
Federal Reserve Note the Federal Reserve is a Rothschild Secret

252
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:47,071
He's willing to performatively threaten to burn a $1 bill that he's also willing to spread lies and bulshit for Alexandra

253
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:53,471
Exchange for 100,000 of those bills principal

254
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,871
Give it a lighter, my God he is just recording this on his own it is

255
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:04,735
Surrounded

256
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:11,135
Very very much and Alex Joseph it is it is

257
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
Be offended if I were Alex

258
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:18,815
If I were Alex listen to this and be like oh my God is that what people think I sound like what a bless you were specifically trying to find a

259
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:23,423
The younger version of yourself ohmygod that's what people sounds like

260
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,823
Yeah you're Alex you kind of have to deal with that early

261
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,615
Yeah I think I think if you would like

262
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
I don't know

263
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:39,551
Considering the possibility of needing an acolyte or something like that maybe like how I see myself in him right boom

264
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,903
He also has more complaints about the dollar bill make you believe that

265
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
I'm at the pyramid on the back

266
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,095
Why is there a pyramid on the back of the dollar bill

267
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
Boat over the pyramid on the dollar bill

268
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,847
Stop it. Illuminati

269
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,223
In God We Trust

270
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,623
Separation of church and state guess that's just total

271
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,696
Baker

272
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:24,096
You like your little Ralph Ralph dollar

273
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:28,704
Play keep walking

274
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
He can really see the Alex impression they're painful

275
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:40,480
Paper that's a direct expression even though Alex was just doing impression of Rush Limbaugh when he does it

276
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,272
The weird after work

277
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,088
Alex

278
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,488
How he's like a separation of church of my God it's it's so awesome because you can

279
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:55,584
Conceived mind working in a way that like you could have prepared

280
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,680
You could have got your thoughts together or whatever but it's into that

281
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,472
Point that you didn't intend to make

282
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:07,872
I am going to throw this out there I think I have a theory on this. Is he is actually reading info

283
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:13,504
Towards transcripts after having listened to the clips and trying to do the exact same thing

284
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:18,112
That's my theory on there because the timing of all of that

285
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:24,512
The the absolute change of the the tone of voice volume control

286
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,912
That suggests to me that he is listen to Alex say exactly those Alex is going to take the time to be like why we let vet

287
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,472
Veterans speak at football games go

288
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
Why

289
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,640
I don't know I just don't help it went to his issues that one might not be I think that one was

290
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Maybe

291
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,224
But he also has more complaints about the dollar

292
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,296
Some great quote from Washington

293
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,600
Burleigh George Washington arms

294
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
To the colonies

295
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,256
Or like a powerful quote from Thomas Jefferson like I have sworn upon the altar of

296
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,168
Annuit coeptis

297
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,984
Novus ordo

298
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
I don't speak

299
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
Psycho

300
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,664
All American

301
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
He's mad at Latin

302
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,296
Okay alright so are we in that new Theory

303
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:24,160
This is an open mic that I luckily missed somewhere around 2016

304
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:30,560
Yeah

305
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,144
Complaints about

306
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,544
Jokes that people told 30 years ago

307
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
Really to illustrate Owens chops

308
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,664
Obviously it can get worse

309
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
As far as

310
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
In your face

311
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,880
It really can't get any worse anymore

312
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,440
It is all in

313
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
Your

314
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
Right in your face

315
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,328
I need

316
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,632
Only if it's in your face

317
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:12,288
For some reason Towing decided to include a meeting with clip-in is demo reel races it's in your face four times at 22 second

318
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
Eddie

319
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:25,088
Is obviously shallow applicantpool Lovett

320
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:30,976
I'm not going to be able to get over how many times he said in your face I will guarantee you

321
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:36,096
He does not say it in this deposition at all he does not accuse things are being in your face

322
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,936
So we're in the clear now all I can say is that just by that

323
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,008
Demo demo reel

324
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,664
I can tell you that guy's going to be working at Infowars I would look at that guy and you got the good

325
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,808
Do you know what in six years you're going to get sued

326
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,600
Got to have them

327
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:02,976
Deposition begins off friendship

328
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,048
Cuz what is the most important thing in the world friendship you bet

329
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
How's your relationship

330
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,960
I would say good I mean there's elements of friendship and then there's elements of Boss

331
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
An employee but

332
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
Is my dad

333
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,080
Would you consider him your best friend

334
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
No

335
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
Does he consider you his best

336
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
I doubt it

337
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
That's so weird

338
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,904
The weird McCormick restaurant in Bell

339
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,952
Do like that almost ideas

340
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
What cuz what is

341
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,280
We're going to say is it going to say

342
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,608
Yeah Alex think Alex probably thinks I'm his best friend

343
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:47,008
Well if I don't think Alex is my best friend has the question of does he

344
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:53,408
What's going on right now it comes up this question is asked

345
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:56,224
You have other

346
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
I would say if if

347
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,576
If it was one it would be

348
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
Rob do buds

349
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
But knock knock

350
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
Not really

351
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
And

352
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,608
You and mr. do have a personal relationship as well as

353
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
That relationship like

354
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
Best friends

355
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:23,616
You got to be confused I think that's what he's doing that's my. I think Bill is deliberately

356
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,152
They just throwing this s*** around

357
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:31,552
Problem just alike f*** with almonds head assume so

358
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,088
Who is your best friend

359
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,488
Play Luis Marshall

360
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,792
I did expect

361
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:48,192
Something to come to the conclusion

362
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:54,592
I think that's the issue with Owen is he was hosting for Alex on a son

363
00:26:54,848 --> 00:27:00,992
Show and someone just gave him an article that he used to laugh

364
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,344
That Neil heslin could not have held his son after the shooting

365
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,904
That's the reason he's in trouble

366
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,304
And unfortunately it turns out I remember who gave him the

367
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,632
How did you learn about that article

368
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
It was presented to me

369
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
That

370
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Day as I was on

371
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
By who

372
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
I do not recall

373
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
So you got it after 4

374
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Yes

375
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,784
And when it was presented to you did they just hand you a copy the article

376
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
Pretty much

377
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:41,696
I mean my best recollection in this is no just trying to dig into my memory is

378
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm in studio

379
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,072
Someone comes in and says hey here's a story

380
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,864
We also have the video clips for it

381
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,424
And then

382
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,472
We live and I mentioned Astorian

383
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,800
Okay so who handed it to me

384
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,080
I do not recall

385
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,664
That's not good because this

386
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,064
Yeah bad information that was given to you and now you're on the hook for it because you reported it

387
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,136
And could conceivably help

388
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,976
Send out the blame if you knew who was responsible for

389
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:21,376
Giving you this information becomes a compounded problem because he's asked who could have given it to you

390
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,168
And it's basically like

391
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
Not just anyone

392
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
Sunday show

393
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,264
You're filming and I'm assuming

394
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,056
Mr. Jones is Not president

395
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,872
That's fine or standing if I'm filling in

396
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Most likely

397
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
And

398
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,992
Who has the authority

399
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
If he's not there

400
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,320
To find a story

401
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
Cut

402
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,648
A number of clips

403
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,952
Into a small segment and

404
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
Hand it to you and give you the authority to

405
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
Go With It live

406
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
I would say anybody has that

407
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
Story

408
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
Cuz not really

409
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
Authority

410
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Figure that has

411
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,776
Beside that anybody can bring me a story

412
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
Any given time

413
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
It's not going to be somebody that tries to stop me

414
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
You're reading it or try to

415
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
Stop

416
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,480
There should be quality control

417
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,784
There should be a certain amount of like

418
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
That's not the proper Channel

419
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:19,232
You shouldn't be able to have like the boom mike operator give a story directly to the host and then they report it yet

420
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:25,632
The boom operator maybe you should talk to the news director or something right in like

421
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:32,032
Pass this along

422
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:37,920
People everyone should be allowed to speak their mind quality control on some level

423
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,992
I mean I would say that if I were in a deposition

424
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,040
Of this kind of magnitude

425
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,600
My first instinct would be avoid

426
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,648
Saying something along the lines of

427
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,184
Really when you get down to it

428
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
Everybody's involved to equally

429
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,376
What was the problem with answering any other way than what he says x y and z

430
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:03,264
People

431
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,568
Wasn't it this person

432
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:11,968
Do you know it wasn't there we got Dawn Salazar he wasn't Nico or whatever and you know it

433
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:18,368
That leads to more trouble

434
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:24,768
Actually you know what I think it was a complete stranger who just broke into our office would be handed me this story I read it out loud

435
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:30,144
Because that's how this could have been

436
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
So

437
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,824
We know from covering pass depositions that Alex is to have told people to not cover

438
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
Sandy Hook

439
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,640
After a certain point

440
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:47,040
I'm so the question is asked as Alex ever told you not to cover anyting I am turns out

441
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
Has he ever told you not to

442
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Cover

443
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
A certain story

444
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
Not that I recall

445
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,768
So if you wanted right now

446
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
Go in studio when you leave here

447
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,096
Do wholesale

448
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,144
About how you think Sandy Hook

449
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Jackson Ford

450
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:10,080
I could and I might guess is I would get quite a tongue lashing

451
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
Afterwards

452
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
But he wouldn't stop

453
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,968
The mic is on the cameras on where live

454
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,528
I mean other than coming in studio to tackle me

455
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,808
Turning it off

456
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
No

457
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:25,696
Stick this is a terrible workflow I am amazed that they can function

458
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
Yeah

459
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
I mean really

460
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,048
It is it is a testament

461
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:36,448
Not to their skills at anything that they are supposed to be doing it is Owen not does he not recognize that

462
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
They have a delay

463
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:41,312
Like cuz they may not for the internet

464
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:46,688
But like for the radio stations they can bleeps cuss words they ain't they do that.

465
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:53,088
It's like I don't know like there has to be some kind of a delay that's possible he starts going off about us Sandy Hook

466
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:59,232
You got it. You and then something goes

467
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
Goes away yeah yeah

468
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:07,168
I think it's a terrible organization to the Vic anybody can give me whatever information they want.

469
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,752
And also you can stop by or cutting the feed

470
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:17,152
Right this is this is a recipe for for defamation

471
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,480
They are describing how their business works

472
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,832
It is a business entirely geared towards eventually being sued for defamation

473
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,672
Yep it's sloppy

474
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:33,792
It revealed so much about the editorial in a working so how these articles are written and how they're used

475
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:38,400
Here you seeing like the live show and how the f*** he had isn't treated

476
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:44,288
The structure is ridiculous

477
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,848
But I went just reads whatever someone handsome

478
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
What happened here

479
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
It's not a normal

480
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
Fraction form

481
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
I mean

482
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
I would say

483
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,624
Yes and know it's a normal occurrence in that

484
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
It's a new story

485
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,256
We're live news organization there's constantly news coming in and out of my desk

486
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,048
But

487
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,376
And I would also say no it's not it's not like

488
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,936
Everyday or every segment someone says hey

489
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
Hear this news stories breaking right now

490
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,032
Right but what I'm saying is not

491
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,104
Common is the fact that you're live on air

492
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,176
Somebody hands you document says we're running with this we got Clip Tray

493
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,736
That's not a common currency usually it's something that

494
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
Is fact-check

495
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,624
You see the different video clips that you're going to talk through in a year

496
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,280
Yeah I mean in this instance it's really just kind of a momentum thing you know cuz

497
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:43,680
Download say there's a developing story on offering example

498
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
So there's an ongoing story

499
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,592
If somebody was bringing me stuff as I'm on are just updates to the story

500
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
In this case

501
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:56,480
The reason why there was momentum to this is because Megyn Kelly was just in town

502
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,016
She was in the news

503
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,088
So there was already all this momentum about Megyn Kelly

504
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,416
We saw that she was in the zerohedge article and that's why they brought it

505
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
Was it any

506
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,792
Was any of the retaliatory for miskellys

507
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,864
Betrayal mr. Jones and her interview with him the week

508
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Couple

509
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,704
I can't even recall

510
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,752
The dates if that

511
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,664
Aired before after the segment in question here so I wouldn't say retaliatory I would just

512
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,712
It was it was relevant

513
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,808
This is this is weird that's a weird perspective

514
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:38,720
Yeah I knowing when things happened because there's just a concrete reality has brought up in this next clip

515
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,304
He's like his video was responding to Megan Kelly

516
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,120
Video about Alex how did you do that

517
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:51,520
Prior to her that we can all see through the veil of Illusion in the right

518
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,592
Forever on the psychic but this is just not possible

519
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
Have you watched the

520
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,664
The video and question

521
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Which video

522
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,272
5-minute video where you're on are talking about Neil heslin son

523
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
Yes

524
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,576
What was the last time you washed it

525
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
During

526
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,184
My latest episode Shannon

527
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
Connecticut

528
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,000
And in that video

529
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,792
Surely you realize that

530
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,864
75% of 8

531
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,656
Is the Megyn Kelly interview

532
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
That happened

533
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Before

534
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
You went on air

535
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,752
Talkin about the

536
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
Yeah I believe she was interviewing

537
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,456
Because you said I don't remember if the Megyn Kelly interview came out before I get

538
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,272
Well I guess what I should have said is I'm not aware

539
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,064
It was the same Megyn Kelly show

540
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
I got you

541
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:44,000
That's that's bad that the bad dog have said is that

542
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,400
This is something that not a lot of people know space and time are one thing and then if you put enough energy into the

543
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,216
The sinkhole of space-time

544
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:59,616
Then it's possible to pierce through create a wormhole and go back in time or really forward into

545
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:05,504
Could go anywhere the point I'm saying is that I got there for days ago

546
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
So we're holding side

547
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,952
I think that has a pretty

548
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,256
Bad explanation

549
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,816
What he was trying to say in this video

550
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,888
But I think he thinks it sounds good

551
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,032
I think he thinks this is very escopitory and it's nonsense

552
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Yes

553
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
Did you use the word opossum

554
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,176
I believe so I remember the exact quote

555
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,712
Remember what you're talkin about

556
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
No

557
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,552
You were talking about a dead sexual

558
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,136
And you said it was impossible for that six-year-old father

559
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Propelled his son

560
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
With a bullet hole

561
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,000
Based on what you

562
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
I've read and received

563
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,680
My conclusion was not that that was impossible my conclusion was that

564
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
The

565
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:01,056
Series of events that I highlight in the videos would indicate that there is

566
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
An inconsistency there

567
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,920
And I was more questioning Megyn Kelly

568
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,480
In the instance and if you look at the exact quote

569
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
I'm not asserting

570
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:15,392
That Mr hasn't lied at all what I'm assuming is that Megyn Kelly never did a fact check

571
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
And

572
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
That

573
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,584
That it was basically impossible

574
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:27,680
Or that it was I could say what I can say is and again this is asserted in the quote that

575
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:31,008
Because of the inconsistencies shown in the story

576
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:37,408
It's going to add to the conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook which are a bad thing why am I tired

577
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
When was that

578
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
Hear that fancy lawyer

579
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,296
4 conspiracy theories out there they're going to take this and they're going to run with it

580
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,832
Will Megyn Kelly fact check

581
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
Meatloaf

582
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
I understand your say you were asking question

583
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,488
And at the end of it I think you said you know

584
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
People

585
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Answers

586
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
Give me

587
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:59,168
I'm saying that this story is only going to add

588
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,472
To the conspiracy theorists out there

589
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:07,872
About Sandy Hook in that that's a bad thing and you're saying that because those conspiracy theorists are the ones asking the questions

590
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
Bright

591
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,712
I'm not sure exactly what you mean

592
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,992
You you said

593
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,272
Conspiracy theorist

594
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
A lot of questions

595
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
We want answers

596
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
Lavate people have questions and these

597
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,744
This story here is not going to

598
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,280
Stop people from Africa

599
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,816
The questions people like you

600
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:32,704
This excuses obvious bowl-shaped but there's a couple of remarkable things are on full display here

601
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:37,312
The first is that Owen is so clearly grasping at straws to explain his video which is a

602
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:42,688
A strong indication that he knows that the content he was involved in putting out was horrible and indefensible

603
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:46,528
In order to make it defensible you have to pretend it was something else entirely

604
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,416
The second thing is at the beginning Owen tries to evade the question by saying he didn't remember his exact quote

605
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:58,816
He's trying to build a rationalization for what he said to help people need

606
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
Look at the exact quote

607
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:06,752
In the space of about a minute you went from not remembering what he said the insisting everyone judge him by the exact wording

608
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Of what he said

609
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:13,920
It's painfully obvious what game he's playing the underlying point that Owen is trying to make is that he wasn't saying that Neil Hassel include

610
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,456
Have held is on after the shooting

611
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,296
He was saying that Mr heslin's claim made on Megyn Kelly show

612
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,648
Was impossible if the video Owen played of the Newtown coroner was accurate

613
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,304
Owen is claiming that his point was that this is an inconsistency that Megyn Kelly didn't fact check for herpes

614
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,704
And because of that it'll feed into conspiracies which one is pretending is a bad thing as opposed to the only reason anyone would

615
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,104
A hundred thousand dollars a year this is obvious nonsense over the course of a few clips

616
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
No I think bill is going to buy it

617
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:51,040
I think it's just going to accept that that is a well-crafted definitely not in complete

618
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,624
Bulshit on-the-fly

619
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:01,280
So a bill throws out a quote from Paul intensive use the words

620
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,584
I'm going to read you

621
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Direct quote

622
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,728
He's claiming he is Mister hustling grieving father

623
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,080
He's claiming that he held his son and saw the bullet hole in his head

624
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
That is his

625
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,920
Now according to a timeline of events

626
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
When corners t'estimo

627
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,016
That is not possible

628
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
So

629
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:28,160
Surely you can agree with me that a reasonable person would hear you say that

630
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,952
And think that

631
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
You are basing

632
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,512
The possibility

633
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,584
On the evidence that you are looking

634
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
Right

635
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
Directions for

636
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,496
I'm not sure I understand the question exactly but

637
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
That I believe

638
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,360
What when I'm saying is according to the coroner

639
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,176
The coroner said that they didn't release

640
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,712
The children to the parents

641
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,040
Well I'm going to ask you this

642
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:59,136
NN you're basing that off of the clips that you played during the second

643
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Yes

644
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:06,304
So here is the fundamental piece of this why Owens argument doesn't work

645
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,864
If it doesn't stand up to any kind of scrutiny

646
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,752
But Owen has to hold on to this for dear life cuz otherwise he has nothing

647
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:20,384
I am at is that the coroner's video is accurate it's funny I think I heard Mark whisper

648
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:27,296
Possible much like you heard it black and the last one

649
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:32,672
In the nature of what happened with this Coroner's video and

650
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,208
Doesn't stick

651
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,256
In your affidavit you

652
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
Do you claim Miskelly

653
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
Edited videos

654
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
To slam

655
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Mr. Jones

656
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
Remember that

657
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,216
Do you think she did that

658
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
Yeah

659
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:51,104
Do you think it's right for a journalist to edit

660
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
Clips

661
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
For an agenda

662
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
No

663
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,503
Do you think it's

664
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
Good

665
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,831
Journalistic practices

666
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
For a journalist

667
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
To take

668
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
Edited videos

669
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,207
Ask any questions

670
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
And run with

671
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
Without fact check

672
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,607
Probably not

673
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
Have you listened to

674
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,447
The corner mr. Carver doctor

675
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Carver

676
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,263
Have you listened to his whole interview

677
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:23,103
Cuz represent to the segment that you played

678
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,383
Cuts off

679
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,943
Immediately after he says he didn't release the chill

680
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
But I want to tell you that it keeps going

681
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
And he says a lot more

682
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,319
Did you know that

683
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,367
Kind of an important fact

684
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:38,463
As I was unaware of that especially if you were about to say what you said

685
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,767
About a father who's still

686
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,815
Trying to get over the fact that he had to bury it

687
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:49,727
And that's awful and I understand that's why I said it's impossible for mr. Headland have a false memory of his dying kid

688
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:54,335
It because of how serious that would be making is that nice try and have that false memory

689
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:58,431
So according to the coroner either the coroner is lying

690
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,735
Megyn Kelly just not going to fact-check

691
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
Or

692
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
Mr. Shroyer

693
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,135
Didn't watch the whole Corners interview and hear the corner say

694
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,975
That he didn't release them at first

695
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,535
And later released the bodies

696
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,351
Maybe that's the third option right

697
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,631
Wilshire that that

698
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
Can be true

699
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,727
Good dick can't be true it is true mr. Shroyer

700
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,007
You understand that right

701
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
Fraction form

702
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:31,199
He can say okay that he understands this but he can't actually internalize this in.

703
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
Operate under that

704
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,039
Absolutely some information because then it cast

705
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:40,415
His entire broadcast in a completely different light if he allows that awareness to exist

706
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
I'm so this

707
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:47,839
Notion that the coroner actually made a statement that they didn't release the bodies

708
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:53,983
Is it is is jumping worth believing and that Megyn Kelly has an obligation to address

709
00:43:54,495 --> 00:44:00,639
It's Insanity have you ever considered that everything is everybody else

710
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:07,039
This fault and I am a blameless person trying to do my best to save the world well I believe in something completely nonsensical and bass

711
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:12,671
Bulshit right everyone else has an obligation to in any circumstance

712
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:19,071
Disprove that or else they are lying what are they are engaging in inconsistencies in a cover-up what I would like

713
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:25,471
The entirety of the human race to know is that it is your job to accommodate my whims at Alta

714
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,031
Definitely

715
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:33,407
Obviously there is an internal problem with

716
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,991
Responsibility it Infowars people really

717
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
Given

718
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:42,623
Appropriate feedback people aren't scolded

719
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,439
And so the question comes up

720
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,487
Whatever tell you f***** up

721
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,815
Anyone ever has ever tell you that you were wrong

722
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,887
I don't want to hear the answer to mr. Jones or mr. do

723
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,191
About this litigation at all

724
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:02,079
Not not too much note

725
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
And employers

726
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,503
No one has come to you and told you

727
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,551
That what you said was dead wrong

728
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:16,415
And that you messed up and use the clip that was highly edited

729
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,743
No and I didn't edit the clip

730
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
I did not

731
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,583
Previously music lip it was presented to me

732
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,607
And you just went with

733
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
Yes I just played it

734
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
Right

735
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,727
No one ever told him that bad work

736
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,263
You screwed up

737
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:37,919
I don't even know how to handle this everything that we learn about how Infowars actually function

738
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,991
Makes me believe that there's no possible way I can function

739
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,551
Yeah it is really leaves you think of it like

740
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,855
Make the offense so lucky

741
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
Spit someone didn't

742
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:54,047
Like really f*** with them like someone get a job there and just cause chaos

743
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,863
No safeguards

744
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,679
There is no there is no accountability

745
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:02,751
Anyone can just feed stories to people

746
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,823
It's a x bananas

747
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,663
The odds of them. Falling victim to

748
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,967
Some internal

749
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:18,111
Then complete sabotages is outraged at this is nuts and I think it's one of those things

750
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,903
It is one of those things

751
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,975
Where everybody just assumes because

752
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,303
It would be ridiculous for it to be possible

753
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,119
But this place function so everybody just assumes like

754
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:35,007
Well there's that there's got to be some sort of control this every somebody in charge of every somebody doing something right

755
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
And the answer is no

756
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,311
No

757
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:41,663
Just know it doesn't seem like a maybe you're from like a business and like

758
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
Fulfillment

759
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,343
Like they're the warehouse I do whatever happened there's accountability

760
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,743
Information on Scott

761
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:00,863
How many times you been arrested

762
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
Your been arrested

763
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
How many times

764
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
I'm not sure the exact number

765
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
Wrong answer

766
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,127
You have you have interested you just lost count

767
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,223
Is it, if you get arrested

768
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
Comment but

769
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,575
Probably too much

770
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,599
More than I'd like to

771
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,879
Angel

772
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:29,023
That's just kind of a fun clip it turns out it's not really that scandalous or anything he's got like a DUI and then

773
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:35,423
Yeah I tried to stop the impeachment trial

774
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,543
Okay well there's that one too

775
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:46,943
Giant rap Lewis days or whatever you say I can't really remember how many times I've been a rest

776
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:53,343
It leads you to believe it's more than like 3 or 4 it's not really

777
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,743
Pretty serious traumatic event that

778
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,071
Filed

779
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,143
And the beginning of it is a little bit funny

780
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,935
Kubiak to exhibit

781
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
1

782
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,263
The affidavit will go down 2 paragraph 2

783
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,543
Right

784
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,687
It says I have been

785
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
Frequent

786
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:24,575
Critic of the government for using tragedies such as Sandy Hook

787
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,135
To manipulate public opinion

788
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,671
In order to

789
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,695
Among other things

790
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,023
Further restrict gun rights in this country

791
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,071
I read that correctly

792
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
Yes

793
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
What

794
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,959
Do you mean by manipulate public opinion

795
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,519
I mean

796
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
Use

797
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,847
Outright lies

798
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,639
To deceive

799
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Public

800
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
Okay

801
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:56,063
Answer this sentence you're not saying the government use Sandy Hook to

802
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,391
Use outright lies to deceive the public you're saying

803
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,159
That

804
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,719
You are a frequent critic

805
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,023
Of the government for using tragedy

806
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
2-minute

807
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,351
You to outright lie

808
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
Like what

809
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
Gulf of Tonkin

810
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,007
Oh my God getting us into the Vietnam War

811
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,871
I'm lying about babies being thrown out of incubators to get us into the Middle East

812
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
What's backup

813
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,247
You're a frequent critic of the government for things that happened

814
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,831
Somewhere between 35 and 70 years ago

815
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Okay

816
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,927
When is that come up in conversation

817
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,255
What do you mean

818
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,327
What causes you to be a frequent

819
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:40,863
Critic

820
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,447
For things like the Gulf of Tonkin and why we got into the Vietnam War

821
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,799
Me I believe it's an issue that has never been properly addressed

822
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:56,479
Is that the case boy you know I that whole go from talking thing I don't think anybody ever really dealt with it

823
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:02,879
Emotionally dealt with a Fallout from that is still are I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes

824
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:09,279
Interview like never talk about slavery ever dealt with it

825
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:13,631
A million times over

826
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:20,031
I thought damai I love like this is the phrasing that Owen thought was going to be really perfect and it's just so far

827
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:26,431
Farcical when repeated it is such that like

828
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:32,831
Beetle here's here's what it is here's what it's so clear about it is that Alex's f***** with these people's brains

829
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,879
Or they never had it to the point where

830
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,159
Words

831
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
Can be just fun

832
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,999
You know like adjectives

833
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,791
Don't need to have mean

834
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:48,191
They're just there they're just like music notes like what he's saying is that we don't say words that

835
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:52,287
Have any meaning whatsoever we put together sounds that make a

836
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:58,687
Functioning noise fear that makes people afraid so they buy it's true

837
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:02,271
Eternal perspective perspective

838
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:08,671
Like everything is just fine like whatever explanation you have for something if it's expired

839
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:15,071
If it works there is no knife sharpening knife here

840
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:21,471
Google's that does not sharpen Google I've never had such a clear moment of lie

841
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,239
Like

842
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,031
You don't mean

843
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:30,687
You don't use words you don't understand words like you can't say I have been a frequent critic critic unless you

844
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,711
You are saying that

845
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,759
I mean in the legal setting

846
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:40,159
You have to complete that seems like an impression of what someone would say

847
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,631
Approximating what a normal person would say here right

848
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:53,471
Amazing so the question that is refined to all right

849
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:59,359
What are these instances where the government use these tragedies to restrict gun rights

850
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:04,479
And shock of all shocks

851
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,039
What did the government do in San Diego

852
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,599
To further restrict gun

853
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:11,903
I don't know

854
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:15,487
We swore to God in your affidavit

855
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
That

856
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:20,095
You're a frequent critic of the government using them to further gun rights

857
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
Restrictions of gun

858
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703
God

859
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,079
So help me God

860
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
I apologize

861
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,663
You swore under oath

862
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,711
That this was true and you said that

863
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,271
Thanks likes

864
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,807
What I'm asking about

865
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,879
Further restrict gun rights in this country

866
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,927
What did the government do in

867
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,951
Sandy Hook

868
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,255
Further restrict gun rights in this

869
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,095
Well you're asking me to go back

870
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:55,679
And provide an opinion or commentary on something that

871
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,495
I didn't provide opinion or commentary on at the time

872
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:04,895
I was not at Infowars when Sandy Hook happened I did no commentary on it when it happened it was not even umbrella

873
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,919
New story to me

874
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,759
But what I recall is

875
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:14,111
And this seems to be the case most of time is whenever there's a gun tragedy maybe less now than

876
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
Other times

877
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,463
There's politicians go on TV and say we need

878
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
New

879
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,535
Gun laws we need new gun

880
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
Restriction

881
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,839
And that's just that seems

882
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,375
Be a pattern of behavior

883
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
Okay

884
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:32,287
I understand that you weren't there for this the initial Sandy Hook coverage

885
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,847
But you just want to roll

886
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,383
But this was

887
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,175
This was your words

888
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,223
And you said that the government

889
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:40,991
Uses

890
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,295
Things like Sandy Hook to manipulate public

891
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,367
Further restrict gun rights I'm just asking you

892
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
They take a tragedy

893
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,695
Like kids getting

894
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,975
Shot in the school

895
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,767
And they say because of that event

896
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:57,119
We're going to further infringe on your Second Amendment right

897
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,679
For an event that you had nothing to do with

898
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
When did they do that

899
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,055
When did they do what cuckoo

900
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,335
Said

901
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,919
Captain we're going to restrict your second

902
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,687
Who said that

903
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
Give me an example

904
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
I couldn't give you

905
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,295
It seems like a problem that's an issue

906
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,343
Stupid, you should be able to

907
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,743
Point out what stories have you gotten your money tonight

908
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:30,399
Right we're stricter gun rights I do like bills bills very clearly got this

909
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,703
Very obvious point

910
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:36,287
But Owen has no idea is coming toward them right

911
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,823
Like he's very clearly

912
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,615
Dismantling the idea that

913
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:46,015
The politicians are doing what it is you're saying they're doing just simply

914
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,807
Give him his own words

915
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:51,391
That will reveal that he is in fact the person who is doing those things

916
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:55,999
And he has no concept of this

917
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,583
I don't think of that

918
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,375
Do people who are paranoid

919
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,911
About everything

920
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:09,311
I don't know if these people who are going in for the deposition are worried enough about where they're being led mean

921
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:13,663
88th and Lloyd the lawyer here's the thing I want to focus on

922
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,223
Why did the lawyer say

923
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,039
Objection he didn't swear to God

924
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:25,695
I don't know I'm not sure I want to know more about that one because it seems like that would be very important

925
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:31,583
They are always talking about Christianity but maybe that was why the

926
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:37,983
The objections are like you're stressing that too much that's what I'm saying yeah you're making this sound like a religious thing as opposed to

927
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:43,615
You know just a formality of legal Riley

928
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:49,247
Maybe maybe maybe weighs maybe that's how it would understand that maybe it's not I don't know

929
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,271
So

930
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,807
The question comes up

931
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:58,463
You think your informed about Sandy Hook do you think that that is something you know about about answers obviously no

932
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,487
This point

933
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,511
After

934
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,815
Your involvement in this case for 3 years

935
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,351
And your

936
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,375
Affidavit

937
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,655
Mostafa David's

938
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,959
As well as your

939
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,263
Couple episodes

940
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,359
On Infowars about Sandy Hook would you say you're you're informed.

941
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,943
No I've barely talked about Sandy Hook

942
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,247
I asked you if you talk about us

943
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,879
About it it's kind of a fake question

944
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,647
I agree

945
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,695
And I ask you this because

946
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:33,791
The number of times I've watched some of your YouTube videos you walking around at Rally's

947
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,327
And asking people

948
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,119
The name accusers

949
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,399
Call Donald Trump

950
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
And you start

951
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,471
Because you said yeah cuz I'm in

952
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,495
Thorndike and

953
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,799
So I'm just asking you to name names

954
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,847
Name names of what

955
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,687
Of any government official you claim used Sandy Hook

956
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,711
Further restrict

957
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,735
Termites

958
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,271
I have to go back in time

959
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,831
The right now see here today you weren't

960
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,855
Uninformed

961
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:58,879
Citizen

962
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,183
Injection form

963
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951
Correct

964
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,767
I would say that

965
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,327
If you could

966
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,607
Catalog

967
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,655
My entire career and media

968
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,191
Sandy Hook

969
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,727
Makes up for less than

970
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,031
00 0.1 per cent of Mike

971
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
Anyway was that response

972
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,383
I think it is very response

973
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,407
What was my question

974
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:24,479
You asked if I would be informed on Sandy Hook

975
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,759
Yeah

976
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
You said

977
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,087
Hell is only 1% of everything that I do

978
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,951
Are you at Sandy Hook is not my bread-and-butter I don't know much about Sandy Hook

979
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,511
3-run informed it's okay to say I'm not trying to trick you

980
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:40,095
Just trying to see if it were not you think you're under your informed or not so

981
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,655
I know whether or not I need to ask anymore questions on that

982
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,983
Are you informed about Sandy

983
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,127
Again it's a big question yes and no I'm aware of Sandy Hook

984
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,407
But

985
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:57,247
Have I done deep Research into my very knowledge roll musculation

986
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,319
Do you know Mister hustling son

987
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:07,999
It's such a simple question in line of questioning about the case

988
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,047
Weird dynamic

989
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,631
Attitude is just as important or more important than content

990
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:17,215
Has been trained to resist ever showing his ass

991
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:23,615
He made his name by going at the hostile territory and arguing with people he was calling them Cox so even though he's in

992
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:27,455
Completely different setting gear that mode is still a part of how he interacts

993
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:34,111
I suspect to come out and say that he's not important about Sandy Hook because he's worried that the next question will be yr

994
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:38,463
Weren't you informed about Sandy Hook really good question good answer for that

995
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,047
If you're Hannibal why wouldn't you learn a little bit about the case

996
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:48,447
He's been in a lawsuit for a while and beyond that is a big deal and online conspiracy communities that makeup

997
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,727
A large part of his audience

998
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,031
Seems like you'd be curious at least

999
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:58,687
Admit to being uninformed by Sandy Hook reveals the lack of curiosity and a lack of interested in knowing things which is counter housing forward

1000
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:01,759
Supposed supposed to position themselves in terms of branding

1001
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:08,159
It also opens up a line of questions that aren't going to come up in this deposition but I'll still probably worried about it

1002
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:12,767
Namely whether or not he's informed on many of the other topics he covers

1003
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:16,351
Like for instance is he informed on the Gulf of Tonkin incident

1004
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:20,959
Good-o incoherently explain what happened Beyond just catchphrase version of like

1005
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,519
The government lied to get us into the Vietnam War

1006
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:27,871
I would suspect not and what are the really important aspect of Infowars kayfabe

1007
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:31,711
Is the image that the people working there know a lot about the things that they talk about

1008
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:37,855
Also not knowing a child's name is actively disrespectful Owens park

1009
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:43,743
If you were truly someone who made an honest mistake and covered the story wrong and it ended up hurting this grieving father

1010
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:47,839
You would think that Owen would have familiarized himself a little bit with the circumstances

1011
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:51,423
If only to be able to fully apologize for the cause

1012
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:54,495
And it's clearly not something that he's

1013
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,031
Felt inclined to do

1014
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:02,431
Yeah I mean what's he going to say I've been advised by Infowars lawyers to know as little about this case as possible

1015
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:08,831
That's making my answers to you perhaps less damaging to the company although now that you have said that out

1016
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:13,439
Allowed I'm starting to think that it's the wrong it looks like s***

1017
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:19,839
His refuge and the thing that he thinks is going to save him is this notion that he was

1018
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,631
Question Megyn Kelly

1019
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:28,031
He wasn't questioning Neil heslin said that there were inconsistencies and Megyn Kelly

1020
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311
One thing

1021
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:35,711
That I do both appreciate and don't appreciate because it moves us on our stupid be evil Continuum more

1022
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,991
Towards the evil side

1023
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:41,855
Is that it does appear that Owen has a kind of plan here

1024
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,135
He is got like

1025
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:45,439
If I stick to the plan

1026
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:52,351
Then I'll be able to keep on going if I insisted this was just about Megyn Kelly

1027
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,399
Through this and if he lets say

1028
01:00:54,655 --> 01:01:00,799
Ask me a bunch of questions that I'm not sure about don't know the answers to I should definitely not volunteer information like at Daniels

1029
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,871
Yeah you can tell pretty

1030
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,431
Obvious difference between the two of them

1031
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,991
We get back to this just questioning Megyn Kelly

1032
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,295
I I never had any intention

1033
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
2

1034
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,135
Go after

1035
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:21,279
Mr. heslin I never accused Mr heslin of lying I never meant to do anything negative to mister Haslam

1036
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
Instead

1037
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,607
You took an interview that he

1038
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,399
Did with Megyn Kelly

1039
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:31,263
And said based on the corners report and based on this cuz Megyn Kelly didn't say how this done

1040
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,543
Neil heslin

1041
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,591
So when you said it was impossible

1042
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,895
You would call him a liar

1043
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
Right

1044
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,247
Questioning Megyn Kelly

1045
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,295
I was questioning the corner

1046
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,879
And I was wondering why Megan genuine factcheck dad

1047
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,927
More as again just

1048
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:52,255
Just because Ben Kelly was in studio she was in the news

1049
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,303
And it was just something that was Ellen

1050
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,607
And she's a journalist so

1051
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,631
That should be packed

1052
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:03,263
Yeah I mean if she wanted to fact-check that and put the conspiracy theories to rest she could have done it right there and she did

1053
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,847
But if she didn't have a highly edited

1054
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,639
Did clip like you that made it look like

1055
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,663
The coroner said

1056
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,455
The parents never saw their kids

1057
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,503
Why on Earth would she

1058
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
Prove

1059
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,063
That Neil has been held his son

1060
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,415
Mr. Hassan was going to say

1061
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:24,511
I held my son I saw the gun wound and they can Kelly's follow-up to that was like

1062
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:29,375
Yeah because the coroner told us they didn't give them to you the kids at first but then later did

1063
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
That's

1064
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:33,983
Houses playing in your head right now I'm so confusing me

1065
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:39,615
Yeah I mean I have no idea what Megyn Kelly had access to as far as if she'd ever seen the corner saying that or not

1066
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,895
I've no idea

1067
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:46,783
This is a great encapsulation of an impossible task it is to question propagandists

1068
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:53,183
Owens claim is that there's a contradiction that Megyn Kelly wasn't addressing that only makes sense if

1069
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
And only if

1070
01:02:54,463 --> 01:03:00,607
You believe that the deceptively edited clip of the corner it is the coroner's complete statement right if you don't

1071
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:04,959
Believe that or if you seen the full video that this isn't something that needs clearing up

1072
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:08,287
Miss Rosalind said what he said there's no contradiction at all

1073
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:14,943
There's only contradiction if you think that b******* video is the full truth which by extension means that you believe that there is

1074
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:21,343
Is a contradiction then you're revealing that you either know the truth and are liar or you don't know the truth and you're just

1075
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,439
Speeding in a horrible and defamatory claims without ever considering

1076
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:31,583
How do you check and see if they're not fact-checking while you clearly have not fact-checked

1077
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,375
I think

1078
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:40,031
That we could solve a lot of problems before this deposition if we just took one sentence of the thing they said on their show

1079
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,615
Go and ask them to diagram a sentence you know like noun

1080
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:50,015
Verb direct object like I really don't think they understand how we're really into grammar today really struggling because

1081
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:55,135
Is it keep asking questions words like if you understood how a sentence work then you would just say yeah

1082
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
Yeah

1083
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:02,303
Reality bring this up as a testament to her doing a better job checking facts than Ellen

1084
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:08,703
She didn't fall for that internet b******* and she's not under no obligation to dispel every potentially inaccurate think so man

1085
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:13,055
Mike Fink represent the contradiction in a grieving father story

1086
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:16,895
One doesn't feel an obligation to pass along true information

1087
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:23,295
For him the video of the coroner was true in the sense that it existed and who cares if the full clips of the opposite of the additive

1088
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,575
Somebody plays on air

1089
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:30,975
Truth of the police objective thing to him and as long as he can claim that he didn't know the version he presented as truth with a lie

1090
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,791
But he doesn't feel that need to be ashamed of himself nor

1091
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:38,911
Does he feel the need to learn a lesson from this and try to do better the next time like it expressed

1092
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,935
Feline

1093
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:43,263
It's just because truth and falsity don't matter

1094
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,847
The ultimate aim is what appeals to the audience to buy their product

1095
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:51,199
That is what dictates truth and reality to someone like Ellen

1096
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:57,343
And then you have to do s*** like this analyzed it in case you ever called on it in a

1097
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,671
Deposition

1098
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,255
My job is to lie about s*** quick

1099
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:10,655
Is that what you want to say

1100
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:17,055
Little Caesars

1101
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,079
I'm ready

1102
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:22,943
So he's just questioning Megyn Kelly though that's the that's the thing that's import

1103
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,503
Except for when

1104
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:31,903
Bill Reeves a direct quote from the video that really makes it seem like he's questioning mr. has

1105
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,439
During

1106
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,207
The segment

1107
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,999
This is a transcript of it

1108
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
Of the video

1109
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,815
Direct quote hero

1110
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,655
Will do well will there be clarification from

1111
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,191
Hessler Megyn Kelly

1112
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,983
I wouldn't hold my

1113
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,799
So when you say you weren't

1114
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,079
Questioning mr. Haslam

1115
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:51,871
Is very good

1116
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,663
Can you clarify

1117
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,687
Sure

1118
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,503
They never responded to the corners

1119
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,295
Claims that I played in the video

1120
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:03,391
So that's what I was saying so because they don't watch your show

1121
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,975
Psyllium for Sunday Alex Jones

1122
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,327
Because they didn't see it here your question and respond

1123
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,119
That's what you said

1124
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,495
I'm not understanding what

1125
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,799
I'm not either

1126
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:27,455
So here you can see again always arguing completely falls apart if he accepts the claims he's ascribing to the corner word

1127
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,247
Not made by the corner at all

1128
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:34,879
Owen fell for a deceptively edited video and then believe that the coroner had made claims that he didn't make

1129
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:41,279
And now he's justifying his coverage of the case based on how suspicious it seems that Megyn Kelly and mr. hassling didn't

1130
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,607
Address these claims that the corner in reality didn't make

1131
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:47,679
That's why this exchange is bordering on incoherent

1132
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:54,079
Because Owen is still clean to this pretense that they were actual legitimate claims that Kelly and that's when we're dodging and he was just trying to

1133
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,127
Make sure all these contradictions are ironed out

1134
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:01,503
That's his foothold on his actions making any sense outside the reality that he was in fact

1135
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:07,903
Very clearly trying to imply that mister Haslam could not have held us up

1136
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:14,047
I'm get more straightforward then literally the quote that was read to you right and I think I think

1137
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:21,215
I mean honestly I don't know I don't know exactly how things work in the legal world but I think that this

1138
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,007
The argument that he's making

1139
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:29,407
Makes it so much clearer that he had nefarious solutely

1140
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:35,807
Best you got this is s*** that's that's shameful

1141
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:42,207
Belligerence that he's trying to stick to it it's very frustrated does not relent

1142
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:48,607
No unfortunately weaving into a little bit of a question

1143
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,887
About free speech

1144
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,679
This is problem

1145
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,983
It's not my job

1146
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,287
To clarify Megyn Kelly's reporting

1147
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,591
Why would

1148
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
Right

1149
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
Yes

1150
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
The great statement

1151
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:06,527
Is it your job to repost

1152
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,063
A repost

1153
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,855
From an anonymous writer

1154
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,159
Question Megyn Kelly

1155
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,719
I think that's just free speech

1156
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,767
Right sure

1157
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,303
You know what isn't free speech

1158
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,351
When actually

1159
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
It was backup

1160
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,911
You said free speech

1161
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,191
What does that mean

1162
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:30,335
Ono Ono this definition is going to be a struggle to get through

1163
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,359
You said free speech

1164
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,639
What does that mean

1165
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,687
You're not

1166
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,479
You're crazy in the coconut

1167
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,783
The right to

1168
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,599
Address grievances to government

1169
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,623
The right to

1170
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
Speak

1171
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,487
Without inherent consequence

1172
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,535
Okay and that's across-the-board

1173
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:51,583
I mean

1174
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,607
I think that you know

1175
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:55,167
Any legal expert would agree that free speech

1176
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,703
It's not Universal

1177
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,007
Correct like defamation

1178
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
Did you know that

1179
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,335
Okay so when you say

1180
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,639
Is my free speech First Amendment right

1181
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,943
You know that the first amendment protects you from

1182
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,711
From the government

1183
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,015
I'm Free Speech right nut other citizen

1184
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,039
You know that right

1185
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,855
Did you know that until I just said it

1186
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,439
I probably wouldn't have phrased it like that but it makes sense

1187
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:23,839
Right it's shocking but also not unexpected that though and doesn't seem to understand what the

1188
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,375
The first amendment is about but

1189
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,935
I got stuck on another thing that he said In that clip

1190
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:34,335
He said the free speech and his understanding involves the right to speak without inherit consequence that I say what the f*** does

1191
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,359
Is that even mean

1192
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:40,223
All speeches consequence because speeches a means of conveying things between persons

1193
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:45,087
If you tell somebody you love them that has a consequence which will depend on how they feel about you

1194
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:48,671
Could be a good, but something happens

1195
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:53,279
Similarly if you yell a racial slur at someone there's always a consequence

1196
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:59,679
Maybe you get hit or maybe that person is restrained but there's still a consequence of emotional pain that's been in for

1197
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:04,031
There is no speech without consequence because speech doesn't exist in a vacuum

1198
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:10,943
The reason I think this is really fascinating is because I want understanding of this is that free speech is speech

1199
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,967
Consequences

1200
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,527
When it's he who's speaking

1201
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:19,391
There isn't a concern at all for the consequences experienced by the other people involved in the speech

1202
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:25,791
It's really just a childish mentality that kind of boils down to I get to say whatever I want if anyone's mad about it there press

1203
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:31,679
I understand and I appreciate the desire and even the necessity of protecting speech from too much censorship

1204
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:38,079
But to not really understand the dynamic nature of speech particularly when you work at a place called Free Speech systems

1205
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:41,919
Mobile strikes me as a mark of a very shallow selfish mind

1206
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
Grasping

1207
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:43,967
I would like

1208
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:48,831
The legal definition of free speech involves the government concept of free speech

1209
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,623
Between persons

1210
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,671
Always have a consequence

1211
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:56,511
It may not be you get sued every time

1212
01:10:56,767 --> 01:11:00,095
But there's a consequence

1213
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:06,239
Inherent consequence to me suggests that what he is

1214
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:10,847
At the conversations that he's been having where inherent consequence would come up

1215
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,407
Essentially would mean to me that he saying

1216
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:18,015
I should be able to say the n-word and people shouldn't be offended cuz I said the n-word

1217
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:24,415
Or just any words that has inherent consequence to me do you know what I'm saying that's where the right-wing version

1218
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:29,535
Consequence

1219
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,375
That's ridiculous

1220
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:39,775
She's around people who don't mind him saying

1221
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,311
Ecstatic

1222
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
Government is

1223
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:48,479
I'm telling you this is f****** just depression is absolute insanity aggrievement

1224
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:54,879
Everybody should have to have the First Amendment on their wall and it should be highlighted it should be tattooed on his arm like

1225
01:11:55,135 --> 01:12:01,279
We make the mark of the beast the First Amendment

1226
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:04,863
No chance.

1227
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,191
We get back to this idea of like what restrictions happen

1228
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:12,799
After the shootings and it's just

1229
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:16,383
With regards to paragraph to in this affidavit

1230
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:19,455
You can't think of a single government action

1231
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,223
That

1232
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:23,295
Was made to further restrict gun rights

1233
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,831
Related to Sandy Hook

1234
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:25,599
Correct

1235
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,623
Now. My head

1236
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,695
Why'd you put it in your affidavit put what exactly

1237
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,279
The first sentence of paragraph to that says

1238
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,071
I've been a Critic of the government

1239
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,863
Freezing things like Sandy Hook

1240
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,423
To manipulate public opinion

1241
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
In order to

1242
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,215
Among other things

1243
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:43,519
Further restrict gun rights in this country

1244
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,799
Why'd you put that in there

1245
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,103
If you can't think of an instance

1246
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,895
Related

1247
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,919
Where's that actually at

1248
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,711
Ejection form

1249
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:58,111
I not say I didn't say it had anything to do with Sandy Hook it says such as Sandy Hook so I'm not saying that there was any

1250
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:01,951
Anything following Sandy Hook all my guy just meant as a general

1251
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,255
Saying when there's tragedy is dealing with guns

1252
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,047
Usually there's a follow-up

1253
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,095
Of a proposal of Morgan

1254
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,887
Legislation and stretch

1255
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,911
But not in Sandy

1256
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,447
Not that I'm aware

1257
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,727
So if it didn't happen

1258
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,751
Why didn't this happen

1259
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,567
Because this entire case is about

1260
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
Right

1261
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
So

1262
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:26,015
But if it's none of this happened why did you add it into the next tenant to start there

1263
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:31,135
Because the full case is about Sandy Hook and is again it says such as Sandy Hook so I'm not saying

1264
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:36,255
It is after Sandy Hook I meant such as Sandy Hook because this case is about

1265
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,583
Okay so such as you mean like so when there's like a

1266
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,607
Mass shooting

1267
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,911
Sure okay

1268
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:46,239
Name a mass shooting where anti-gun legislation is immediately

1269
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,823
I couldn't name off the top my head

1270
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,359
KT I'm heading out

1271
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,407
You know the fun fact is I can't either

1272
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:56,223
Which is why I'm trying to figure out why this sentence is in there

1273
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,503
It's tough

1274
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:03,903
It's tough when you have to really go over this affidavit and be like why did you say this

1275
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,743
Basically that any governmental action

1276
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:14,143
That took place after the gun

1277
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:18,239
To the next sentence in the affidavit which is about criticize into mainstream media

1278
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,287
And this is also fruitless

1279
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,823
Go to next sentence

1280
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:26,431
I believe the mainstream because you were talking about the government since 1 right

1281
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,455
Descendants 2

1282
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,479
Completely different

1283
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,295
Now we're talkin about mainstream media

1284
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,343
Use the Sandy Hook tragedy

1285
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:38,207
To utilize and transform the public sympathy sympathy for the victims and their families

1286
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Into

1287
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:42,559
An issue of gun rights I read that correctly right

1288
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,351
Okay give me an example

1289
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,655
I think it's the exact

1290
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,935
Examples I just gave it

1291
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:54,335
But you didn't give me any asking you for this one

1292
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,127
Give me one example

1293
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,223
So that I can understand a little bit as to why this is even in here

1294
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,015
Don't have an example

1295
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
That's

1296
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:10,207
That is the most Infowars thing I think I've ever seen it could not be more info

1297
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:16,607
Then just this is Marion. It's exactly the examples that I just gave you

1298
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:23,519
Infowars

1299
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:29,919
You people just don't question my daily life most people are very distractible

1300
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:36,319
The subject of the mainstream media obviously you're in a courtroom set Riley wanted to find

1301
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:41,439
Wd2 with these people what is the mainstream media let's hear it

1302
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,231
When you say mainstream media what's up

1303
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,559
Just any

1304
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,351
Cable News Network

1305
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,631
Familiar to

1306
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:50,911
Buff people

1307
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,703
Okay so they have to be on cable

1308
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,239
Not necessarily

1309
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,775
Okay what do you mean by mainstream

1310
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,847
Big corporate media

1311
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:01,151
Been around for awhile well known to the public

1312
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,431
Okay Whitney Corp

1313
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,247
As corporate sponsor

1314
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,551
Okay so

1315
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,367
Corporate sponsors

1316
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
That are

1317
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,975
A company that has corporate sponsors

1318
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
That

1319
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,791
Convey the news

1320
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,327
And

1321
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,191
And are known to the public in

1322
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,239
I've been around awhile that's how you define me

1323
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,151
When you say for a while

1324
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:33,919
How long is that

1325
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:36,991
What are you referring

1326
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,039
Your answer that you said

1327
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,599
Do the corporate sponsors they've been around for awhile

1328
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,135
What do you mean by for a while

1329
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,159
For your words

1330
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,463
I would say

1331
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,511
They've been around long enough to have

1332
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,047
Some sort of reputation in

1333
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
Public

1334
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:51,839
Recognition

1335
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,119
Okay

1336
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,935
So Fox News

1337
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,287
No

1338
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,591
No really they've corporate sponsors

1339
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,639
They're well known to the public right

1340
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:08,991
I would I would say most people probably don't know about LAN

1341
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,271
Really

1342
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,599
I would guess most people if I ask them on the street they probably around

1343
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,879
Definitely not

1344
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:15,647
Like

1345
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,695
As familiar as they would be with Fox News

1346
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:23,071
Fox News is mainstream media

1347
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:29,727
For whatever arbitrary draw of number of people who Owen could ask upon the street

1348
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:36,127
Number and it's arbitrary

1349
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:40,991
Trump rally everybody knows who I am

1350
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,647
Is it Breitbart

1351
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:50,719
They got corporate sponsors their well-known to the public they been around for

1352
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,999
Longer than the way in

1353
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,047
Breitbart

1354
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:54,815
Is it

1355
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,351
Is mainstream media team

1356
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,399
According to your definition right

1357
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,727
I would probably say

1358
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,799
No I wouldn't consider Breitbart mainstream either why

1359
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:10,687
I mean this is all open for interpretation but I mean another General thing of

1360
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,735
Mainstream media would be

1361
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:16,319
Entities that go along with the same narrative

1362
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:20,415
As everybody else and I filled it Breitbart and oan often

1363
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,183
Beer

1364
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,719
Off of

1365
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,255
The consensus narrative

1366
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,023
Okay

1367
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:27,071
So you're mainstream media

1368
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:33,471
Yeah even if you're a news outlet that checks all of mr. Shroyer's boxes of what he defined as mainstream

1369
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,519
If you

1370
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
If you

1371
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:40,895
Have an opinion that's different than some other news outlets then you're not mainstream

1372
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:45,503
How different is it have to be in what's the frequency of that

1373
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,551
There's no match

1374
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:54,463
There's no there's no I mean I feel like

1375
01:18:54,719 --> 01:19:00,863
Stuff is and isn't interesting here is you have these definitions that I want his brain.

1376
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,447
Corporate sponsorships

1377
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,751
And those are the things that you would like

1378
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:10,335
To present is what he defines as mainstream media put on further questioning

1379
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:16,991
You really start to realize it's like oh no mainstream media says things I don't like and things that are crazy and are in law

1380
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:20,063
Why was my narratives that's not mainstream media

1381
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:26,463
They satisfy all the conditions that I immediately came up with the respectable answers

1382
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,743
It does

1383
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:34,143
Feel like this should be a criminal trial and the punishment should be a life

1384
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:40,543
Wang parole of word that the plaintiff is words you have to okay so if you want to use a word

1385
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,823
You have to

1386
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,615
Demonstrate

1387
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,151
To an expert

1388
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:51,295
In language that you know how to use it properly

1389
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:57,951
Yeah I think I think their punishment could be a lifetime of carrying a dictionary around your neck

1390
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:04,351
Yes yes Scarlet Letter but it's all the letters

1391
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,655
Realizes like wait Infowars

1392
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:12,799
Would fill all the qualifications that you just gave right for it so they are you mainstream baby

1393
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,336
Prior to

1394
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,896
Infowars and your selfie deplatformed

1395
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,688
Social media Outlets

1396
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,736
I was Infowars mainstreaming

1397
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,528
Okay

1398
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,320
They've been around a long time

1399
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,344
They have notoriety

1400
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,624
Massive audio

1401
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:27,904
That

1402
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
Warts

1403
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:31,488
Most of the companies that I just mentioned earlier

1404
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Right

1405
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,816
And on every Outlet

1406
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,352
That wasn't infowars.com

1407
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,144
Corporate sponsors with

1408
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,192
We have that

1409
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,032
I just want to know Infowars

1410
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,592
Checks all of your boxes for mainstream media

1411
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:47,872
Why aren't they

1412
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,920
I just don't agree

1413
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:52,480
Check all boxes at all fact

1414
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:54,528
Check

1415
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:58,624
Generalities of my definition of mainstream media somebody else has to be

1416
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,392
Entirely

1417
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,720
I'm ask I'm not asking for you to classify

1418
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,512
Infowars for everybody

1419
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,304
Right I'm asking what

1420
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,840
You think what's Owens

1421
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,632
And then when I asked

1422
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,960
How Owen decides whether something is mainstream media

1423
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,496
You gave me your criteria

1424
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,800
And then I took Infowars your employer

1425
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,336
And it checks every single box

1426
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,408
But you're saying no no no we're not mainstream

1427
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,944
And I'm trying to figure out why

1428
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:23,968
Tell me why

1429
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,528
Okay

1430
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:28,832
How about this

1431
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,392
When

1432
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:37,024
News outlets lie about events that caused massive violence to happen

1433
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,328
They don't end up getting sued or in court

1434
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:43,680
But when Infowars covers event somehow we always end up in litigation like

1435
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:46,496
You ever seen defamation verdicts

1436
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,032
United States

1437
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,568
I'm not too familiar now

1438
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,616
I want you to Google it when you go home

1439
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:54,944
And I want you to see who was dependent by the Play-Doh

1440
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,480
Their names are

1441
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,248
CNN

1442
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
NBC

1443
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,552
Gawker

1444
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,344
Pit massive

1445
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,112
Hollywood

1446
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:09,024
So I think this is one of the more revealing moments it's

1447
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:09,792
Information

1448
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:16,192
He needs to come up with an explanation for why Infowars isn't the MSM and the thing that he lands on is if they get sued where they make

1449
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,984
Things up but the mainstream media doesn't

1450
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,544
What's remarkable about this is that it's

1451
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:26,944
Wholly reliant on Owen having no idea who gets sued for what no clue it's solely Based On A Feeling in that

1452
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,224
Healing is a grievance

1453
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,320
Feels like they're the victims of society and so

1454
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:35,136
Assumptions are made in order to prop up that feeling

1455
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:41,536
Instead of asking yourself if other people get sued for doing the things that you've done it feels more satisfying to assume that they do

1456
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:44,608
And you're only getting sued because everyone's against you

1457
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:51,264
I think this is so revealing is because it's an instance of Owen speaking to the identity and definition of Infowars

1458
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,128
It's something that's at the root of why he thinks Infowars is different than other media Outlets

1459
01:22:56,384 --> 01:23:00,480
Because they're victims of an unfair game persecution

1460
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:06,624
This completely inaccurate feeling is part of how and identifies Infowars and how they're different from CNN

1461
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:13,280
This makes total sense to me and I think that this feeling is almost comically present in their broadcast but it's a little

1462
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:16,096
Shocking to see it articulated by Owen in a deposition

1463
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:22,496
Infowars isn't different for the mainstream media because they cover the stories that no one else will they're not different because they have asked

1464
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:25,056
Will deep-level sources who feed them solid Intel

1465
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:30,432
They're different because they believe incorrect things that make them self-identifies the victims of society

1466
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:37,088
Really just very angsty and childish at its core and it really does explain Owens early career as a selfie

1467
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,624
Describe duck Destroyer

1468
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:45,280
Just a child this is just childish it I mean it does feel like what he wants to say is like UK

1469
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,864
You can't like take the things that I say

1470
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,912
And then put them into a different context

1471
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,448
Because then

1472
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:59,872
They own oh yeah that's cuz I feel like I feel real stupid now

1473
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,152
I have

1474
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:07,808
Made some broad statements about what makes mainstream media

1475
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:14,208
Accuracy on the persecution fully understood the transitive property

1476
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:18,816
Could you please explain that to me from the very beginning

1477
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:21,376
We're going to be here awhile

1478
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:26,752
So we get to the next sentence in the affidavit and

1479
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:29,312
This is a meal basically this affidavit

1480
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,640
In Exodus you say I believe the mainstream media

1481
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,688
Remove

1482
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,712
? over that

1483
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:40,832
Instead you believe that makes you media instead of blaming the shooter

1484
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,392
Portrayed all going gun owners

1485
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:47,744
And gun-rights activists as the cause of what happened at Sandy Hook

1486
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:51,584
Surely there's an event that you watched or saw

1487
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,608
Where

1488
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,888
This happened so that

1489
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,680
That made you put this in your affidavit

1490
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,984
I can't recall

1491
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,776
Wow that's

1492
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,056
Not good

1493
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:08,224
What I'm hearing you say is that I should have a reason for the feelings that I have and the things that I say

1494
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:13,856
I mean you don't necessarily have a reason for all of your feelings but ones that you swear

1495
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:17,440
Motivate your actions try I would think that you should have

1496
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,464
Some sort of

1497
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:25,120
Like here's why okay now let me throw this out at you this is the first I'm hearing of this s***

1498
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:31,008
This notion that mainstream media blamed gun owners

1499
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,824
Come up with an event makes this make sense

1500
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,872
But Bill makes it a little bit worse

1501
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:39,200
If this sentence that I just read one true that's a big deal

1502
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,224
Correct

1503
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:44,320
What is a big deal that the mainstream media

1504
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,112
Was

1505
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:48,928
Was portraying all gun owners

1506
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,232
And gun rights activist

1507
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,256
They don't even know

1508
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:57,120
As the cause of what happened at Sandy

1509
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,400
Correct yes

1510
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,960
But you can't recall anything that made that

1511
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,752
Right

1512
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,544
Not an exact

1513
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:12,992
Because you're putting me into a position where I can't produce the oven in

1514
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,272
You're asking me to produce

1515
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,296
I'm glad you said

1516
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:21,696
We'll come back up what's awesome about this moment is

1517
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,488
That was basically saying like

1518
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,768
Man that would be huge

1519
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,560
I would be

1520
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:32,960
I'd be worried if you could prove this please prove it I will join your team

1521
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:39,360
Right now I'll f****** quit this love profession for good and work under you Owensboro

1522
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:45,760
If you can get me one f****** example

1523
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:54,208
So we get back to actual video and this is not good if I definitely would not

1524
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,256
Not want to hear this in a deposition

1525
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,304
With what you know now

1526
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,376
We read some of the quote

1527
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,656
When I read some of those clothes

1528
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,960
The video

1529
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,496
Are you did about mr. Iceland

1530
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,288
Should you settle

1531
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,384
I mean I think with any live

1532
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:15,712
Broadcast I mean we don't have teleprompters or Scripts

1533
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,248
That you're going to

1534
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,272
Sometimes

1535
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:21,856
Have words and phrases that come out

1536
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,160
Are in the way that you like them

1537
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,208
And so I'm upset

1538
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:26,976
That

1539
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:33,376
My commentary that day is perceived as an attack on Mr heslin it never was that was never the intention

1540
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:38,240
When you said think we're going to get clarification from Mister haslinger Miskelly

1541
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,776
I wouldn't hold my breath

1542
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,056
You know what you did after that

1543
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:43,360
I think it went to break I'm not sure

1544
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,384
Chuckled

1545
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,528
That's what you do

1546
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,112
Did you find it

1547
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:54,880
Funny

1548
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:55,904
No

1549
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,744
No do you find

1550
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,024
Mass shootings

1551
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,328
No you find you know

1552
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,120
Asking parents

1553
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,912
For clarification

1554
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,472
On things that are the true

1555
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,264
Is that funny

1556
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,664
Sometimes it's just awkward when you go to break and you just kind of have an awkward moment

1557
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:22,016
And I guess in that moment it was a chuckle or maybe it was just because

1558
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:29,440
Megyn Kelly was just kind of a joke me at the time so bringing her up was kind of a board leave a charcoal but then it again to know

1559
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:33,024
In no way shape or form was any of that commentary meant

1560
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:40,960
A slight on mr. heslin I never see his kid didn't

1561
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,240
I never said any of that

1562
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:48,896
You really don't want to hear you laughed in that room

1563
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,856
You laughed real

1564
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,904
I'm feel good

1565
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:04,256
Feel like I shouldn't have done that 8 can I ask you a question let's go back to the first question

1566
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:07,072
Do you feel like you should have said all that stuff

1567
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:13,472
Honestly he kind of thinks that like he did as good a job as he could

1568
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:19,360
With the information that was available to its course he does it's not true

1569
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,640
You are now

1570
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,432
Have been found by a court

1571
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,968
To have defamed

1572
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
Mr. heslin

1573
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:26,784
Right

1574
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,808
Justinformed

1575
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:34,208
I I had no again I never accused Mr heslin of line I never

1576
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:38,048
That segment was never purposed as any sort of affront to me

1577
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,864
I'm not even sure if I knew who he was before

1578
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,472
So you didn't care who you were talking about

1579
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:49,312
I'm just covering a story that was given to me you would agree you covered it poorly

1580
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,336
Correct

1581
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,896
I covered what I had available to me

1582
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:53,920
No

1583
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:54,944
You did not do that

1584
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,992
You covered what was selected

1585
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,784
By someone at Infowars in with

1586
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,552
Given to you

1587
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,576
Without any questions

1588
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,856
That's what you did right

1589
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,416
Yes because available was the whole

1590
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,440
Corners

1591
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:06,464
Prescott

1592
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,000
True

1593
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,816
Not to me but it was out there

1594
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:13,632
It was an it was Shirley was available to you

1595
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:17,472
Not in that exact moment but what if the news isn't a race is it

1596
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:22,592
Is it up for interpretation

1597
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:25,920
I don't do it as a race

1598
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:27,200
No it's not a race

1599
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:27,968
Mister Ogden

1600
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:28,992
Right

1601
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,528
I do not view the news as a race

1602
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,296
Okay

1603
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,832
Now that we've established that

1604
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,904
You definitely have that Corners press conf

1605
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:36,928
Available

1606
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:38,720
True

1607
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,512
No all I had was that clip

1608
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,560
You know what the internet is right

1609
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,608
Ouch

1610
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:51,008
Define availability let me let me try and make this a little bit clearer

1611
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,288
Okay

1612
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,568
How do you

1613
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,360
Or someone around you

1614
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:02,528
Googled the words you could have watched the whole thing

1615
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:09,952
Guardrails around Infowars there's news instead of being handed directly to you

1616
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,000
And then if this video is b*******

1617
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:18,400
Then do you just need to get to you and there's no risk of you accidentally reported.

1618
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:21,472
Never had anyone add Infowars to do that what is that job

1619
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:25,824
Where do you get those people

1620
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:32,224
Ship is going to hire somebody who can look into things I don't think they teach them

1621
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:38,624
Not with this centralized government school system

1622
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,440
Got this video and this article from

1623
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,976
Whoever anybody

1624
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:43,744
Everybody

1625
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,768
And

1626
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,560
This clip is fantastic

1627
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,352
Because this

1628
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,120
Is the clap

1629
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:52,704
Where Bill basically makes Owen admit that he's a puppet

1630
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,752
I don't know who edited that video

1631
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:58,592
Right it could have been someone in our house it could have been someone else on the internet that they found

1632
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,360
Right

1633
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,128
You know what

1634
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,408
Do you know we can agree on

1635
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,200
Nobody fat

1636
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,504
Nobody to sit

1637
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,552
Oh man that's crazy when did he say this

1638
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,600
Google up the interview with watch it

1639
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,368
20 minutes

1640
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:17,280
I didn't plan on covering the story that day so I had no preconceived notion that I would even have to do that I know Mister Shroyer

1641
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,816
We're here because you were a puppet

1642
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,632
You would agree with me right

1643
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:27,264
You don't agree with me that you

1644
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,032
Heeler puppies

1645
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,056
Cracked

1646
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:29,824
Puppet is

1647
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:33,152
An object that is used

1648
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:34,432
To convey a message

1649
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,480
But somebody else is actually controlling them

1650
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:38,784
Yes bright

1651
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,320
You were conveying a message

1652
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,088
Right

1653
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:44,160
True somebody else was

1654
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,184
Controlling

1655
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,464
True

1656
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,256
No

1657
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
No

1658
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,072
Who who is controlling the message that you were putting

1659
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:56,192
I were you and control what was the messenger recurrent at the corner

1660
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:58,496
Said he never released the children

1661
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,544
Cuz that's the story ran with

1662
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,592
Who is in control of that information

1663
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:05,152
If you weren't cuz you already said you weren't in control of it

1664
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,944
Who was somebody has to be

1665
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,992
Whoever originally posted the video

1666
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,064
Someone else had control

1667
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,368
You were conveying the message

1668
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:16,160
We just established that you

1669
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,976
There's nothing wrong

1670
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,768
Derogatory term

1671
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,560
But it's analogous to where we are now

1672
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:23,584
You would agree

1673
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:28,192
I think if anybody is being using the puppet it would be

1674
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,776
People who are reporting their stories

1675
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:35,104
I'm just chilling at information

1676
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:35,872
The story

1677
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:42,528
If I cover it so if I just pick up anybody's new source and cover it.

1678
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,808
Does that make me a puppet

1679
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:49,952
So if you don't absolutely okay then I guess then I guess I'm a puppet of zerohedge in this case

1680
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,256
Yeah I know that's actually not true

1681
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:53,792
You're a puppet

1682
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,584
I coin Bank

1683
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:56,864
Okay

1684
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:03,264
That's the source that was underlying the Zero Hedge article

1685
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:09,664
Unlike their puppet

1686
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,968
I can't believe

1687
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:16,064
That you don't have that moment where you go see where you going

1688
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:20,928
Okay I think I did and I think you realize like there isn't a way out of this trap

1689
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:27,328
Because otherwise I have to admit that I was in control of release

1690
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:33,728
Totally I feel like the first time he was like so you're not a puppet okay so were you and control the message

1691
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:36,032
Where you conveying the message

1692
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:42,432
Yeah if it's humiliation or responsibility which are you going to accept

1693
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:48,832
Shurfine in this situation

1694
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:53,952
At the end I guess I'm a puppet then zerohedge

1695
01:34:54,208 --> 01:35:00,352
That's not even good enough to have to hit back not even that you wish

1696
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:06,752
You don't even know who the f*** they are so at this point Bill plays some videos

1697
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:09,312
Of all the women's March

1698
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:12,896
Hey this is a continuation of Owen saying

1699
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:19,040
Uprinting M on it

1700
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:25,440
And I don't have it at my disposal so he's this is the videos where he does that to people and says you're on

1701
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:30,560
Basically yes listening to this as we've gone

1702
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:34,656
Bill already made reference to Owen doing this

1703
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,960
He's already foreshadowed

1704
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:43,360
And he made a very unsuccessful attempt at explaining what he was doing

1705
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:48,992
So now we got it now we got props and Ona still hopeless

1706
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,376
Alright

1707
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:09,472
So this gentleman just told you tell that to the dozens of accusers that

1708
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,520
Stead of accused him of sexual harassment

1709
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,824
Right and you responded with

1710
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,872
Name one

1711
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,640
Right

1712
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,432
Yes let's keep watch

1713
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,016
So keep watching

1714
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:28,416
And Bill subtly trying to make this point that I have been doing this to you

1715
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,184
To pick up on it

1716
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:32,000
Alright

1717
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,024
So

1718
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,560
Has an encounter with some protest

1719
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,888
You were asked they had a position

1720
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:38,656
Right

1721
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,192
And you ask them

1722
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:40,960
For evidence

1723
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:44,800
In master

1724
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,080
One name

1725
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,360
One of the tropics

1726
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,736
You said oh I'm formed

1727
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:53,504
You started name

1728
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,064
Trap Queen

1729
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:57,856
And

1730
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,648
Afterwards he goes

1731
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,928
Believe the women

1732
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:02,976
Even though I do

1733
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,536
Even though I can't remember

1734
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,072
That's right

1735
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,864
And he's and you said

1736
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,632
You can't even

1737
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:10,656
1

1738
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,496
Now

1739
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,776
Take what just happened

1740
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:20,640
What's rheumatism

1741
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:22,688
Dublin

1742
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,248
Couldn't

1743
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:28,064
And there's way more

1744
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,368
Right

1745
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,416
I don't know but okay

1746
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,048
I have no idea

1747
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,584
Surely you believe that there's more

1748
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,608
Governmental

1749
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:42,912
And or congress

1750
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,216
And or congress people

1751
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,032
And or mainstream media

1752
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:48,800
What's

1753
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:50,336
Encompassing

1754
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,616
Way more than Trump

1755
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:52,896
True

1756
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,200
I'm I'm I'm sorry I don't understand this

1757
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:57,248
Yeah you couldn't name

1758
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,016
1

1759
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:02,880
He doesn't understand he doesn't grasp that they Dynamic that is

1760
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:09,280
Planning out here it's not a satisfying no but but that's why build it has to directly tell him

1761
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,048
So here's that

1762
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,840
Can you kind of see how I got my

1763
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:13,120
My question and answer format

1764
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,168
Affidavit

1765
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:18,496
Spoiler alert

1766
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:23,360
Capital Cab

1767
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,152
Oh my God

1768
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,944
Oh my God

1769
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,784
I want I want

1770
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:37,184
Organic

1771
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,768
Plated but there's a little bit of like still Saving Face a tiny bit

1772
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:43,840
I still don't think he understands quite what is happening

1773
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:50,240
I don't think he understands being directly told I took that

1774
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:55,360
You did with protesters and use that to form the way I asked you these questions

1775
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:57,408
Yeah again I really think that

1776
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:03,808
Owen does not understand the ability to transfer a series of actions and behaviors from

1777
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:10,208
Someone said section to another I understand I understand why you think I disagree

1778
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:13,536
The a lot of the inability to understand things is somehow

1779
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:16,352
Sometimes strategic sometimes it's

1780
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:20,704
Convenience to not understand that

1781
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:27,360
This article that Owen was using to do his coverage that he was flipped by somebody

1782
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:32,224
You think like I don't know maybe if that article was everywhere

1783
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:36,576
Like it was a huge story then maybe commenting on it

1784
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:43,232
Make some sad that like with kit meals right if truly Marcela fontaine's picture was

1785
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:45,536
Everywhere

1786
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:51,936
It makes some sense to address or something

1787
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:58,336
If you have more than just say a tweet by buttmuncher 99 then yes

1788
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:02,432
How relevant that story was

1789
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:04,224
This is the article that you were going

1790
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,040
You're scrolling through the video in this

1791
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,088
Cracked

1792
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:13,184
Why had I believe I had that article printed off

1793
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,512
Dismiss

1794
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,792
What you're going through

1795
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,352
Okay yeah I'm not in control of what goes on

1796
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,656
So you don't

1797
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,448
You are just somebody else is on this

1798
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,496
But I do want to look at this

1799
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,056
This shows that

1800
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:32,128
And we're not sure where zero-point now is

1801
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:33,408
They could be in the center

1802
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:38,784
And so could have been published at 3:35 p.m. central or

1803
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:40,576
Or 235

1804
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,856
445

1805
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:44,928
And

1806
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,744
This screenshot is from the

1807
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,864
And you can see how many shares has had

1808
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,448
How many shares has had at the

1809
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,216
What time you put it

1810
01:40:59,264 --> 01:40:59,776
What's that number

1811
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,056
3

1812
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:04,128
This article is not one

1813
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,712
Getting shot around and Diesel other

1814
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:08,992
Outlets

1815
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,016
Reporting this is it

1816
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:14,368
Safe2save this is at a minimum if this is been up for

1817
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,416
At most

1818
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,184
Our

1819
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,720
3 shares

1820
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,512
We're not dealing with the top

1821
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:27,680
Your auntie

1822
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,984
Is much larger

1823
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,056
Something that's been put up for

1824
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:34,848
Nauert

1825
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:36,640
Correct

1826
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:39,968
You know you talk to

1827
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:41,248
Thousands if not

1828
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,272
Hundred thousand

1829
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,552
People everyday

1830
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,320
The TuneIn

1831
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,344
You and Mister

1832
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,184
So

1833
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:50,720
When

1834
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:53,280
A larger media player

1835
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:54,816
Like a war

1836
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,888
Takes a smaller media platform

1837
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:00,704
Article

1838
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,984
And puts it up

1839
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:05,568
You can agree that disseminates that information

1840
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,640
Kanishka

1841
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,408
Probably

1842
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:14,528
This is a great way of using their grandiosity against them

1843
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:17,344
Something that might be described as a to-do move

1844
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:23,744
There's a Twist in here with you guys talk all day about

1845
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:30,144
How popular you are billions and billions of listeners this b*******

1846
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,680
Couple thousand

1847
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:35,264
Cool if you were in Owens shoes

1848
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,592
If someone had fed you this information

1849
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:42,432
Like what would you internally at work what would you do

1850
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:45,248
Abdomen

1851
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:51,904
What would Owen do you know if you were in that situation what would you what would your sort of agenda be

1852
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:52,928
I'm on air

1853
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:56,768
No not talking like afterwards after you realize that this is

1854
01:42:57,024 --> 01:43:03,168
Bad information that someone is giving probably run away because you're a coward

1855
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:09,568
Because if I admitted guilt it Infowars I don't know what anybody would do to me there's a lot

1856
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:15,968
Lot of possible consequences with a lot of guns over around the heavily-armed workplace

1857
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:22,368
And I couldn't continue working there morally speaking because I just committed one of the greater sins that I can imagine

1858
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:25,696
So I'm going to have to go with move to Canada

1859
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:32,096
I was looking for a figure out who gave you that information because they've clearly f*** you over

1860
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:38,496
Because I feel like they're going to get rewarded and I should go to Canada

1861
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:43,872
Bananas world over there

1862
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:50,272
Hey this person maybe won't be mad at them

1863
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:56,672
Maybe you'd be worried that they might do it again and maybe you'd want to have a talk with him about being more careful with their information

1864
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,976
So it doesn't really care too much

1865
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:02,304
If zerohedge never publishes the story I've never covered

1866
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,328
Sub-Zero

1867
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:09,216
I didn't say that I'm just telling you that if zerohedge never publish the story I would have never covered it

1868
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:09,984
Zerohedge

1869
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,520
Isn't the one that gave you

1870
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,336
Circlip

1871
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,152
And all of your

1872
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:20,224
I don't know who gave me that clip I don't know where they got it

1873
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,528
You definitely want to find

1874
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:25,600
When you leave here you're going to find out who is working that day

1875
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:26,880
Injection for

1876
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,184
Probably not

1877
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,720
You don't even you don't care

1878
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,304
Well I imagine that you would

1879
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,328
Oh my God

1880
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,376
I again I mean

1881
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:43,264
I'm not even sure if the people that would working that day even still working and for

1882
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,032
10 question

1883
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:47,616
What's the question

1884
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:56,320
Yeah I am upset that Mr has one had to go through any of this I'm upset that I'm being lumped into this again

1885
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:59,136
Sandy Hook was never my thing I never

1886
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:03,488
Have ever doubted the events happened I never doubted that his son never died

1887
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,816
I'm doing commentary on a piece that was published

1888
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:10,144
By 0 heads or 0.90 or ibankcoin

1889
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,424
They would never published it

1890
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,704
I would have never covered it

1891
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,008
Yeah but

1892
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:17,056
But you were

1893
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:20,128
You were reporting on that that was the

1894
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:22,944
Zerohedge

1895
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,504
But you

1896
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:27,296
Directly siding

1897
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:28,064
The corners

1898
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,088
Testimony

1899
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,368
That's it

1900
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:33,952
That's company

1901
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,232
True

1902
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:41,632
I think it was a CBS interview with the corner I don't know where the original interview with the corner come

1903
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,168
What we do know is that

1904
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,448
You didn't know what was in it

1905
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:46,496
True

1906
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:50,336
Till I saw it that day you're upset that you're lumped into this

1907
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,152
Enough

1908
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:54,688
Go back to work and figure out

1909
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,224
Who did this

1910
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:57,760
In this position

1911
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,808
Made you betray

1912
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:00,576
All the people

1913
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:02,880
And

1914
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,184
Dearly

1915
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,976
Impacted mr. hussle's life

1916
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:07,744
Again

1917
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,024
Right

1918
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:09,792
You're not that

1919
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,072
Injection form

1920
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,680
I just feel that that would be

1921
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,496
There's nothing that can really come of that

1922
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:22,592
Jen and Noah truth not matter

1923
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,664
Absolutely nobody ever

1924
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:28,992
Was targeting any individuals

1925
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,880
By bringing me that thing other than to say hey look ma back in the news

1926
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,160
You don't even have gave it to you

1927
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:40,512
Okay fine I guess I don't know then Ringo

1928
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:41,280
You don't know

1929
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,304
Why they did

1930
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:45,888
You don't know why they clip that video in

1931
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:46,912
Zach Wade

1932
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,192
Set you up

1933
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:49,472
Two light

1934
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,240
Thousand

1935
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:54,848
Owen did not have to say no one meant to Target anybody

1936
01:46:55,104 --> 01:47:01,248
Because now that is introduces that idea. Cohen can't say that

1937
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,272
On the record

1938
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:08,672
For the jury Ellen saying give me this in order to Target though

1939
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:15,072
This is just an unforced error AAA cost nothing to be like

1940
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:21,216
You know what I hadn't thought about it but yes absolutely I would love to get to the bottom of this and I intend to figure this out

1941
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:27,616
I didn't before and maybe that's that was sloppy of me

1942
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:29,664
Nothing I mean

1943
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:36,064
I genuinely cannot believe that none of their lawyers just got together and explain how a deposition works

1944
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:36,832
Just was like

1945
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:37,600
Listen

1946
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:44,256
Answer only the question if it all possible keep your answers to yes or no do not

1947
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:47,584
Explain if it is not part of the question

1948
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,632
All you have to do is answer the question

1949
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:52,448
You just answer the question

1950
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:56,032
Yes or no if possible

1951
01:47:56,288 --> 01:48:01,408
Giving giving these bizarre explanations for your motivations and where your heart is

1952
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:06,272
Is only going to create so stupid more problem you are so stupid

1953
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:09,600
So the video gets played and

1954
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:14,464
I think this is just a demonstration of how poorly these videos were cut

1955
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:17,024
Like they cut off mid-sentence

1956
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,304
ISO making a

1957
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,072
Pretty

1958
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:19,840
Extreme

1959
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:20,608
Glenwood

1960
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:23,680
Very thing Vivid in your memory holding his dead child

1961
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,216
Here is an

1962
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,496
Corner

1963
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:28,032
That does not cooperate

1964
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:37,248
Contact

1965
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,424
Accomplished

1966
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:18,208
That is what

1967
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,256
You realize he was going

1968
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,792
He was about to say something else

1969
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,072
Agree

1970
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:26,912
I have never seen the clip I never seen the full clip that is

1971
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:29,984
The only time I've ever seen or known anything about that clip

1972
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:30,752
Backup

1973
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:32,544
Right there what we just saw

1974
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,336
You could hear him going

1975
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:36,896
Continuing to make noise as the video

1976
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:37,920
Correct

1977
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:42,528
You can play it back for me now but I've no idea if I heard it then or not

1978
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:56,864
Have you ever heard somebody in descendants

1979
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,144
Bottom

1980
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:00,960
I have no idea

1981
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:07,360
This is just an attempt to be like you should have had an instinct that they would this

1982
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,896
Maybe there was more

1983
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:14,016
And this is laying the groundwork of establishing a pattern because there's another clip

1984
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:16,832
That is played that's just got off mid-sentence

1985
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,488
Well

1986
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,536
At first I thought that

1987
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:26,816
And I have questions

1988
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:30,400
Wanting to

1989
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:31,168
See her

1990
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:33,984
We can agree that

1991
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:34,752
That clip

1992
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,056
Right in the middle

1993
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:38,592
Troop

1994
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:40,896
Wanting to see her

1995
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:42,688
That would be an assumption I don't

1996
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,712
Oh my God

1997
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,808
Okay so

1998
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:48,576
Just

1999
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:49,856
Another question

2000
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,904
That people are now going to be asking

2001
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,184
About Sandy Hook

2002
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:02,912
Will there be a clarification

2003
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:03,680
From

2004
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:05,216
Edwin or Megyn Kelly

2005
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:17,760
Not a good look not a good look

2006
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:24,160
Do a little bit of a fight right after that because you can hear Mark in the background

2007
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:30,560
But that is a question that is very relevant

2008
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:33,888
Who is fueling the

2009
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:36,448
Thumbs up

2010
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:42,848
The last tech glasses and on that video you say will there be clarification from Heflin

2011
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,128
Or Megyn Kelly

2012
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,920
I wouldn't hold your breath

2013
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:48,736
So now there

2014
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:51,040
Fueling The Conspiracy Theory

2015
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,576
Unbelievable

2016
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,624
Who isn't there

2017
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:56,672
Viewing the conspiracy theory claims

2018
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:01,280
Megyn Kelly and zerohedge

2019
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,608
No

2020
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:06,400
What did Megyn Kelly say

2021
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,264
Just mystery

2022
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,616
Against far as my knowledge

2023
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:16,896
The

2024
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,224
Coroner testimony was not brought up

2025
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:20,992
2

2026
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:22,272
Mr. heslin

2027
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:24,064
In Megyn Kelly's interview

2028
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:28,928
And it may have been irrelevant but that's what I'm saying is that Megyn Kelly did not clarify that question

2029
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:32,256
Questioner

2030
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:33,024
On the spot

2031
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:35,328
And I'm probably doesn't go to

2032
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:36,864
Your website

2033
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:39,680
Pretty fearsome

2034
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:42,496
Okay sure

2035
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:48,640
You can see here that I want still grasping to this thing that he thinks is a life raft it is the idea that Megyn Kelly for some reason

2036
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:55,040
Was required to address the manipulative lie edited clip of the coroner and the fact that she didn't is somehow suspicious

2037
01:52:55,552 --> 01:53:00,928
Without oversimplifying things this is basically all Owen has to defend his actions which is really sad because

2038
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:04,256
If you want to really Express a truer version of what happened

2039
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:10,656
It's B Owen believe the fraudulent claims was true because of conform to his conspiracy worldview

2040
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:17,056
To attack the people he felt were threatening his boss whether he actually believed it was true is beside the point but use the impression

2041
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:20,384
To discredit the claim of a grieving father

2042
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:26,784
Who his boss had lied about defamed in the past but they didn't fully address this fraudulent clip

2043
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:31,136
That must mean that there's a reason that they don't want to clarify things

2044
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:37,024
We all that's going on sloppy

2045
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:43,424
No no every every new question

2046
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:49,824
That's continued existence

2047
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:54,176
Point know about Wolfgang halbig

2048
01:53:54,432 --> 01:54:00,576
Until I really even know about him until like there

2049
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:04,672
Papa and be relevant

2050
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:12,096
But don't just learn something kind of course this deposition

2051
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:16,192
Then why did you say what will there be clarification for bromhead

2052
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:20,800
Just I would say that if he doesn't like

2053
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:22,848
You Stories being published in

2054
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:24,896
Then he would come out and make statement saying

2055
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,688
You know

2056
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,224
What he said in the video

2057
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:30,016
That's literally what he

2058
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:31,296
In the video

2059
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,344
She said I held my dead son

2060
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:34,880
Silence

2061
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:36,416
Conspiracy theories

2062
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:41,024
That's why he did to Macon Kelly enter

2063
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:42,304
Do you understand

2064
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:46,656
You're saying he did the Megyn Kelly interview because of Infowars

2065
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:49,984
Yes because of the phone

2066
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:53,568
For That interview all of the torture

2067
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:54,592
Did they put him

2068
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,152
Over and over and over again

2069
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:57,920
108

2070
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:00,736
That's how many videos

2071
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,392
So yes

2072
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:08,672
Did you not know that

2073
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:12,512
Depressing I just

2074
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:13,792
I mean

2075
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:20,448
It's either a lie or it's an indication of just not caring at all

2076
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,472
He did sound honest

2077
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:27,872
It did sound honest when he's like wait but he's your little issues you're saying that he went on Megyn Kelly

2078
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:29,664
Because of us

2079
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:30,944
Yeah

2080
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:37,344
That's why are we the bad guys kind of moment or just like

2081
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:43,488
Yeah

2082
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:45,024
So

2083
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:48,352
The another thing that Owen did

2084
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:54,752
Was be really shity to miss Lafferty whose mother died

2085
01:55:55,008 --> 01:56:01,152
Sandy Hook was one of the teachers and he made a little bit of a suggested that

2086
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:06,272
She should have had a gun and that would have solved everything that's going to go well yeah

2087
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:10,368
I've forgotten some of how shity this is

2088
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:13,184
Pause this video at

2089
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:14,464
49 seconds

2090
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,744
You just made the state

2091
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:20,608
If Miss Lafferty's mother had a pistol or firearm

2092
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:21,376
She could have her

2093
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:25,984
By shooting

2094
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:28,288
Her assailant before

2095
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,312
The sandwich shop

2096
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:31,104
How did

2097
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,152
Did Miss

2098
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:34,944
Did the did the deceased

2099
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:37,504
This is Lafferty's mother did she see the assailant

2100
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:39,552
I have no idea

2101
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:41,600
Did she have the ability to get

2102
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:42,368
2

2103
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:43,648
Personal lock box

2104
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:44,928
The weapon

2105
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:45,952
To defend herself

2106
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:47,744
I would assume not

2107
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:51,072
Did okay so then why are you representing to the public

2108
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:53,888
And directed to to miss laughing

2109
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:55,424
Who lost her mom

2110
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:57,216
That if she had a gun

2111
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:58,240
She could prevent

2112
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:04,896
Because I believed if you would have had access to a gun she would have used it to protect her life in the lives of others

2113
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:07,712
She could have also

2114
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:10,528
Use that gun in taking steps to put herself in

2115
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:11,296
In further Danger

2116
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:14,112
Meaning yeah if you're going to

2117
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:18,464
Approach armed assailant then you do put yourself in further Danger

2118
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:19,232
Chickadee

2119
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:20,000
List

2120
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:21,280
And get a child

2121
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,072
Yes

2122
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,400
Or she could have

2123
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:27,936
She could have died

2124
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:30,752
Without ever even seeing it coming

2125
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:32,288
From behind

2126
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,824
Tripping the first one that went down

2127
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,384
She could have been I don't know

2128
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,152
So this

2129
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:39,200
Conspiracy theory that you have

2130
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:40,224
Which is

2131
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:45,088
Guessing

2132
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:45,856
Really

2133
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:46,880
You and I can

2134
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:47,904
You're making

2135
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,208
Jackson forum

2136
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:53,280
No I believe the gun issue was made

2137
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,352
With whatever story I'm coverings

2138
01:57:56,608 --> 01:58:01,984
Like I said whatever the story is I'm covering they're saying that you don't new gun legislation is the answer

2139
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:03,776
And my proposal is that

2140
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:06,848
Having a gun to protect yourself is a better answer

2141
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:08,896
Are you sure that that's what

2142
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,432
Because

2143
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:11,456
I will say this

2144
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:14,016
You do say that she is a

2145
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:15,040
Hypro

2146
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:16,576
Going to have a

2147
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:17,856
That's not

2148
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:21,184
This is about her

2149
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:22,208
Telling press

2150
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:23,232
Trump

2151
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:24,512
Distance

2152
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,048
You understand that

2153
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:30,912
I know that that is mentioned in the article

2154
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:31,936
You're the one that I

2155
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:34,240
Arming teachers

2156
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:41,920
That's a great moment there because it's really tough to argue that all and actually was not the first

2157
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:43,968
Who was making the story about guns

2158
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:49,600
Miss Lafferty was just saying the Trump shouldn't associate with Alex and in order to lash out and started talkingshit

2159
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:51,904
But how is her mom had a gun should be a lot

2160
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:56,512
What I find particularly repulsive about this instance of Owen Sandy Hook content

2161
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:59,584
Is that it's directed specifically at Lafferty

2162
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:04,448
He speaks in the second person saying your mom as if he expects her to be listening

2163
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:10,080
It's pretty f***** up stuff and I can't imagine what kind of internal strife it must hate to pretend you're not a monster

2164
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:12,896
Listening back to that kind of stuff that's he's doing

2165
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:14,944
In this deposition

2166
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,480
Grizzly

2167
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:24,160
How did the how do you survive that now I'm interested in knowing as like a

2168
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:30,816
Specimen you know like I could not hear somebody in a deposition play that for me

2169
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:36,448
Recognize that I did that and then continue living I feel like I would just explode instantly and be like

2170
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:42,848
Good call I'm out boom and I'm just gone I have a place where you could search for Clues your beginning

2171
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:49,248
The rest of his demo video with Lafferty

2172
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:55,392
Answer the reason that I brought up that he claimed earlier that he had no real weariness of Wolfgang halbig

2173
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:57,440
And that's because this next clip

2174
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:03,584
He's looking

2175
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:06,144
He's not the one

2176
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:13,824
Wolfgang halbig

2177
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,104
Forgot just done the best

2178
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:20,736
Really going to

2179
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:21,760
I'll stop there

2180
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:28,928
Earlier I asked you some questions about Wolfgang halbig and you said no he's the radical one

2181
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,512
I don't know anything about his work I can opine on what he does

2182
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:34,048
Remember when you told me that

2183
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:34,816
Yes

2184
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:36,096
Vacu said

2185
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:49,408
Should I'm not familiar with his work enough to have an opinion

2186
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,944
Remember when you said that

2187
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:57,344
Certainly sounds bad considering the context

2188
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,112
Like if

2189
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:04,512
Somebody had me in a deposition and was like when you introduced such-and-such comedian

2190
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:09,376
Did you really think that they were the best in this area would you say that

2191
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:15,776
Do you really believe that they played colleges have you have you seen them at clubs and all around the neck

2192
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:21,920
All around the nation are they really a regular on the festival circuit

2193
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:28,320
You really think that it's someone's birthday well usually

2194
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:32,416
Good excuse for that

2195
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:39,328
I mean if I if I have to make a cemented statement it would say I think that people died that day cuz there was no

2196
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:43,680
Alarm security there was no layer of protection to stop the shooter from going in there

2197
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:45,216
And killing people

2198
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:46,240
You may

2199
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:47,520
Miss Lafferty's mother

2200
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:49,568
Would not have died

2201
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,616
If she had a pistol or a fire

2202
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:52,640
You said those were

2203
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:53,664
True

2204
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,432
Yes

2205
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:56,480
Then you went on to say

2206
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:58,016
You know

2207
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:00,064
Wolfgang halbig

2208
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:02,368
He's a good guy

2209
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,136
She's dumb

2210
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:04,672
Best reporting

2211
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:06,208
Of anyone

2212
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,232
On Sandy

2213
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,024
He's got 16

2214
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:16,704
I wasn't

2215
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:17,728
I'm not sure

2216
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:24,640
My guess is when it comes in Sandy Hook that was probably the only name that I ever saw brought up about it and that's how

2217
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,920
Probably why I referenced it

2218
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:31,552
But to say I was a big fan of Wolfgang halbig is inaccurate and it and I don't believe I ever described him as a good person

2219
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:32,832
Okay

2220
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:38,976
How how did why did you tell thousands if not millions of people here

2221
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:40,256
Wolfgang halbig.

2222
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:41,536
Is the best reporting on

2223
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:45,376
Out of all the reporting and this was a highly repeat

2224
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:47,168
In the world

2225
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,008
Probably because that was just the only name

2226
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:53,056
That I had associated with Sandy Hook

2227
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:57,408
For whatever reason just got in a research didn't I was the only name I ever saw so she ate it with it

2228
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,784
Big CNN MSN

2229
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:03,808
Fox News

2230
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:08,672
Hunza people covered it

2231
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:09,952
But you

2232
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:12,256
Did you choose walking hobby because

2233
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:13,536
He fit your name

2234
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,304
Narrative here

2235
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:15,840
I didn't have a narrative

2236
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:18,912
Again I wasn't falling Santiago time I wasn't following

2237
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:20,448
Politics are current events at the

2238
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:21,728
You were just upset

2239
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:23,776
Miss Lafferty

2240
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:26,336
Your boss

2241
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:27,104
Upset you

2242
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:31,712
I just wanted to cover an article and respond to Staples

2243
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:32,736
Did you get

2244
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:34,272
Good feedback from

2245
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:36,320
Alex Jones after this did he say hey

2246
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:37,856
You good

2247
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:39,136
I have no idea

2248
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:41,184
I doubt there was any feed

2249
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:45,536
The bomber has your dad ever said good job son

2250
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:49,376
That's a bummer

2251
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:55,776
Situation where it's like you have just been shown evidence that you lied

2252
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:59,360
Is material that has to do with like

2253
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:00,384
You

2254
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:01,920
Or calling out

2255
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:08,320
Someone whose mother died at Sandy Hook tour and part of your rationale for that is hey Wolfgang halbig

2256
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:10,624
Big is great but I've never heard of the guy

2257
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,184
But the

2258
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:19,840
Video to show you know correct yourself probably

2259
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:26,240
Obviously if I've never heard of Wolfgang halbig I'm sure that later on you'll see that I've never heard

2260
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:29,824
Loaded him on are you should probably correct

2261
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:30,592
Or not

2262
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:32,384
What reporting

2263
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:34,688
Wolfgang how big do the

2264
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:38,016
How did he beat

2265
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:40,064
In your opinion

2266
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:41,600
I would say

2267
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:43,392
I misspoke in that

2268
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:45,952
Video or as I said earlier

2269
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:50,048
It was just the only name that I've ever heard associated with Sandy Hook

2270
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:53,376
When was the you saw this video

2271
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:54,400
A couple weeks ago

2272
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:56,448
About a month ago

2273
02:04:56,704 --> 02:05:00,288
Okay in the last month have you gone on Aaron clarified all of your audience

2274
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,312
Do you wrong

2275
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:02,848
Cuz now he's got a second

2276
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:06,176
I don't want to touch anything Sandy Hook with it

2277
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:07,712
3000

2278
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:08,992
Million football

2279
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:12,320
I really on time and I understand

2280
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:14,624
Impulse right but I also think

2281
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,392
That

2282
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:22,048
If you if you're someone like oh and you have to recognize like this makes your credibility look really bad

2283
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:29,728
The families probably would only think it appositive if you would go on air and directly ask

2284
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,264
Address that you made a mistake

2285
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:38,176
I just think that this is cowardly kind of perspective bill doesn't understand

2286
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:44,576
Alright is that standard operating procedure for Infowars okay he's too

2287
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:46,624
To never be wrong

2288
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:53,024
Always lie and never ever apologize and yesterday didn't really happen

2289
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:54,816
I don't even know what yesterday means

2290
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:59,168
I got the Feeling watching this that Owen is starting to get pissed

2291
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:01,472
I would imagine so

2292
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:04,288
Alex

2293
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:05,312
And they say that

2294
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:08,384
He doesn't know what really

2295
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:09,664
At Sandy Hook

2296
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:10,944
And they do

2297
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:12,224
The official story

2298
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,248
Has more holes

2299
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:15,552
So again

2300
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,344
What holes are you talkin about

2301
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:20,416
Okay then why are you talking on there

2302
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:22,720
Cuz I'm covering a story

2303
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,768
You're defending your boss

2304
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:25,792
Because

2305
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:27,328
Someone said he said this

2306
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,608
But all he said was

2307
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:30,400
That's all he said

2308
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:31,680
What did he say

2309
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:32,704
I don't know

2310
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:37,312
Prior to going on air did you do bunch of research

2311
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:38,336
Fact-checking

2312
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:39,104
No

2313
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,152
Okay you just took somebody else's article

2314
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,432
When on Aaron started.

2315
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:45,248
Yes, your modus operandi

2316
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:49,344
Now but that's the case in this

2317
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:51,648
And that was also the case in

2318
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:52,672
Last video

2319
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:54,720
Right

2320
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:59,584
Got those kids

2321
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:00,608
Same thing

2322
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:01,888
True

2323
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:04,192
I've answered the question

2324
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:10,592
Where was that

2325
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:16,992
Earlier man recognition that you should not answer

2326
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:22,624
Lising I am losing by the end of the little bit of Bud here little beep

2327
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:26,208
Has if you ever heard the phrase in over your head

2328
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:27,232
Yeah okay

2329
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:32,096
In the in the suit thorax do you know where an angler fishes in the ocean

2330
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:39,520
That's about how it over my head I help you but turns out just promote Wolfgang halbig

2331
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:44,384
I'm asking conservatives

2332
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,432
Join me

2333
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:49,760
Alex Jones

2334
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:56,672
Pure

2335
02:07:56,928 --> 02:07:57,952
On his show

2336
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:58,976
Again I would

2337
02:07:59,232 --> 02:07:59,744
Say you need

2338
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:01,536
Wolfgang

2339
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:04,352
Is 16 +

2340
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:05,632
But again

2341
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:10,496
Where Wolfgang halbig 16 questions

2342
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:11,520
I don't know

2343
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:13,568
Why were they so important to you in this video you mentioned

2344
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:16,128
I think it was more of a matter of

2345
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:21,504
From my perspective Alex Jones was catching all this flag for Sandy Hook but the other

2346
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:23,552
People that were questioning it weren't

2347
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:24,576
To my best knowledge

2348
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,112
Who who do you mean

2349
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:27,904
Wolfgang halbig

2350
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:34,304
It's f****** Brazen Amazing Alex should be taking all the Heat

2351
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:41,728
And where you decided to express that is telling a woman who lost her mother in a horrific shooting lied about a bunch time

2352
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:51,712
That doesn't sound like a takedown and how big and this comes from the same video where island called how big the best reporter

2353
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:58,112
He's clearly saying that Lafferty needs to answer how big's questions because he thinks she can't write

2354
02:08:58,368 --> 02:09:04,512
Meaning behind what Owen is saying is he believes that if Lafferty were forced to answer those questions could be proven to be a hoe

2355
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:10,400
Oaks pretending that this is an anyway critical of Wolfgang is the most cowardly dazhou encabo here

2356
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:12,448
You expect better from a cuck Slayer

2357
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:18,848
Yeah you died the Cox late or you live long enough to see yourself become a cock on the road that's what's going on here

2358
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:21,408
I I mean

2359
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:28,064
It is it is so sad I just want I just want to sit down and just be like listen

2360
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:31,904
I know how Infowars actually works

2361
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:34,208
The questions that I am asking you

2362
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:34,976
AR

2363
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:38,560
Just either to tell me if you know how it was actually works

2364
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:44,960
Or to tell me how you're lying about how it was actually works there was no outcome where you get away

2365
02:09:45,216 --> 02:09:47,264
This is it this is over

2366
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:53,920
Yeah if a conversation or traffic Metroid

2367
02:09:54,176 --> 02:10:00,320
Come on dude clip of you doing the thing

2368
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:04,416
How long are we going to do this dance I don't know

2369
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:05,952
Joann hours

2370
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:07,744
Tilapia

2371
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:10,560
For you lose

2372
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:12,352
I feel for whatever happened

2373
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:14,912
But I'm telling you Alex Jones

2374
02:10:16,448 --> 02:10:17,728
How big is not your enemy

2375
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,008
You still believe that

2376
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,288
Wolfgang halbig

2377
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:27,200
I don't know enough about walking out big tits

2378
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:30,272
I never know

2379
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:32,320
Alright f*** you b****

2380
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,160

Stark

2382
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:41,536
I never knew enough and yet I am

2383
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:44,608
Using him as a prop to attack

2384
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:46,656
Woman who lost her mother

2385
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:48,960
Just Google is s***

2386
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:51,008
Here's a little bit more video

2387
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:51,776
I asked you

2388
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,080

Today

2393
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:04,576
Infowars.com

2394
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,368
How do you think

2395
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:10,208
Action form

2396
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:12,000
I don't know

2397
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,584
If you could redo this

2398
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:19,936
I just wouldn't do the video doll

2399
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:20,704
Why

2400
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:23,264
Because it's now being used against me

2401
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:28,128
Is that why that's that's that's real

2402
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:31,712
See that's one of those things where your answer is

2403
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,992
Way worse zip

2404
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:35,552
And also not for nothing

2405
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:39,136
We got the shooters name wrong he's at dylann roof sealing roof yeah

2406
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:42,976

02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,584

Yeah

2411
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:53,728
So the question comes up of hey man what shootings

2412
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:58,336
Has Infowars not thought was a hoax or a false flag

2413
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:03,456
Okay if I'm Owen and I get this question my immediate responses

2414
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:08,064
I don't have any examples for you and then we just call it right cuz that's where we're going to go

2415
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,344
I mean eventually

2416
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:11,648
Can you think of a mass shooting

2417
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:14,464
Infowars

2418
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:15,744
Did not

2419
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:17,280
False flag

2420
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:18,816
And or a

2421
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:22,400
Yeah there was just wanted a high school

2422
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:23,680
And I Michigan this week

2423
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:30,592
Prior to

2424
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:32,640
Actually

2425
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:34,176
Prior to this lawsuit about

2426
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:41,856
Because

2427
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:43,136
Columbine

2428
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,232
Brainwash

2429
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:48,768
The government branch

2430
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:51,840
Boston bombing

2431
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:55,168
Gabrielle Giffords shooting

2432
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,448
Parkland shooter

2433
02:12:57,216 --> 02:12:57,728
Aurora

2434
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:00,288
Sutherland Springs Church shooting

2435
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:01,568
El Paso

2436
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:02,592
911

2437
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:03,872
Oklahoma City

2438
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:04,896
San Bernardino

2439
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:05,920
Oh

2440
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:07,456
False flag

2441
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:11,296
All claimed by

2442
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:14,880
Earlier when I asked you if you

2443
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:15,904
You thought Infowars

2444
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:16,928
Spira C3

2445
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:21,792
Now that I just went

2446
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:23,840
Still holding on to that

2447
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:27,936
There's way too much to unpack there

2448
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:29,216
To make a broad statement

2449
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:31,776
20 different events

2450
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:33,568
Make a blanket

2451
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:36,128
Statement of conspiracy theory I gave you all 20 of them

2452
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:38,176
However many

2453
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:39,712
Which one of them was a

2454
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:40,736
Was a hoax

2455
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:42,528
Which one of them was a

2456
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:43,552
False flag

2457
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:44,576
You tell me

2458
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:45,856
I have no

2459
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:50,464
I didn't say that either

2460
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:56,864
You can't you can't nobody you can't you can't say any because if you do those follow-up question

2461
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:03,264
You just can't handle this

2462
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:08,384
Trey or claims that any of them were actually hopes as an Infowars called all of the pokes

2463
02:14:09,152 --> 02:14:11,968
That makes you a conspiracy site doesn't it

2464
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:13,760
Every single one

2465
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:15,808
Is

2466
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:21,184
Labeled a hoax and or false flag

2467
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:22,464
Immediately

2468
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,000
MyInfo

2469
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:26,048
The day up

2470
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:27,072
Every single one that I

2471
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:31,424
I mean I'm

2472
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,704
I'm facing

2473
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:34,752
An answer off of

2474
02:14:35,008 --> 02:14:36,032
An assumption that you're being

2475
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:39,104
Completely honest I don't know what you're talkin about what events did I cover

2476
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,640
Of those events that you listed

2477
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:43,456
So here's the thing

2478
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:44,736
You didn't cover

2479
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,272
But

2480
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:47,040
You did say

2481
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,064
The Infowars

2482
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,344
Not a conspiracy

2483
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:52,416
So if their website

2484
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:55,232
Labels all of these

2485
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:56,512
Events

2486
02:14:56,768 --> 02:14:58,304
Has false Flags Endor

2487
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:00,608
Government cover-up

2488
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:02,912
Hoaxes

2489
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:05,216
And none of them

2490
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:07,008
What does that

2491
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:10,848
Meropenem

2492
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:12,640
I'm asking what's Europe

2493
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:14,944
Section 4

2494
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:24,160
Yeah I don't answer that figure this out 3 hours in

2495
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:30,560
You starting to look pissed off it just felt like yeah you're going to have to almost like a switch kind of flipped

2496
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:34,656
Like I got a clam up about something

2497
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:35,424
Clips

2498
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:41,824
Revelation of like completely trapped myself here I can't say anything else

2499
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:46,944
It's probably going to be a trap

2500
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:47,712
I mean

2501
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:52,064
I would be shook too if I was in that position I mean

2502
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:55,136
I guess points for getting there

2503
02:15:55,392 --> 02:16:01,536
But you should have gotten their way earlier might have taken three and a half hours but

2504
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:02,560
God

2505
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:08,192
So there's that there's a culture it Infowars that is of a certain character

2506
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:10,496
Now how much

2507
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:15,872
Anyone is aware of what the other people there believe is a matter of debate

2508
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:20,736
There's some information about some of Boeing's coworkers

2509
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:25,856
Is brought up stuff

2510
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:26,880
Michael Zimmerman

2511
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:27,904
Do you know who he is

2512
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:29,696
Yes Susie where you friends with her

2513
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:32,256
I would say we're friends but

2514
02:16:32,512 --> 02:16:34,048
I mean we don't hang out about that often

2515
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:36,608
But you friend someone

2516
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:39,936
Professional in Paradise Salon in public I go say hello

2517
02:16:40,704 --> 02:16:42,240
He seemed like a good guy

2518
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:45,568
Supposed to be come up there

2519
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:48,640
Shockingly

2520
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:53,504
Wood

2521
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:57,344
Has he ever shared any of his

2522
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:59,136
Opinions or views on mass shooting

2523
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:01,184
Not that I can recall

2524
02:17:03,488 --> 02:17:06,304
Were you aware that

2525
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:10,400
Christchurch

2526
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:11,936

2528
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:18,592
Brandon Tarrant

2529
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:20,128
Was the shooter exq

2530
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:21,408
Bunch of Muslims

2531
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:23,712
Something

2532
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,504
Yeah you're refreshing

2533
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:27,296
Details of the event

2534
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:28,064
Army right now

2535
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:33,952
Do you know whether or not anyone had Infowars

2536
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:34,976
Claimed it was a

2537
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:40,864

2538
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:42,656
Some individuals and Infowars

02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:43,424
Light

2540
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,192
That shooting

2541
02:17:46,752 --> 02:17:47,520
Did you know

2542
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:52,640
You understand that Michael Zimmerman handles the it stuff

2543
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:55,456
Directions

2544
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:59,040
I know that he

2545
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:03,136
Was doing it I'm not sure if that is still his role

2546
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:05,696
Did you know that on March 14th

2547
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:07,232
2019

2548
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,560
Mr. Zimmerman registered the domain

2550
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:16,960
Did you know that he registered the website

2551
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:18,240

2553
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,032
No

2554
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:21,312
Did you know

2555
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:22,848
You know Timothy Thrift

2556
02:18:23,872 --> 02:18:24,384
Yes

2557
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:25,664
Do you have a person relation

2558
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:27,712
Work acquaintance

2559
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:31,296
Did you know that he registered the website

St

2561
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:32,832
Tarrant

2562
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:35,904
The shooter

2563
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:37,440
No

2564
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:40,000
How do you feel

2565
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:41,536
About

2566
02:18:41,792 --> 02:18:44,608
The people that you work with who you have somewhat of a personal relationship

2567
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:46,400
Registering these taco

2568
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:47,424
Websites

2569
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:48,192
Immediately

2570
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:50,496
Live streaming

2571
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,288
3 surprise

2572
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:57,152
He was pretty surprised but he also says I'm not going to bring it up to them I

2573
02:18:57,664 --> 02:19:03,808
What are we going to do I'm going to be mad at all

2574
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:10,208
I think if I found out that A co-worker had registered

2575
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:12,512
I'll probably quit

2576
02:19:12,768 --> 02:19:16,352
All because it also is that an intersecting datapoint

2577
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:22,496
With someone who has been on much lately but was a pretty regular Infowars guess

2578
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:28,896
Vox day would call Brandon Tara getting parent

2579
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:30,432
Of Andrews breath

2580
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:32,480
I and I think

2581
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:36,576
I think that these kinds of intersections these kinds of

2582
02:19:36,832 --> 02:19:42,720
Like with suspicious that everyone seems to that you scratch under the surface and there's he's

2583
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:44,000
Weird

2584
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:46,048
Semen is seeming to like

2585
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:51,680
White nationalist violence and murder

2586
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:55,008
You ever noticed how many of your friends are Nazis

2587
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:59,104
Like but have you ever talk to him about it I want to talk to him okay

2588
02:19:59,360 --> 02:19:59,872
But like

2589
02:20:00,128 --> 02:20:06,272
If you're at a real talk to about it then I met you don't have to okay okay

2590
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:12,672
Talk to him about it and then you guys go to a rally together right and it's all of their friends

2591
02:20:12,928 --> 02:20:14,208
Okay

2592
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:15,232
Okay

2593
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,280
But you like them right

2594
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:23,680
Well I love the other ideas are all wearing Nazi armbands

2595
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:30,080
It's the season okay well convinced it's troubling I mean like obviously

2596
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:32,896
Responsibility to know everything that you're

2597
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:39,296
Coworkers do or anything like that I've had some co-workers that I've had some suspicions about you were

2598
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:45,696
Somebody came to me and confirm some of those suspicions I would have disassociated myself

2599
02:20:45,952 --> 02:20:52,096
Around that whether it's like maybe another office or something like that nothing

2600
02:20:52,352 --> 02:20:52,864
To do

2601
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:54,400
With those folks

2602
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:55,936
And if it's something like

2603
02:20:56,704 --> 02:21:00,544
A place that does deny mass shootings at did

2604
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,360
Christchurch shooting was a false flag

2605
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:07,200
And you have multiple people who work there who are

2606
02:21:07,456 --> 02:21:13,600
Creating websites intended to maybe make something

2607
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:24,608
I understand that what you want you can't make 100,000 anywhere else but you can make a fine living

2608
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:27,936
I don't know helping Nazi so be good

2609
02:21:28,448 --> 02:21:33,056
So we only have a couple more clips left and one of them is a question about

2610
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:36,384
Did you know that you didn't answer discovery

2611
02:21:37,152 --> 02:21:39,712
And so this is all going to be exhibit 30

2612
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:41,248
And it's

2613
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:43,040
One large document

2614
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:44,320
Starting his first day

2615
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:48,160
Which is a signed order

2616
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:50,720
By the judge back in 2018

2617
02:21:52,256 --> 02:21:53,280
And it is

2618
02:21:55,584 --> 02:21:56,608
Order discovery

2619
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:58,144
By the judge

2620
02:21:59,168 --> 02:21:59,680
To defend

2621
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:04,032
And this is the Discovery ordered

2622
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:05,312
And that's your name right

2623
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:07,104
Said that was

2624
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,384
Ordered by the judge

2625
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:10,432
For you to answer these requests

2626
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:11,712
Directly to

2627
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:15,808
And if we go to the request for production

2628
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:27,840
We see the request for production one

2629
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:30,400
Can you read with that set-up

2630
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:35,776
All Communications including letters

2631
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:41,408
Miranda emails text messages instant messenger logs or other Electronic Communications in which the following

2632
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:43,456
The follow topics our reference

2633
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:47,296
Neil heslin Waterstone dr. Wayne Carver zerohedge Jim Fetzer

2634
02:22:50,368 --> 02:22:54,720
To this end I was ordered by the court that wasn't just sent by us he was sent by us

2635
02:22:55,232 --> 02:22:57,792
Not answered and then brought to the court of the court order

2636
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,072
You

2637
02:22:59,584 --> 02:23:01,120
To do that production

2638
02:23:02,656 --> 02:23:03,168
Okay

2639
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:04,960
To this day you have naughty

2640
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:08,032
As we sit here

2641
02:23:10,336 --> 02:23:10,848
And

2642
02:23:16,992 --> 02:23:17,504
Correct

2643
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:19,808
I was I was unaware of the

2644
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:21,856
And

2645
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:24,416
You would agree that some of the

2646
02:23:25,184 --> 02:23:28,000
This one of the exhibits that we've gone through today

2647
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:29,024
Wood

2648
02:23:29,536 --> 02:23:30,560
Be considered

2649
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:32,096
Communications

2650
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:34,912
About

2651
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:37,472
Carver

2652
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:39,520
Neil heslin our son

2653
02:23:40,032 --> 02:23:40,800
Zerohedge

2654
02:23:41,824 --> 02:23:42,336
Correct

2655
02:23:42,848 --> 02:23:43,360
Yes

2656
02:23:45,152 --> 02:23:46,688
You did not produce any of that

2657
02:23:46,944 --> 02:23:47,456
We have to go

2658
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:53,344
I like I said this is the first

2659
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:55,136
Even been brought to my attention

2660
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:59,232
In the other case as soon as this request was presented to me I produced everything

2661
02:24:00,512 --> 02:24:05,120
So we have this situation where you needed to do this

2662
02:24:05,376 --> 02:24:06,656
In addition to do I have

2663
02:24:06,912 --> 02:24:13,056
The Orioles where he said that the lawyer sat on this thing for a month right conceivably might be

2664
02:24:13,312 --> 02:24:15,104
Uno's

2665
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:19,456
Answer this leads to Bill making a suggestion that

2666
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:21,760
Is a little bit too unconventional

2667
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:24,320
I understand the Mysteries represents you

2668
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:25,856
And I am

2669
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:27,136
This next question

2670
02:24:27,648 --> 02:24:28,160
No way

2671
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:31,744
Because our

2672
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:33,536
The best

2673
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:37,888
But

2674
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:38,656
When I

2675
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:40,448
When we look into your net

2676
02:24:41,984 --> 02:24:44,032
I want to know whether or not you have

2677
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:44,800
Disgust

2678
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:45,824
Wauconda Plata

2679
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:47,616
Not with Mysteries

2680
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:48,640
Anybody else

2681
02:24:51,712 --> 02:24:52,480
Legal malpractice

2682
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:54,528
Lawsuits against

2683
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:55,296
Park Council

2684
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,856
Multiple failures

2685
02:24:58,112 --> 02:24:58,624
Over the course of

2686
02:24:58,880 --> 02:24:59,392
3 years

2687
02:24:59,904 --> 02:25:00,416
Duke

2688
02:25:01,184 --> 02:25:01,952
Entertain

2689
02:25:02,208 --> 02:25:03,232
Responsive discovery

2690
02:25:03,744 --> 02:25:04,768
To the point where

2691
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:06,048
You haven't sanction

2692
02:25:06,816 --> 02:25:07,328
The default judgement

2693
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:09,888
Can you just

2694
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:11,936
Simplify that for me so I can

2695
02:25:12,192 --> 02:25:13,984
After you discuss or

2696
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:14,752
Clayton suing you

2697
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:16,800
Because they

2698
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:21,920
Did not tell you any of this it come to them that you were ordered by the judge

2699
02:25:22,432 --> 02:25:22,944
Answer

2700
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,480
And because of that along with

2701
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:25,504
Anaconda.

2702
02:25:27,808 --> 02:25:28,832
Fraction form

2703
02:25:29,088 --> 02:25:31,648
I have not had any discussions about that now

2704
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:36,256
I will say this

2705
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:38,304
Fiction

2706
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:41,888
And the reason I say that is because

2707
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:43,936
The claims are an asset

2708
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:46,752
At some point

2709
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:49,056
The baskets

2710
02:25:49,312 --> 02:25:49,824
Probably going to be

2711
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:50,592
Evaluating

2712
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,432
Because

2713
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:58,272
I'm sure you've had conversations to an extent

2714
02:25:58,528 --> 02:25:59,296
With your lawyers butt

2715
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:03,392
I will say this are you aware that as this case dance right now

2716
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:04,416
The judge has taken

2717
02:26:04,928 --> 02:26:05,440
Any ability

2718
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,792
I understand that now

2719
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:12,864
And cereal

2720
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:15,936
Foley from

2721
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:17,216
Whatsoever

2722
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:18,496
If we could please

2723
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:20,032
Make sure we're clear on the record there

2724
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:21,824
Malpractice

2725
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:25,920
That's

2726
02:26:26,944 --> 02:26:27,456
Between Hawk

2727
02:26:27,968 --> 02:26:31,040
So this is a pretty wild thing here

2728
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:34,112
Recommended do you sue your prior lawyers

2729
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:40,512
Also there's a there's a two prong thing here the first is that there's like this isn't all your fault you got

2730
02:26:40,768 --> 02:26:41,792
F***** by these lawyers

2731
02:26:42,048 --> 02:26:43,328
Second thing is

2732
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:50,240
If you do so your lawyer's that's an asset that's collectible money whatever you will give her

2733
02:26:50,496 --> 02:26:51,008
Lawyers

2734
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:57,408
Should be assessed to be possibly given to the people who are awarded a judgement against you

2735
02:26:57,664 --> 02:26:59,712
I feel like Bill is saying real quick

2736
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:00,736
Like pet

2737
02:27:01,504 --> 02:27:02,272
If you think

2738
02:27:02,528 --> 02:27:04,064
After this is done

2739
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:07,648
You can then go to your lawyers to get some of your money back

2740
02:27:07,904 --> 02:27:09,696
We are going to take that money to

2741
02:27:09,952 --> 02:27:16,096
Yes all of this money all of yours is now mine this is not going to be something where you can

2742
02:27:16,352 --> 02:27:17,632
Make yourself

2743
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:19,936
Richer after the fact

2744
02:27:20,192 --> 02:27:26,336
This will beat this will be a piece of whatever your assets are that are

2745
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:28,640
In this case here's what blows my mind

2746
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:29,664
Okay

2747
02:27:30,432 --> 02:27:31,200
They know weeks

2748
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:34,528
So

2749
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:40,672
The only thing that makes sense to me is we have episodes

2750
02:27:40,928 --> 02:27:42,208
Where we critique

2751
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,744
Depositions

2752
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,304
Essentially we gave them free coaching

2753
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:52,704
All they had to do was listen to us s*** talk them I'm take our advice

2754
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:59,104
Free lawyers

2755
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:05,504
I don't know if it's the ones that I was at Brad was the lawyer the hills was another lawyer

2756
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:11,904
Just once Brad thinks some of the other ones

2757
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:18,304
Periodic different lawyers

2758
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:24,704
But yeah it's free to bring this sort of

2759
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:30,848
Deadland fish anytime

2760
02:28:31,104 --> 02:28:37,248
Amazing I think like genuinely this is shocking don't we don't

2761
02:28:37,504 --> 02:28:43,648
Show me know all that much about law or legal advice Kobe to know about unforced errors you keep committed

2762
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:50,560
Shut up or come up with a better answer

2763
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:51,584
Silly

2764
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:57,472
Who's one last trip here to Dismount and it's a question of whether or not Owen feels remorse for what he's done

2765
02:28:57,984 --> 02:28:58,752
Last question

2766
02:28:59,264 --> 02:29:00,544
You have any remorse

2767
02:29:01,312 --> 02:29:01,824
Or

2768
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:03,872
Any of

2769
02:29:04,128 --> 02:29:06,176
The contributions you made

2770
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:06,944
Chords

2771
02:29:07,456 --> 02:29:07,968
Impact

2772
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:08,992
Mister Haslam

2773
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:10,272
Reporting that you

2774
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:13,856
I would say I do

2775
02:29:14,368 --> 02:29:17,696
I would say that I wish I never commented on any of it

2776
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:21,024
I would say that I wish I understood

2777
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:22,304
Whatever

2778
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:25,888
Recording mr. how big was doing at the time better

2779
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:27,168
Before referencing him

2780
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:29,216
And so

2781
02:29:29,728 --> 02:29:33,568
My my one regret is that I should have never even covered it never should have talked about it

2782
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,360
And having said that

2783
02:29:37,664 --> 02:29:38,176
I'm just a

2784
02:29:38,432 --> 02:29:40,736
Not to be redundant but I think it Bears repeating

2785
02:29:41,248 --> 02:29:42,784
I never said anyting

2786
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:49,184
About mr. Hazlet being a liar I never said anything about his son not dying I never said anything about Sandy Hook Sandy Hook being a hoax

2787
02:29:49,952 --> 02:29:53,024
I never had any intention of any ill-will towards

2788
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:54,816
Mr heslin anyting

2789
02:29:55,072 --> 02:30:01,216
If I had thought that there would have been such consequence 28 minutes of my career on air because

2790
02:30:01,728 --> 02:30:03,776
These videos and I would have not done it

2791
02:30:04,288 --> 02:30:05,056
Absolutely

2792
02:30:06,336 --> 02:30:06,848
Appreciate

2793
02:30:07,872 --> 02:30:14,016
This is interesting for me because obviously there is an expression of him saying yes I have remorse

2794
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:20,416
At the same time with the explanation of the remorse has to do with consequences that have been visited upon him

2795
02:30:20,672 --> 02:30:23,488
As opposed to it was wrong to do this

2796
02:30:23,744 --> 02:30:29,888
It's it wrong to put someone that treat someone like this essentially even if

2797
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:34,240
Abstract idea to you

2798
02:30:34,496 --> 02:30:36,544
Like a person in his life but

2799
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:40,640
Not considering the possible ramifications of your

2800
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:44,224
Blatantly irresponsible and bulshit coverage

2801
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:46,016
Also very very

2802
02:30:46,272 --> 02:30:52,416
Series Intermatic and not to mention Miss Lafferty's

2803
02:30:52,672 --> 02:30:55,744
Respectful coverage of a situation

2804
02:30:56,256 --> 02:31:02,400
I think I don't know if it's an inability or an unwillingness to accept responsibility

2805
02:31:02,656 --> 02:31:04,960
Beyond the level of this was wrong to do

2806
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:11,360
But I find that distasteful that these could only understand wrongdoing through consequence

2807
02:31:11,616 --> 02:31:13,664
Is a guy saying I regret being caught

2808
02:31:14,176 --> 02:31:20,320
I listen I stole all of her money I love stealing it I get to keep it and I regret you catching Maybe

2809
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:26,720
Because now I feel like I'm going to lose it and I would really like to keep that person's money that is not mine if I'd known there was a

2810
02:31:26,976 --> 02:31:33,120
The punishment for the shity behavior that I engaged

2811
02:31:33,376 --> 02:31:39,008
Never thought there was a possibility that this would come back to haunt me I probably wouldn't have done it

2812
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:45,408
I mean Solutions on being a responsible adult it's just it's just so much like listen if I had

2813
02:31:45,664 --> 02:31:50,784
I'm going to work for Infowars where they told me this s*** was fine then I probably wouldn't be doing it

2814
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:54,880
What education do I have I'm a moron

2815
02:31:55,392 --> 02:32:01,536
You work for that AM station we are we reach the end of this and I'm exhausted

2816
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:06,400
But I think we learned a lot I think we did but I think we really

2817
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:12,800
Learned a good bit about the inner workings of multiple facets of Infowars show

2818
02:32:13,056 --> 02:32:17,920
Enforced of it that these people are s******* scam they just don't know what to do and can't defend themselves

2819
02:32:18,176 --> 02:32:21,248
Without making things worse can't take the help

2820
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:22,528
From people

2821
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:28,928
Who hates up to do a podcast

2822
02:32:29,184 --> 02:32:35,328
They know who we are doesn't mean listen to every episode

2823
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:38,656
Listen to anything but if you've got a deposition

2824
02:32:38,912 --> 02:32:40,448
I mean it might behoove you

2825
02:32:40,704 --> 02:32:43,008
Next time

2826
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:44,544
Jordan

2827
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:58,368
Emilio Emilio

2828
02:32:58,624 --> 02:33:01,440
I'm dcx clerk I'm

2829
02:33:01,696 --> 02:33:04,000
Sure

2830
02:33:04,256 --> 02:33:08,608
And now here comes the sex robot
