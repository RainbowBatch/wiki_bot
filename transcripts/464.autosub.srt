1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important I'm sweating

00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect with knowledge like I'm sick of them posing

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,304
It's around a little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
IMDb

7
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
Jordan Jordan

8
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
What's up

9
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Potato chip

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,728
Later

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,776
Well you know I'm a

12
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,568
Do flavors like

13
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:22,688
Find a couple of new varieties

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,064
I bought two flavors York Pizza

15
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
Mostly out of fear

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
Smart is it thinner than the Chicago

17
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
It's a smaller bag

18
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:41,888
Nashville hot chicken flavor

19
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
Shockingly accurate

20
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,496
Read are you similar

21
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
It kind

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
Freaks me out

23
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
I don't like it

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
Utug

25
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Like I did

26
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,272
I did it first and then I ate more

27
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
It's too much

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
Too much as a

29
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
But I still

30
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,928
Reconsider to Bryce because I admire the

31
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
Accuracy of the

32
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,024
The flavor and swing for it

33
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Pizza one

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
But

35
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,168
Good job ladies

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192

00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:31,296
For me and my bright spot is I got to spend a little time with my family today and

40
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,904
We went to a place where it's like it's like

41
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,416
And it's alright

50
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,000

72
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,207
I have a lot of thoughts about your Manifesto

73
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
Saving for a party

74
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,143
Alright

PC2

76
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
You are now a technocrat

77
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
Alicia are thinking about

78
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
Money off at heroin

79
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
So good

80
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
Is freakishly large

81
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
Would be wondering

82
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Take that

83
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
Generosity

84
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Put it in a bin.

85
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Walk on over to your nearest

86
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
Charity Outpost

87
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:56,095
Glacier over there drop that bindle and give people some Goodwill

88
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:04,031
I think that's a great great way to go I like it although I was distracted because

89
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,615
I can't think of a friend of mine from Missouri who described

90
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,687
Hozier

91
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
Bohemian types

92
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
Kindling official

93
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
No that's not bad

94
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,439
That is a great ride.

95
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
I like it

96
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,815
We're going to be getting into

97
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,863
Business Alex's declaring

98
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,007
Being on Sunday

99
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Did not happen

100
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
But I thought

101
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
Do we do something we don't do very often

102
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
His follow-up on some other stories

103
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
But Alex has recently reported.

104
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
Completely Ross I like this

105
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:56,255
Are you looking might be some value in beginning this episode on past week or so

106
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
Completely unfounded assertions about

107
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,375
We just turned out to be complete nonsense okay

108
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
The first story I'm going to check in on

109
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Was the Twitter hack

110
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,847
We're verified Elon Musk

111
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
I never used to run a Bitcoin

112
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Scam

113
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,455
July 17th

114
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
Alex covered the story

115
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
And this is how he presented

116
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
Campbell just a cover

117
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,263
What's going on

118
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
It's

119
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,383
Patriots inside us intelligence agencies

120
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,759
On July 31st nbca out of Tampa reported on the arrest of a seventeen-year-old

121
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
Floridian dude named Graham Clark

122
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Who is accused of masterminding the Hat

123
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,207
The charges he's facing include

124
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,511
Fraud

125
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:06,911
Fraud one count of fraudulent use of personal information with over $100,000 or 30 or more

126
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
Dumb

127
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
Fraudulent use of personal information

128
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Access to computer

129
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Or electronic device of that Authority

130
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
So what did he do wrong

131
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,967
Work was one of three suspected individuals in Mesquite

132
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,575
New year old named Nima fazeli AKA Rolex

133
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,903
Nineteen-year-old from the United Kingdom

134
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Alright I'm on there

135
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
Team so far this article

136
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,071
A big deal of their aliases

137
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
Arrest affidavit clams

138
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:42,751
To get access to these Twitter account to a Twitter employee

139
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
Feel like there's a

140
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Who committed the crime

141
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
Court used social engineering

142
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:55,039
Convince a Twitter employee

143
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Access because

144
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Customer service

145
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
Squirtle

146
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
From the appearances of the information

147
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
And it's come out

148
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
About this

149
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,279
Navigation so far it looks like an almost impressively simple

150
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,095
What's the think actually worked

151
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,679
There's no evidence to support Alex's fabricated coverage of the story

152
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,751
But honestly the other stories lied about is much worse

153
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Okay

154
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
On July 25th

155
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,615
Protester Garrett Foster was shot and killed in

156
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
Alex's falsely reported on the story in order

157
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Justify Foster

158
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Killing

159
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
And that's awful

160
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,855
I think I want to focus on however is what Alex said on the July 30th show

161
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,415
About the identity of the person who shot Foster

162
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,487
They have armored vehicles going around

163
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,583
Stopping traffic in downtown Austin

164
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Was shot dead

165
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
Last weekend we pulled a gun on

166
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
Amanda's car while I got it blocked

167
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
Anime

168
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
We still don't know the man's name

169
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
Turn himself in to police and was released

170
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
White

171
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Doterra

172
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,159
Leasing information

173
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
Eastandard

174
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
Supremacist white nationalist commentator

175
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,607
Whenever there's a crime committed in the identity of the perpetrator is not an ounce

176
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
It's a default position for them

177
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
The perpetrator is

178
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,519
Person and that doesn't

179
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
The media wants to

180
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
This itself is a narrative

181
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
That these races to want to push

182
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,247
Namely that there's a cover-up of crimes being committed by minorities

183
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
Intentional plan to demonize white people

184
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
You see this all over the white identity

185
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,719
Never stop

186
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Why would you

187
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,071
On July 31st the man who shot Garrett Foster identified him

188
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
His name is Daniel

189
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
He is an act

190
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
Duty sergeant

191
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,959
In the US Army stationed at Fort Hood

192
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,311
He claims that he shot Foster in self-defense and that Foster pointed his rifle

193
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,431
Alex has made this claim but the evidence that I've seen provided doesn't seem to support this Ark

194
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Namely that he pointed his rifle

195
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,855
If that is the case he definitely shouldn't have done the argument of self-defense

196
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
Becomes a little bit murky

197
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
When prior to the alleged

198
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
You drove your

199
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Car into crowd

200
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
People

201
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
It could easily be argued

202
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
It seems to me that if

203
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Deadpoint is going to

204
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
The car that could be

205
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Self-defense and defense

206
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
The people who

207
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
Could have been run over

208
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:26,335
I don't think this case is as cut-and-dry as to hinge on whether or not Foster pointed his gun at the car

209
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
Is it that determines whether it was okay to

210
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,199
Shoot them or not

211
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
That makes perfect

212
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Even if

213
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
There were two

214
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
To be evidence

215
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
But he had his rifle raised

216
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
It justifies shooting him when

217
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,719
Once you already reached that point

218
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,535
You know if I was holding

219
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,583
And a car was barreling towards

220
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
Smith threw a bunch of other

221
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,983
I would probably throw the rifle away and

222
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Apologized

223
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
I don't know

224
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
I think I was in a

225
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
There be some more information

226
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
And we'll see if that's

227
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
Prepare

228
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
Deschutes roster

229
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,367
Prepared to drive into a crowd of protest

230
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
I do I just

231
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
Or show is about Alex and his coverage

232
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,567
He's a 33 year old white dude in the army

233
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,127
The speculation was completely

234
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,479
It's just a product editorial position

235
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
It's based in racism and white identity

236
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
It was more important

237
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Super Alex to push the nose

238
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,415
There's a cover-up

239
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,255
Then it was to deal with the story on its merits

240
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,887
It should be mentioned that Daniel Perry almost certainly only identified himself on Friday because

241
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
Certain protest communities online

242
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Figured out who he was

243
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
His name

244
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,847
It wasn't

245
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,711
Terry tried to delete his social media but people are already taking screenshots

246
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
But things like a bond

247
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
Intuit

248
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
Trumpet put out saying

249
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,623
Any protestors anarchist

250
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,951
Meditators Lueders are Oklahoma

251
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,791
Please understand you will not be treated like you has been in New York Seattle Mini Apple

252
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
It will be a much different scene

253
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,911
Tweet Perry reply quote

254
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,471
To Texas will show them why we say don't mess

255
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,079
There's some pretty strong indications

256
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
Violet inclination

257
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
In-store protesters

258
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
Question

259
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
I'm driving

260
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Into a March

261
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
The protesters

262
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,575
Information on this

263
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,599
Complete determination

264
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
But from the information I can find

265
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
It's hard to not feel like

266
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
This guy shouldn't be at least

267
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Tried

268
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,023
For murder

269
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Probably should

270
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
See the inside of a

271
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
Sound bad

272
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:04,287
Maybe he was just referencing

273
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
Litter

274
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:10,431
You know you was like as send all these protesters to Texas

275
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Maybe

276
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
Nevermind

277
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,951
Pretend that the shooter was he non-white persons

278
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
When in reality

279
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,327
The shooter was a white army Sergeant who seems to share some of the political beliefs

280
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
Espouses regularly

281
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
How to say I'm shocked

282
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
So we start here on the 31st

283
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
Which is Friday

284
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
And

285
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,359
You know how like

286
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
P****

287
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
If you're a band

288
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
And you have one head

289
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
You better open your

290
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
Michelle with that hat

291
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,135
Or open close

292
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
Alex has the same thing man

293
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:58,303
By the way

294
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
Do you want to hear

295
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Convenience

296
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,799
About how this Saturday

297
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
OverWatch snipers Oliver

298
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
But they're planning to shoot police

299
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,839
Citizens if anyone stops antifa major roads

300
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:40,031
So Alex at least got the story almost immediately after saying I'm having trouble getting

301
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,895
To be really into it

302
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Here's the news

303
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,759
Secret documents to set up roadblocks

304
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Some snipers in

305
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
And all this dick this weekend

306
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:57,183
As somebody who is here on Sunday I can tell you that on for

307
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
Fortunately Austin has

308
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Been taking over

309
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,631
Antifa is not

310
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
Sing about now

311
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,007
You would never know if you just listen to the 31st

312
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Short have to listen

313
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,615
But like dig into it

314
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:21,247
Forgo

315
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
What he's talking about

316
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Couldn't tell

317
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
You wouldn't be able to tell just

318
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
Apparently this weekend

319
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Plan

320
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
Is

321
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
It's going to take over

322
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,887
Six police station around the country

323
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:44,287
Border to border from seed

00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:50,687
Driving sea-level is control Democrats planning this weekend

325
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087

327
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847

What a warrant

331
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,087
This this this whole thing

332
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
The trick is that it's a it's a

333
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
The Parlour trick

334
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
Your card is

335
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,839
Reporting on this kind of news where it's like

336
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,143
Police stations this weekend

337
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:47,519
Deep inside sources

338
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:54,687
Sing that most rotors Revolution

339
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
Is that

340
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
It's also an actor

341
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Permission

342
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
Because

343
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:06,207
No matter what like the TV media that jerk-off to Violent protest that's what they want

344
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
Peaceful protest to the millions of

345
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
That happen all the time

346
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Violent protests

347
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
Cats are there

348
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
Portraying protest

349
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Violin

350
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
The Rake

351
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,495
Just propaganda is portraying and Eddie

352
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Protesters are violent

353
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,847
Protesters don't have

354
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
But you get permission

355
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Come up

356
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,295
So yeah there's that element to it

357
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,111
It's a trick

358
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
It isn't it isn't it

359
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
It's an absolute

360
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,511
There's nothing that can be done with the way Alex is reporting

361
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Exactly

362
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
No matter what

363
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,679
What happens the next day at the end of the weekend he has a narrative that he can move forward with

364
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Yep and that's

365
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Just

366
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
The dumb game

367
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Yeah

368
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
Okay nothing happens

369
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
I stopped yet

370
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
I told you

Completely honest

372
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:07,391
Related matters

373
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Or

374
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,535
Going to Nuke a city

375
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
How is Chicago.

376
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
Secret documents

377
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,287
Very scared

378
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
Cabg

379
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,503
Route to know about this

380
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,111
Watch already with Andy

381
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,159
Apartments in

382
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
Balconies

383
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255
Parking garages

384
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,583
Why is there Army Special Operations Command or something

385
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:52,447

Situation

401
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
Racist

402
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
Conspiracy to cover up

403
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,063
Crimes being done by non-white people

404
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,183
Racist rope that was really inappropriate turns out it was

405
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951

Defense argument cookies

410
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,191
White guy was in the Army and his right-wing beliefs

411
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
You know it's

412
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
To see Alex released

413
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,127
Supporting a member of the United States military murdering us

414
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:10,271
You know that wouldn't have done that I'm sure you would feel the same way

415
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,063
Right-wing beliefs

416
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
Probably

417
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:19,488
False

418
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
False flag event

419
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
Right now

420
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,728
Communist forces that

421
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056
In the soros-funded Democrat Party

422
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,128
Assaults on

Police stations in federal buildings tonight

424
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
Across the United States

425
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,552
And when the Austin Police

426
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,880

427
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
To the mayor's office

428
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,816
I've seen the photos I've seen

429
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
This is happening

430
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
Sure

431
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Didn't

432
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
Are you sure

433
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Yep

434
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,800
I do like the image of this cop like walk

435
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,360
Going into the mayor's office

436
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,712
You stare down these are our communist

437
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,760
Really imagine of kicking

438
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
You sir

Setting it on the desk

441
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
Don't mess with tech

442
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
Exit

443
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,264
The nonsense

444
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,312
So I guess I'll stop.

445
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Information

446
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:46,016
And apparently everyone else has got it to all the other media has gotten this

447
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:52,672
And the rest

448
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,072
Blown up in the official City Council

449
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Budget

450
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
The controlled demolition

451
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
As a symbol of stopping police

452
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,104
So I mean is there probably saying blow the police station

453
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,968
What do you think's going on so there's going to be a back to Blue

454

I don't overshadow this by showing up in a tank could call Alex

458
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448

461
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,896
Decided

462
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,968
With a controller

463
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
Tastes like soda

464
00:23:53,856 --> 00:24:00,000

Realizing

468
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
We talked about that

469
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
Episode

470
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824
Me too I get to Deep

471
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
Can do that again

472
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,944
Alex explains the cities that are going to

473
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Be targeted

474
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,272
5S antifa

475
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,808
Write all about

476
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,136
This is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country

477
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,720
Are you around the country here in Milwaukee

478
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,768

00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,656
Or you are in Los Angeles California

481
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
In Miami

482
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
Phoenix

483
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
These are some of the towns

484
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,688
Police station

485
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
Saturday night

486
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,928
Behaviorism future baby

487
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:07,840
Past performance is the most indicative of future Behavior

488
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
I mean

489
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
If Alex wants of the standard

490
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,984
Past behavior is indicative of future

491
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
Performance

492
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,128
Performance

493
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
Sloppy

494
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Pretty bad

495
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,992
Indicator of future

496
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
Station

497
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
He's burned down over the weekend

498
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,696
So that's actually kind of

499
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
This shows

500
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,792
How good Alex

501
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,864
Because like he not only stopped

502
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,168
The Takeover of Austin

503
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:50,080
Phoenix Countrywide Minneapolis

504
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,664
I think he probably meant

505
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
You stopped

506
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,784
All of the places from apprisen

507
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
I-41

508
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,392
Obviously

509
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
The communist

510
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,696
Soros / Gators

511
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,120
Influence in seven states

512
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
Embalming

513
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
Well done

514
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,264
Hibiscus is big

515
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Big narrative

516
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Forever

517
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
To figure out what

518
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
What he was talkin

519
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,128
About what

520
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
But

521
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,712
For now

522
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
Because on Friday was also an ounce

523
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,832
That's a lot of those deal and Maxwell documents we're going

524
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
How to be really nice

525
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:39,488
My big position on this that I want to really stress

526
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Is that

527
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,792
I don't respect

528
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
Alex is coverage of the eps

529
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,656
16 story and I refuse to dignify it with

530
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,448
Any actual discussion

531
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:54,080
Because I find what he does is Sodus tasteful and disgusting

532
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,896
And I don't care

533
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,920
What is the dictionary

534
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,224
It will never be valid

535
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
And it will never be

536
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
Any kind of

537
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
Information

538
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
Betty actual source

539
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,136
Could not provide for you

540
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
I'm just

541
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
I don't care

542
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
B

543
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,512
Leave it there is something

544
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
Thing that comes up

545
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
That is

546
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,864
It's a big swing

547
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
Is he still going with

548
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
Yes

549
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:25,824
Yeah right

550
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Alright whatever

551
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640

All of it

556
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
Golf Course

557
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,152
Obscene heated know ghislaine Maxwell arrested

558
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,736
Oh did it fly when we go to war with China

559
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,344
You really don't want Trump wishing you well

560
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,720
Wishing you well

561
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,424
Didn't Trump wish you well

562
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,264
Yeah Trump wish Alex and Rodger Stone both well yeah

563
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,336
Consistent

564
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,176
I love the idea that he's now trying to build into the narrative

565
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,016
Because he was

566
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
Confidential

567
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:44,416
Grizzly original outside Jeffrey Epstein

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
Papers

571
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
To get a

00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
Price

573
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,984
What else you want to claim that Trump

574
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
Why not just shoot

575
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,336
We never would have gone to the Moon if it weren't for

576
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:07,200
Trump when he was 18 years old

577
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,504

00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,160
Believe Steve on his b*******

580
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,488
Why not just believe the trumpet literally did everything

581
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,400
Comes into the studio

582
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
He's been working on

583
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
That is

584
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Pressing

Camp Dimock CDC stats

Robert Kardashian

589
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Haven

590
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
Get this information

591
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
Doctors Hospital

592
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,304
Found six months ago 5 months ago with true

593
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,376
They're counting on the flu deaths you name it in the same column

594
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,448
Problems here you have sensation to go over this

595
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,032
The Starchild Arizona with walk through this

596
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:08,384
So I walk through this to make some graphs

597
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,688
The show that flute

598
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
In a couple States

599
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
You sure these tracks

600
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,088
Flute

601
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
Covid death

602
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
Drawer

603
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,488
The Crux of this is that the grass appear to show that it's going down

604
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
We're going up

605
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
These graphs

606
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Approve

607
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,936
Also there's one essential problem with them but Alex staunchly refuses to address drowning

608
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
Might as well

609
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
Issue is that

610
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,592
Destiny States all go down around the same time

611
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
And that's because the grass show the

612
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,408
The end of flu season

613
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:47,040
Presented honestly

614
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Distributions from

615
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
Past years

616
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,624
We did end up revealing that the

617
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
Trajectory

618
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,208
Blue Datsun the 2019 2020 season is

619
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
Wheatley normal

620
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:00,352
You would expect to see flu deaths peeking around week 10 to 12-year

621
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
And then drop

622
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
From there which is what

623
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,680
You see in Alex's G

624
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,472
This is completely normal

625
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,544
Compared to past year are you saying that maybe the

626
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
Does cherry-picked information

627
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,640
Isn't that so

628
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
Pictures of wrong word

629
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,712
Misrepresented

630
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,296
Fraudulently presented drafts

631
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
Because that's the other

632
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
Big problem is there access

633
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:27,744
If you just take these grams to visually these lines might appear to match up

634
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
Really well

635
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
But when you look

636
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
The scale differences

637
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
Big problem comes

638
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,424
Take for instance there is a chart from Arizona

639
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
It appears to show they

640
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
Between weeks

641
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
12 + 6

642
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Speed of 20

643
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
20

644
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,432
And because of the scale of these lines they appear to

645
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,224
To track almost identical

646
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
Whatever

647
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
The lines are being misrepresented

648
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,368
In that timeframe the flu that's went from about

649
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
122

650
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,232
15 whereas the covid-19 rose 29

651
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,280
I don't know what that Rose tonight

652
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,352
From because there's also a hole in the line on the grass

653
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:09,216
Covid deaths

654
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:15,360
Okay great another issue but the numbers are so far off from being explanatory

655
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,176
Manipulated

656
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
Make it look like

657
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
Like 121 like

658
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,040
Is it the same as the fall

659
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,832
Statistical game

660
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
Yeah

661
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,648
This problem runs through all of their grass

662
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,256
They do this really dicey kind of game with data Miss representation

663
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,328
And the fact that they don't mention the flu deaths are going down

664
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
Has flu season

665
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
And the fact that they don't

666
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
Autograph of New York

667
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,472
The highest number of covid-19 deaths

668
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,008
That's during flu season

669
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:49,408
He's all combined to create a lot of issues that Alex needs to address before any of this could be taken seriously

670
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:53,760
Can covet itself sue for defamation

671
00:32:54,528 --> 00:33:00,160
Keep some respect on my name

672
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
Probably right

673
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
To remain anonymous

674
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,792
Doubting yourself is a person behind it

675
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Way to clear

676
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
How willing you are to

677
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,632
Create bulshit graphs

678
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,912
For money

679
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
Roberts first edition

680
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,336

681
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,640
Position

682

Grace

683
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Great stuff

684
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,528
Another Studio

685
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,320
After this is Rob.

686
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,136
Incompetently presents this information

687
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Holyshit

688
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,048
I mean we've heard it before he's been on in the past

689
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
Any he's not really

690
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,120
Nonsense

691
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
He

692
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
He's

693
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,448
Full of life

694
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
Alex

695
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Basically

696
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
Like you can

697
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,568
Deal Alex

698
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Becoming Envy

699
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Invigorated

700
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:58,016
Welcome back I'm Alex Jones your house del bigtree is a very renowned award-winning

701
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:04,416
Journalist

702
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
I think it hurt you

703
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,632
So you got the four here you're on fire

704
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,448
We're so honored a an awesome thank you

705
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
Whether he's on fire

706
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,080
He's on he's on fire

707
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,040
The two of them are in a situation where they both have

708
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:36,416
Identical anti-vax narrative are just like.

709
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
It's hard to listen to

710
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,584
One thing they seem to disagree about

711
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,424
Gates Bill Gates position in all of this

712
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,008
Now he's been The Mastermind

713
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,544
The Council of twelve

714
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,360
Joel skousen came in the other day and said

715
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
You the middle manager

716
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,968
Kind of threw a little bit of a curveball for Alex

717
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
I don't think

718
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,344
It's like somebody got a gun

719
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:12,512
Pleiku what why are they doing this that's the case I don't know I don't know

720
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,872
I have Silicon Valley and I have the medical establishment

721
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,528
World

722
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,344
1 minutes going to kill us

723
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,112
So I

724
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,904
Guess

725
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,768
Childsup

726
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:51,168
Del bigtree about that

727
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:55,520
I don't I don't know anymore.

728
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,848
We got counsel at 12 we got middle manager and we got

729
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
Those are the Four Tops

730
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,920
Insofar

731
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
Okay gotcha

732
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:08,320
Who knows

733
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,648
B of A conversation

734
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,696
Anti-vax bulshit

735
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,024
And I don't even respect Alex's

736
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,816
Stuff about

737
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,352
I really don't respect

738
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,912
Olivia

739
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Goliath

740
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,984
Bigger things we've already

741
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,800
Talked about a lot of narrative

742
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,848
I already in the past and it's just like

743
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,664
It's exhausting to go over it over and over again

744
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,992
There is one moment

745
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
But I think it's so illuminate

746
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
For the wrong reasons

747
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,112
In Bentonville big

748
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
Trees

749
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,696
You tell the story and I really think it sends

750
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,976
Wrong message

751
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
But I think

752
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,792
It sounds exactly

753
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,840
Like the message of the feeling I have

754
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
About people like him

755
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:57,472
What's a quick story

756
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,032
I would walk to school everyday with my my sister

757
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:08,224
T-shirt

758
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
Pliers

759
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,928
And he lives right next door to the school self

760
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,208
Call Tisa from him

761
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,256
Next day I like

762
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,352
I was homeschooled children

763
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,400
Share with somebody else thinks

764
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,200
In that story Dell thinks that he's telling a story about how he learned to stand up for his own

765
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,760
Which is why he won't back down from censorship

766
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
For his auntie back

767
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
Bulshit

768
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,648
However a closer examination of that story

769
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
Doesn't make

770
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,768
In the story he has a shirt that you like

771
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Light switches

772
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
His friend tells him look

773
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,376
In response to this influence from his

774
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
A Dell decides to

775
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,448
Before going to school

776
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
When his mother finds out about this

777
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,032
She takes him out of school and put

778
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:10,432
Put cement homeschool like a responsible parent do this is not a story about Rising above

779
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
The influence of your peers

780
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,272
It's a story about running away from it

781
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,296
So you never have to

782
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
Front back

783
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,344
Countervailing Force

784
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,160
The good version of the story is an amp

785
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,232
Aesthetic mother telling Middle School

786
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,792
Decide

787
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,864
Back to school the next day with

788
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
Shirt on

789
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
And you know what

790
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
Liking the shirt

791
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:39,616
Something like that

792
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:44,480
That's how the narrative Arc of learning

793
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,040
Recumbent negative influence of others

794
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,600
Storytelling

795
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,904
Feel like ones up with no more wire

796
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,976
Singers like that's where we're at in this kind of situation

797
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
Here's how this story were

798
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,376
Do received some influence from appear

799
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Which he succumbed

800
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,704
When his mother found out she

801
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,752
Changing his shirt

802
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:11,360
School thereby isolating Dell from having to regularly deal with the challenges of

803
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,640
Influences from his beard

804
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:17,504
Instead of helping her child recognize that his opinions and taste are valid

805
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,808
Regardless of whether or not people agree

806
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,392
Laterally remove Dell from the situation in

807
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
Artificial

808
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,208
Controlled environment

809
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
Where he won't have to

810
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,048
Make those tough choices anymore

811
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,096
Is Mother basically created

812
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:36,704
Bubbles

813
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,288
Instead of teaching him to validate his own feelings about the shirt

814
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,104
Even if not everyone agreed that it was cool shirt

815
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
On a certain level

816
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
This is actually a purple

817
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,712
Analogy for Wood Dale

818
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,504
Victory is done as a career

819
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
He's a

820
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:55,392
Text bulshit doesn't stand up to the scrutiny of actual science in the standards mainstream reporting

821
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,208
So he's metaphorically put himself in homeschool

822
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,768
Thanks to millions of dollars from anti-vax

823
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
Donors like

824
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,560
Bernard sales

825
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,400
An insulated bubble where is ideas

826
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,936
Compete with the influence

827
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:11,008
A metaphorical shirts sucks

828
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,848
He has his own safe space where he can wear his metaphorical shirt

829
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,408
In the privacy of his homeschool media operation

830
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,944
A company's vanquished

831
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,736
Risen above outside

832
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,808
When in reality all he's done is run away from it and hide

833
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,672
I love the idea that he's telling the story that he is

834
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,696
Completely

835
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,792
Send Skype message

836
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,096
Do what he does now as an adult

837
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:42,496
Know all of the all of the child true story

838
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:46,848
Stories tell like

839
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,176
Well that's one piece of the puzzle and how f*****-up you

840
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,016
Tapestry

841
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
Yeah I don't even

842
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,856
Desty I don't even hear from that

843
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,904
Story like granted I have no idea what his wife

844
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
Was like but like

845
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,720
I didn't hear that story hit mix

846
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,488
Expressing

847
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:07,584
He was distraught about his friend not liking his sure it seemed like it was

848
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,400
Is all his mom's response

849
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
I feel like

850
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
Better into that story is

851
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,520
He's taken away from his mom

852
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:21,920
I don't know I mean will be traumatic

853
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
I don't know

854
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,808
It's weird anyway

855
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
From social influences

856
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
Forever

857
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:34,208
Do you know you just got over it

858
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,000
I've decided

859
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,584
To believe that Andrew Wakefield is the best doctor in the world

860
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,448
You're just put myself in that bubble where that makes sense

861
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
I nobody

862
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,544
So

863
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
The rest of this is

864
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,895
Victory just like having a

865
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,199
Jolly time

866
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,807
First Alex does a 2-hour emergency report

867
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:13,887
Saturday August 1st 2020

868
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
So again

869
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,639
It's the same

870
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,039
Decide

871
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,575
Where am I

872
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,343
Show

873
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,367
Expecting something

874
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,391
Think big to happen

875
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
And it

876
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
It happened

877
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,767
I'm not sure he's expecting to happen during his show

878
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
It's more of like

879
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,399
Created a really intense narrative

880
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,727
And there's also a 10 date on when

881
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:56,127
I will have stopped that picture of that burning while it's an active

882
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,455
He starts this off with like almost

883
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,015
The 5-minute long clip from Road Warrior

884
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,599
Strange choice

885
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,159
Lord humongous

886
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:14,559
Do you want their children

887
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
If not

888
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,527
The city has announced they're going to blow up the PlayStation

889
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
Tonight tonight

890
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,159
Goodnight

891
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:47,583
Explosion

892
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
Tonight

893
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:51,167
Boston has changed the name of the police station 24

894
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
Sumpter

895
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:58,847
So then their plans plans

896
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,127
But there's other

897
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,711
Important information

898
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,503
And this is probably one of the most

899
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,783
Unimpeachable of the

900
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,319
Call

901
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
Wife

Tennis partner this morning

We're out there with guns in the parking lot

907
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,495
So if there was 150 people this morning

908
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,287
The text came in at like 8

909
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
Ken

910
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,151

What's going to be tonight cuz they pledge

We're going to take over the police station

913

City councilwoman but it involves defund the police

914

Hanging out at Whole Foods

917
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
Call the Prout

00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,191
She's lazy or something but it's like I

919
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,007
To getting tear-gassed you can sleep till noon

920
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:03,615
How regularly Alex will have Intel from his wife

921
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,895
The various friends

922
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,199
Her tennis partner called me

Realistic Alex out of the equation

928
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,191
Anybody across any kind of

929
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,215

It's embarrassing

933
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,015
Even if it's not Alex does he have any

934
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,295
Corroborating evidence

935
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,831

943
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,455
Perfect

944
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527

Everything and if you're white you need to be scared

947
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,023
You seen the footage in Utah

California

00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
Or somebody

952
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:32,959
St.Louis

953
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,799
Are you for black lives matter yes but I believe all lies

954
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,591
Mama

955
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
Your dad

956
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,247
Because she was white

957
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,599
And because she didn't bow down to this racist ideology

958
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:55,999
Even remember any of the detail guys today

959
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,791
Years old he doesn't remember her name was

960
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Jessica Whitaker

961
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
Never cared

962
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:06,239
St Louis McCloskey a couple pointing guns at protesters

963
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,799
Just all like trying to make white people

964
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,359
Scared details of everything that happened

965
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,127
Is even made up

966
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,967
So in this next clip

967
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
Sing about

968
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
Going to take over everything

969
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,927
And this is where I was able to sort of get in a little bit

970
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,719
Figure out here we go

971
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:32,351
Infowars.com Austin Police warn antifa BLM planning

972
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
Shooting downtown

973
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
We show you

974
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,031
A public document

975
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,823
My major

976
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,615
Manager company

977
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,151
CNBC

978
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,247
Apartments

979
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
They were told by

980
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,927
Is taking the roof with guns in their buildings and list

981
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,975
That's where they're going to be

982
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,535
This article and

983
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,399
Does two major pieces of information that Alex's basin

984
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Astoria

985
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,007
And the first thing I want to point out is that Alex gave the wrong name to that man

986
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,031
Asthma company

987
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
It's Nazi ND

988
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
DC

989
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,383
It's hard to tell

990
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:21,247
If it be not because he can't read or because he's trying to make details harder to track down

991
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,319
CNBC and then

992
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
Who knows

993
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,671
This is the Guadalupe neighborhood development

994
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,719
Corporation has just posted

995
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:34,047
The screenshot of what appears to be a letter from the gndc to

996
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
Lieutenant

997
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,375
Asking them to report any suspicious activity because

998
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,519
People coming to Austin tomorrow may be armed and have plans to get on top

999
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,567
Buildings along the ice

1000
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
Frontage Road

1001
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,127
This weather

1002
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,687
Steven Rios

1003
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,527
There's no mention of antifa or anything else

1004
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,831
Could be anything the only one group

1005
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,855
People historical

1006
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,391
Play who have the

1007
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,159
The training

1008
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:05,279
And the necessary to get on top of rooftops

1009
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,303
Endoscope

1010
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:12,191
So this brings us to the second piece of information that's in that article.

1011
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,983
The other part of this

1012
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,543
Really comes from a face

1013
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,359
The Texas state gorillas militia

1014
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,175
Which is supposedly a left-wing militia

1015
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:26,271
Interesting Lee if you try to Google that name there's no search results

1016
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:31,647
What's up other than message boards from like a day ago and

1017
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,695
Trysting if you go look at the Facebook

1018
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,975
DuPage it's pretty clear

1019
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,999
This is not Alexa

1020
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
Militia

1021
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,327
At least one of the admins of this group has

1022
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,375
Explicit Boogaloo iconography and

1023
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,679
His profile picture

1024
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,007
Includes at least two people pictured wearing skull mask

1025
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,031
Switch is a look

1026
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,335
It is regularly Associated that sort of community

1027
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,127
The Facebook group is

1028
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,967
Is private you can still tell certain things about it if you're not a member

1029
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,015
It was created by the month

1030
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,807
Which is a little bit weird

1031
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,879
The other things you can tell

1032
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,647
Private

1033
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:10,559
Admin Pages aren't all private

1034
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,911
You just created

1035
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,007
It's really hard to determine how much of the stuff on their use

1036
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
Like seriously

1037
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,055
Is it the Facebook page

1038
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,359
Pictures he chooses to post

1039
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,895
Speaker to send to the guy

1040
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
He's a big

1041
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,687
Fan of guns

1042
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,991
Pictures of him with guns

1043
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,319
There's a weird picture that

1044
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:35,903
Because white women are into black men because they have bigger dicks

1045
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,231
Sounds historically like something I've heard

1046
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:39,999
So okay

1047
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,839
Is that okay

1048
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,655
Just come up with that himself I'm sure there's no historical

1049
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,191
Corollary for that exact

1050
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,751
Narrative right

1051
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,775
No

1052
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:57,919
Memes in August

1053
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,455
Igloo related me

1054
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:07,903
Sure the second person to become an admin in this Texas State Gorillaz

1055
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,951
Which is obviously a fake

1056
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,279
Post

1057
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:17,631
But almost related

1058
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,423
It goes on and on like

1059
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,215
It says you look at the members of the group

1060
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Profiles

1061
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,823
This is not so much

1062
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,127
Presented as much as it is a Boogaloo

1063
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,967
The group

1064
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,527
I have no idea has any validity

1065
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,367
Which is what

1066
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,135
The conjecture is

1067
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,463
Because it's a private group

1068
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,791
I'm not joining it and Alex doesn't have any proof

1069
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,119
And we don't recommend people try

1070
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,911
I wouldn't

1071
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,519
Austin Police Department

1072
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,567
Guadalupe neighborhood group

1073
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,663
This ultimately could be a situation where there is an underlying

1074
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,711
Storied namely that a subset of

1075
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,503
The acceleration is the Boogaloo type

1076
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,807
Current social climate

1077
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,087
To trigger some violin

1078
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
But

1079
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,647
Even that

1080
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
Substantiate

1081
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
I'm not saying

1082
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,743
Possibility

1083
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,815
Even if that is the truth and story Alex's

1084
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:23,167
We'd be misrepresenting it to be some kind of an antifa black lives matter

1085
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,215
As opposed to being a group of

1086
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,239
Absolutely

1087
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,591
If Only They were a little bit more universally race

1088
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,711
It's interesting to me because

1089
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:39,551
He was presented The Story So vaguely

1090
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,903
Take over police stations and others

1091
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,183
I didn't see any evidence

1092
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
To that

1093
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,255
Maybe that's in the

1094
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,535
Good Facebook group.

1095
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,071
I can't see I don't

1096
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:51,839
Don't know

1097
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,887
And he's trying to present it as

1098
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,727
Antifa Soros fund

1099
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,287
It's like 100 people

1100
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
What group

1101
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,359
A cheat for Sora

1102
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,639
You know that's

1103
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,199
If you're paying that yet

1104
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,223
Maybe

1105
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,759
Max for 100 people

1106
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,527
Facebook group

1107
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,063
5 G

1108
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,111
Thesaurus

1109
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:16,927
Explodes

1110
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:23,583
So Alex touches back on the story of the Doctor Who super into Hydrox

1111
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:29,471
Who also believes that people are having sex with humans in their sleep and what have you

1112
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
Imallexx

1113
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,823
She's being attacked

1114
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,407
Because she's a Christian

1115
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,943
In the process

1116
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,479
Kind

1117
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,039
Is light as that people have sex with humans in their sleep

1118
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,807
They keep my

1119
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,855
Okay

1120
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
2 + 2

1121
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,463
Crazy Christian lady

1122
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,255
Gee thanks

1123
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,863
Solon made it with aliens

1124
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:01,471
And so she's crazy at the very establishment believes that

1125
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
Hold on

1126
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,359
Are you going to read the Bible that says that

1127
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,967
100% battery

1128
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,039
Big thing that matters

1129
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
Leaves

1130
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,671
The Bible is about alien DNA

1131
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:27,071
Some human cells have alien cells and that damn

1132
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,863
The Bible says the Earth was

1133
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,215
Preceded by viral RNA from

1134
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,239
The directions

1135
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,263
Miguel

1136
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,847
What led

1137
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,735
Too busy

1138
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,319
Del bigtree

1139
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
With stats

1140
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:57,791
Yes we are commercial free on this August 1st

1141
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,815
Saturday

Is Right Patriot always appreciated in size 10 most accurate smart people know

1146
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,175
Now hear you're making a weird face

1147
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,967
I think Alex is right

1148
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:23,647
Okay

1149
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,463
Okay I will compute that

1150
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,279
Everyone else is wrong all the time

1151
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:33,631
Steve's wrong all the time to entertain

1152
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:39,775
Alicia Reeves

1153
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,567
Briefings from Stratford

1154
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,335
There's something

1155
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,175
Rap status

1156
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
Slip-up

1157
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,015
In this interview

1158
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,551
But I think our kind of telling

1159
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,623
He's at the beginning

1160
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:55,903
Steve

1161
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:56,927
Start

1162
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,511
Loses his train of thought

1163
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
How to do a second

1164
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,047
Take

1165
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
This

1166
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,143
Complains to me

1167
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,447
Steve might be working off a little bit of a

1168
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,127
19 is just a variation of a virus

1169
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,175
That we've had for over 60 years

1170
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,735
You cured me to fix a spike

1171
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,783
It is a highly

1172
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:30,463
19

1173
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:36,351
19 is just a variation of a virus that we've had for over 60 years

1174
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,655
It's a spider

1175
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,471
It is a highly

1176
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
Virus which can

1177
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,639
Attack someone but

1178
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,199
We had to do two takes there

1179
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,735
Basically the exact

1180
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,063
Austin's is train of thought

1181
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:05,023
Everybody down here I just wanted to jump into correct myself a tiny bit here

1182
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,607
After recording the episode I went back and I watch the video

1183
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,935
Of this from Alex's show

1184
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:16,287
And this is not actually an instance of Steve pieczenik saying this twice

1185
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,311
Though it sounded

1186
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,871
A lot like it if you were listening to it I went and watched

1187
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,639
The video

1188
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,455
And it is actually a weird editing

1189
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,759
Nothing vet Infowars screwed up

1190
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:29,855
I don't know how they did this it is not I've never seen it before

1191
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,135
But they just

1192
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,183
Played Steve saying this twice

1193
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,719
I have no idea why

1194
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,279
I apologize if that slipped passed me

1195
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:43,679
Anyway I was wrong I made an assumption that Steve was reading the same thing twice when in reality was

1196
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,751
Play never-before-seen of very weird

1197
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:50,079
I think we're in Fort Worth played the same audio twice

1198
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
4

1199
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:55,455
No reason video plays twice

1200
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,991
Just a tiny little

1201
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,039
I've no idea who I can't explain it

1202
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,575
Are we back to the show

1203
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:08,767
Probably even leave that aside for a moment is it weren't for the other slip up

1204
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,791
That happens

1205
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,327
That I think he's being fed

1206
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,351
Information

1207
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,631
Remember that

1208
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,447
He cured himself of copas

1209
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
OK Google

1210
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
There's a problem

1211
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,591
So Trump has been 90

1212
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,127
China virus

1213
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,503
Happy quotes

1214
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,879
Did the Chinese

1215
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:35,647
Cuz Alex Isabel

1216
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,695
Steve

1217
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,975
Kind of completely

1218
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,511
Fox Veterinary

1219
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:43,583
Ironically didn't really come from

1220
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,679
And fauci never understood it it really came out of Northern Italy

1221
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:53,567
Tony has never understood the underlying dynamics of a vaccine

1222
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,871
So apparently according to Steve

1223
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,199
This came out of Northern Italy

1224
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,759
Ruins everything

1225
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,599
All right if that's true

1226
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,879
If Steve is a lie

1227
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,927
Right

1228
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,999
Inaccurate people you could be talkin anyway possible

1229
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,303
Everything Alex has built up about

1230
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,863
Is wrong

1231
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,887
Conspiracy

1232
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,983
60 years old it's a variation

1233
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:26,079
Tony fauci doesn't even understand pyrometer

1234
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:30,431
He wasn't involved in

1235
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:35,039
Bio weapon

1236
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,831
Without

1237
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:40,927
Why not you know Hillary visited Northern

1238
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
Confident

1239
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,975
Who's Steve the shape

1240
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:46,303
The geopolitical landscape government

1241
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,327
Putting l

1242
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,863
Total every single

1243
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,679
Certain person

1244
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
In the world

1245
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,751
I did with him at some

1246
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
Itsfunneh

1247
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,335
When

1248
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,103
Steve

1249
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,127
Accuses

1250
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,151
Tony fauci

1251
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,943
Of using hyperbole

1252
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:08,575
Unfortunately I'm working Tony was my teacher

1253
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,879
Medical doctor Cornell University Medical

1254
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:15,231
What you see is what I said 425 months ago

1255
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:18,559
He is Jesuit rain is narcissistic

1256
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,351
He has hyperbole

1257
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,911
Really made a medical mistake

1258
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,239
You should never recommended

1259
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,735
When you said what

1260
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,575
Cornel Wilde

1261
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,111
They probably would have overlap

1262
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,719
Reese

1263
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:53,119
Deserve

1264
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,911
Cuz like this guy is a braggart

1265
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,495
This guy is an a******

1266
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
Also I

1267
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:04,639
Self I was the first person to cure my also also

1268
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
Anti

1269
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:08,479
I'm Jack Ryan and

1270
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:12,575
Every war of my lifetime

1271
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,623
He helped kill the Italian Prime Minister

1272
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,159
About that parts

1273
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,695
Zoe

1274
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,767
We get to talk in about like what's wrong with Trump

1275
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,071
Because Alex is like

1276
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,143
Wants to people who give him like really tough talk yes

1277
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,447
This

1278
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,471
It's not what I asked

1279
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:33,055
Did you hear about

1280
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:37,663
Policy but not with who he hires

1281
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:41,247
Carlson told me privately

1282
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,551
Just travel to his enemies

1283
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,327
The fire somebody in front of them

1284
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,655
He doesn't indirectly I see count responses like

1285
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,983
And they can never confront somebody directly

1286
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,775
How much are remind Steve at

1287
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,055
Which phrase was

1288
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,591
You're fired

1289
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,855
Like in real life

1290
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,159
Oru

1291
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:22,463
Sure know if that's actually true or not

1292
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,255
The narrative

1293
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,887
Worked in the administration like

1294
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:36,287
Not you're being fired indirectly or call me hearing on TV

1295
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,103
Step down

1296
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,759
Fun about Steve's

1297
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
Is that it

1298
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,831
Also recognition

1299
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,111
Trump satire

1300
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,391
Persona is fake

1301
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
Is b*******

1302
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:56,255
So wait are you telling me that his reality TV show

1303
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,791
Donna was sold to us

1304
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,071
Was as his actual person

1305
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:02,143
Soda during the campaign

1306
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,423
You think they were electing one

1307
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:07,519
Where's the smart business leader

1308
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,287
Like a big

1309
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,311
Of course

1310
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,127
So that's fun

1311
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:18,271
Trumpcare Fire Pizza

1312
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,575
Get the guy out of there

1313
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,647
To the point of being ineffectual

1314
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,671
Probably

1315
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,463
Leader known bosses like that

1316
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,231
And I think

1317
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,535
Give them highly is that what you think they should be proud

1318
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,863
End

1319
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,631
I'm coming in

1320
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,399
You know Biden

1321
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,423
Is the other choice

1322
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,727
And it turns out that Steve

1323
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,031
Isn't big on voting

1324
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,591
I need a stronger president than Trump

1325
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
That's it

1326
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:51,295
They will be no

1327
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,063
Community

1328
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,623
I'm saying what I mean

1329
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,911
That's not funny

1330
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,447
He is

1331
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,495
Super enchi

1332
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,263
Justin election

1333
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,079
I'm telling the people in the

1334
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:17,151
Community that a Biden president

1335
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:20,735
Any kind of power

1336
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,295
Perspective

1337
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,599
And the position that he has

1338
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,623
Deeply

1339
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:30,463
Deeply authoritarian

1340
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,255
To Blackmail the president

1341
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,791
Into getting rid of Alexa

1342
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,583
What you got to do

1343
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:40,959
You got to get Larry Nichols and Larry flew too close to the Sun he's not welcome back

1344
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
Doesn't seem

1345
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,007
Because now would be a good time

1346
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,287
A nickels

1347
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,103

1348
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,551
I have it

1349
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,671
I got my sources.

1350
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,951
They gave me the pee tape

1351
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:06,047
Ali choto paid my mailbox

1352
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:11,167
Where's the guy bringing telling us that Reagan had a video of him getting paid

1353
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
Where was

1354
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:12,959
Yeah but he

1355
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:15,007
I mean metaphor I like

1356
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,823
That guy

1357
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:22,687
And said that he had

1358
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,711
Peg

1359
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,271
It wasn't like they were trying to take down Reg

1360
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,855
That was a no

1361
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,159
Right

1362
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,231
Completely unrelated conversation

1363
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:39,071
I could use a non sequitur

1364
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:40,863
The champ come

1365
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,935
So Steve is one of these guys who

1366
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,983
Since a lot of really bad

1367
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:46,751
Things

1368
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,287
A sort of casually like

1369
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,127
Regardless

1370
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:58,527
Black yeah yeah why you saying that

1371
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,551
Soros

1372
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:03,135
Surat

1373
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,671
Knotweed

1374
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,463
Does Melissa live

1375
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,511
There's a lot of stuff that makes me think

1376
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,071
You're a real big

1377
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,863
And this is one of those instant

1378
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,679
Is here

1379
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
Georgetown

1380
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:24,127
Goes into the Lincoln project another idiot Outpost

1381
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:27,455
It makes Kia says the Trump is not

1382
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:32,575
Narcissistic

1383
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,879
We got one

1384
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,439
Yeah I mean like why do you have to point out the Gorge

1385
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,231
Conway

1386
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,767
I mean you got to toss them in there

1387
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,607
Most people who are half

1388
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
I don't know

1389
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:48,959
Anything other than whites how is it at all relevant

1390
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:55,359
To any conversation as we all know

1391
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,895
Send have never served

1392
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,175
I mean that's just

1393
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:02,015
Sorts of ticks are really out of

1394
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,087
So

1395
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
People

1396
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,903
More telling

1397
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,671
What needs

1398
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
To be done

1399
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,487
And

1400
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,559
Because

1401
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,607
He may have

1402
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:19,935
The different view of America in a lot of people

1403
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:24,287
What do we the people do the folks that do care about their family

1404
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,311
What do we do

1405
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:32,223
Into the street they protest and they say we want change and we want to get rid of our tongue

1406
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,295
And we need to have

1407
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,087
Financial

1408
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:39,903
Program more than anything America

1409
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,695
Is a business entity

1410
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,487
More than anything else

1411
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,279
We are business entity

1412
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,959
Did you know 80s

1413
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,239
Refreshing to hear it

1414
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:59,103
Underlying

1415
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,151
So much of this right-wing

1416
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,431
The Richard like

1417
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,991
The Constitution matters

1418
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,807
Is a business proposition for that

1419
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
It's refreshing

1420
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,623
To hear somebody just come out and be like

1421
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:17,023
I want to oppress away but I water quality

1422
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:17,791
We talkin about

1423
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,071
We the People

1424
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:19,839
No

1425
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:22,911
Business the people my friend

1426
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,983
Crying about the blood is

1427
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,383
Government source

1428
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,455
Steve pieczenik

1429
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,503
Business

1430
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:41,599
Cookie with yours is equality and Liberty

1431
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:46,719
Tell me about any kind of

1432
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,743
Founding

1433
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:52,095
For the United States of America even considers those things

1434
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,167
I hate to do this to

1435
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,495
Centro Bus

1436
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,799
Because suggest

1437
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,823
That

1438
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,103
Is 2 week

1439
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,639
To kill his opponent

1440
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,967
Here's where there's another slip-up

1441
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:08,991
Steve

1442
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,527
Obviously

1443
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,831
Mfu globalist ended up

1444
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:17,183
Avocado accidents I'm not calling for this cuz you'll get called in federal court still alive

1445
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,999
You know we're serious I'm doing myself I'm just saying

1446
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,815
Revolution

1447
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,375
George Washington

1448
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,959
We'll just go after a few of these guys Abraham Lincoln wouldn't all be over

1449
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,775
I mean

1450
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:37,663
I guess the Pentagon is all too I may just actually go after a few people you took money for the Chinese and you're a traitor

1451
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,223
Well you don't they take a dirt nap

1452
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:46,111
If in a few of these people got trouble all the wrestler turn around there's a bunch of wimps but we have to hang out here under attack

1453
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,159
We have to deal with all the physical threat

1454
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:51,999
Which I'm happy to do and then no one else ever makes them pay as what I'm saying

1455
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,303
Wilbur Ross

1456
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:57,119
Here's what you have to do

1457
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,423
Two men are who I do respect

1458
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,983
Steve mnuchin who understands money

1459
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,799
And distribution of money and Wilbur Ross

1460
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,335
Steve

1461
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,639
Is there with him

1462
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,663
She's like Googling

1463
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,527
Yeah that you should not have let her come on

1464
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:15,807
Wilbur Ross

1465
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:22,975
He needed her to feed the name but he's going to put into his next next paragraph

1466
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,351
It's interesting

1467
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,399
The business entity

1468
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,423
Fine with being a

1469
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,703
A traitor to a busy

1470
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,471
This entity

1471
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,799
Especially when the business

1472
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:41,663
Exploit

1473
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:48,063
Are we the shareholders of that business

1474
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,343
If you're in Shaler

1475
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,879
You get some sort of lip

1476
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,439
Oh boy

1477
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,279
Another time that Steve has slipped

1478
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,047
Much like

1479
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:01,631
Bring up that Steve Conway's half-filipino

1480
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,447
Complaining about that

1481
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:07,007
The Frontline saying about Alex

1482
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:11,103
Why do they film conspiracy so much

1483
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,895
Trump's bad Elizabeth piercings

1484
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,967
That's how the real world

1485
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:21,855
Listen to that show was so idiotic

1486
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,647
First

1487
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:29,023
What an amazing flaming individual but more importantly they said

1488
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,839
He was a CIA intern

1489
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,887
Really no kidding

1490
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,447
I don't know

1491
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,383
Number one

1492
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:47,455
Steve can't talk about people who are not

1493
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,991
White screen

1494
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
Not be a big

1495
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:51,807
Can't not do it

1496
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,831
It's just impossible

1497
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:56,671
And then I don't even remember Anderson Cooper being in

1498
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:00,255
The documentary outside of archival footage of him

1499
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,791
Like I think there's footage

1500
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,071
Give him interviewing

1501
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,351
One of the Sandy Hook

1502
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
Parents

1503
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,399
Okay prom like

1504
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,703
Around that time

1505
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:15,103
I don't remember him being a talking head in the documentary I don't under I don't know what

1506
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,639
Existing at all

1507
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,175
Very angry

1508
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,223
Just in the documentary in the background

1509
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:27,647
Hey Ivy was part of the CIA bums me out because they never get

1510
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,927
They never get

1511
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:33,023
Alright so if you were living in Steve pieczenik lily-white

1512
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
World

1513
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,607
Chisholm

1514
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,703
Then he's just going to be a bigot towards

1515
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:43,775
Oh yeah he's Italian he's going to do he's going to just be a

1516
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,311
Bigger towards whomever

1517
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
Confine

1518
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:49,663
That's me

1519
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,199
Exclusionary thinking

1520
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,223
Is that you

1521
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,271
You end up

1522
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,807
With definition

1523
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,087
Become

1524
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,879
Smaller and smaller

1525
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:02,719
If you end up with the white nationalist you'll end up then with a

1526
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
The separatist

1527
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:06,815
Community

1528
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,095
Or whatever.

1529
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,887
Puppy weasel

1530
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,191
Just for being

1531
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:16,799
Never realize on real reason

1532
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,359
The reasons are forced

1533
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,895
Artificial unmade

1534
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:24,223
They can be forced artificially made up about any

1535
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,783
Arbitrary distinction that you want to make

1536
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,575
Because

1537
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
Beans

1538
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,695
You know moves towards exclusion are always

1539
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,231
Make up for something else

1540
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,303
Excuse for why the economy isn't

1541
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,839
Could be why is there crime

1542
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,191
Olivia

1543
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,215
You want

1544
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:49,055
To exclude people because it solves some other issues

1545
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:52,127
It's not related

1546
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,919
You have to understand that

1547
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:59,295
Your way and then

1548
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:03,647
Again another group of people

1549
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:07,487
Yeah of course Steve will never be satisfied with whatever

1550
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,839
It's joining its joining Stalin

1551
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,607
Politburo

1552
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,167
Like you got it

1553
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,239
It's not going to you're not going to be in that pic

1554
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Picture later on

1555
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
The issue for

1556
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,591
Steve right now though

1557
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,639
There's no leader

1558
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:25,919
For his size

1559
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:30,527
L

1560
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,367
But according to Steve he installed Trump

1561
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,647
The president's so

1562
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,439
There's no l

1563
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:42,047
But unfortunately you have f***** up then because you install

1564
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,351
You're not going to

1565
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,191
We haven't

1566
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,727
Absence of leadership

1567
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:50,495
Power

1568
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,287
Country

1569
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,591
The conservative movement

1570
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,615
Which I think is

1571
01:14:56,127 --> 01:15:02,271
Justin American movement

1572
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,343
Bactrim

1573
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,903
What's supposed to be that leader but what you hear

1574
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:19,423
I mean honestly I

1575
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
Together

1576
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:26,079
And bringing Melania to be your vice president

1577
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,359
And you do

1578
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,919
Calm down and start firing

1579
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,687
Assistance

1580
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,527
Another

1581
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,623
To not know what we wanted the guy we saw 4 years ago

1582
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:45,535
Does his wife know that Steve has a boner for Melania never heard him

1583
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,303
Like

1584
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,167
Without mentioning how Melania should be more important

1585
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:55,519
That's that's not that's not

1586
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:59,103
Number of times that he hasn't brought up

1587
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:09,343
Melania's great

1588
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:15,743
Vice president

1589
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,559
I would say

1590
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:21,375
Staff around me

1591
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,423
Depressed of the National Security Council

1592
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,335
Well

1593
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:33,663
That's the point that's what I need I don't either in the front

1594
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:38,783
I just needed a critical mass for her to implement what's required

1595
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,599
And override a lot of what Trump is doing

1596
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,367
Why is

1597
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
Happening

1598
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,207
It makes sense

1599
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,743
Because we've met

1600
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,535
Here's the deal

1601
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,559
Alright

1602
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,119
Clearly they believe Trump is a fake

1603
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,959
And clearly Trump is absolutely not the thing that they believe

1604
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,495
They made it all up

1605
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,519
Shirley Malone

1606
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,287
To feel better about

1607
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,103
Obviously

1608
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,639
And even they can

1609
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,407
Can a boy.

1610
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,967
Yeah pick a new person to make up s*** about

1611
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,015
Play Muse right there and see wants to f***

1612
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,183
Solovar

1613
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,511
Oliver power fantasies on

1614
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:26,143
It's weird

1615
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:29,215
Consistent thing where you seems to want to

1616
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,263
Install Melania in

1617
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,847
I don't know I don't know how much I feel confident

1618
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,615
About

1619
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:36,639
This

1620
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:43,295
You know in the same way you feel like you get these reveals the things that are going on while Steve's having an interview like his wife Google and stuff

1621
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,623
The ruins of the side

1622
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,647
America's like this

1623
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,439
Insistent

1624
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,207
Tissue slide

1625
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,487
We need to make

1626
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,791
Melania the shadow president

1627
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,095
I'm not sure I trust you as

1628
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:59,423
Like a crafty Mastermind either

1629
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,959
I don't I don't know

1630
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:01,983
I don't know if

1631
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,007
Your plans are good

1632
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,287
Is it like

1633
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,311
Maybe

1634
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,615
Okay maybe I'll throw this out

1635
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,663
Alright let me toss this out

1636
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,479
I think he's creating

1637
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,015
An alternate universe

1638
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:14,783
Clinton

1639
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,063
Do you know what I mean

1640
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,879
Like he's thinking Trump is your bill

1641
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,487
So it makes sense that

1642
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,023
FIFA boomiverse

1643
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,303
President

1644
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,327
I think I see

1645
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:31,679
Think you're probably right that there's some of that projection

1646
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,959
Entirely unconscious that's

1647
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,495
Possible but it does have that

1648
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,263
Feel of like

1649
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,031
Either

1650
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,567
Creating their own

1651
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,359
We don't like they thought Obama was a dick

1652
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:44,735
You know they thought Bill Clinton was his wife

1653
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,039
So now they're saying that Melania should have that

1654
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,367
Yeah

1655
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,927
Maybe Alex

1656
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,743
You know hey man

1657
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,047
You're at your psychiatrist

1658
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,327
Neuropsychology

1659
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351
Tell me

1660
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,887
What's going on

1661
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,423
I just remembered

1662
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,959
You're not allowed to diagnose people

1663
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,007
Opposed

1664
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
Medical doctor

1665
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:19,551
He's already there he was I I said it 6 months ago

1666
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,575
Real quick

1667
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:26,463
Being senile dementia

1668
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,511
I don't

1669
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:33,887
I don't belong to the APA quickly so where is he in a month

1670
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,447
He's exactly where he is

1671
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:39,519
Basically

1672
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,311
I'm not knowing where he is

1673
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,127
That's one of my favorite things because like

1674
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:50,527
From Spotify

1675
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:56,927
Resume

1676
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,207
Ended because I diagnosed

1677
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,999
Bush from afar

1678
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:04,095
There is that I was at exactly

1679
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:11,775
I bet have to alleviate

1680
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,080
You stand up for your collection

1681
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,152
Steve

1682
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,712
We had some parting words

1683
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,808
This is bad advice

1684
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,880
Start going back to an ordinary life

1685
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,440
And forget about the Coronavirus

1686
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:34,560
If you got a problem go with your pharmacist a doctor

1687
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:40,704
And I will handle it

1688
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,240
The numbers for New York

1689
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,288
Forget the TV

1690
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:49,152
And go on with your lies and create a lot of local don't believe that

1691
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,200
Steve's

1692
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,272
Pretend this isn't real

1693
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,320
This isn't happening

1694
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,600
Like here's the

1695
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,624
F***** up part

1696
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,440
This is this is almost there

1697
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,208
50 bucks down

1698
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,488
Here's what

1699
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,768
Almost certainly going to

1700
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,328
It's going to double get worse

1701
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,608
We're going to get a vaccine

1702
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,680
The people who take the vaccine are going to be okay

1703
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:16,544
The people who refuse to take the vaccine are large enough and number that when they start dying

1704
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,360
They're going to claim that we're killing them

1705
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,128
Because we

1706
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:23,968
The vaccine that it wasn't real and that we're just killing them anyways

1707
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:25,760
And because they're going to continue spreading it

1708
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,040
It's entirely possible that

1709
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,088
Mutate in the f****** backseat

1710
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:35,232
Second

1711
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,304
Tino come

1712
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,912
You know you end up with a certain amount of folks are just

1713
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,192
Going to have negative

1714
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:47,008
Reactions to medications

1715
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,800
People like Alex

1716
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,824
Sewer anti-vax

1717
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,592
Swell

1718
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,616
Use those in

1719
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,640
Instances of inevitable

1720
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,176
Complications

1721
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,968
They were right all along

1722
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,016
I don't know I

1723
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,392
Hypothetical

1724
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
Vaccines

1725
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:10,048
I don't I don't I don't know about that

1726
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,584
Thresholds of how many

1727
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,168
Vaccine would be

1728
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,704
No problem

1729
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,776
I don't know I can't I can't really speculate on that

1730
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,056
Steve leaves

1731
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:25,920
Gets back to his story about antifa that he's lying about

1732
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,296
Information

1733
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:34,624
It reveals that this is not a black lives matter

1734
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,904
Antifa group

1735
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,184
The Boogaloo group

1736
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,488
I'm going to check these lights this is

1737
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,536
Mine on Facebook it was real people

1738
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:45,632
Intel Leroy Jenkins group known as Boogaloo

1739
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,168
That's a fake cut out right way

1740
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,192
ATL run

1741
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:51,008
Advising about body armor and weapons the group

1742
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
About 9

1743
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,312
Farm people

1744
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:56,896
Officer safety Bungalow safety Gutierrez

1745
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,712
If we're at other people related devices

1746
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,760
Another suspect advised have

1747
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,040
Spray paint

1748
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:03,808
Charges

1749
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,832
Nfib

1750
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,856
Was whatever that is

1751
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,928
Whatever

1752
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,232
Information is supposedly from

1753
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
Police

1754
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,048
Misinformation

1755
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:14,816
Kitchen towels

1756
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:19,424
Is that that Leroy

1757
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,960
This Facebook group

1758
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:23,776
And some of the other names that he read offer also the admins

1759
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,544
This Facebook group

1760
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,104
Because he's reading this out

1761
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,384
It's very clear that

1762
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,432
Whatever is supposed

1763
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,200
Then

1764
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:36,832
It's still Alex so I have no idea of any of this information is even accurate

1765
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,880
Assuming

1766
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,952
Just told him that there is

1767
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,256
Group that this is this Facebook

1768
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,024
Book group

1769
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,304
Betty's Boogaloo

1770
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,120
Decent door inspired

1771
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,144
And

1772
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,704
Have some

1773
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:53,984
Plants

1774
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,008
And because Alex

1775
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:58,080
Knows enough to know that word means something

1776
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,360
He has to say that it's

1777
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,640
The fake cut

1778
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,944
It's 8.

1779
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:06,528
Just running cover

1780
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,088
Like there's no

1781
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,368
He knows what he's doing

1782
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,648
He is trying to make a

1783
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,928
Get so no matter what

1784
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,696
The Boogaloo move

1785
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:16,256
What does doesn't come back on

1786
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:24,704
Space here towards the end of the Saturday show where he's like man

1787
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,008
Talk show host

1788
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,032
Hard

1789
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:31,104
I mean killing love with me so much easier to talk show

1790
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,384
Play around me

1791
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,432
It's so much easier to

1792
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,480
Would it be not going to do that

1793
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,784
But you keep starting your fights

1794
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,552
Your

1795
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:40,576
Dad

1796
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:48,000
And the police know and the public knows and the military knows everyone sick of you

1797
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,352
You won't back off you won't

1798
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:55,680
You won't stop messing with constantly

1799
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,472
You're going to make us

1800
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,288
How's your eyeballs out

1801
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:01,824
And you know it

1802
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:03,872
Alright man

1803
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,152
I honestly think

1804
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,432
Alex's

1805
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,200
Lazy enough

1806
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:09,760
That if it were actually easier

1807
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:10,784
He would

1808
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,552
Oblique

1809
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,088
Yeah

1810
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:18,464
Could be easier than doing his show the way she doesn't

1811
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,768
So sloppy and so bad

1812
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,608
Devoid of

1813
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,376
Crafts

1814
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:31,776
You don't even need to be good at your job you spend the first 10 minutes of every show saying that you can't even

1815
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,360
Watching some of the road warrior

1816
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,712
Bruno Just

1817
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,528
Hard it is to do his job

1818
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,832
Please consider this is August

1819
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,600
First

1820
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,880
You know I said that the

1821
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:50,208
Christmas in July within yesterday and it will end by tomorrow

1822
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,768
Special yet

1823
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,816
Double Patriot Point still available

1824
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,144
He can't even do this

1825
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,984
Christmas in July high in the first place

1826
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,776
Definitely shouldn't

1827
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,336
Yeah he's bad at everything

1828
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,688
Do the same sale just make up a

1829
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,224
Christmas in August

1830
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,016
F****** just do it

1831
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:16,064
Jesus in August sale

1832
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,792
No way

1833
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:30,144
Men's Day in August

1834
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:39,872
That I'm glad didn't accidentally end up in any violence

1835
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,152
The best of my knowledge

1836
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:42,944
Who knows

1837
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:48,064
Yeah I mean playing with fire the way he did this whole broadcast about

1838
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,136
Tonight and tomorrow

1839
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,672
Planning to blow up

1840
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,744
These police stations all around

1841
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,768
Country

1842
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,792
All this death

1843
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:02,912
That's really risking the possibility of someone hurting somebody based on that recording

1844
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,704
And

1845
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,752
Little bit further

1846
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,800
You see the sources that he's relying on

1847
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,848
And you see well what it is

1848
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,152
Here's to be about is not all around the country

1849
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,688
It appears to be one

1850
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:15,968
Group

1851
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,760
Is run by some

1852
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,808
Who may or may not have

1853
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,576
Been planning

1854
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:21,600
Something

1855
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,648
It's unclear

1856
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,952
You know and he's taking the bath

1857
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:27,744
Hispanic

1858
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,280
Extent

1859
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,072
Like that's really fun

1860
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:31,840
Walking dangerous

1861
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,888
Pretty scary

1862
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,168
That's pretty scary

1863
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,960
And then

1864
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,032
They're coming for your town neck

1865
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:45,920
B11 antifa there going to be

1866
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:46,944
F****** bum

1867
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,248
F*** Idaho any moment now

1868
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,784
And what do you have

1869
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,064
When you have like that

1870
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,344
At the end there when you talk

1871
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:57,696
You know killing people be so much easier than doing this talk show and you could

1872
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,792
To do this

1873
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,584
Restart to realize

1874
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:07,680
You keep pushing us is fake stories

1875
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:13,824
Really keep pushing you and I keep pushing you guys haven't actually murdered anybody yet

1876
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,920
It becomes clear that this is almost like a self

1877
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:20,480
Perpetuating cycle that he's trying to

1878
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:23,552
Trying to antagonize and empty

1879
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,600
I mean

1880
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:30,464
It's hard not to say that he is I mean after you know he's covering for the Boogaloo movement movement

1881
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,744
And he's

1882
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:32,768
Actively

1883
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,304
Encouraging his own audience

1884
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,376
To essentially start the Boogaloo movement on their own

1885
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,400
South

1886
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,424
I think we know what

1887
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,192
What kind of movement

1888
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,520
Episode

1889
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,848
I would have rather spent like two hours talking

1890
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,128
About that story to tell

1891
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,456
Revealing thing

1892
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:56,064
Except

1893
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,112
I'm actually not involved

1894
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:02,464
APA stock

1895
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,512
Protection Agency

1896
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:07,840
Bradshaw for the WWF in 1999

1897
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:13,216
