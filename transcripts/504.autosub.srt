00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Need

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,024
Alex

7
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,792
June

8
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,888
What's up

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,216
My bright spot today is

10
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
Ian

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,568
It is nice out

12
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,616
So it wasn't just the words.

13
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,528
Whatever the f***

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,904
Because I stuff earlier this week

15
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
What do I know about myself I like spicy stuff

16
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
A spice challenge

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,704
Sitting around that we were going to camera

18
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,984
No what's the nuts

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,056
It was the chocolate bar

20
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
I believe

21
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,480
This white chocolate bar that has bunch of Chili's at at you cuz I was like

22
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
That sounds interesting

23
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
They were given

24
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,464
Meals to charity for every bar that they soldiers Charity Drive

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
I will try it we'll have some fun

26
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,304
It was sitting on my counter

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
I thought to myself

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
Would I enjoy this

29
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
Without an audience

30
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,216
That's a good question would I in

31
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
Enjoy this spice

32
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,312
The crazy hot thing with

33
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712
Without the added element of people watching me eat it sure can I enjoy this without it being

34
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Contact and now we get to know the

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
Exactly

36
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,648
I don't like spicy stuff that much

37
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,464
What half of it alone

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
I thought

39
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,816
Terrible

40
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,936
I don't know if I'm getting older or what it but like it was

41
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
Unpleasant

42
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
I found it to be too much

43
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
It hurt

44
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,408
It's a tall punctured you don't like f****** the spicy things you don't like

45
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:02,784
Seltzer's you're not going to like myself anymore

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
Fake smile

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Is this just you and me I have all these sock puppet account

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,728
Address isn't sending buttons to yes that is a what's going on

49
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,312
I still really like spicy stuff but I don't like

50
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
Really spicy

51
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,504
You know I don't know maybe it was late 20s early 30s I was in a realex

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
Stream spice kind of

53
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:41,440
Place and now I got your picture

54
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
Cheap company

55
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:47,328
I think that maybe it's just over for me for the extreme spicy

56
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
So I will be

57
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Beginning

58
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
A hot

59
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
As opposed to an extra hot

60
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
At the Thai place in the future

61
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
And I think that's okay

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,176
That is okay is accepted

63
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,784
How about you by Brightspot dead is a piano solos

64
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Okay

65
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:12,160
Well actually this is a mix of a grape bright spot

66
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,208
B of A

67
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,303
The outro to Layla.

68
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
I was listening to Yoko

69
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
Econo play the piano solo on I do from the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack

70
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Really good pianos

71
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,359
Solo I can delete the outro from Layla

72
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,943
It's very salonius Monk and it's syncopation it's really really good

73
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,759
And then I was thinking about my favorite pianist

74
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
List of all-time Keith Jarrett

75
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Okay keep Jared I do not

76
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,903
He is a jazz pianist

77
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Who will give these like

78
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
Literally hour-and-a-half-long

79
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,303
Improvise piano Khan

80
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
It's basically just him

81
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
For an hour and a half

82
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,935
388

83
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,751
His music is beautiful and he is in

84
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
Incredible he's a dynamite

85
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
Performer

86
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
And I just found out

87
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
That he had a stroke

88
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
Oh no

89
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,295
Yeah and he's lost the ability to use his right hand or his I can't remember it's one of his hands though so we'll probably never

90
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,671
Never play live again

91
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
I'm telling you he was he is

92
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Incredible

93
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:26,911
So I am pouring one out for for Keith Jarrett hantu

94
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
Recover that's that

95
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
It's very sentimental

96
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
Time. We're wishing the past

97
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,943
Snout into one of his live album I want to transition into a less

98
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
Rain is bad

99
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
I was thinking the whole time you were talking

100
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,087
We've had pianos for a very long time now

101
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
I can't imagine anyone doing anything new with them

102
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
I don't think you're telling me about how great he is

103
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
Ghetto self

104
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,727
How many keys does a piano have

105
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
Simple combinations of 88

106
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
Over any number of measures are they

107
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
I mean some of those sound good

108
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
For the good place

109
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,111
We got a lot of time

110
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
Today's you say that

111
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
Yeah I think I might be done with all music

112
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,631
Wrap it up we got all the musically dude

113
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
Now see here but my brain doesn't work again you're like

114
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,287
Let's talk numbers I like ya wait we've done everything we can with numbers.

115
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
I'm in a wiener

116
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
Headspace

117
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
Whole numbers is infinite

118
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:51,647
Today

119
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,695
16th and 17th 2020 of Dance

120
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
2020

121
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Sounds good

122
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
That's right

123
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
Holyshit

124
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
This is Ben

125
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,079
What 100 episode

126
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,383
I got accepted Suitor later

127
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,783
That's just how it got to go X

128
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,855
Sometimes you need to submit to the universe

129
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Insist on saying this thing

130
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,047
I'm going to be honest I have to accept a little bit like the end of 1984 with

131
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
I just love the government now dance right

132
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,679
I'm bad to the government

133
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
So

134
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
This is a stretch of time

135
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
I think it's a little bit of a stop

136
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
We're talking about

137
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
Week Monday and Tuesday sure and there's a reason

138
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,551
Al Bundy episode will pick up on Wednesday

139
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
And go through the rest of the week

140
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:59,231
Everybody who's listen to this probably already knows Alex has gone down to Atlanta

141
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:04,607
Because there's a protest in to do and he's got to try and stop the Steal

142
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
He's on his

143
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,775
And I kind of feel like that's an extension of the Caravan Alex Went Down to Georgia looking for an election to seal

144
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
What's Happening Here

145
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
I just

146
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
Hold on tonight

147
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Okay

148
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,295
Alex is going to Georgia and

149
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:29,695
Doing all this stuff and I kind of it's not obviously part of the Caravan had to go through Atlanta

150
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
But

151
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,959
It's kind of a kind of has the same spiritual energy is like Infowars on-the-road IRA

152
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:47,359
Will have the sequel of Alex's Adventure in Atlanta.

153
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
Texas back in Austin in studio

154
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
And

155
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Complaining a whole bunch

156
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,039
It's kind of like Steve Coogan and Rob brydon in the trip

157
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Sure

158
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:02,719

184

00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
And then

189
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
Use that generous Spirit text

190
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Breast

191
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:16,351
Music in a way that gets lost it a little bit at the end because of your

192
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,263
You bet

193
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
66

194
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
God

195
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Through

196
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Cheated

197
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,039
This is just logic

198
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
This makes sense

199
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
You can't refute that

200
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
Real done with God

201
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,719
A real dumbass

202
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,791
Is Emma's first clip where we start off the show at

203
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
Alexa

204
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,447
Last episode he had to go off air threat to go off air twice

205
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,287
Cindy he's now switching it up and just going off air as soon as

206
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,311
The show began

207
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
We have massive breaking news

208
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
A few minutes

209
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
To some insiders Hollywood

210
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,343
Stealing Georgia

211
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
Serious this situation is

212
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
We have a path forward

213
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
First I want to play a little bit my speech

214
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
Yesterday Dallas Jones

215
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
Myspace from Saturday

216
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Million

217
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
Trump March

218
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:28,287
After I had close to a million people attitude no no they're not

219
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Estimated game

220
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
He's getting his information on that they're trying to steal Georgia and so as we know by the end of this Alex Wilhite

221
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,903
Atlanta to meet up with Alexander who's going to be

222
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,951
Stop & steal thing great stuff

223
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,815
I wanted to stop you before you started talking about Alex without Georgia

224
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,887
Because I've written the song

225
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,703
I'm sorry for stepping on

226
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,239
You're one of six.

227
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,079
I do think that this episode is not as good as I want

228
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,383
There's not as much happening

229
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
Alex is kind of

230
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
Just talking about how Georgia needs

231
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
What's on his mind

232
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,087
Take it over

233
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
And what have you

234
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
That's all I thought as a bonus

235
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
To the audience appeal to people

236
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,791
I would write my own version of The Devil Went Down to Georgia but that Alec

237
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Saint Alexander

238
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
Do you have a company

239
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
No

240
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
How do I get a piano

241
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Certainly.

242
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
Do the mouth sounds

243
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Alright I'll take that

244
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
Alex Went Down to Georgia he was looking to stop the steal his sales are down

245
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
We came across this young man

246
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Spinning a yarn and

247
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Malik's jumped

248
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
Tell you what

249
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,207
I guess you didn't know it but I'm a bulshit all this to

250
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
And if you care to DARE I'd like to work with you

251
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,607

I need your skills to sell my pills but I'm still better than you

253
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,519
My name's Ally and it might be unwise

254
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,871
Don't join your scam to make some clamps cuz I only have shameful allies

255
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,711
Peter was a little office.

256
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
Perfect so far just keep on rolling

257
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,575
Ali Robin up your threesome push-ups aquitard

258
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,159
Google profit to Macon Georgia and Alex's of blowhard

259
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,487
If this works of money and Renown are all yours

260
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,815
But if you don't

261
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Dope dope

262
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
Go to

263
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,615
Alex and mumbled about his obsession with The Unborn

264
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,479
My pickup.

265
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
I've got to be out of system

266
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
You just do get this from other political podcast

267
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
You just out

268
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,463
Alex mumbled about his obsession with v on board

269
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
And fire flew from his fingertips when equipped

270
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,863
Any push the talk button and it was a static hiss

271
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,447
Replace the battery

272
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,359
Has Alex fumbled

273
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,175
I know you have a million-dollar Studio B

274
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
Go to the boat run boys run

275
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,959
Alex got abused

276
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:44,639
Conclusion

277
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:49,247
Charles here

278
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,831
Alex got a misty look in his eye because he knew he met a friend

279
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,159
Any offered Ally of tiny bullhorn handing it by the speaker end

280
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,999
Can you call Larry Nichols about that Congressional blackmail

281
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,839
And I don't told you want to son-of-a-b**** stop extending Easter sale

282
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
So

283
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
That's

284
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,591
Bethel Music

285
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:22,015
Real hard to do any kind of think you were Cupid struggling I realized

286
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,319
It's just business

287
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
It took me maybe half an hour

288
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,487
Music

289
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,215
Stop the stereo

290
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,055
Bastille dad election

291
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,103
Georgia

292
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
There better be

293
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
This Thursday apparently is the deadline

294
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,063
We're recording this on Thursday

295
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
And I have been on the phone with

296
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
With a lot of different

297
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
And

298
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,071
Purposes

299
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,119
This election could be over for

300
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
President-trump

301
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Thursday

302
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Last

303
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,007
Still not leave office

304
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
There's a fraud is real

305
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,151
Perception of the election has been certified

306
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
Make the road towards

307
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Put a second

308
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Trump

309
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
Taking our country back

310
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
Very hard

311
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,695
Yeah I know s*** that will that will make things more challenging

312
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,559
The process continuing to move along as it's supposed to

313
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Make

314
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Derailing

315
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
The process more

316
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,215
My car being turned into a cube will make it difficult to

317
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
To drive from here on

318
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
That is that is trapped having your wheels taken

319
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,943
Yeah absolutely having my feet

320
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
Cut off

321
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,527
Will really make it harder to

322
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Play

323
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Yes yes

324
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,647
Alex is not the only one is heading down to Georgia

325
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
Of course Ali Alexander

326
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
Is going down there

327
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Some other noted weirdos

328
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,583
Everybody needs

329
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
To go to Georgia I would like to just

330
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
Point out

331
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
Again

332
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
I don't I don't want to keep

333
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,519
Beating a dead horse and I love that Caravan

334
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
Caravan

335
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
To Georgia

336
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
It did

337
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:28,223
And it was wildly successful

338
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,759
Successful in so they need

339
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
To do it again here

340
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Better

341
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
You're in the car

342
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
Heading to the Capitol

343
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
Cambodia

344
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
Unfolding right now

345
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
Give me black people

346
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
Legislature

347
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
The force the governor

348
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
Emergency station

349
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Certified

350
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
Legislature must stand up

351
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
You work for the clintons

352
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Staff

353
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Is the problem

354
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,455
We need funding

355
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,807
Yeah I don't know I find this unconvincing

356
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,599
Uninteresting

357
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,927
Yeah I'm a little bit Blown Away by

358
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,719
The level to which

359
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,767
They're willing to embarrass themselves

360
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
Without dragging my route

361
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
I'm talking about the whole the whole

362
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
The Hulk

363
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,679
Are all teaming up

364
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,471
To make everything sick

365
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Joke

366
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
And it's weird me out

367
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
Because

368
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,359
That suggests to me that we're going to have to escalate

369
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
From sick joke to

370
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
Full-on military takeover or they're just good I don't know you know didn't you notice how I asked

371
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
It's

372
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
Here we go

373
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
Let's ride this

374
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,559
I don't know why everyone's acting like we can just wait and he'll just go

375
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:51,679
Well I think that's one of the good reasons why I'm really glad that our show is about Alice

376
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Alex Jones

377
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
Because at least I know he

378
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Peaceful looks

379
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
I don't know what's going on

380
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,359
In terms of other places and not very scary

381
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,407
So I'd rather not have

382
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,527
You know an opinion the people take you seriously on it sure is I could be wrong

383
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
Right I could misinterpret something

384
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Italics

385
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,439
Totally fine saying he is

386
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
And push

387
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
Extremist

388
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,607
I thought along the way sometimes there's something really fun

389
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Like

390
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,471
It's always fun to write a parody song of The Devil Went Down to Georgia

391
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,775
A lot a lot

392
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Great

393
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,615
Another thing that's fun is when Alex says things like this

394
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,479
The Dollar Tree rolling around like

395
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
Exterminator

396
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,159
Hello my friend

397
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
You got to go away

398
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,975
No be very different villain

399
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,559
Japan and Europe have Daleks

400
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
Doctor Who

401
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Copy.

402
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,935
Sure

403
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,591
Gundam

404
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,503
I want one of those

405
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,087
Right now I want a

406
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
Suavity

407
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,159
Gun transfer

408
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,464
God of War 1

409
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
Barrel

410
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
I love that so much

411
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
Alright Google

412
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
Alright it's programmed

413
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,264
I guess because he's not saying it's someone's

414
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,312
Captaining is robot eyasu

415
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,640
The robot comes up to you

416
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,968
I'd somehow it's in its programming that if you refuse

417
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
It Shakes You Down

418
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,552
Weatherguard retina

419
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,624
Presumably not shooting you if you then agree to get

420
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
Schwab

421
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
Alright

422
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
Here's your swab

423
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
Or here's your gun

424
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
Turns out you're going to choose this one

425
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,656
Carrot stick swab gun

426
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,496
I think why would you even

427
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,032
I would prefer a knife

428
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,872
If you switch from a slob to a knife and it's like

429
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:12,480
One of these is going up your nose today made by doctors

430
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,808
Do I assume we're not prioritize

431
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,416
Alright the head of a

432
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,024
The head of the Mayo Clinic is a real gun nut alright so we're developing this

433
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,864
Robot that specifically to text people for covid-19

434
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,216
Make it so people don't have to risk getting exposed to run tests

435
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
I feel like you didn't answer my only question

436
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,360
Of course it has. I will

437
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
Greenlight

438
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Anything

439
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,712
Is amazing news

440
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm going to need a citation.

441
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,344
Source

442
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
Information on it

443
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
Although I think what he's referring to is that there are robots that are used for like covid testing

444
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
We're countries they've rolled out

445
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,888
How do you combining that with

446
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,936
If there was a crowd control robot

447
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
In China

448
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
From like maybe last

449
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,312
Gear 2 after they were working on that would like give little shocks

450
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,480
Different directions

451
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
The mental images so funny

452
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,344
No I will not

453
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,416
What about now

454
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Read the most

455
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
This is what ticks

456
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
So f****** funny

457
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:40,544
Shootout with a cartoon

458
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,104
Got a robot hand

459
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
Pick them up

460
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,760
Annette it takes your wallet

461
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,672
Alright stop here for a showdown

462
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,256
Has been the fun part of the show at

463
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:04,352
Alex gets into like what sort of Georgia

464
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
Storyline

465
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
This is a big story

466
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
Georgia Secretary of State

467
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,264
Signed

468
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Legal deal

469
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Democrats

470
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Challenging how bad

471
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
Alice

472
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Lottery process

473
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Mail-in ballot

474
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:32,256
This is another classic case of Alex getting a trump talking point it's factually incorrect and then

475
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Spiraling out of

476
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
Control when he's recovering it in

477
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
To something else

478
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:40,704
In this case Trump tweeted about how the Georgia was stealing the election in the third been they

479
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
A consent decree by the secretary of state that quote

480
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
Makes it impossible to

481
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
Checking match signatures on ballots and envelopes

482
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
Etc

483
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
To say quote

484
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,480
They know what they knew they were going to cheat must

485
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,016
Expose real signatures

486
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,112
This dude speeding like a detective in a shity Noir film who's just been shot

487
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
Rolling on a piece of paper

488
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,208
Suppose real signature

489
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,792
Anyway I have no idea how a consent decree would make it impossible for people to

490
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,352
Compare signatures but I guess that's the best drops people can

491
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
Can come up with

492
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,192
Do people like Alex busy and keep people funneling money

493
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,240
Ended up stopping the Steelers or

494
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,592
In reality according to the Associated Press the state absolutely requires

495
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
The match

496
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,408
The issue comes down to this

497
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,808
Cook a lawsuit by the Democratic party which led to the agreement argue that minorities were disproportionately affected when they have

498
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
Heather ballots rejected

499
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Among other things

500
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
Sings the settlement

501
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,208
Set steps for local election officials to notify a voter

502
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,792
IPhone mail or email in a timely fashion about problem

503
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Bums with a signature

504
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,400
Are they really trying to tell me

505
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
That a state

506
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
Governed

507
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
By Kemp

508
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
Has not done enough

509
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
Voter suppression

510
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
It's an interesting

511
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Angle

512
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,968
Yeah I feel like he didn't win the election because it was

513
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
Was free and fair

514
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,296
Summer said that

515
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,648
Like maybe if they were paper ballots we might find out that the results might have been different

516
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,184
It could be

517
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,976
And this is just another legal challenge

518
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
The Trump's Camp is making trying

519
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,608
Block the finalization of the election but it's going to get thrown out just like all the others

520
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:17,728
The only thing I find really interesting here is the dynamic where Alex can't even really understand what the

521
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
Issue is

522
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:22,848
Alex thinks it has to do with deadlines and post that signatures

523
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,200
The legal challenge has to do with whether or not the secretary of state had the authority to make

524
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
The changes that were made

525
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,504
Which word designs

526
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,088
To create more oversight and better handling of signature matches

527
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,440
The suit doesn't seem to even take issue with the actual change that was made

528
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,024
Just it was allegedly made unilaterally and without proper approval

529
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,608
Which is pretty deep in the weeds in terms of legal challenges to an election

530
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:48,448
I'm not surprised Alex doesn't know the details on this I wouldn't make

531
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
Expect them to

532
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,032
It's being aware of how much of a Hail Mary this is

533
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
Would probably be bad for business

534
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
Can you imagine

535
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,968
I believe that right before we started recording this challenge got thrown out

536
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,808
I believe if I if I understand the headline is just saw

537
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,856
Correctly I believe this cases

538
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
Just died got thrown out the moment

539
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
The judge realized that it was written in color

540
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,424
Can you imagine if that's what if they've all the sudden they were like all the Secretary of State didn't do it right so Trump is president again

541
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
That's that's

542
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,544
How it goes. That's how it's going to work for anyone I wouldn't assume it would

543
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,896
Obviously knowing this is week

544
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
Alex

545
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
Recommend

546
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,992
Course of a door

547
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,296
Is investing in Conroe box

548
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
I lied

549
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
Everyone must go

550
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,928
To the capital of Georgia now

551
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
Round the governor's mansion

552
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
Rodger Stone

553
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
Other people

554
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Call the White House

555
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
To go

556
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
Get on a freaking airplane

557
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
Capital Georgia ago

558
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,896
End of the governor's mansion

559
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,200
Stop

560
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,760
To see people power and this will do it

561
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,832
Yeah it's a great idea live Trump storm the

562
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:13,696
Governor's Mansion the great idea idea

563
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,232
The only thing that would be

564
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:20,864
Better episode that one is a great idea he should do that everybody in the Senate

565
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Stabbed him once

566
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,448
I do love the idea that he's like

567
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,216
I'm coming

568
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,032
Georgia and I'm f****** bring it Rodger stone with me

569
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,104
I want I want him to be like

570
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,664
And we're going to settle this election

571
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,040
Buy single comment combat 204 we have Rodger Stone in this card

572
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:43,136
The camera pans over

573
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,232
Play Glenn Elliott

574
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,048
Girl fight whoever you f****** world

575
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,376
I will only fight if Eliot Spitzer's dad

576
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,960
Come again

577
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,240
Gina

578
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,136
Security in DC for a job

579
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Gyros

580
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,464
Having proud boys

581
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Launch

582
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,840
I see this is the thing that I'm talking about how is it that we have

583
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,168
The juxtaposition of Rudy Giuliani melting like a f******

584
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,960
Candle in front of us with

585
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,520
Enrico Tauriel being like what if we killed all the left

586
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,944
Enrique tarrio is clearly trying to learn a little bit about

587
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,712
PR

588
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:44,064
Because he's doing some heavy lifting on this appearance

589
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,392
Trying to give the okay we just like to hang out

590
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,208
You know the boys were just like a drinking Club

591
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:57,888
We'll just let anybody in

592
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
Stickman

593
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
Extensive background searches

594
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
Whatever the case

595
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,824
He's trying to make it look much more respectable

596
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,616
And Alex is actually the one who

597
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
Kind of ruining

598
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,992
When somebody when a man's down I don't want to keep it

599
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,136
Women and children

600
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,048
So Alex seems to be the one who's

601
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,096
Who sings this towards even more

602
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,656
Street seems like a nerd

603
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,496
Talking to a bully

604
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,800
How you kick their ass

605
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,688
Good thing you're not blowing me

606
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,368
Do you know what IUD people up I kind of know what's the job it's got it that's the end of the site.

607
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,184
Cheese's

608
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:59,840
You know what we're trying to do is just show that we're we're a group of normal people like everyone else I mean we have our own political

609
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
Local beliefs

610
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,936
We do is we get together and we just share Community just like we do

611
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,728
I think you should kill people

612
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
Delhi okay

613
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,312
So much bad press

614
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
A lot of our members

615
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,176
Turn out to be real crazy

616
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,296
We do a lot of background checks but apparently not on that kind of

617
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,624
Kind of cereals

618
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,648
Exactly

619
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
The deal

620
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,584
We're trying not to do all that s*** publicly all this stuff about kicking people when they're down

621
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,120
Look different

622
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,168
I know The Oath Keepers

623
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:39,008
And your buddy still roads kind of lead into that we're going to kill you stuff

624
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
That's great where different

625
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,080
Alex Alex

626
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
Text Buddy

627
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,616
There two ways

628
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
We're going

629
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Underground my

630
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:51,552
We're going to survive and then we'll kill people again in 10 years or for whatever will be will make it through this

631
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,880
We're not going to go out to guns blazing today

632
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
This is like

633
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
What if we're not

634
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,512
I think if I had to guess

635
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
I think it's

636
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
Just like

637
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,144
Glass half-full half-empty in terms of the DC rally

638
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
I think that Alex is trying to play it like

639
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,472
Half full

640
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:14,080
Like we are going to take over the world that you almost there

641
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,872
What's weather like

642
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:21,248
Yeah it was a lot of people but it wasn't that money and we can't take over the world of this many people had enough

643
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,040
Yeah not enough to maybe

644
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,600
Brian put on a face of respect

645
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
Stability

646
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
Or invite General

647
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,720
Patras and see if he'll do us a solid

648
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:34,304
Boom so Alex is impressed that I don't

649
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,096
Know if this is actually true I think it's

650
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,120
It's not but Alex

651
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
Thinks that no one is ever going to

652
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
Filtrate of The Proud boys

653
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
I don't think that's

654
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,032
True but he has a theory as to why

655
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
And I think it's pretty fun

656
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,664
How you guys accept organization infiltration free

657
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,088
How do people get involved with boys and

658
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
Operation Freedom

659
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,464
You looking at me for the devil worshiping vampires

660
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,048
Canterbury School

661
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,608
Yeah too Macho to infiltrate you know

662
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,216
Yeah leftist we just can't look Macho enough.

663
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
That's worth something

664
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,104
So I think that Alex is a pretty consistent

665
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
Thread going over

666
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,200
Just like really gaslighting as audiences

667
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
Crowd size

668
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,760
He's talking about like it's

669
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:31,904
Straight up maybe even a million people they're tough to sell

670
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:38,816
Event incredible getting Gavin again is lined up dealing with

671
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
Appreciation

672
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:46,752
First of all Skype issues not a surprise

673
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,104
We're we're really trying to infiltrate the

674
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,176
I have this I had this interesting experience while I was

675
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,968
Episode

676
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
Largely

677
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Okay

678
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:02,112
We're just going to interview bunch of people with proud Boys in

679
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,136
Extremist

680
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
I'm not interested

681
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,744
Who else wants

682
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
Start a war

683
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,560
You want to start a war yeah

684
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:15,168
Okay yeah I'm not super interested except for just to say like yeah okay

685
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:21,568
Having the whole conversation is largely about everyone's

686
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
Got to go to Georgia

687
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,920
I think this is bad but I also don't respect

688
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,480
Gavin at all

689
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:33,344
I don't I don't not refuse not interesting he's not funny he doesn't say anything

690
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,416
So are they trying to drum up likes

691
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:41,792
Support from the proud boys like Hey we're focusing on the Proud boys the proud boys need to go to it

692
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Anna is that like there

693
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,424
The idea here no I think they're just trying to show a stiff upper lip

694
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:53,824
Insertive like you can come to Atlanta because the proud boys will be there to fight with you

695
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,384
Short case s*** goes bad or something

696
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,432
I think that's kind of a lot of them

697
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,736
Stop being a coward

698
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
You'll have don't have your back

699
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,576
I'm so Alex

700
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
Enrique 2

701
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
Define the MoMA

702
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,672
Keep doing this

703
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
He asked

704
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
Define the moment

705
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,560
And then something very

706
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
Very familiar happen

707
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:21,216
Taking over probably if you haven't started as an idea to promote family and man and

708
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:25,568
Attorney in area

709
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,152
Kellogg

710
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,456
Hundreds of antifa

711
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
You call

712
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,344
Enrique tarrio this just right now

713
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,912
Sorry that was my fault

714
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:59,616
Cool that happens multiple times I think there's some issues

715
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,920
Gavin shows up

716
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
I find him

717
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,528
Insufferable

718
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,552
Yes

719
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,600
I just wanted to

720
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,904
Say that I'm thrilled that he's decided

721
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
To give up

722
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
We proved it this weekend

723
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,000
The we are on the side

724
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
That's right

725
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
And they are on the side of what's wrong

726
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,864
And if you can't see that now

727
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
I give up

728
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
Congratulations

729
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
Good good

730
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Please

00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:28,800
Please give up didn't didn't Kevin come on Alex's show like a year ago saying

732
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,360
F*** this

733
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
The point

734
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,968
Nothing nothing expresses

735
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
You know just like

736
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
Leader

737
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,856
More than any time you lose Hootie deciding

738
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:46,208
To quit Moody lash out

739
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,256
Absolutely

740
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,792
A lot of people with

741
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,816
Listen to that

742
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
And say I would die for that

743
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Anyway

744
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,680
Tucker Gavin

745
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,704
Owen Shroyer

746
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,008
Leader of the Caravan comes in

747
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,544
And they talk about their

748
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
Huge crowd

749
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
Daddy

750
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,176
Doan you did the Carolinas for the South

751
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
DC

752
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,832
The police that we talked to estimated cuz I was a 200,000 that Days please listen to Adele Someone spot

753
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,904
Going back to the beginning of it

754
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,720
Three-and-a-half miles

755
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
Annoying people

756
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,888
What would you describe

757
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,496
Images I've seen sad

758
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
Morphe

759
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,848
People in attendance Andy million

760
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,384
March

761
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
From the images

762
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,712
I've seen of your

763
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736
Caravan

764
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
I've done

765
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064
Stand up for large crowd

766
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,368
Was a failure

767
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
Oh yeah

768
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
You

769
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
I don't know

770
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,560
I don't care but relative size of the Million Man March either

771
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,632
They seem really hung up on that really want to make sure that this March

772
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,680
Which is better than other black people's March

773
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,776
It seemed it seemed like a perfect

774
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:08,384
Seems like a sticking point they brought it up a couple time

775
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,688
I would ask you Jordan how do you

776
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,224
How do you define the

777
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
How do I de

778
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,064
Define the time this moment

779
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,624
I would say pathetic

780
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,184
It is sad pathetic

781
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
That's what I would say that the

782
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
The human race

783
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
Has

784
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
Responded brilliantly

785
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
Terribly

786
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,888
At the same time

787
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,424
To the point where

788
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,728
Man I'm really hoping

789
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,544
We lose 98% of people and get the reefs

790
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,360
Do you know what I'm saying the 98% of reefs lost

791
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
That's a tragic

792
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
That's not great

793
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,272
Owen has had a revelation

794
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
This doesn't seem like a revelation

795
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,904
Seems like very similar to

796
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,488
Catchphrase of Ben Shapiro's kind of

797
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
He Democrat

798
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,792
Body politic

799
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,192
Emotional

800
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,800
Live in reality million people out there nobody got covid nobody got sick I'm riding back in the air

801
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,104
Define laughing about the dumbass thing

802
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
Don't kick me off of

803
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,456
Flats

804
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:20,576
So it's far too soon to know what kind of effect that DC rally is going to have on covid rates

805
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:24,160
But it's not discuss broader trends that we seen from past event

806
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,512
If Trump's rallies throughout 2020 or any indication

807
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
Eat those words

808
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
It's in the future once

809
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,584
Data is available

810
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:35,680
Purple released in October by the center for American progress said quote

811
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:42,080
Analysis by the center for American progress find said about half of the president's 22 campaign rallies held between June and said

812
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:46,176
September 4th followed by county-level increase in covid-19 cases

813
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,968
Suggesting the events May have life

814
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
Community spread

815
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,392
I don't have data on the recent rally nor does anyone yet but I mostly cut out that clip cuz I have a hunch

816
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,440
Watch that Owens going to look pretty bad in hindsight

817
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
As well.

818
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,768
Crazy from from like

819
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,816
I blocked up to the Supreme Court

820
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,632
You're here packed in like sardines I mean it neither

821
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,168
You can barely even breathe

822
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,520
Poor choice of words I would say

823
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,360
Shall we end the 16th

824
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,176
70

825
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,480
And this is a business

826
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,504
This is really strange.

827
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Beginning

828
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
First of all

829
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,320
Screws up his

830
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,344
His whole thing

831
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:29,952
This whole time. Between the election in the inauguration what are you what it what is it

832
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,256
79 days of hell

833
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
79 days in hell

834
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
The countdown

835
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,864
Day after the election

836
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
78 days I have left

837
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
Alex Cruz

838
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
Goes backwards

839
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,384
64 other 79 days in hell, does China and its dual

840
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,968
War allies are desperately trying to overthrow the election

841
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,296
President Trump I understand that it's an easy mistake to make

842
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
No one cares about the

843
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:00,928
Has accepted you caught on it's not it's not

844
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,584
No one's going to remember 10 years from now all your member the 79 days of how you're the one who's pushing is really hard

845
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,656
Do you have to actually get it right you can't say where updates

846
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:14,496
64 valve there is a little bit left

847
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,544
Little bit

848
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,944
End on the 30th

849
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,272
It is fine but it's not

850
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
No

851
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
Pennywise

852
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,648
There was a weird sound

853
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:36,000
I mean like poor quality sound or anything like I really felt like Alex's

854
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
It sounded like he was reading a commercial

855
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
Beginning of this episode

856
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,472
The mainline Republican party is the truth of the New World Order and world government

857
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
Tucker Carlson

858
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,544
DJ

859
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
Opportunist

860
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
Persian

861
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,919
Copying

862
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Your truly

863
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
As

864
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
Macon

865
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
The Mac Ranch

866
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,855
When it comes to culture War

867
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,255
We are winning

868
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
Cidnet

869
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:14,143
Yeah take a promo trailer

870
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:20,543
Those LaFontaine all the way and I was really thrown by it cuz it just seems like what is going

871
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,871
Going on and goes to couple Lake pre-recorded report

872
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,895
Realized

873
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,175
Heated wasn't there

874
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,479
That was pretty important

875
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,759
Alex

876
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,295
18 minutes into the episode

877
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,623
Thank you so much for joining us

878
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,391
Plenty of

879
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,439
Broadcast

880
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,535
Was 6:05 Minnesota Carlson but he knocked it out of the

881
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,375
I guess he was getting more in

882
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,399
Information about Georgia

883
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,935
Or something

884
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
There's an interesting dynamic

885
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
What's going on

886
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
Alex is crazy

887
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,615
And all this stuff is nonsense

888
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
I think he's benefiting

889
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
From qanon

890
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
Quite a bit

891
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
Cuz you know you remember

892
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,039
The day that Dynamic that existed

893
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,063
You know it is

894
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,087
Previous time

895
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,159
Between people like Fox News and Glenn Beck

896
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:14,047
Alex Jones Justified Glenn Beck being crazy I'm not Alex Jones

897
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,375
You hear about you was able to sanitize himself and make

898
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,167
Himself seem more palatable

899
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,239
To a wider audience bulshit launderer

900
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:28,639
Because there was somebody could be like I'm not that guy exact I'm stepping on that guy in order to make myself look respectable

901
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,735
I think Alex now has qanon to be like I'm not qanon

902
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:37,599
That's a fair point and because everything has just gotten

903
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
So much worse

904
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,671
In terms of public discourse

905
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,463
Filtering information

906
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,487
Like I think

907
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,023
I think he's able to like

908
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:51,167
Take advantage of people thinking they like there's only one person who's wrong time

909
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:56,031
Whatever not realizing qanon and Alexandra

910
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,311
You think you think

911
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,335
Qanon selfie

912
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,127
Who's going to

913
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,151
Become leaderless

914
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,687
And they're going to be like

915
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
Hey baby will go back to

916
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
Alex Jones

917
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
No

918
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,575
I don't I don't know I don't know what the predictive it but I think

919
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,879
Make that most of those people are two pills

920
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,463
Seattle back to Alec to go back to the lights

921
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,559
Yeah I think they would find it a little bit

922
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,119
Point actually find it on gratifying

923
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,423
You know Alex is late

924
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,215
Yeah starting to show 14 minutes

925
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,031
Or whatever he did say videos of Newport

926
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Tough talk about

927
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,871
Now generally when is important things to talk about

928
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,663
Bizarre fantasies

929
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
Notions

930
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
Things he's misremembering

931
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
Half-baked anything

932
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
Am I one of my favorite things

933
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:46,207
Is reporting Twitter comments as if their new desk

934
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,351
P.m. at the future had upstate

935
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
Country

936
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,191
Have been openly promoting the global economic forum

937
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,239
Initiative for months already

938
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,127
Mentioned or disgusting

939
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,943
Cuz you're a slave you're not supposed to see all that info

940
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:12,831
Supposed to be

941
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Before

942
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
Never consciously

943
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,951
Understand

944
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:24,095
So this is really standard bulshit but I think it highlights something that's really interesting within like Alex and his resurrection

945
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:30,495
You can easily find articles discussing the ideas presented by Klaus Schwab and references by name to quote the

946
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,263
The great reset

947
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,079
Immediate going back to early this year after his book

948
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Was published

949
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:40,479
Just a simple Google search shows that before July there were articles in

950
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,551
Forbes and plenty of international Outlet

951
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
This is the same thing

952
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:50,207
As why aren't there any Muslim voices denouncing terrorism

953
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
You didn't look

954
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,023
For it you assume it's not there

955
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,303
And now you're making out

956
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,119
Conspiracy out of the idea that you haven't found anywhere

957
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,727
There plenty of people talking about these ideas they were just not places you were interested in

958
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,031
They weren't in Publications that you

959
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:08,639
Maybe normally read the hill is publicly available to their the articles are there

960
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,943
If you wanted to if you had any interest

961
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
That discussions there

962
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,807
No one's hiding anything from you you can

963
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,855
Type questions into the Google

964
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
Search bar true

965
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,159
So if he's like

966
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,695
Giving you one of those rhetoric

967
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
Questions like

968
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
How come no one's talking

969
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,255
Think about this

970
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,535
You could type in like

971
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
How come no one's talking about this

972
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,631
And you would have to fill in

973
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:35,519
I think that what's going on is a Miss phrasing of what they believe or what they

974
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,799
Experience as the

975
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
Sure

976
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,359
They want these ideas

977
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,919
To be yelled on the front page of every paper

978
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,711
That is what they

979
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
Think

980
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,015
They Merit

981
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
It's so important

982
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
Exactly

983
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,599
In the same way that all of Alex's

984
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:55,231
Conspiracies never take the media is not covering XYZ like there's an article about why you're wrong about this everywhere

985
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,767
You can find it if you want

986
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
They just want

987
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,583
This like the coverage

988
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,143
The same thing with like no and no one covers

989
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,447
The truck being good at finding

990
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,495
Articles and Publications about good things

991
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:13,407
Did no-one is bowing down back

992
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,175
2

993
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,527
They're covering these ideas in a real-world way as opposed to your way

994
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,599
Because that isn't your view isn't being

995
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,647
Shouted from the rooftops

996
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,463
Experience as a cover-up and that's just not

997
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
That's not accurate

998
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,815
They're not saying what I want them to say so they're not covering it all

999
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Exactly

1000
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,655
And I'm not going to look for the articles that would

1001
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,703
Prove my point wrong

1002
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,983
And it depends

1003
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,079
For business

1004
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,871
Phenomenon right now because

1005
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,151
Alex is reading someone

1006
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,175
Tweet yeah

1007
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
That's

1008
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,551
Is there any bad take you can

1009
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
Find

1010
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
On Twitter

1011
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,623
Like you can find

1012
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,183
The Scituate that's the corollary to your lies about

1013
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
The piano

1014
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,487
Bees are too good

1015
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Resorts

1016
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,351
Yeah for the environment

1017
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
Exactly

1018
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:09,727
There's no oil executive someone who hasn't tweeted out like let's kill all the bees so I don't

1019
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,775
I have to be with flowers anymore

1020
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,359
Trying to think of a take that isn't on their candy sucks

1021
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,639
Snow someone doesn't like

1022
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,431
Nope definitely there it's all there man

1023
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:23,807
It's all there if you want to find a bad take you just search it into Twitter it was somebody's bad

1024
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,343
Of course

1025
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,135
Do you know where are comes from

1026
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:33,023
Busch Gardens

1027
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,095
Stardew Valley Alexander shows up

1028
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:40,703
And this is actually really interesting to like that last clip

1029
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,983
Really Devon

1030
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,287
Once traded this sort of phenomenon of like not look

1031
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,335
Looking for evidence and then claiming there's apps

1032
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
Evidence of something

1033
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,407
This is another really in

1034
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,967
Interesting thing that Alex and his people do quite a bit

1035
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
Really

1036
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,807
Appreciative of all the Grassroots work out there

1037
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,671
Teachers are Coalition partners are always willing to work with anyone

1038
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,999
More than people go get

1039
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:10,655
Right

1040
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:14,495
We care about winning the Electoral College and getting Donald Trump above 270

1041
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,431
We secured the permit and then decided

1042
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Alex can't speak

1043
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,271
This person can speak in that person can't speak

1044
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:33,439
Come out later

1045
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:38,559
But you know we're not going to tolerate our movement behind the White House

1046
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,423
That's the reason these ladies are

1047
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,615
Georgia featuring is a blue state

1048
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
Any misspelled Georgia

1049
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:59,551
You and I were first to announce on our independent channels

1050
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,255
Casting freaks

1051
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,055
You really want

1052
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,591
What's going on

1053
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:27,455
It is that women for America first group got the

1054
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,503
Petitioner got the department

1055
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:34,623
Yeah and they organized the actual event and had a list of speakers that shouldn't include

1056
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,415
People like Alex

1057
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,463
Well they organized

1058
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,791
Well there were a lot of people who also

1059
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:46,911
Decided to descend on Washington at the same time

1060
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:52,287
Party crashers are actually more integral to the party by Diplo willing to

1061
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:58,175
There is no party without the crash Iraq that doesn't sound true but I guess I have to believe you I don't have any evidence

1062
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,223
Why isn't anybody talking about this

1063
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,063
Are you find this fast

1064
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:08,159
Because it's the same thing with like OK freedomworks America

1065
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,439
For prosperity

1066
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,999
Coke money Coke funds

1067
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,815
Astroturfed a ton of

1068
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,399
The tea party ended early days

1069
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,679
Amanda Alex

1070
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
Glommed onto it and then

1071
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,519
Accuse them of taking his move

1072
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,335
I meant exactly what he's doing here

1073
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,687
Ezz and they won't let them hijack their height

1074
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,991
He's crashed this thing

1075
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,527
In d.c.

1076
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:40,159
They rightfully probably like this is going to be tough to deal with

1077
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:43,231
I understand maybe Alex speaking

1078
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,767
But Alex is Buddy

1079
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,815
I don't know about this

1080
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,863
And then they have the temerity

1081
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,959
To get on this show and accused the people who are the actual organizers

1082
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,031
Stealing varuven

1083
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:00,639
To be like they do present well

1084
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,175
Like Alex

1085
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,479
Do they really want to like

1086
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:07,551
I have these clips available just whenever I'm

1087
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
I'm just like

1088
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,647
Women for Trump and it's like man

1089
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,927
You guys don't get it

1090
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
The moment you say

1091
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
Step out of line

1092
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,767
You're no longer

1093
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,535
For Trump

1094
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,863
Just women to them and you know how they treat

1095
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
Blanket chest with

1096
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:22,911
It's

1097
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
It is

1098
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,239
Kind of kind of shocking

1099
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,519
He like

1100
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,055
So fast you could

1101
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,591
Not have organized

1102
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
That event

1103
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,383
Alex

1104
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,663
You could not have

1105
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,943
We saw the Caravan

1106
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,479
Exactly

1107
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,271
Saw what you were capable of

1108
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,087
The combined work of a ton of grifters

1109
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,879
Added to the

1110
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,671
Population

1111
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,975
They came to DC

1112
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
The actual

1113
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,791
Avent

1114
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,863
And people having a reason to be there

1115
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,399
Was done by the work of the

1116
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,423
The people who you are

1117
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
Computer

1118
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,239
And that's why

1119
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
Diaper if you're on the right

1120
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,311
Stop crying

1121
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
Stop it

1122
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,383
Stop organizing these things

1123
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,711
The people who want to come and get up there and yell and make you look bad

1124
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,991
And steal all your thunder

1125
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,039
Are going to s*** on you later

1126
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,319
Yeah you're being used

1127
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
Party time

1128
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
Oh well

1129
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,439
Anyway Alex's friend

1130
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,559
Alex is talking to Allie and he wants to know why

1131
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,839
Is Georgia so important

1132
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:31,263
Why Georgia Stokes

1133
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,287
Gorgeous

1134
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,103
How you doing there buddy

1135
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,895
3 long pods

1136
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,663
Alex

1137
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,967
Alex we lost you

1138
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,991
Alex

1139
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,015
Alex is Misha

1140
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,295
In command

1141
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
Control

1142
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
Weird

1143
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,023
Alright

1144
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,303
Commercial

1145
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,375
I thought that was really strange oven if he just went out

1146
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,703
Yeah and I don't know what happened when they come back

1147
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,495
But here's the thing

1148
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:06,079
I know that probably online that didn't happen

1149
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,383
Sure but I'm listening to it through

1150
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:13,503
The feed that goes to all of the radio station that play Alex around the country

1151
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,063
This is what syndicated to shortwave to

1152
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,111
Whoever's listening it just cut out

1153
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,647
What is

1154
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,415
I'm a psycho

1155
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,719
If that's an audience you care about that

1156
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Certainly

1157
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,535
Not great

1158
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Could

1159
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
Really fit

1160
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
Dixie's Brown

1161
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,375
Maybe not

1162
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
It's doable

1163
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,935
I don't know

1164
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,959
Why let's go

1165
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,519
Alex wants to know where

1166
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:42,175
Hiding I like Howard he always was Alexander

1167
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,735
Blanca's question from

1168
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,831
Because that's his bully pulpit power he still has why has he been so

1169
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,391
I won the election yesterday

1170
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,071
So the rallies were going to come and then there was a cop

1171
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
Compromise reached

1172
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,631
Inside the White House so I'm just

1173
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,423
That is my first time talking about it

1174
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,031
I start making their way through the

1175
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,847
Trump is not want to

1176
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
Position himself

1177
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,407
What can hold a tweet against him

1178
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,943
Or a rally against him

1179
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
And so

1180
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,735
Hey sweetie

1181
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,759
Concentrate

1182
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:22,367
Counterpoint Alex just said that he tweeted the other day that I won the election

1183
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,183
Victory fraudulently

1184
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,975
Calling him a dictator but he's afraid

1185
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,559
Ridiculous

1186
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,863
Held during the

1187
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,423
The band The terrorism Bandit was described as the

1188
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,215
Muslim ban

1189
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,775
Kinston

1190
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,799
Cachapa trying to play

1191
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,335
Play the legal strategies tomorrow

1192
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,103
Counterpoint

1193
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,127
Trump tweeted

1194
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:50,527
I want really smart strategy iPhone

1195
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,063
Antifa scum

1196
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,927
Your story doesn't hold water Ali

1197
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,255
You can make up all the fantasy

1198
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,535
Fiction that you want

1199
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,071
But Trump has a giant

1200
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,351
Cowardly loser

1201
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:11,007
And I holding

1202
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,287
He does now he wasn't

1203
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,567
Want to get out there

1204
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,847
He wants to do his rallies

1205
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,383
There's plans to do rallies

1206
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,711
Anytime stop Bastille. Us

1207
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,503
Opposing rallies

1208
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
Capital

1209
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:23,807
Full-time

1210
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:27,135
Until the Electoral College meet to maybe after that maybe after that

1211
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:27,903
Maybe

1212
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,927
We never get this

1213
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,695
Country back to them

1214
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,999
If it's calling at the Electoral College

1215
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,023
Is fun but

1216
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,583
I don't care

1217
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,167
What are you doing is

1218
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:42,239
Trump wants to come out and say hi to the people you lost

1219
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:45,311
To be the figurehead but he can't be he's got to play it smart cuz record

1220
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,359
So for now it's just me

1221
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:51,711
But here's my website so we can have demonstrations

1222
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,247
Capital

1223
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,807
And never give the country back whatever that mean

1224
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:59,647
She idolized I get it and I understand why everybody is like

1225
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:03,999
Mocking this

1226
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,559
Dislike

1227
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,583
This is just a griffin

1228
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
Turn all that stuff

1229
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
What it's like

1230
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,167
This script is going to run out

1231
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:18,079
Fatal just stop it when the grift runs out they create a new Griff and whatever they need to do

1232
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,383
Whatever they need to do they will do to

1233
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,407
Continue that

1234
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,455
Not a joke

1235
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,735
Right right right

1236
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,527
It is primarily

1237
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,319
A scam people like Alex

1238
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,599
Somalia running

1239
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
B

1240
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,647
The scam

1241
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,951
If taken seriously

1242
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
It's super

1243
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,999
Verify

1244
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,583
In the past when it's been a scam

1245
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
Civilians

1246
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,679
And normal people

1247
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
You know it

1248
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,007
It's awful and it is what it is

1249
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,799
It's a game where you get hurt

1250
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
The world

1251
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
Yeah yeah yeah

1252
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
The world

1253
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
That's too much

1254
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,479
Now I've had a theory

1255
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,271
This whole time

1256
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:01,343
But Alexander was working with Rodger Stone

1257
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:05,695
Stop a steel because it is the same name as Rodger Stone

1258
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
Alleged

1259
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,047
Pool watching organization from 2016

1260
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:14,143
And I didn't actually do any further research on if they just told me he was

1261
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,703
Olly Alexander a great political analyst

1262
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,239
The publisher

1263
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,287
Is here with us he's been a tireless fighter

1264
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,103
Was Rodger Stone starting

1265
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:29,759
I don't understand

1266
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
Okay

1267
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,807
So I was right

1268
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,111
Is all connected

1269
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,159
If Alex has to be believed which

1270
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,183
She's usually not

1271
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,767
But this seems like something that makes total sense

1272
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
How does Rodger

1273
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,327
There's domain

1274
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,399
He registered it now he's

1275
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,679
He's taking his cut

1276
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,215
No doubt he

1277
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:49,983
He's taking a cut

1278
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,031
I'm here here's the

1279
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:54,335
Nothing if if this is a conspiracy

1280
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,919
Conspirators can be charged with every aspect

1281
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,199
Active a crime Rico

1282
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,503
Exactly

1283
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,039
So

1284
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,879
Is Ali follow through with his plan Rodger might be in trouble

1285
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
Tweak out our plan Alex

1286
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:10,975
We're going to

1287
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:14,303
Virtual

1288
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,607
Alex and I will feel the street

1289
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:23,263
Million Patriots

1290
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,943
Insurrectionist

1291
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,247
We know how to deal with that

1292
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,527
We will bring trucks

1293
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,599
Now is the time

1294
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
A Georgia

1295
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,391
Occupied

1296
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
DC.

1297
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,695
So apparently

1298
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,463
The plan

1299
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,047
Is occupying DC what you're going to get bored very quickly Alex

1300
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,071
You have no

1301
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:51,167
Ability to run anything like this no interest in anything that

1302
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,447
Especially once

1303
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,751
The cameras stop

1304
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,799
It does kind of occupations is that

1305
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,847
I get boring after awhile

1306
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:05,503
People make coverage broke up and then there's a long periods where there are cameras

1307
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,295
Sending you don't have you're not built for that

1308
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,575
So now you're not going to do that

1309
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,623
But assuming that you do

1310
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,183
You're not going to get 5 million people to come to DC

1311
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,719
That is not going to happen

1312
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,791
Let's imagine what's going to happen

1313
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,327
If you try and inaugurate a second

1314
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,607
President now that'll work

1315
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,143
Dark pope

1316
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,495
We'll have to poke somebody will dig up Biden's remains and put them on trial of the

1317
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:34,687
Remember my middle evil medieval warfare history I don't remember

1318
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,711
People like

1319
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,735
Writing down

1320
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,527
CJ's where our favorite pie

1321
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,807
You know

1322
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:43,135
4 months of waiting for supply lines to catch up

1323
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,671
Sitting there going hungry

1324
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:49,023
Not fighting anybody. I think I think Alex wants his listeners

1325
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
To do that

1326
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:53,119
While buying survival food from him

1327
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:57,727
Of course and then Alex will show up with a bullhorn every now and again and take credit for everything

1328
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,287
Like medieval kings fighting a washer

1329
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,847
I just try and think

1330
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
Think about like

1331
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,663
What in the real world would that look

1332
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,711
Is Alex

1333
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,735
First of all

1334
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:12,063
It's a leap to imagine 5 million people show up

1335
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,903
So let them add let's stipulate that 5 million do show up

1336
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:21,279
Now they decide they're going to inaugurate Trump is no he lost the election

1337
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,119
I guess we divided up

1338
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,143
Territories

1339
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,959
I don't know

1340
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,263
The Mind reels

1341
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:36,383
Guess Steve pieczenik might get a job I'm telling you I

1342
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,687
I just telling you we just got to isolate him

1343
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:42,783
We just got into isolated we give them we give them all Alaska it's

1344
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:49,183
The biggest stadiums old werewolf treatments take all of these take all of them and say you know what

1345
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,719
We agree with everything you're

1346
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,999
We love what's

1347
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:57,631
Going on going to say we're starting a pilot

1348
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:01,215
We want to put your ideas into action but we're not sure cuz they're not

1349
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
Tried-and-tested

1350
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:05,311
We want to move all conservatives to Alaska

1351
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,335
And you guys just

1352
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:12,991
Work it out there and then bring it back to us whenever you're ready I feel like this is not fair to the people who live in Alaska

1353
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,015
No that's true

1354
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,063
Oh well

1355
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,623
The moon will give will give alaskans Hawaii

1356
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
Who

1357
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,487
To Japan

1358
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:27,071
Book everything

1359
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,399
It's trouble so let's leave that aside for another day

1360
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
Alex

1361
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:34,495
Gets if he's been doing that on this episode to his Brian stelter impression

1362
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,775
Oh that's just great

1363
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,311
Not a good impression

1364
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,615
Now it's really funny because apparently it's not his

1365
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,623
Hours and hours of evidence today it's ridiculous

1366
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,839
Hokkaido

1367
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,375
I don't either

1368
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,191
Alex told Brian

1369
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,543
Makes me feel like an

1370
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,079
These people is what

1371
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:10,847
Play laugh at

1372
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:11,871
Yeah like

1373
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,151
Was that that

1374
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:13,919
Funny

1375
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,967
What did you laugh at all

1376
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,759
What did you laugh

1377
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,063
Was it just that he did a voice

1378
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,087
I think so

1379
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,879
And if so

1380
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:29,791
Yeah well I mean I think is that that was one of the challenges of

1381
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:30,815
Doing stand-up

1382
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,583
Was

1383
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,351
First of all not

1384
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,655
Thinking the things that I said we're that funny

1385
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,471
That's the audience agreeing

1386
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:43,103
And then you know things that I eat saw other people say that weren't all that funny

1387
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,151
And audiences thinking they were hilarious

1388
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,943
People have different

1389
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,015
Sense of humor there's no accounting for that and it's bewildering

1390
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,599
I do agree with you that the stuff on Infowars

1391
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,879
State is humorous

1392
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,647
2000

1393
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,439
Like a folks were on as guest

1394
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,999
It's worse than anyting

1395
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:03,583
Most things that I've seen at comedy shows

1396
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,863
Really does because

1397
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
Comedy

1398
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,167
You know you've seen every

1399
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,983
Kind of obscene the gamut of

1400
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,775
People trying to be funny

1401
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,055
All lacrosse

1402
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,823
Keyboard

1403
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,103
And even they

1404
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,639
I have nothing

1405
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,919
There's nothing like

1406
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:23,039
This is just a series of people who only understand each other and laugh at

1407
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,063
These weird things

1408
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:25,855
Divorce

1409
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,623
From

1410
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,671
Real

1411
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:35,839
Yeah so much of comedy and so much of what you find funny is the ability to

1412
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,375
Shared

1413
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,655
Perceptions

1414
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,703
Ideas

1415
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,751
And I think once people have

1416
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,031
Such fractured

1417
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:49,151
The reality is that they live in it make sense that you were wouldn't translate at all

1418
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:56,575
At sad how did you make a joke about the sun rising if they're like weird

1419
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:59,391
It's dark all the time and then I got to be tough there's no SharePoint

1420
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,183
Commonality

1421
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,511
I'm sorry this expert Valley yells that he signing his death warrant

1422
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,071
He's going to fight this thing all the way to his grave

1423
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,375
And show all of these guys on soap

1424
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,167
Proud to be working with you Alex and you add

1425
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,959
Got to rush the gate

1426
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,799
The Barbarians that rushed the gates in the castle

1427
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,871
It's really that simple

1428
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,711
It's liberty oryx death

1429
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,015
I think you're in the same boat

1430
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,159
Well I'm like that I'm total commitment every cell in my body is Tamanna music

1431
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,951
I just remembered

1432
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:38,559
Money got sued by Chobani and Alex said I will fight that are backed I will

1433
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:44,959
Woodwind or I will die I will win at other week later

1434
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:45,983
That I did

1435
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,263
I will win or die

1436
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,311
That's a you-know-what

1437
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,335
Error

1438
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,103
Look

1439
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,151
Hamdullah Kaya I am so sorry

1440
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:56,479
That I said those things about you please don't

1441
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,015
Okay I'll

1442
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:58,783
Alex whatever

1443
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,087
Ali leaves

1444
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,879
He's got a head down to Georgia

1445
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,647
Alex

1446
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,671
To meet him down there

1447
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,463
And Alex pics

1448
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
Some calls

1449
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,023
This is

1450
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
Ifucking performa

1451
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,327
It's on Alex's Park

1452
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:14,399
I believe that what's going on here is that

1453
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,167
Alex thing

1454
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,703
Fix that this caller is nuts

1455
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,495
And he doesn't want to talk to him

1456
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,519
So he decides to

1457
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,311
To pretend to be mad about something else

1458
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,383
On the Air day

1459
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,295
Mass ejection

1460
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
British accent

1461
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,327
I love you Dad

1462
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:46,655
Other talk shows

1463
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,191
Want to have your clean phone

1464
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,471
You're calling about

1465
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,263
Once you get on air

1466
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,591
You tell us what you want to cover you don't have to ask permission sir

1467
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:57,919
He wasn't he was telling you what his topic was around

1468
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:01,247
His phone sounded fine compared to

1469
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:07,647
The colors that you generally have on this show but he said he wants a predicted Corona

1470
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,927
Brain-chip

1471
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:11,487
Alex is like I want to fuc

1472
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:14,815
Talkin talk to this dude I want to get mad at him for no reason

1473
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,351
Continue

1474
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,655
Once you get on here

1475
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:21,983
You tell us what you want to cover you don't have to ask permission sir

1476
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,567
Hang up on you

1477
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,151
And no screening

1478
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:32,991
Dragon Dave I love you still had your free man brother glad

1479
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:48,095
Did not ask for permission again he's he was given a caveat that this is going to sound like numerology

1480
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,911
How's more Preamble than

1481
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:57,311
Numerology

1482
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:03,711
This is going to sound like numerology maybe you'll think it is more of a rational actor in this whole thing

1483
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,991
Yeah alright

1484
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
I don't want to do this

1485
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,575
I don't want to take whatever this guy saying seriously but

1486
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:14,719
Yeah whatever I'll just get mad about my weird ideas about anti-censorship of phone calls

1487
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,511
Very strange

1488
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
Yeah everybody

1489
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,047
A very strange

1490
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:22,143
Don't think another call and this guy wants you to not take of that

1491
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,703
And then thankfully

1492
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:28,543
Alex starts talking about his idea of this Karma

1493
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,823
Indeed

1494
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,871
That's what the whole thing about like you need

1495
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:36,479
Utica Obits need to trick you into doing things to her moral reasons Galactic law sure

1496
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,551
And you might get a little

1497
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,319
Confused

1498
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,087
Could using

1499
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:46,463
Is perhaps the only thing that like really fascinates me about Alex anymore

1500
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,767
This idea of his bizarre ethical

1501
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:53,631
And all up the radiation they can inject you with anything they want to

1502
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,167
You got to make sure that

1503
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,215
You don't take anything that that

1504
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,263
Get their push it out

1505
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,919
They need you to agree

1506
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,991
I need you to agree

1507
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:10,783
At least

1508
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,647
I do understand it all they know it's a loss that a lie

1509
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,951
You make somebody do something get Instant Karma

1510
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:20,255
Interdimensional, when you die

1511
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,071
For sins even if you manipulated the

1512
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,375
The field how it works

1513
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,935
They need to trick us to go along with it

1514
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,471
Emily

1515
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,007
Their satanic operation

1516
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,031
They need

1517
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,567
Garden

1518
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,615
No

1519
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,151
Not not not one bit

1520
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,175
Nope

1521
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:38,943
So

1522
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
If I understand

1523
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,015
Correctly

1524
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Instant

1525
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,551
Karma

1526
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,087
Isn't after you die

1527
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,415
Right

1528
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,695
Witches real

1529
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,559
I don't think the history backs that up

1530
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,327
No.

1531
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,471
All the monsters who died in their beds

1532
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:04,031
Do that but you missed out all the Instant Karma

1533
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,615
If it did happen though

1534
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,431
I don't think that this works

1535
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:13,759
I think you're going to really tough time explaining how this system has

1536
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,831
Ever operated

1537
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,903
Especially if you go back to like

1538
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,927
Times when

1539
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,207
Like feudal time

1540
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:25,279
I'm sure how did how did Instant Karma work back then

1541
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:30,911
Well okay in the Dark Ages

1542
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,727
I can't remember but it was I can't remember if it was Roman

1543
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:36,799
If it was not but I feel like in my head it's Roman

1544
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
The the

1545
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,615
Metal Bowl

1546
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:46,015
Do you remember the metal Bowl The Golden Bowl and they would put a human being inside the bullying light

1547
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,551
The fire underneath it

1548
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:52,159
Making that person burn alive inside of the bowl

1549
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:56,767
Kings last talked about Game of Thrones

1550
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,327
And that guy

1551
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,119
Absolutely

1552
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,143
Had diarrhea

1553
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,191
And that's what happened

1554
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,727
Instant Karma

1555
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,287
Tough

1556
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,055
Yeah

1557
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,871
Tough for me to wrap my head around this

1558
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,895
Now Alex

1559
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:17,759
Seems to also be saying that even if you manipulate the system and get people

1560
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,295
To do things up their own

1561
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,319
Volition

1562
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,855
You'll still have

1563
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,927
Bad seem Karma or you die

1564
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:30,303
What haven't you seen the scoreboards that

1565
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:35,423
What's the vet follow us around everywhere and sit on top of our left shoulder am I the only person who can see the scoreboard

1566
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,959
I think so

1567
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:41,055
This makes perfect sense to me and Alex scoreboard

1568
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
I'm

1569
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:45,151
A little bit I'm a little bit worried

1570
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,687
About the

1571
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:49,247
Real world application of this moral system

1572
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:52,063
I'm a little bit worried about it

1573
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:52,831
41

1574
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,135
If you believe this moral system

1575
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,159
And then

1576
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,183
Light say

1577
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,231
You violate someone's free will

1578
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,511
And then there's no answer

1579
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,279
Instant Karma

1580
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,815
Oh my God

1581
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:09,471
I must not have violated their free will go there we go

1582
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,519
Bentley car mode so

1583
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:14,335
Furthermore furthermore here's the biggest hit

1584
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,127
You know what that kind of implied

1585
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:22,015
Is there anything that you do if God doesn't strike you down for doing it it must be okay

1586
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:25,855
Until after when you find out

1587
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,135
It's not like

1588
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:35,839
Whatever you did to somebody they must have been fine

1589
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,143
So the fact that you're still standing and don't have

1590
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,679
What the f***

1591
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
I think my biggest

1592
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,239
Is that they can

1593
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,007
Quote

1594
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:43,775
Pressure you

1595
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,055
Now

1596
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
What does that mean

1597
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,871
Wow what are the limits of

1598
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,663
They can presser

1599
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:56,063
Are you into agreeing with them still be in trouble after they die so just have Instant Karma if they pressure

1600
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,367
Just figured just

1601
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:04,511
Torture you endlessly until you agree what if they send my profile

1602
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,607
If I would say that it's not

1603
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:10,399
Baloch Baloch pressure

1604
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:14,495
Installing pressure I think that's the question that it is

1605
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,823
Globalist

1606
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,895
Have to get you to agree to do things you sure

1607
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,711
Daleks with guns is not

1608
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,735
Pressure

1609
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,719
If the guy that killed the person

1610
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
That's insta

1611
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:41,887
But as long as our director of the government is not

1612
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:48,287
Appropriate level of pressure

1613
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:52,383
I think it is debatable you know the whole idea of like

1614
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:59,295
Did I make you do something cuz I pointed a gun at you

1615
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:02,879
Morally culpable or should you have gotten shot instead of sure

1616
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:06,719
Stupid conversation of course

1617
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,023
You got a gun

1618
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:20,799
This portal system makes no sense but I I want Alex to talk about it for an hour

1619
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,847
Robot with a swab is baby

1620
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:26,175
The robot.

1621
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,967
That's a little bit intimidating

1622
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,271
I mean it's weird

1623
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:36,671
If there's no Garden it's not walk away from the robot

1624
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
For the jet

1625
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,767
But if you could outrun it

1626
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,815
Close

1627
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:43,839
Not feasible

1628
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,399
Not real well right now

1629
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,447
I like to call Matt Smith and see what he can do about

1630
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,239
Anyway I just want Alex

1631
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,519
To do a socket

1632
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:56,127
Whole special episode about this weird moral system

1633
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,151
The call-in show

1634
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:00,735
Where people can ask him questions help refine some of these ideas

1635
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,551
I wanted to have it

1636
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:07,647
So far I really want him to try and explain it I really do because

1637
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,415
Is it is

1638
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,439
But Uncle yeah

1639
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,767
So now Alex another call and

1640
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,047
What happened

1641
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,863
When's that happens more than I would like

1642
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:17,631
To admit

1643
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:21,215
And that is this caller tells Alex about a dream he had

1644
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,055
Discern

1645
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:26,847
I just wanted to

1646
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,407
To reiterate a dream I had approximately

1647
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,431
16 years ago

1648
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,967
Gringo's like today

1649
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,247
Red Cross.

1650
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,063
Waycross

1651
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,087
I didn't know where to go

1652
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,879
I lay down my back

1653
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,159
I looked up to heaven

1654
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,439
And I saw a

1655
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:44,767
Blue spiraling light in this blue spiraling light turned into like a

1656
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,047
A tornado

1657
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,327
And out of that Blues

1658
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,095
Spiraling light

1659
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
A dove

1660
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,655
The blue dove

1661
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,191
And

1662
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,495
Liquid Love raindrop

1663
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,543
Entirely through me

1664
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,663
A moment is only for a moment

1665
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,455
But a moment last forever

1666
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,479
Alex

1667
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,015
This is America's moment

1668
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
Stand up

1669
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,087
If this moment dismiss

1670
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
This moment will pass

1671
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,391
Forever

1672
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,927
There's a shelf life on it

1673
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
And I

1674
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:18,047
Kudos for you for going to Georgia today

1675
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:20,607
What a liquefied the energy field

1676
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,167
The future and we have to remold things now

1677
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,447
What are those words

1678
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,495
People liquefied the jump

1679
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,031
What are you talkin about

1680
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:28,799
Course

1681
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:33,407
Yep liquefied the junkie dream that I was skateboarding last night

1682
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,271
Anyway this guy I got to tell you about a dream I had

1683
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,295
At 6

1684
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,831
So I was

1685
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,367
I was 17 years old

1686
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:47,743
I love you and you're my best friend. Don't want to hang out do you want to hear this

1687
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,767
Really incredible

1688
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,327
I had this dream and there was this

1689
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,351
Is cat and it was

1690
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,631
Was climbing a tree you know like

1691
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,703
And then I saw this blinding light

1692
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,727
And so did the cat

1693
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,007
And you know the cats.

1694
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:02,335
Because that's the light blinded the cat so much that it fell

1695
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,919
And it was holding onto the tree

1696
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:10,015
And a booming voice said it was like a trumpet in there Kitty

1697
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:14,111
And I just always hung onto that Dad

1698
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,671
Well it's a meaningful thing

1699
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:20,511
I like the idea that some people are like in a maybe

1700
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,351
Like protest outside capitalism be like the time is now

1701
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,935
I mean or else why would that guy who caught Alex Jones Show

1702
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,007
I've had that dream 16 years ago

1703
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,031
That's ludicrous

1704
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,359
I just want to reiterate add riwayat

1705
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,383
16 years ago

1706
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:42,783
Is the last sentence I want to hear anyone say ever have to assume Alex and that bubbles like I'm so mad I freaked

1707
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:48,415
The Freak Out

1708
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,975
Anyway we have one last clip

1709
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,511
It's sort of an intro

1710
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,791
To our Monday up

1711
01:17:54,815 --> 01:18:00,959
Well I'm on my way I'm not the devil little bit but I love Jesus

1712
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,007
So I'm on my way to Georgia

1713
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,871
Rodger Stone Ali Alexander so many others

1714
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,175
Very exciting

1715
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:15,551
Join us Monday on knowledge fight is no way a project part 3

1716
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:19,903
The Texan Went Down to Georgia

1717
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,719
Yeah so I'm excited about that kind of

1718
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,487
I'm excited

1719
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,023
About the idea of

1720
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,583
Like I'm playing by my own rules

1721
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,399
Likes to wear to cover the show but

1722
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:36,799
I think a bottle episode we talked about his time in Georgia makes more sense than discovering Wednesday at the end of

1723
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,567
This episode

1724
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,335
Agreed

1725
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,871
Like the Caravan

1726
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,151
Perfect two-parter

1727
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:45,503
Mexico recently and let me tell you something I've done a little bit

1728
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,783
But I was very well

1729
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:47,807
Well-written Perry

1730
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:54,207
Thank you that is very well-written is a good parody song I will be genuine for this one is very nice of you to say

1731
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,231
I will admit

1732
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,767
In hindsight

1733
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,071
2 m problem

1734
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,631
That's a problem whenever you write it out

1735
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,935
And you don't sing it in a you know

1736
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,775
I might have reread it

1737
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,079
Anyway

1738
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:15,455
I think that this was a little bit of a

1739
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,503
Preamble episode

1740
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,527
In some ways

1741
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,319
I feel like this

1742
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,623
Was getting ready to go to Georgia

1743
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,415
And it's this

1744
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:30,559
Just got back from DC and now he's about to leave again there's this weird middle play swords like

1745
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:36,703
Buck I don't know I'm going to hang out with Allie Alexander and all the proud boys at the layover in the airport

1746
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,799
He is he is a nomad

1747
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,847
For the 79 days of hell

1748
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,639
He is a manager if

1749
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:47,455
Running around the country hit already on trying

1750
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,015
To find attention wherever it might be

1751
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,551
He is going to have to do that

1752
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,575
I guess yeah

1753
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,135
That seems like what he's got to do I will see

1754
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,415
On the one hand

1755
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,951
I'm glad it doesn't

1756
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,231
Come off as desperate

1757
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,047
As being pissy

1758
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:10,495
Website

1759
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:16,128
Girls want to go to bed

1760
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:22,528
Facebook we are visiting a local charity or Bellefonte in your area to help out
