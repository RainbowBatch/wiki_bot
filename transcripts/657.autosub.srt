Books that are endorsed by the author of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

Alex holding up a frame me and Replacements album covers and and what have you

Friend or something

10
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,216
By the beginning of our show we would like

11
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:50,336
People do do that to create those memes and then it goes viral and then they get all the attention

12
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,736
It has never occurred to me that we could try to do that just did right now for that

13
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
Not what we did make me feel gross to artificially trying to do my brakes bought is ruined

14
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
Lot of fun

15
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,336
Bassmaster is releasing in Boston's former character the task

Bright MLS

Try and have to don't have to do it yeah you you've mentioned this

23
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,384

24
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
Cuz whenever they

25
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200

You're Greg Davies I'm Alex Horne

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072

What

41
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,736
Very fun idea that something from

42
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:11,392
I guess my childhood or my youth might be able to Stone Cold stun somebody a couple times

43
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Just like

44
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
Beat up people WrestleMania from sort of recent times

45
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Hangout

46
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,983
Giving someone a Kik somebody in the gut you'd give him a stunner and then you get out of there the upgrade

47
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,127
In the world

48
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663

Indeed adding to the pantheon of

00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,799
A couple of gas

76
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:43,455
Most shows after 670r episodes have more than three

77
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,039
True three bucks a convention and

78
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Have

79
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,879
Nobody I think largely because

80
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
You and I don't want to

81
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
Inflict other people with

82
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
We talked about it and I think the most people don't

83
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
Want to talk about those things

84
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,215

Awful content podcast

93

It's a tragic

94
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,311
Sort of subject matter that we all cover in that

95
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Kind of fitting

96
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Related to

97
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
Tragic topic

98
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
Yeah

99
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247

Alex Jones's

103
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Coverage of

104
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,743
If you could call it that Sandy Hook from the very beginning

105
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
Yeah we we

106
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
Babe that mistake

107
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
LaFerrari Ferrari mental state

108
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Yeah

109
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
And lives and you know

110
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
Just general

111
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
Cynicism is taking hold

112
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:17,151
Yeah I know I had hoped before yeah it it was an interesting ride certainly

113
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,711
Watching all the stuff from late 2012

114
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,015
Onward and I imagine that you

115
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
Probably had

116
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,623
Exact same but fairly similar

117
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Experience

118
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Diving into a lot of

119
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Material

120
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
Yeah in fact

121
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,607
I first got to know both of you your work that is and your show

122
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:43,007
Because Lenny Posner who is the father of Noah Pozner the youngest Sandy Hook victims

123
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,079
Recommended that I listen to your podcast

124
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,407
Sort of going back and taking a look at what Alex Jones

125
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
Said on the day of the shooting

126
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
So that was

127
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
How I first

128
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Became acquainted

129
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
Out with you both

130
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
And had that whole show trance

131
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Ascribed

132
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,671
And you do kind of really studied what you had to say about it

133
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:06,047
What is like what see let me see if I remember some of the things I said about it

134
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,143
I believe he's a trash

135
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,447
Human made of

136
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,263
Garbage and feces did that one go into the book

137
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,383
15 not go into the book Jordan alright quote you on that alright

138
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
Okay it is a little surreal to know that random things Jordan was yelling as maintenance

139
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,855
What was research material

140
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,183
That will be our our

141
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Close toll

142
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
As we sit here and

143
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
So this

144
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:43,167
Do you think that's how you sort of Came Upon Our show but it was that in the context of you.

145
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
Already had it in your mind to write

146
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
A book about this

147
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,055
This subject matter

148
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
Yeah it was

149
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
You know I got to know

150
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
Lenny obviously at

151
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
The very beginning of the

152
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
The project

153
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,039
Because he was one of

154
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Two families

155
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
Is that sued Alex Jones in

156
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
In Texas in the middle of 2018

157
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,815
And when I saw that kind of come over the transom either one of our reporters who covers

158
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
Breaking news

159
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Put that in the paper

160
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
And I thought

161
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Wow that is a pretty

162
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:23,103
Cast of the First Amendment and at the time we were really in the middle of year the very beginning of the Trump era

163
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
Untappd

164
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
Truth and

165
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
Alternative facts and

166
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
This just seemed like

167
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
A real test on you

168
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Alex Jones

169
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
As you guys have documented

170
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
4 years

171
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
Often claims it not always

172
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
Claims the First Amendment as a defense

173
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,767
For what he says

174
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
Sure seems like

175
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
A great test of

176
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
You know

177
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
What is free speech and

178
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
It's a deer

179
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Your first amendment rights

180
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Hover

181
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
I'm spreading material that results

182
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
Open significant harm to already

183
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
That is one thing that I enjoyed about the book

184
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Is

185
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,759
No I mean it doesn't matter how many years we are going to do this

186
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,855
You still have to write out the entirety of the First Amendment

187
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:11,999
Put it in the book and then remind people once again it only protects you from the government

188
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
It's hard to protect you from face

189
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,399
It's like there's a lot of these

190
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,983
These people kind of say they call it my free speech

191
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
And my first

192
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
Amendment 10

193
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
It's kind of hours

194
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,127
You know so

195
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:33,503
There's like they don't exist really in the context of a community interaction

196
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
For a team member

197
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,087
Promulgated thing yeah

198
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Knox

199
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
With the proper

200
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
1071

201
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,975
Yeah yeah yeah I think it's really fun to is that now that is

202
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
Come such a meme kind of that

203
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
Is used by people in other countries as a sort of a buzzword you saw there with the Canadian

204
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
Truck organizer

205
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Oh yeah

206
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
Yeah it's

207
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,079
It's very strange how that's a better understanding

208
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:04,735
Then we just talked to what's his dumb face the guy who's lizards Which Wich

209
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,295
David Icke we just talked about David I can he was talking

210
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
Think about his first amendment rights

211
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Senor like

212
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,903
You're from the Buford Britain man

213
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
It's true

214
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
I think he still lives in

215
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
You came to

216
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
He's relocated

217
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
Yeah yeah

218
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
It's very it's very strange

219
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
But you you were

220
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,263
You're somebody who I know you were you were writing about Alex

221
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,823
Or you had written about Alex prior to this

222
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
If I understand correctly cuz

223
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
I know that

224
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
My first interaction with you

225
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
Was Alex yelling about you

226
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
I ate heard him

227
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Complain about something you had written

228
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
Before we had ever spoken

229
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
It sounds kind of wondering

230
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,767
Like where did your exposure with

231
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
Jim begin

232
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
Like what do you do recall when you first

233
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Gaming contact

234
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
With his

235
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
He's content in

236
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
What what the

237
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
Kicked off that path

238
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
Yeah I do

239
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,919
I may have heard about him a little bit

240
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
During

241
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
2015

242
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
But my first

243
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
Exposure to him him sort of

244
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
In the Flash

245
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,927
Was during the Republican National Convention in twenty

246
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
16 and cleave

247
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
So he and Rodger Stone and Ida

248
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Describe this in the book

249
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
They were on the stage

250
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
At the the America

251
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
The first Unity rally

252
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,495
On the Cuyahoga River

253
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,823
On the convention yeah sort of in the convention City if not

254
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
Play convention grounds

255
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,943
And I sat down next to a woman who

256
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
With a very

257
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Nice

258
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,343
She seems like just one of those nice women and you know she was sitting there

259
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
Yeah we had

260
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
Really big smile and kind of it

261
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
Gentle way about her she was

262
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,511
Early sixties and

263
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,399
I was asking her the way I was asking a lot of people who were there for that rally

264
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,959
Alex Jones and Rodger Stone drama stage

265
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,055
And I was saying where do you get your nose and she was saying

266
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
Louder with Crowder

267
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
Infowars

268
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Bench

269
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Shapiro

270
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,479
And she said you know

271
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
If you're a journalist

272
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Cuz I have course dinner

273
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
Myself as one

274
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
She said if you're a journalist

275
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,903
And you're not listening to those shows

276
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
You're only getting half the

277
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,815
I can that makes me really sad cuz like I can understand

278
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Someone

279
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,655
Of that age cohort watching Ali

280
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Likes possibly

281
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,239
I could see them watching Ben Shapiro

282
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
If you have these presents himself is like

283
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,431
I'm pretending to be an intellectual / 25

284
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,247
Would watch louder with Crowder is so sad

285
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
That show is the dumbest

286
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,927
Sophomoric attempt at comedy I can't

287
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
I can't imagine an adult watch

288
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
Watching conservative,

289
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Sophomore

290
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,375
Does like poo poo jokes

291
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
It's that

292
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,751
Done with her and I would say her son

293
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
Was

294
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
Maybe 30

295
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,895
Or so maybe a little bit younger little bit older

296
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
And he

297
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
They hear she spent her son was disabled so he was in a wheelchair and they spend a lot of time

298
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,391
Together because he had a lot of difficulties in

299
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
He or she mentioned that they'd listen to these shows

300
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
Underway

301
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Two doctors

302
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
And some things like that

303
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
So I think they were

304
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,143
Things that he started listening to her that he was listening

305
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
Thank you for a long time

306
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,471
And she kind of you know

307
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
Picked up on it

308
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
From him that's a bit that pointed to parents

309
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,663
Responsibility

310
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,503
You got to be a bridge would you jump off of it too

311
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,855
Well I mean pretty hot these days

312
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:59,231
That sucks that there's also a nice irony to that image that you're painting of

313
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
You know this

314
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:06,143
Rally involving people like Alex and Rodger Stone you were so staunchly opposed to like government regulation

315
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
Happening on the Cuyahoga River right

316
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
Essentially a testament to the effectiveness of the EPA

317
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
The tragic image

318
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
Running into this

319
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
This is this

320
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
This protest is this where you at

321
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
Did you end up talking

322
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
Rodger

323
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,511
It was a very crowded then

324
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,863
There were a lot of people there are a lot of Hillary for prison t-shirts remember those

325
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Oh yeah

326
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,751
And and so know he was up on the stage and kind of in his

327
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,847
You know Entourage and sort of you know security around him and

328
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,919
And things like that so you describe him in the book as just

329
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:55,551
Him and Rodger stone is just swaggering about when their retinue

330
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,951
Yeah acting like celebrities like either that's one of the big things that you you bring up for just specifically that

331
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
Is Alex

332
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
It's such a

333
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Strfkr

334
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,935
That like he goes to those places to soak up their celebrity which is such a great point of

335
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
Yeah he it was interesting his staffers

336
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
We're telling me that that

337
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
You know

338
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:24,735
One of them described him as he would always say you know as you guys know better than me

339
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
You know

340
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,831
Hollywood the root of all you know globalist evoland

341
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,463
At the same time he said he was like a girl screaming after the Beatles

342
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,863
When it came to itto people he was meeting at the convention

343
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
You're the best

344
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
He was really and also the other thing with

345
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
He was doing which is

346
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
His cameraman who is with him

347
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
At the time told me

348
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
For the book

349
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
That

350
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
It what they were doing is

351
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
You're making their way through media row you know they were inside rather than outside the convention barrier where it you know

352
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
Alex Jones would typically be with

353
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,671
His bullhorn you know always on the outside of the perimeter

354
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,719
Instead they were very much

355
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Departed things

356
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
She was definitely on the ascendant

357
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,119
They were you know kind of sweating through the crowd

358
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,959
Creating provocations you know I'm needy arohi

359
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,775
Get crashed sank uyghurs show the younger

360
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:26,175
Jimmy Dore spit on them

361
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,247
You did yeah Alex Jones did wind up with

362
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
Spit on him that day

363
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,855
But that was all great for him because

364
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,695
This cameramen filmed all of that and they were really looking for

365
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
Viral video from there and they got it

366
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
Damn now that's

367
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
That's the unfortunate thing is that strategy does to

368
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Ends up paying off

369
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,007
Yeah there were a lot of events that I'm I think I just grabbed him in the book as

370
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
You know he was

371
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
He's like

372
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
A shark

373
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
He needs attend

374
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
If he does

375
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
Get it it's like a sharks

376
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,295
If he doesn't spill never sleeps

377
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
But with a shark it's just sort of

378
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
Evolve that way with Alex

379
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
Because he's on standby

380
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
Yeah well I mean that's a certain type of that

381
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,071
Addiction evolves over time

382
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
That is true

383
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,191
Is this weird like your first

384
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
Article

385
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
Involved

386
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
Come from is this

387
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
This where that's at the

388
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Let's burn out

389
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,407
Yeah I was on the editorial board

390
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
For the times

391
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,247
Then and I wrote you a short

392
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Peace just on

393
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
What is this

394
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
Alternative

395
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
News ecosystem that

396
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,047
You know these folks are really wired into a louder with Crowder that I hear

397
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
Apple talking about

398
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,959
And I really did feel like very much an outsider cuz of course as soon as that

399
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,775
That story went in the paper I got a lot of you know

400
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,615
People who listen to Ben Shapiro do not listen to louder with Crowder and

401
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,175
How could you put them in the same sentence end

402
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
You do all of the

403
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
So

404
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
But my

405
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
My

406
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Broader point

407
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
You known earlier point

408
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
Was just

409
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
That

410
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,951
This is a whole group of

411
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
Personalities

412
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,559
And shows and sources of information that

413
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,863
Most of us have never really heard of

414
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
New York Times

415
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
NSAID

416
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Yeah

417
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,239
In the in the intervening time

418
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,311
Cuz I mean one thing that we talked about with

419
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
Mark Bankston

420
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,895
Who is

421
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
Solid protagon

422
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Going to send your book

423
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,343
He he specifically said you know over the years that I've absorbed myself in the

424
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
In this case

425
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,695
You know it is definitely changed some of the way that I think

426
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
About things

427
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,303
Do you feel like this is this is had that kind of effect on you as well

428
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
So I remember a moment

429
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
With Mark thank

430
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
Winston and Bill Ogden

431
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,727
Another

432
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,543
Another partner

433
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,943
On the show have you been on the show strong and no bill Ogden policy

434
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,991
Go on TV and markets to hang out with us

435
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:15,391
Okay I get it I like Bill I met him when I was down in Austin.

436
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,208
He's great but I like I also kind of like to Pretend There's a

437
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,792
Oh I see okay alright well I'm not

438
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
Step on that but

439
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,096
Iam

440
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
He told me once we

441
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,728
We after one of the Year while I was working on the book we went out

442
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
To dinner and now

443
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:37,920
I remember Mark went off to take a phone call and Bill was talking about how his role in

444
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
McKay's

445
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,272
Was listening to hundreds and hundreds of hours of

446
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
Infowars broadcast

447
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:49,184
To find the points where he references the family so that they could make sure they had every rough

448
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
And

449
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
She said

450
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,608
I was seriously starting

451
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
To lose it he said

452
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,056
One late here late one night he just was listening to it you know what his 40th or 50

453
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
Successive Infowars

454
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
For our programming stent and he was saying

455
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Oh my God

456
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,808
Yeah that's that's a fairly chilling line in the book

457
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,648
And and and I thought

458
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,232
You know but it is true that if you

459
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,304
And that's the sort of frog boil of all of this isn't it

460
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
That you know I mean

461
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
This is this

462
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
Form of propaganda is like

463
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:37,312
90 * you know you start bike with it with a relatively minor suggestion

464
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
Then you start with something a little stronger you you have small live and you have a little bigger lie I mean the very

465
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:48,832
First lie was about crowd sizes at the inauguration right I'm very first day

466
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,160
And then you don't look at the size of allies

467
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
By the time we got to January 6th

468
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,512
And it really was a kind of

469
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
Can you I'm like that

470
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
It was sorta like

471
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
Before we really knew it

472
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
Earwig

473
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,192
We were looking at this and saying

474
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
This this

475
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,008
Lie about the 2020

476
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Action was

477
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,848
Unthinkable even a year ago and here

478
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,944
Is a significant swath of Americans who really believe it

479
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:21,600
I mean I supposed supposed to my next question then is like do you feel like this type of propaganda is differ

480
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
Because

481
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
You know before before

482
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,256
2017 before the inauguration it wasn't like that's the first time people

483
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,304
We're believing in things that were

484
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Clearly in

485
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,352
Incontrovertibly

486
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
Bulshit

487
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,960
So you feel like this is something that you

488
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Have

489
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,032
Interacted with in a different way from

490
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
Let's say other forms of propaganda

491
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,664
So I think taking the Long View

492
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,688
Jordan

493
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
The big thing

494
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,736
Obviously that

495
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
Is a big difference

496
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,320
Certainly from the Nazi era until

497
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Till now

498
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
Is

499
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,880
Social media

500
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
And

501
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
You know the gigantic up

502
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Take

503
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,768
In social media even from

504
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
You don't say

505
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,072
So I went back and I

506
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
I talked to

507
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Parents

508
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,240
The mother of a young woman who was involved in the

509
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Virginia Tech

510
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
Masa

511
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,360
And she was saying you don't hear was a huge

512
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
Shooting on a college campus

513
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
Interstate

514
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,992
Where you know people would get

515
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,784
Concerned about

516
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,088
Gun policy in the aftermath of that

517
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,392
And they're just really wasn't a lot of

518
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
Conspiracy theories

519
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
That shooting

520
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,768
If you look at you know how many people

521
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Side

522
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
Facebook

523
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,096
For example in 2000

524
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,632
7 when that occurred

525
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
It was 20 million people

526
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,496
By December of 2012 when the Sandy Hook shooting happen

527
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,776
That number was

528
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
1 billion

529
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,360
And I really think that that has

530
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,920
Accelerated I mean we've we've spoken

531
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Together

532
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
About

533
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
Someday old

534
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,272
Cultish things and things like that

535
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
The loan guy on the

536
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
Subway with

537
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
Casino

538
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
A photocopy

539
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,952
You know about the JFK assassination or

540
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,000
Those people were really icy

541
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Before and now they found

542
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
Each other and they

543
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
Feed whatever they

544
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,632
Come up with around the

545
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
The world ends

546
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Yeah

547
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,472
And I think that they

548
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,544
Look through social media and like YouTube

549
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
They found

550
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,664
Really efficient ways to monetize

551
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
This is out of

552
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,528
The speediness of that that messaging that's got to be

553
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
Like a pretty negative

554
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Reinforcement

555
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,392
Yeah that doesn't even

556
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
You know

557
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,464
You think about you think about that change

558
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,560
And now there's a Tik-Tok as so impenetrable to

559
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:45,216
So many people above the age of 19 that's that's like my louder with Crowder

560
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,128
But you do see millions of views on these short videos that are all bulshit

561
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
Instantly

562
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,688
But you know

563
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,480
They're there and then they're gone and it's

564
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
It sticks in your brain

565
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,648
I think it's impossible for humans to interact with social media in a responsible way

566
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
I could be wrong

567
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:11,584
I'm kind of with you on that one I think you I do think I do see a I sound like a

568
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
Super Midwest

569
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Pollyanna here

570
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
Cunningham

571
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
But

572
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,520
It's I really do think

573
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,896
The newer generation younger generation coming up are much more skeptical

574
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
About what they redone

575
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
And about having your

576
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,784
Of course there are thousand except

577
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,856
That but I really do feel like

578
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
You know I mean I have kids who are that age

579
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,232
And I really feel like they are much worse kept

580
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,280
Article not only of what they read on there

581
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,328
But about having an accountant

582
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
And what that means

583
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
Sure the privacy

584
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
The stuff is so much more clear

585
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
You know I got I think

586
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,032
It in just my time

587
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Since I was

588
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
In college

589
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
You know

590
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,896
Facebook went from the Facebook

591
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,968
Where was the thing where only college students were on it

592
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,784
Two big white Lake open

593
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
Interesting wave you could like

594
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
Promotive

595
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,160
There's all kinds of possibilities to attend now

596
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:12,256
It's like your grandma's on there and she sending you change emails

597
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:17,632
It's it's taken on in addition to the privacy

598
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
Concerned because

599
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,680
Becoming more clear

600
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216
The evolution of what

601
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
This is

602
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
Has train

603
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,592
Your Point Journal you were bringing up the

604
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,896
It seems like Tik-Tok is kind of

605
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,480
Like a place where there is a a newer

606
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
Sense of life

607
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,320
Migrated it's a little bit to that

608
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,624
I wonder if what you're saying Elizabeth

609
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
Babe you feel like some of these

610
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,488
Like younger folk are just avoiding even

611
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
We can gauging at all

612
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
Beekeeping with stick

613
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,704
Yeah I mean you know I have a I have an 18 year old

614
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,984
And she

615
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,824
Got on Twitter maybe in the last two or three months

616
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
Because he's communicating with

617
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
You know his football.

618
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
But

619
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
Even before

620
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,504
Before that though no snow

621
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
Social media accounts whatsoever

622
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
You know Joe

623
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Kind of

624
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
Took it on board that

625
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,928
Boy if you want to go to college

626
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:17,024
One great way not to get into the school your choices have somebody surface one of your old

627
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
You know awful

628
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,096
Twitter Facebook post

629
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,632
Nino orb Instagram

630
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
College admissions looking for

631
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,360
Some some racist thing you posted as a thirteen-year-old or something

632
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
That'd be crazy

633
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,224
Yeah and I so I think that you know to some degree

634
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
That message

635
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,320
And also you know

636
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
They're just that much more time

637
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,880
Technologically savvy

638
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
You know they kind of understand how the sausage

639
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,952
It just made online

640
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
Which is really in

641
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Interesting I mean

642
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,072
And that actually that knowledge

643
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,400
Being used as a say in the book you know there's

644
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,216
There is it that there's a series of games now where

645
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,800
People can make up a conspiracy theory as a kind of game

646
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,104
As a way to inoculate them against

647
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,432
Bamiyan to conspiracy theories and

648
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,064
Spreading them online without really knowing it before they hit the button you're so they kind of understand

649
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
Yeah

650
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,880
How do you make one you know how do you make a

651
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
It's spread

652
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:21,792
Like what elements do you put in there to make it really viral you know just responding to that you know outrage algorithm

653
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
All of that

654
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,608
So if you see something online

655
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
And they're studying this

656
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
People who

657
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
Looking at this and if they

658
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,592
Kind of inoculate people in that way by showing them how this is made and how to spread them

659
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,920
Then when they run into him online they're less likely to spread them

660
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,968
And to be more skeptical

661
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
What is

662
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,320
The belief in a conspiracy theory right it's sort of saying I possess

663
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
Superior knowledge

664
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,184
You know I know something the rest of you Rubes don't know

665
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,512
And so you can use that in this sort of

666
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
Free banking

667
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,072
Anything that they as they call it

668
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,656
All to the good cuz talking people out of this stuff

669
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
As you guys know is

670
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
Really

671
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:07,872
Yeah that's that's definitely something we hear a lot has also sounds like you're a tyrant pushing vaccines on us

672
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:13,504
Inoculation

673
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,576
New York Times of the Caballo weather to me

674
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:24,768
Yeah I think one of the things that I find very interesting about my experience

675
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
With

676
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,632
Doing the show is that there is not really been a ton of

677
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,960
Interaction with info Warriors let's say

678
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:38,592
I think part of that is just due to the fact that we don't really engage on social media all that much here it's kind of like

679
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,664
The wave that folks end up having most

680
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
Their argument

681
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,272
We have not had a ton of

682
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,856
Instances where we try to talk somebody out of these beliefs

683
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,160
What second-hand I do hear that

684
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,464
It'll be program

685
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
As it were

686
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,816
Can be very difficult from what do internalizing idea like

687
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
Sandy Hook was fake

688
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
2 or

689
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
January 6th was

690
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
Provocative Santa by the FBI

691
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
Antifa

692
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,544
Yeah yeah

693
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,408
Do you do you get a lot of that it from your from your work you get a lot of

694
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,248
Folks who want to convince you that you're wrong

695
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,344
Oh absolutely and in reporting this book

696
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,368
Just every

697
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,160
Conspiracy theorist I spoke with

698
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,976
In fact there's one in particular Kelly W

699
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,280
Who is in a life I really started delving

700
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
I was just very

701
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,096
Curious about

702
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,680
How you know how does someone with the email handle

703
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
Great mom

704
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
You know GR

705
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
Numeral 8

706
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
Mom

707
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
Actually

708
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,408
Get to place where she's posting on

709
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,712
Lenny posner's Memorial site

710
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,248
To his murdered son

711
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,320
I want Geraldo to open the cast

712
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,624
Yeah

713
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,928
That story was f***** up

714
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,232
Yeah I could not

715
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
Understand

716
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
How someone could get

717
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
Play send

718
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,728
So I Geraldo famously opened Al Capone safe and there was nothing in it she was kind of making

719
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
I'm being too

720
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
No she was

721
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
Yeah

722
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:20,992
You know and then the idea of so she had a cleaning the house cleaning the house and office cleaning business in Tulsa Oklahoma

723
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,344
And you don't hurt her sort of unique contribution to this

724
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,648
Crazy quilt of Sandy Hook series was

725
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,184
Let's find out

726
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
What company

727
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
Cleaned up this

728
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
School after

729
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
And that became one of

730
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
Toxic

731
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Request

732
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
That these

733
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
Hoaxers pudding

734
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
To the board of ed in

735
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Did the city of newt

736
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,288
Either we want a copy of the contract

737
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,104
And we want receipts and we want photos and

738
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
They were extremely graphic

739
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,176
Taken what they were describing might have been

740
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
Been cleaned up from

741
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
From the school

742
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,992
And

743
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
The thing that was really interesting is

744
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,576
One of Lenny Posner song

745
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Tears

746
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,648
I'm into bunking all of this stuff

747
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,696
Actually found the records

748
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,744
A police report that

749
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
Etc

750
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
This is the name of the

751
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,584
Company I actually called the

752
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,632
Company I had a conversation with them

753
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,424
Confirm that yes they didn't back clean

754
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,288
Extremely detailed record of what was removed from the school and what have

755
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Happened to it

756
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,848
And so I presented this

757
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
To her and

758
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
Comes the answer

759
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,456
After some silence

760
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
Where's the receipts

761
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
It's just

762
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Never

763
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:34,976
Ending and you know there is no and I actually think that maybe someone like her

764
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,536
They are so far down the rabbit hole

765
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,864
That there's a there would be a level of Shame involved

766
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
I mean

767
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,192
Course your entire life is a lie

768
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:48,544
And not yet that definitely Jordan and

769
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
But I think beyond that

770
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,664
You have tormented the families of murdered children

771
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
I mean at some point

772
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
Maybe you can't

773
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
It's easier to believe

774
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,392
I think I would personally

775
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,184
I have a really tough time but

776
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,488
I also think that maybe

777
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,536
If you're in that state

778
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
You can't even

779
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,888
Conscious you're not even consciously making that decision

780
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,192
Like you know didn't you know what I mean

781
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
You can't you obviously

782
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
Except

783
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,056
The possibilities that you did something

784
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Yeah.

785
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
Yeah you're just

786
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,688
You just won't allow it happening manifest

787
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
Fasb's like

788
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,808
Instinctual denials of any proof that you're wrong

789
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,880
What do you think is different Elizabeth because

790
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:40,512
There is the story from where Lenny Posner joins the

791
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
Oaks Facebook group

792
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
I do believe it's Jen

793
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,168
Who eventually exits the group and help yet

794
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,752
Lenny starts

795
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
That his is a program

796
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,896
Wondering what do you think is different between Jen and

797
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
What

798
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,200
Great mother

799
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,808
Great mom

800
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,136
So that that that woman Jen Force

801
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,672
So

802
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,976
Here's what I think happened at the beginning

803
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
End

804
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
I think a lot of the parents

805
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,816
You know enlighten me

806
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
To this

807
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Share this View

808
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:22,752
That in the beginning this was such a horrific crime that no one

809
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,776
Wanted to believe that

810
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,568
You know it was

811
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,640
The parents themselves that they when they

812
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
Right and

813
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
And speak about it

814
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,504
They talk about waking up in those first

815
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
Stays you know and say

816
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:40,416
Oh my God what a horrible nightmare I just had and then realizing that their living

817
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
That is their life

818
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,232
And that did how

819
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,120
And there was there were a significant number of these early

820
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,448
Entertainers I'll say of the

821
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,984
Conspiracy theory around Sandy Hook

822
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,032
Cooper young parents themselves

823
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,080
Two had children around that same age

824
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,920
And one of them you know I profile for the book

825
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,224
A woman named Tiffany mausser who

826
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,784
Became one of Lenny's most convicted

827
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,600
Convinced and uncommitted

828
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,880
Volunteers

829
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
Who you know

830
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,976
Had had a tragic situation in her past

831
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,304
She hit a child with her car and that child died

832
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,840
We had

833
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:23,424
Two children who were around the same ages

834
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
The children who were killed

835
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,008
And she went on to the Sandy Hook hoax

836
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,288
Facebook page

837
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,592
Just say I am here

838
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
For whoever

839
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
Can tell me this didn't happen

840
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,456
I just need to believe that this

841
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:43,136
And that was and that was Jen to you know s*** also took a little bit of a true crime

842
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,672
Kind of approach to the

843
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
To the whole

844
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
Prime right but

845
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,304
But these were the people who kind of

846
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Peels off

847
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,120
Because they were open to being

848
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,424
Convinced it was more of a

849
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,960
You know a gut

850
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,752
Kind of emotional reaction

851
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
To the crime

852
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,568
Itself

853
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,128
This level of evil is possible

854
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,152
Kind of thing

855
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,200
Exactly exactly

856
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,248
Yeah they just put

857
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
Do it

858
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,600
It's interesting that you brought up that has people with young children

859
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,880
Around that like

860
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,720
That it would somebody find really bizarre is that

861
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,048
I just realized that Alex's kids would have been

862
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,328
Younger

863
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,608
At that point

864
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,216
And it's that that wasn't the reason I wasn't in

865
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Experience

866
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
But he had

867
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,872
I believe it was actually on the very first day when the news broke

868
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Because

869
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,688
This is something that I remember specifically

870
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,968
When we covered

871
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,272
Is when the news first broke

872
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:46,368
Alex did not immediately have a negative reaction

873
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,392
His first reaction

874
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,184
His instinctive reaction was

875
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
I'm sorry

876
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,488
I'm sorry for the fam

877
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,328
Yeah that was his instant reaction and then the next day

878
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,096
It was awful

879
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
Everything was a lie

880
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:03,008
He was crouching ways to make a patient first day that's true

881
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:09,408
There was that there was a gut-check a little bit but it didn't last the whole show

882
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,712
A little bit coffee

883
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,296
My memory is literally always fuzzy that's the only reason the show works

884
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:19,392
But there was a moment remember when he talked about

885
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,696
Okay this is happening at the holidays

886
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
Oh my God

887
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:29,632
You know however many kids he had the number wrong but he knew that it was it was a a large number

888
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
And

889
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680
And he did

890
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,216
Seem to be

891
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,032
At least momentarily taking a bath

892
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
Right

893
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
What an a******

894
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:47,040
You know what I'm thinking this guy is no good I'm having a negative opinion on it

895
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
Yeah

896
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
Really that's

897
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
Really bizarre.

898
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
There's thinking about the difference

899
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
Between what make

900
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
Somebody

901
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
I

902
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,864
With somebody who would

903
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,656
The give up on the

904
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,424
Conspiracy

905
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,984
When confronted by some reality and somebody who's

906
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,568
There's just never stopped yeah I wonder if there is even

907
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
Some kind of

908
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Consistency

909
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
Doing what

910
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
And what

911
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
And what were you could learn

912
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:22,368
I think it is I think it really has to do with I mean that this not University of Miami Joey Shins

913
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,952
Ski who studied conspiracy theories especially political ones

914
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
And I would

915
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
Call this one of those because

916
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792
Gun control

917
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,864
Always a factor and you know or or almost

918
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,192
Consistently and definitely the government planned it makes it

919
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Protocol

920
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,752
Conspiracy theory but

921
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
His

922
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Peebles

923
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,872
He will say you know even qanon

924
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
Does not select

925
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
Politics

926
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
That

927
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,784
You know it is really your kind of mindset

928
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
And your

929
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
Personality

930
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:56,416
Much more than your politics that determines whether or not you

931
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
Conspiracy theories

932
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,000
And you know I was

933
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,024
Skeptical because

934
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
Qanon

935
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,816
So much about

936
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,864
Hillary Clinton and the Democrats

937
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
You know

938
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,704
Democratic stronghold and Balboa

939
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
But

940
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,312
If you really look at you know the different variants of that you know

941
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
Child traffic

942
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,664
You can kind of understand where he's coming from

943
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,456
And I think you know a lot of

944
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,760
These people there's a level of narcissism is

945
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,808
Documented so well with

946
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,136
That you know I need to possess the

947
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
Superior knowledge

948
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,464
And then there's a certain you know in this

949
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,792
This woman Kelly W daughter Madison explain to me

950
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,632
You don't my mom never felt like anybody really

951
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,680
Respected her for having an a

952
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
Original

953
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,728
Idea or

954
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,008
You know making a

955
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,544
Kind of intellectual conch

956
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
Contribution

957
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,640
Or something like that it was it's really important

958
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
Her

959
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,712
To be the sort of bear

960
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Unique

961
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,088
You know it's hard to even

962
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Yeah

963
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
You know

964
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:05,024
Other people would ghettobaby like get an advanced degree or

965
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,048
You know

966
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
But

967
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,168
It's an emotional thing you can

968
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
Kind of relate to understand us

969
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
It's a

970
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,544
How to struggle but with the way you

971
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
Proceed from there

972
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
Right

973
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,664
Is not good now the interesting thing about

974
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,200
What's your book

975
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,528
That I appreciate is that despite it being

976
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,600
Very focused on Sandy Hook it is also

977
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,928
A really good example of that kind of grapes

978
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
Conspiracy theories

979
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
Singularity

980
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,024
So many of these people wound up

981
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Sandy Hook

982
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,816
Conspiracy theories

983
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:44,192
Coming from different motives different backgrounds different things that they wanted to be true

984
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
And

985
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,544
As we as you point out you know yoga moms

986
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,848
Turn into anti-vaxxers 5 years later

987
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:54,431
And it's all the same conspiracy theory but

988
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,967
People are just coming out at 4

989
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,991
From so many different

990
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,831
Ya know it's true and you know I

991
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:08,511
One thing I didn't explore a lot although I did in talking about Kelly Watts life and kind of what her life

992
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,791
Had been because it

993
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,583
You know there's a lot of trauma

994
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,863
In her life

995
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,679
I do think trauma in some of these folks lives

996
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,567
You know like Tiffany mausser that the woman you know who had the access

997
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,615
Set with her car and a child died or

998
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:27,967
Either we just had a story in the times yesterday about

999
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,551
Robert F Kennedy Junior and his belief in it you know just

1000
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,575
One of them

1001
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:37,183
Biggest anti-vaxxers you know with an enormous following

1002
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,511
And just like an absolutely divisive force in the

1003
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,791
The Kennedy family

1004
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,095
But you do a lot of trauma neck

1005
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,423
Alex was stuck under a house one time

1006
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,263
When they were fumigate again,

1007
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:58,175
No I mean it is it is very much a I find it so analogous to

1008
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,967
Evangelical born-again Christians

1009
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,271
The ones that come to it later in life

1010
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
Because

1011
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,063
Something

1012
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,855
Something is like prison

1013
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,159
Yeah I mean or

1014
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
Cyberweld rogerstone of course

1015
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:17,119
But but there is that like there's an inciting event that where you're at your lowest

1016
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,399
There's a group

1017
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,703
That love bombs you essentially

1018
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,239
And then you're just

1019
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,799
You know so if you're at your lowest point

1020
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,103
Your business isn't going so well

1021
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,919
Nobody's helping you out you find a qanon website

1022
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:34,783
You're immediately love bombed with guess what you're so smart

1023
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,831
Validation

1024
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,183
Yeah no it's that makes me think of

1025
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:45,279
I think that's a really good point it makes me think of somebody like Mike

1026
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
You know

1027
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,375
Mike Flynn when he was in the military was

1028
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,167
You know people called it

1029
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
Information

1030
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,007
Ghetto his plight of misconceptions about

1031
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,055
Islam or

1032
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Or

1033
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,359
Radicalism

1034
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,639
Or you

1035
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:07,551
He didn't have I mean

1036
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:16,255
It's a general side you're telling me that they do everybody's like oh yeah we know that guy's full of s*** but we're going to continue

1037
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
Foreboding

1038
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,863
Offices with Fluor like

1039
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,191
National Security advisor exactly yes

1040
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
Scrapes

1041
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,031
Yeah but it was that you know that kind of

1042
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:33,919
The thing that really struck me about a lot of these groups like the Sandy Hook hoax group or any of these gatherings

1043
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
Casino on

1044
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,479
On social media

1045
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,015
With how mutually reinforcing

1046
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
You know that

1047
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,831
Almeda

1048
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,367
Each other feel really

1049
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,183
Smart and that's what Kelly Watts daughter said

1050
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,719
To have a guy like

1051
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,999
Jim Fetzer

1052
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,047
Who is a PhD

1053
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,607
Who are the former professor of

1054
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,631
Wait for it

1055
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
Logic

1056
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,471
University of Minnesota

1057
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,287
One of the biggest Sandy Hook hoaxers out there

1058
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:04,895
Praising her for her insides for her Scrappy reporting for

1059
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,919
Calling hundred

1060
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:10,015
The people in Newtown and never giving up as she sought you know

1061
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,575
The contract the holy grail for

1062
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,599
Who cleaned up

1063
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
School

1064
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,647
That makes

1065
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:19,487
People feel good and if they don't have a lot of other sources for that

1066
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,535
It's really hard to

1067
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,559
Give that address

1068
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,167
Yeah I'm bummed out the gym pets

1069
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,191
Was a professor of logic

1070
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,239
IAA

1071
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,519
They studied a bit of logic

1072
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,055
Acknowledgement

1073
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Did I do

1074
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Think they

1075
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,871
When people who

1076
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,895
Study that

1077
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
Break

1078
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:44,063
It's not a twig at the 309

1079
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:50,207
Really hot rail for you you know once logic breaks you're out of your out of games you know

1080
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:54,303
You can use also for deferiet

1081
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
Ways to make really bad argument

1082
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,447
Arguments are not logical

1083
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,495
They're not they don't follow

1084
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
Formal

1085
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
Structure

1086
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,615
I don't know I'm sorry I just got lost there for a second

1087
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,175
I am amazed

1088
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:15,039
One thing that is I will give to Jim Fetzer is that

1089
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,087
Even in print form

1090
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:21,183
When you write out his quotes he does sound like he's shrieking mad

1091
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:27,839
You know like you can hear him going in your in your head while you're reading is quotes

1092
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Yeah

1093
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,911
That

1094
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,471
How to interview him

1095
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
A few

1096
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:42,943
In person that interview in the in my rental car

1097
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,711
Right

1098
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,759
I enjoyed I enjoyed that story

1099
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:49,855
He's laid low after the case

1100
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:53,183
And he does not want to talk to Olivia and

1101
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,719
Eventually like fire

1102
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
Your car

1103
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:02,399
Absolutely like a drug deal my family doesn't need to know about

1104
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,935
I'll get in your car

1105
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:08,031
His family was so angry that

1106
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,055
Is it but

1107
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,871
It was like crap to him that idea that

1108
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
You would get

1109
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,431
Yet one more interview and

1110
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,711
Some attention

1111
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,759
And be able to trumpet his

1112
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,295
Because he had been

1113
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,087
Successfully by Lenny's lawyers

1114
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:21,855
You know Lenny

1115
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,695
Failure failure listeners in

1116
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,511
He had sued him for defamation and won

1117
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:32,607
They wanted $450,000 judgment in October of

1118
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,887
2019

1119
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
And

1120
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,239
So I went and spoke with him after that and after he lost

1121
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,543
You know this was enough to bankrupt

1122
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,591
Probably two generations of

1123
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,871
What is familysoda

1124
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:48,479
Yeah so he was saying you know my family doesn't

1125
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:55,135
Really and it was killing him to say that because it was his wife and daughter so it just seemed like he had been completely

1126
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:55,903
You know

1127
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,463
Emasculated by this

1128
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,511
But yeah it was sort of like

1129
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,375
I'll talk to you in the car so then my wife

1130
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,799
And then he immediately decided to find a way to double that judgment against two

1131
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,103
Four generations of his family

1132
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,431
I sealed videotape

1133
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,527
Deposition and gave it to the hoaxers and then they put it online

1134
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,063
And they compared

1135
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
Lenny's

1136
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
Ear

1137
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,671
To his ear in previous photos and

1138
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:33,535
Decided that the Lenny who testified in that defamation case in the courtroom was in

1139
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,583
This checks out

1140
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:39,679
I remember that actually being like a really popular thing

1141
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,215
Conspiracy message boards

1142
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
Leslie like

1143
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,519
Let's compare ears

1144
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,591
Well so weird once you get an ear you know the rest of a person

1145
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
Soul

1146
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,663
That's picture of

1147
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
Joe Biden Iroquois

1148
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,967
Conspiracy to

1149
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
One of the hoaxers told

1150
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,551
Lyrica I'm sure

1151
00:48:55,807 --> 00:49:01,951
There's a Joe Biden body part conspiracy forever is top-to-bottom

1152
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,255
Everybody's a queen

1153
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:10,655
Honestly Joe Biden is three people he's a clone he's a walk-in also Jim Carrey and he's Jim Carrey we learned

1154
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,775
Carrie is wearing a bow tie

1155
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,103
You play as Joe Biden that's why he does these gaps

1156
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
Yep sometimes he does pratfalls

1157
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,271
Very insightful stuff

1158
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:31,391
From actually Project Camelot who interviewed Jim Fetzer Olga

1159
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,927
Full circle

1160
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,719
I can't imagine

1161
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,767
What that but like would be like

1162
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,559
Be in a closed space

1163
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
Face with him

1164
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,399
Would you would you say that that was

1165
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,191
Maybe the most bizarre

1166
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,007
Experience of the book preparation

1167
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,055
Cuz I would like I would

1168
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,079
Love to hear about

1169
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:56,479
If there was something later

1170
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,247
Weirdest

1171
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
Jim Fetters brat

1172
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:06,207
Yeah I do mention that in the book that's the only reason I brought it

1173
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
It was quite funny

1174
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:13,375
On a technicality I still think that's part of being in a confined space

1175
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,191
Yeah I can't see can't barely separate that out

1176
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,007
I would have to say that Alex Jones interview

1177
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,823
When I when I interviewed him

1178
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,847
That was some

1179
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:26,687
That was really interesting and it and it was funny because

1180
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,551
Andrei interviewed him I had a couple years to think about it

1181
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:40,255
So I know I kind of listened to it again and again and thought about it and thought about it in the context of a

1182
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,791
Paymaster

1183
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,815
And

1184
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
I think

1185
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
You know

1186
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,191
It was a really

1187
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,983
Interesting window into

1188
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:50,751
The man

1189
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,823
More so that it seemed on the day of

1190
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,591
Because at

1191
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,127
The time it seemed like he was just

1192
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,151
Doing the show

1193
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
You know

1194
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
She called me the next

1195
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,039
Stay and then he spoke

1196
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:08,415
For two more hours on the phone and that was actually a little more real because I think he got

1197
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,951
He might have called his lawyers

1198
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,511
His mistake

1199
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:15,327
What is an item actually put snipers on the roof of my build

1200
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,679
Yeah it could have just been drunk

1201
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,495
Perhaps

1202
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,567
I don't know but

1203
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,127
No idea but I got the sense

1204
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,151
Like when we were

1205
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,687
Speaking Rob do his

1206
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,711
Naruto

1207
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,991
Lieutenant was in the room

1208
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,551
And I got the sense that he was trying to end

1209
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,903
You know watch me intimidate this woman

1210
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:44,767
You know watch me like make fun of her watch me make fun of her paper to her face

1211
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,791
Etcetera etcetera

1212
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,583
How come stuff really doesn't

1213
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,351
Bother me

1214
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,631
And so

1215
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,167
It didn't really

1216
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
Rattled

1217
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:58,335
Play much brother such a there's such a good little part in whenever you're describing the interview in your book where

1218
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,943
You say if he was really trying to intimidate me he would have come up and put a

1219
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,223
Space right into mine

1220
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,247
And instead

1221
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,807
Just kept backing further and further away from

1222
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,647
Which spider moving around the room and

1223
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,695
Yeah I was great Connecticut

1224
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
Description of his

1225
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,255
Complete and utter cowardice

1226
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:22,399
Bedford I do he didn't get a ship that's that's really where my heart goes out to

1227
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,679
Poor guy

1228
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,519
He gets to be the corporate representative a few years after

1229
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,311
Somebody gave us a show

1230
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
Yeah

1231
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,103
I'll say

1232
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,407
That was yeah that his

1233
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
His behavior was also really enjoy

1234
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
Interesting because

1235
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
It was such a like

1236
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:44,159
He'd laugh at Alex's jokes and that's her to check Alex's face to make sure it was okay that he was laughing like

1237
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,439
Was that a joke

1238
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,975
If you didn't mean it as

1239
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
The Joker

1240
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
I don't want to be laughing

1241
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,071
That was that was

1242
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,375
And that I remember calling back

1243
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
Writing it if

1244
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,423
Different story

1245
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
And he

1246
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
And here is

1247
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
Like

1248
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:02,847
Is this Elizabeth Williamson from the CIA who says

1249
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,175
Lame

1250
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,759
You could do better Rob come on

1251
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,551
Oh yeah

1252
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,087
Is Alex

1253
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
Surround

1254
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,927
Rob can I talk to your dad please

1255
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,023
I pretended to be a big boy

1256
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,399
Yeah that's actually kind of sad

1257
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,191
You can do better Rob but I bet you

1258
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,567
Fighting history teachers

1259
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,127
Yeah I have gone back

1260
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,431
And I realize that one of the things that I have

1261
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,455
Generally missed

1262
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,223
Over

1263
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
But I'm doing the shows

1264
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
Since of the Infowars Nightly News

1265
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,879
The show that Rob was the head of

1266
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,183
I've gone back and watch some of that new

1267
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
I was right to ignore it

1268
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,535
It's so bad

1269
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,327
You eat it a terrible job for years

1270
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,679
Naturally by David Knight

1271
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:05,055
He was for the

1272
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079
Beset

1273
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:12,479
The the older crowd who might be offended by Alex's gallon instead of louder with Crowder Ben Shapiro

1274
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,319
Quieter

1275
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,879
What's Covent down with David

1276
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,463
Have some chamomile tea in the morning

1277
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,327
You like to go to bed at 11 a.m.

1278
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,119
David items for you

1279
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:33,983
Forget you celebrate New Years at 4 in the afternoon

1280
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,823
Do you you interviewed Alex and what worked was the

1281
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,919
What was the surrealness of it other than him backing into a corner

1282
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,199
And and

1283
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:43,967
Failing to in

1284
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
What would you

1285
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,063
What do you win with about it was so surreal

1286
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,367
I really was trying to get

1287
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,415
So the idea of

1288
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:53,951
How

1289
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,743
How do you sort of

1290
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,559
How do Tuesday how do these two things exist

1291
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,583
In Alex Jones

1292
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
He is

1293
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,143
Good father

1294
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,703
Three children

1295
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,239
4

1296
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,519
Sorry now for

1297
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
And

1298
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,615
He is someone who

1299
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,943
Knew that he was inflicting a lot of pain

1300
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:15,967
On

1301
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,015
Parents who

1302
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,295
She had to have known

1303
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,623
Obviously that he was inflicting a lot of pain on the

1304
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,391
Her parents

1305
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,695
Of children who were his

1306
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
Children's ages

1307
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,535
Who were brutally murdered

1308
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,815
And I just

1309
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,143
You know all the joking aside and all the

1310
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,191
You know the the

1311
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:40,543
The sort of bravado and the end the China Vino

1312
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,823
Performance

1313
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:46,943
I just I couldn't really get there and it made me think about some of these other

1314
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,735
Conspiracists wear

1315
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,063
Is it that if you actually looked

1316
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
Set that

1317
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,879
And you didn't just deflect

1318
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
The question

1319
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:57,951
Could you ask

1320
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,975
Actually live with yourself

1321
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,767
You know I mean

1322
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,535
Jon Ronson

1323
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,559
And you know the Welsh

1324
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,375
Filmmaker who spent a lot of time

1325
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,911
Without Jones from

1326
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,191
Wayback

1327
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,983
And you know he

1328
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,007
Thanks

1329
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,031
She was different

1330
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:12,799
Person

1331
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,871
You know that earlier on he was not

1332
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,943
The kind of person who could do so

1333
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:25,343
And the islamophobia and the racism and all of that and he thinks that with

1334
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,879
Money and power

1335
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,183
Came a lot of that what do you guys say

1336
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,767
I don't necessarily believe that

1337
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:35,071
I think the John knew him

1338
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,655
And obviously has more exposure to him

1339
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
I think

1340
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,543
That a lot of the stuff

1341
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,847
But say the big

1342
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,871
3MP

1343
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,407
Denial of

1344
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Stuff

1345
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:54,015
Those Turtles were there in his earlier career

1346
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:54,783
It's just

1347
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,087
Are you with money and power you'd more to protect

1348
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,623
And more need

1349
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,903
To accelerate

1350
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
Eminem

1351
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:04,255
More dramatic

1352
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,071
An interesting person

1353
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,863
You start to make money off

1354
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,631
Being

1355
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
I don't know

1356
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
What's your head

1357
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
It doesn't

1358
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,287
I excite the audience as much

1359
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:21,663
To maintain that same level you going to have to ask a late in order to keep people's attention I think

1360
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:25,247
Yeah I think that business model maybe he you became

1361
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,551
A slave too but I think

1362
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,831
I think a fair amount of

1363
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,391
Those Tendencies were already there

1364
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,439
A big John Birch guy like

1365
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,487
From the beginning of his career in

1366
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:40,351
Right there nothing is not a ideology that's based around

1367
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:41,887
20

1368
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
Racist

1369
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:49,311
Be a nice caring person and also believe that black people are part of a communist plot to kill

1370
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
Kill white people

1371
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,895
The idea of civil rights

1372
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,967
Is a communist conspiracy

1373
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,271
Feel like

1374
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,319
I don't feel like that at

1375
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,623
Exist generally in a non bigger

1376
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,695
Yeah I think I think less

1377
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,255
That's what I mean that is an interesting question

1378
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,815
What Alex was like indifferent

1379
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,839
Time. But

1380
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:16,959
One thing that John said to us when we when we talk to mister

1381
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
Was

1382
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,567
He doesn't know if you can really Judge Alex

1383
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:24,127
Based on the way that we would judge

1384
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,407
Other people

1385
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
Because

1386
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:29,503
Maybe Alex is really just a narcissistic

1387
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,271
Psychopath

1388
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,807
And if that's the case

1389
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:35,135
What really do we have to say to a person who is just

1390
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,927
Utterly incapable

1391
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,719
Of giving a f*** about

1392
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,255
Whether or not murdered kids

1393
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,815
Families are are

1394
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,583
In pain

1395
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
You know

1396
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,399
Yeah I mean

1397
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,191
I always am shy wave

1398
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,983
From those things cuz I'm not a

1399
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,799
Psychiatrist obviously

1400
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,127
Just a journalist exactly Goldwater

1401
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
But

1402
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,711
It is awfully hard

1403
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,991
To come up with

1404
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
The

1405
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,807
And not only him

1406
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,343
You know how

1407
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,647
These people could

1408
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,463
It's either maybe it's that

1409
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,279
They truly truly believe it and now it's just case

1410
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,559
He is already set

1411
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,327
She thinks she'll be

1412
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,607
Open. So this is this

1413
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Does not apply to

1414
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,655
But

1415
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,031
I think there are some of these individuals who really do believe that

1416
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,103
This didn't happen or didn't happen the way it was reported

1417
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,663
And then I think there are others of them that

1418
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,759
There's something they're getting out of this witch

1419
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,319
That is much more precious to them

1420
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,855
Then

1421
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,159
Even their reputation

1422
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,207
You know or there

1423
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,815
You know or the sort of ostracisation that comes from

1424
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,351
Espousing a theory like

1425
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:51,167
Like this so they're kind of driven back into their own

1426
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
Proud

1427
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,983
Because those are the only people who

1428
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,031
Will give them the benefit of the

1429
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,823
The doubt anymore not only as a

1430
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,359
Conspiracy theorist but

1431
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:04,479
Yeah I mean it it makes sense if you go out into reality

1432
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:09,343
Painful and if you Retreat back into fantasy everybody likes

1433
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,879
I mean it's it's

1434
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,439
You know if you go outside and you're a vampire and

1435
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Get burnt

1436
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,231
You're going to stay inside

1437
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:20,607
Yeah yeah 53rd group it's become a kind of knew family to them

1438
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,143
You know one number then

1439
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,447
I am in Wolfgang halbig again Springs

1440
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,983
His wife left

1441
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,775
Him he is completely estranged

1442
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,567
From an insofar as I can

1443
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,335
Intel

1444
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,871
You know from his

1445
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,151
And from his grandkid

1446
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,711
And you know this

1447
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:39,295
James Tracey you know University of

1448
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,831
That you

1449
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:44,159
FAU thank you for the Atlantic University

1450
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:50,559
Thank you so much and I just

1451
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,399
So yeah so he

1452
01:00:55,423 --> 01:01:00,543
For him I mean he lost his job he told me he's an absolute Pariah and Academia

1453
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,591
There he is

1454
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,127
Unemployable

1455
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,431
She has a lot of kids

1456
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,479
And including a child

1457
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,783
With a lot of difficulties you need to

1458
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,319
You know Medical Care

1459
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
And yet

1460
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:19,999
He doesn't find a road back for himself and as I'm getting off the phone kind of feeling awful it

1461
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
You do what is just

1462
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,047
Described as

1463
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,327
You know his life

1464
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,863
He's like

1465
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,911
We can talk about coronavirus yet

1466
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,215
Yeah

1467
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
So

1468
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,543
There is no Elemento

1469
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,335
Psychology there that

1470
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,895
I think requires some

1471
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,919
Special training.

1472
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:42,783
Yeah probably that's a good way of putting it and it's really interesting

1473
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,599
To the look at that person

1474
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:54,559
These people like Fetzer and how big

1475
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,375
Tracy who you're describing as like

1476
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,655
Effaced

1477
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,703
Drastically severe

1478
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,471
Secuencias

1479
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
And

1480
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,615
Maybe that's what's coming for Alex

1481
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,919
But it's so weird that he's

1482
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,455
Been able

1483
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:16,063
To some degree to avoid the Fate that these other

1484
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:16,831
Folks have

1485
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:19,903
Just Duke boys in the General Lee over

1486
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,671
Laws

1487
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,463
Yeah pretty remarkable

1488
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,535
Yeah it is well

1489
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:28,351
He's made a lot of money doing this as

1490
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,887
You know you guys know from

1491
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
The documents that have come

1492
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,679
Come out

1493
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
Court cases

1494
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,751
You do he's

1495
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,287
Cannon fire

1496
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,567
Legal count

1497
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,335
Council and

1498
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,127
So far

1499
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:40,895
He's

1500
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,663
You know

1501
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,199
But I do think

1502
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:43,967
The Reckoning

1503
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
I think

1504
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,343
I think what I'm hearing from you is that

1505
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,647
Setzer's mistake was he didn't start a pill come

1506
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:58,815
This is the classic mistake

1507
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,863
That we need a pill

1508
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,655
Pretty bad

1509
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,471
I was thinking about this

1510
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,751
The process of writing this book

1511
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:07,775
I took

1512
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,311
Quite a while

1513
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,591
And it's

1514
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:13,407
It's as much as it is a creative process

1515
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,943
It's got to be also

1516
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,479
Like a learning

1517
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,503
Experience

1518
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,295
Says well going along

1519
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,855
What do you think is

1520
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,695
But one of the most essential things that you learned

1521
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,231
Over the course of the

1522
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,511
Experiences

1523
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,535
Of writing the book

1524
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,911
I think I'm not original in saying this and that set

1525
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
Every book

1526
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,727
Is a lot harder

1527
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
To right then

1528
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
You think it is

1529
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
Starting out

1530
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
That's what a lot of

1531
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:47,199
Call ezoo written books told me complained about that a bit

1532
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,223
Don't you think

1533
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,015
It's it's great

1534
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:54,879
The process is awesome it happened so quick and you never ever struggle

1535
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,927
That's the thing I learned from writing a book

1536
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,255
Oh no

1537
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,839
You never stare at your computer screen and wonder if life is worth living

1538
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,167
The process

1539
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:10,751
This is obviously very difficult and then you add the subject matter being something

1540
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:14,079
So uncomfortable to wrestle with something

1541
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,359
Yeah

1542
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:18,687
I mean one thing that I struggle with Az a writer just

1543
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,735
In general just in my day job at the time

1544
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
Is

1545
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,039
You don't that sort of

1546
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,319
A blank paper

1547
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,623
Kind of feeling I will just put

1548
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:30,207
Something down just not to have to look at that and

1549
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,487
Because one

1550
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,535
As long as the page is blank

1551
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:39,167
I can come up with the most amazing things to do to keep me from actually writing I'm sorry

1552
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,959
I organized an entire

1553
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,519
Linen closet during this book project

1554
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:46,079
Before a chapter and it wasn't even Milan

1555
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,871
Closet

1556
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,943
To learn procrastination taken

1557
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,735
Really new one

1558
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,527
Impress

1559
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,807
Steven Myself and I

1560
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,111
I'm used to myself on that so

1561
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,671
I found that bad happened

1562
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,207
Before every chapter

1563
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,279
26 chapters

1564
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:09,887
So I added up all the days that I spent you know kind of

1565
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:12,703
Stalling between chapters because of the

1566
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,495
Total Terror of

1567
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,775
Starting a new chapter

1568
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,847
And I thought you know I could brazenness this book 6 months

1569
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:24,991
Every every now and again but like when I'm trying to not prepare an episode

1570
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:28,319
I will consider learning a new language

1571
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,367
Or something

1572
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,647
I find this at

1573
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,695
That's been such an impulsive like

1574
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,023
This material is

1575
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:40,095
Ugly I remember

1576
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,911
I don't actually do it I just think about it

1577
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:47,519
Alright sometimes I scroll through Duolingo and maybe

1578
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,823
Maybe today is the day that I

1579
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,615
Brush up on my French

1580
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,151
Or whatever

1581
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:56,223
It's great day exactly remember what

1582
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:59,295
But I was riding by and I had a blank page and I was

1583
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:02,623
I was doing everything possible to avoid looking at it

1584
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:05,695
And then the next time I turned and looked down I had written

1585
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,231
You're doing alright

1586
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:13,631
Just without I didn't think about it it was there waiting for me when I went back and I was like

1587
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,911
I think I need help

1588
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:19,519
I think you might need that medicine

1589
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,591
How did you get over that feeling that blanket

1590
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
What I mean

1591
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,663
That was kind of

1592
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:30,783
Part of it will be we talked about it before we recorded but that was parted by

1593
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,111
Chopping up so I printed everything out and then chopped it up

1594
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,671
And so having the physical

1595
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:40,511
Watch I'm not pieces of paper with stuff that I'd already written on it

1596
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,327
I could look over at that and then start writing a

1597
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:46,911
So that was really you know I'm holding

1598
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:50,239
Are you know to win

1599
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,543
It's it's trying to mix

1600
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,079
The transcription and

1601
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,127
Turn it into something new

1602
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
You know

1603
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,199
So one thing that I did was

1604
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,991
And this was on the advice of

1605
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,039
Time is a mentor

1606
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,063
To me who's written

1607
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
Name is David Harbour

1608
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
And

1609
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,207
Wonderful wonderful friend and he said

1610
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,487
One thing you want to do

1611
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,791
They are bunch of chapters or if you

1612
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,839
You can swing it your whole first draft

1613
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,399
Send it to a group of readers people

1614
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,191
Russ not just journalists not to

1615
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
Just people and wash

1616
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,263
Container in New York or wherever

1617
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,055
Like some friends who are

1618
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,335
Read a lot of books and

1619
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,895
You know who you trust to give you some honest

1620
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,663
Feedback

1621
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,711
So I print all that out

1622
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,759
You know it's 16 chapters

1623
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:38,111
I realize that at 16 chapters and again there are 26

1624
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,183
I was a hundred thousand words over

1625
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,535
That's actually an entire book

1626
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,119
So I had to talk my entire book

1627
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,447
A hundred thousand words

1628
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,495
From the first 16 chapters

1629
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,775
And then write 10 more

1630
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:56,799
So

1631
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:02,431
But those 10 those following 10 were definitely a little more refined than the

1632
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,527
The lesson of 100,000

1633
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,319
Was Larry

1634
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:11,391
I mean one thing that I will say absolutely is

1635
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
Is great

1636
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,439
Is how readable

1637
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,743
It is so

1638
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:19,071
Straightforward well-paced

1639
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,607
Written organized

1640
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,911
I mean I read it in

1641
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,447
I think 3 or 4 hours

1642
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,983
Like sat down and just

1643
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
Bang it out is great

1644
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,799
Thank you so much

1645
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,591
And thank you for reading

1646
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:31,871
You welcome

1647
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:39,551
Exchange another quick question

1648
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,575
Before you

1649
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:45,183
As far as what we found is when you

1650
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,255
Study the misinformation world if you

1651
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:51,327
Get good enough at it you become part of your story

1652
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,607
You know like

1653
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:59,519
From the beginning the idea with our show a Dans Dans intent was we're not going to interact with Infowars

1654
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,543
I don't want to become part of

1655
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,311
The story

1656
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,103
And in your case

1657
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
You

1658
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,919
He talked about you on the show

1659
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:10,015
Do you feel like you got added into the story more than you wanted to

1660
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,855
Oh that's a great

1661
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,647
Question

1662
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,183
It is

1663
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,511
What a great exchange exchange

1664
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,399
You know I suppose

1665
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,959
Suppose it was going to be inevitable

1666
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,495
Because when you're asking

1667
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,031
People why they do what they do

1668
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:32,799
And

1669
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,567
You know it's

1670
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,335
Clear that

1671
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,639
You're not on there

1672
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:42,783
That they're going to c&n against the nature of this was

1673
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:45,599
These people are are getting so much

1674
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:48,159
Psychic income from what they're doing

1675
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,439
That

1676
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,719
Anyone on the out

1677
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,999
Side of that asking

1678
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,791
Questions and saying

1679
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,071
What you just said is

1680
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:55,839
Shrew

1681
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,375
Is a threat and antenna

1682
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,655
Righto

1683
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,679
I think.

1684
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,471
There was part of that

1685
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:04,799
And then also you may have noticed over

1686
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,335
The past several years that

1687
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:11,711
The New York Times in general is a pretty handy file

1688
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,991
For a lot of

1689
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:14,783
Folks who

1690
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
Sure

1691
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:20,415
And it's something that has

1692
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:21,951
Permit

1693
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
Implode attached

1694
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:24,767
Stewart

1695
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,791
To like

1696
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,839
The New York times is attacking me

1697
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,607
Is is almost

1698
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,399
A sign of validation

1699
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,423
4

1700
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,751
Someone like Alex would be very difficult to resist

1701
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,031
Yeah

1702
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,055
Yeah and

1703
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,871
You know and I I tried it like

1704
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,663
While some of what I was

1705
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:45,759
You know I knew had gone on and and what I was learning and and what p

1706
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,783
People were saying

1707
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,063
Was absolutely

1708
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,343
Urinating

1709
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
Juno

1710
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,927
Really

1711
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,207
Beyond

1712
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,231
Creating

1713
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,535
I was trying to

1714
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,095
Stand you know I just kept trying to thing

1715
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,703
If I'm passing judgment or I'm just pushing back all the

1716
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,775
I'm not going to

1717
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,567
Gain any fresh

1718
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,615
Insights I mean we know this

1719
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:15,199
Stop is wrongheaded you know we already know that so they don't

1720
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,735
Need me to tell them that

1721
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,295
You know I'm trying to figure out like

1722
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,831
How did you

1723
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,623
Become this way

1724
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,647
And

1725
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,439
And why do you say

1726
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,719
This is it

1727
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,743
You do it

1728
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,535
Is it like a prophet reason

1729
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,583
Is it an ideological reason

1730
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:35,679
Is it something that you know is there like some need in you that

1731
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,215
This fulfills

1732
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,263
I was trying to understand that

1733
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,031
Just be

1734
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
Because

1735
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:44,127
I wanted the book to Ashley

1736
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,407
Help our

1737
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,431
Collective

1738
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:50,527
Societal thinking about this and maybe help us arrive at some answers

1739
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,319
You know how can we bring

1740
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,367
People back from the edge or

1741
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,135
Keep them from

1742
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,927
Tipping over in the first place

1743
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:01,279
That's what I was trying to do and I guess by fighting

1744
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,303
With people your

1745
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,607
Yeah

1746
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,631
Yeah

1747
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,447
No you might be able to write a book

1748
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:13,567
Action sequences

1749
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,847
But yeah that might not be

1750
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,127
Societally is

1751
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,175
Yeah

1752
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,991
And then I also you know the thing I was always

1753
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:21,759
Obviously

1754
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,527
Holding

1755
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,831
Close with this idea that

1756
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,623
You know these families

1757
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,927
Telling me their story

1758
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,231
You know they were trusting me

1759
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,511
With the worst

1760
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,047
Possible

1761
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,327
Day of

1762
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,607
Fairlife

1763
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,399
Slice and

1764
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,959
And they were doing it not because

1765
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,727
Anything

1766
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,495
Having to do with me

1767
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,775
They were doing it

1768
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,055
Because they wanted

1769
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,103
You and all of us

1770
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:50,175
To understand that this was something that

1771
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,711
If these folks

1772
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,735
Income

1773
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,503
For the

1774
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,039
Parent of a murdered child

1775
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:55,807
There come

1776
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:56,831
For all of us

1777
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,623
And that this is

1778
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,951
Societal warning that they're trying to raise

1779
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,999
And and you know

1780
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,023
I just

1781
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:11,935
That's why I and I know that this is a really hard topic this shooting is is something that'll

1782
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,471
A lot of you know

1783
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,519
A lot of humans in it

1784
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:18,591
It's a very human reaction to want to look away from it and not

1785
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
Wanted

1786
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,639
Relive those days

1787
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,663
Details and where

1788
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:25,247
You were when it happened and how old your own children were

1789
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
And all of that

1790
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,599
But I kind of feel like

1791
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,159
We owe it to the families

1792
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,439
22

1793
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,207
You know

1794
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:39,327
Walk through that with them and understand what happened afterward because they are trying to

1795
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,607
Italian

1796
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,375

1797
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,703

1799
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
That's

1800
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,519
Agrate

1801
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,799
Great thought I thought

1802
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,567
I feel like

1803
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:55,967
Doesn't get better than that great plot 222 clothes on

1804
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,759
I think there's a lot to say

1805
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:04,159
Think about their yeah we're not going to we're not going to be able to top that one so soon he'll get the best line I think I'll just end it

01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,271
Incredibly painful

1842
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:36,575
If you're actually engaging with it and
