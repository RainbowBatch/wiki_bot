Jordan

8
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
Good question for you buddy

00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,200
Hold the f****** a really does

That movie is good. Actually good I've seen it made fun of too many times

12
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,648
It is restrained cage

13
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,208
But with a good freak out

14
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,280
It's you know it's it's it's

15
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,840
It's a it's an accessible Nicolas Cage

16
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,376
It's not like you know what you

17
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
You get some sort of just

18
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:47,264
Run-of-the-mill average everyday person

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,592
Call New Orleans

20
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,896
Original Bad Lieutenant

21
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,712
Some other caves performances probably too

22
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
Too much for the normies National Treasure you can get them in on that knowing it

23
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
What is in that Mill York

24
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Exciting

25
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Anyway

26
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,280
The movie came out 13 years ago

27
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
Google

00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,632

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,360
I told you my bright spot is yesterday nice

00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,432
Table of women at this restaurant

31
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,992
Bought me and my partner a bottle of wine

32
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
What oh yeah and Winos here's the worst part right

33
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
I was dressed like this

34
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,000
Basically I do the nicer sweater on no hood

35
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
Oki

36
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,840
To sit at a second hand store

37
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
Earlier yesterday morning

38
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,656
Right

39
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
She was wearing jeans

40
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Nice shirt we were both walking

41
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
She had flowers

42
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Right

43
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
And

44
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,152
They immediately came over and they're like oh my god did you guys just get married

45
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
And the problem was

46
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
We have

47
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
Oh and that's offensive

48
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,112
Because both people correctly sussed out that's as good as this Dirtbag is going to look

49
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
Wow that's as good as it gets for me

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,696
Yes

51
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
I would like to remind the listeners before I went to

52
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,496
We went to The Men's Wearhouse what you could have

53
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
You got a hug out of

54
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,920
Believe their Jordan Courthouse

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,528
Yesterday at 2 p.m. took us about

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
5 minutes to get the marriage license

57
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
Quick

58
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,160
Devon my partner's mom

59
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
She married us

60
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,000
The humanists celebrate

61
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,584
Okay take about 15 minutes we ran out we went and had dinner

62
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
Congratulation

63
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
He's great but really

64
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,520
I want to talk more about knowing

65
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:02,688
Congratulations I'm sure everyone out there is very happy and excited for you

66
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
It was nice

67
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
Is the best way to do a wedding

68
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
Ever

69
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,856
Pretty low-key in terms of the ceremony

70
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,416
Pretty low-key in terms of you announcing it

71
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
There was a witness

72
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,631
Okay huh like to cry

73
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,591
There wasn't an official with it

74
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
To be there

75
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,967
Yes we had our

76
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
Wedding Witness by an innocent bystander

77
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
That was how it goes

78
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,903
Kind of brings us to another point it's going to take a little bit of a trip

79
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,719
Honeymoon ish

80
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
There is a vacation

81
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167
I'm coming up middle of April something like that release schedule.

82
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,751
Prepare yourself

83
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:05,407
So Jordan today not to take away not to not to Pivot away from

84
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Courthouse that needs

85
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Just a private Vine

86
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,551
So it's about

87
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
The 22nd

88
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,903
Within the year of Our Lord 2020

89
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
This is

90
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
Chaos there's episodes

91
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
Going to be a mess there is a lot of nonsense

92
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,863
Episode itself is

93
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,775
Perfunctory not really that's going over it there's some interesting things to discuss but

94
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
Far overshadowed

95
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:39,967
By the circumstances surrounding this episode of all that

96
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,807
Before we do it's like little moments say hello

97
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,135
So first Jordan gets me through the mic up

98
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
Thank you so much right now policy walk

99
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
Are you very much

100
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,071
2 ft from NOCO thank you so much for now policy walk

101
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727
Very much sorry pumpkin but I'm glad we bought it over this thank you so much

102
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,359
Romantic themed emerging

103
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,687
Your nickname for your partner is pumpkin does not matter

104
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,343
You claim that one was on you sure

105
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,511
Lindsay Lawler thank you so much

106
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,655
Your Amazon Alexa thank you so much

107
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
Thank you very much

108
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
You

109
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:39,103
So I believe that everybody has a vague understanding of the things

110
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
Set up and going on in Alex's

111
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
Immediate past

112
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
And

113
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,551
I feel like we will we will dig into this hole a bit

114
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,367
About contacts drop from Today Show

115
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
Earbuds

116
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Find

117
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Leave my bugs alone

118
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,583
Bye bugs Pacific property issue or a bug

119
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
This does not approve of your bugs

120
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Now it makes more sense

121
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,751
So I was going to put out an episode on Wednesday this week Jordan

122
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
You know this because

123
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
Your eye called

124
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,127
Albuquerque told things got a bit overwhelming and I wanted

125
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
Ended up laying out

126
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,271
Monday was an insane day for things that are related to our show

127
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,903
First Joe Biden use the words New World Order and in the process he gave conspiracy theorists

128
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Justification to believe

129
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,791
That their particular flavor of shadowy lead cabal runs the world behind

130
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
And a big old

131
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,167
It was a dumb move but I was trying to say

132
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,567
It's not like there's a new world order it's an order that is not the same as the old and we are on the world

133
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,687
As soon as I heard the biting it said I was not

134
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,807
Publix 294 Alex's response because I feel like it's super predictable and I really have that much

135
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
More to say than we have

136
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,951
Leaders sometimes talk about the international order of the world

137
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,999
The set of relationships alliances

138
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
Trade Agreement

139
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
An enemy's internationally

140
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:08,959
Sometimes it major changes to the status quo of these relationships has become something new

141
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,055
It's an expression that makes total sense and there shouldn't be anything wrong with using them

142
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
Describe exactly the situation in the world

143
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,151
Today

144
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:22,015
I hear them and Pruitt is a guy approves of the devil's puppeteering biting at the top of the world

145
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,599
So we don't fight to eat our children's blood or something like

146
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,183
Monday evening everything got thrown into chaos

147
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,535
Will summer reported that Alex's lawyers had requested his deposition

148
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,119
In the Connecticut Sandy Hook case be postponed because of an emergency

149
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
Genesee medical situation

150
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
Apparently the afternoon it's

151
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,263
3:30 p.m. North Patterson received

152
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,151
A call that Alex was quote under the care of a physician for medical conditions that require immediate

153
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
And possibly emergency testing

154
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
Norm Drew

155
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,855
He doesn't pee.

156
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,415
Right superficial

157
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:06,815
Alex had done his show that day and was on here until like 2 p.m. and there was no sign of any particular

158
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
In addition norms

159
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
Filing claim

160
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:15,519
My client is not authorized me to disclose the nature of the medical conditions or the identity of the physician

161
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Which is sketchy

162
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:22,431
This was all in service of trying to delay a deposition that was scheduled for this Thursday

163
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Right

164
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,759
Dispose doctor had advised Alex

165
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,319
Sit for the deposition given his medical condition

166
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Again seem Shady

167
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
Yeah there was a schedule at

168
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,975
The park may I sort of oversimplify

169
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Wednesday in

170
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Thursday

171
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,583
Delaware deposition

172
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
Yeah he had a case of I don't want to do it either

173
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,239
I didn't want to rush into anything and turning around to get an episode at the

174
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
Discuss this on Wednesday would have been a challenge

175
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
But at this point if you more data points have come out

176
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,687
The first is that Alex was in studio doing his show on Tuesday

177
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
He wasn't broadcasting from home

178
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,807
You didn't have Owen or Harrison cover the show so he could

179
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,367
Keep up the ruse that he was

180
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
It was just business as usual

181
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
Can I suspect the reason for that is that bite into a new world order and I couldn't let Harrison or Owen swing at that

182
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
Add meatball that was right over the plate

183
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
With

184
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:20,287
So hard it would make everyone cry like Alex would have to break into the studio like you would like to know

185
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,431
The movie like Mike Myers scream it at a smoke

186
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
This leaves

187
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
Question that still hanging in there

188
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,855
What's going on with that motion that Norm filed in the first place

189
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,487
The most obvious answer is that it could be purely an attempt to f*** with the plaintiff's case

190
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Install the process

191
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,327
Legal strategy up till this point

192
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
At every turn he pulled out any trick

193
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,727
You can pick up to slow things down and try and create legal headaches for the opposing counsel

194
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,823
This would be totally within his character and I wouldn't put it past him at all

195
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,639
There's nothing you really stands to lose from sitting

196
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,967
Sing for the deposition because of Stonewall like he always does

197
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,039
He does have something to gain and Theory from trying to drag his feet

198
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
And try to force

199
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
The court to reschedule is trial date

200
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Which

201
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,231
Much more fun for health course it wouldn't surprise me if that was part of what he was up

202
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Justify

203
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:18,655
Yeah when I go to shot a second option occurred to me and that is the Alex could have covid again

204
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,239
When you got back from California Alex was complaining about feeling

205
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
I'm sick and we know that he's

206
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
Is very Reckless

207
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
And on

208
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,895
Tomatoes and he's guy who consistently hangs out with other unvaccinated people

209
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
And takes no precautions about getting sick

210
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,783
He's a high-risk category and he just took a trip to another state

211
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
So the opportunity

212
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,135
Please bring to be exposed to something seemed pretty decent at least

213
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,439
His behavior is a whole would also fit with

214
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,255
The covid idea because if he had covid he would

215
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
Still show up to his Studio to do the show

216
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,399
He doesn't give a s*** about his staff and he's admitted he already

217
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,239
Did that the last time she had Kobe went to the workings exposed to it

218
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
I heard that

219
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
The first thing I texted you is like well of course

220
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,431
She's still in the studio if he has any wood make sense why he wouldn't go to court

221
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Wouldn't want to go to court

222
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Is Dave take

223
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
Things like that

224
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:12,159
One of the primary reasons I didn't want to jump the gun on this is that I wanted to be able to have some

225
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,255
Some kind of information and not just you know come to the show with assumptions and whatever

226
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:21,887
David was filed and we learned a little bit more about this medical

227
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,239
Monday Alex happy complete lunatic

228
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,871
Fantasizes about murders doctor marbles on his show to do some fun covid denialism Khan

229
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Contact stuff

230
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
When Marvel showed up at

231
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,223
The studio to do the interview his quote

232
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
Personal observations of mr. Jones

233
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
So alarm him

234
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,623
But he insisted on conducting a physical examination of mr. Jones

235
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,231
He immediately advised mr. Jones to go to an emergency room or call 911

236
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,047
After mr. Jones refused the physician advised

237
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,607
To stay home which mr. Jones did not do

238
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,215
Okay so if I understand this correctly

239
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:03,615
Marvel's walked into Infowars inside you look like s*** you got to go to the doctor I called

240
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
911 Alex

241
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,503
Appropriately understanding the doctor Marvel's is a moron

242
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
I would assume

243
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
Right off the bat we have a few problem

244
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,415
The first is that doctor marbles is certifiably insane

245
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
And I wouldn't take Direct

246
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Cancel the grocery

247
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
Restore from him let alone Medical

248
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,607
So this is all coming from him seeing Alex getting freaked out and then I guess checking

249
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
His pulse

250
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,727
Whatever it was that marble saw it was enough to advise Alex

251
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,543
It's called 911 Sirius although again

252
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
Doctor marble

253
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
Is advice coming from a lunatic

254
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
Alex didn't take

255
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,223
This advice

256
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,783
Excuse to not go to schedule deposition

257
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:48,671
Probably would have come off a little more convincing if Alex and hadn't done his show the next day

258
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,511
Beverly punctures any illusion that whatever he's dealing with would preclude him

259
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,327
Them from sitting for a deposition God that's great

260
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,495
Having snub doctor marbles advice and not called 911 Alex didn't show the next day Tuesday the 20

261
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
Which is what we're going to cover

262
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
For today

263
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
Marbles was able to convince Alex to go to

264
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
See a doctor friend of his doctor Amy offered

265
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
Who practices in Marble Falls

266
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
Texas

267
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
Just about an hour outside Austin

268
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,671
At this point I feel like we're in some kind of a weird marbles base

269
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
I feel like

270
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,535
Feel like I'm asleep or something

271
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
You're just marbling

272
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:32,703
Not the marbles the way that marbles needs to prescribe marble rye

273
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,823
Doctoroff 8 in the morning of Wednesday March 23rd

274
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
He didn't do his show

275
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,199
Additionally he didn't show up for the first day of his schedule deposition

276
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,503
Which was supposed to be like I said on Wednesday and Thursday

277
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Resultant

278
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Complexions

279
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
Doctoroff it was in agreement with marble

280
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
Should be doing this deposition

281
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
At all

282
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
Based on issues related to stress

283
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:05,727
She said quote I had a medical visit with mr. Alex Jones for acute medical issues that were time-sensitive

284
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
A potentially serious

285
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
There's a little tough.

286
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,919
Parse because the time sensitivity could be a reference to him having a hard deadline about the deposition

287
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
As opposed to being something where is Health a dictator

288
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
The time sensitivity

289
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
It's unclear

290
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
In her note however

291
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
There's a redaction

292
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,183
We started a comprehensive medical evaluation

293
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,511
He has to assess his blank

294
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,279
Status

295
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
I've asked him to avoid too much stress

296
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,143
Until we have results from the blood test

297
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
This morning sure

298
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,983
Assuming that this isn't all an elaborate charade that's

299
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Kind of worrying

300
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
This has to do with the medical condition

301
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
It's on full display everyday

302
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
I guess it has something to do with him

303
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
Ridiculously high risk

304
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
Of heart attack or stroke

305
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,599
Both of these are things that can be exacerbated by an

306
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,927
Pre-stress and markers would be the kind of things you'd find doing blood to

307
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
On Wednesday Alex

308
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:03,071
Didn't do this show but he recorded a long voice memo while he was driving

309
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,119
Probably to doctor office office

310
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
In Marble Falls

311
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
Play periodically on the show to keep the audience

312
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
Tuning out from reporting IRA

313
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
In case they might

314
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,871
I think that Alex accidentally showed up again so they really well maybe he'll come back

315
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,711
We got him so couple of fun pieces of trivia to throw in

316
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Just add for flavor here

317
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,551
Dr. marbles included the Dubai

318
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
He has claimed that he was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize

319
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:30,975
In 2021 any statement of facts in his affidavit which is hilarious

320
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,279
I read that and I still don't believe it's true

321
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
Affidavit

322
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,679
That's wrong doctoroff it is

323
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,031
But I was able to find it August 2021 article from a local Texas blog

324
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
About how her and her husband had decided not to

325
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Get back tonight

326
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,783
She doesn't run a normal medical office either she works of a place called heart and soul integrative

327
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Find yoga

328
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:01,439
Apparently has an MD but her practice is an is an integrative medicine

329
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,255
Which is definitely not where you'd go if you were in need of a

330
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
Cute emergency consultation

331
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,631
Integrative medicine is built on relationships with page

332
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
Actually

333
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,239
Be one that involves like a bunch of hormone therapy and yoga

334
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,543
Also she doesn't accept insurance

335
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Which is strange

336
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
Well no insurance will accept

337
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,455
I think the she can say that but I'm pretty sure it goes the other way around

338
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
I'm not sure I would put on the website

339
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,975
Percent. The doctor you drive an hour to see if you're needing a consultation about a condition that could be an emergency

340
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,023
None of this adds up

341
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
None of it makes sense

342
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,399
And I think that she has some kind of association with the American Frontline doctors

343
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,727
Hydroxychloroquine Ivermectin

344
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,031
Think of that that might be where the Kinect

345
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
And why he would go

346
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
See her as opposed

347
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
2

348
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,223
Someone potentially more qualified

349
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
I would think not

350
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,111
A lot of neck flexibility exercises

351
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:08,511
It's hard to tell precisely what's going on here but I think it's probably fair to say that this is an intersection

352
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,839
Innovation fully transparent attempt to avoid the deposition

353
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:17,727
And they real but probably not immediately pressing underlying condition that Alex is almost certainly struggle

354
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,055
He's in terrible shape and if you had a heart attack

355
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,871
Any point in the last 3 years I can't imagine anyone being

356
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
Surprise

357
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:30,271
Evening the judge in the case judge Bellis gave an order that was basically saying that Alex

358
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,343
I didn't listen to doctor Marbles and still came into work

359
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
So that affidavit is

360
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Really all day

361
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
Convincing in terms of the

362
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,487
He does have a Nobel Peace Prize

363
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Maybe he was a

364
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
Somebody said he should get one

365
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,631
The court wasn't sure who doctoroff it was but

366
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
But taken as a whole.

367
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,495
The two doctors provide indications that Alex had medical issues that quote

368
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,823
While potentially serious are not currently serious enough to

369
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,871
Either requires hospitalization

370
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,431
Or convince him to stop engaging in his

371
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
Mr. Jones

372
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,855
Unilaterally decide to continue to engage in these broadcasts but refused to participate

373
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Ended up as a

374
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,695
And plus she rejected the motion Alex

375
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
His lawyers had made to reschedule and Bar

376
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
Change in circumstances

377
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
Like Alex actually being hospitalized

378
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
Position book

379
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
Is planned on Thursday March

380
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
The real question

381
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
The game

382
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,751
What happens Thursday morning

383
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:28,639
Did Alex show up to do his shadow or does he show up at the or does he either

384
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,295
He's a very Brazen move Alex did not show up for the deposition on Thursday

385
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,879
Though the show did open with a pre-recorded video of him

386
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,439
Complaining about how his trial is a show trial

387
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,511
Laterally decide that the Peppa's

388
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
Fishing bait should be changed

389
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,327
No one will ever find me

390
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:51,423
The video is legitimately and say it's complete nonsense

391
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,799
Be perfectly honest when he didn't show up for Wednesday's deposition I was pretty sure you wasn't

392
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Going to show up on Thursday either

393
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127
And a big part of that was because what

394
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,199
He was actually required to produce for the deposition

395
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735
Is stuff he could never

396
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Never bring

397
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,111
It seems likely to me that he knew you was going to be sanctioned whether he showed up or not

398
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,671
And if you was able to not show up and make

399
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
He's not showing up

400
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,255
Somehow about the court not respecting his health needs

401
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559
Changing the narrative in distract

402
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
Acting is audience from

403
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,655
Is clear inability to answer a direct question

404
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
Particularly about his finances

405
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
The deposition of the penalty phase of the

406
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
McKay's a number the topic

407
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,103
Lexi was going to be required

408
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Pretty shoes with Finance

409
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,199
Including agreements that he had with youngevity

410
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
Which of course is the veterinarian dr. Wallach supplement company any cryptocurrency transactions

411
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,391
And documents related to

412
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,439
The connections between Asbury shell company

413
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,255
Like pqp our Holdings Limited

414
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,303
Njlj are holding

415
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
LLC

416
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
Good stuff

417
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,959
If you're in Alex's position it strongly in your interest to Stonewall this kind of stuff because

418
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
For the charade of your show to really work

419
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,383
It's pretty important for the listeners to just think that they give Alex money and he uses it to fight the big bad globulus

420
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,455
The actual details of his finances with

421
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,759
Radnet Imaging probably AAA the audience's

422
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,063
Blindly throw money at Infowars

423
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,976
You know he's not going to provide this information that is being required of him in the deposition and that'll get him

424
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
You cannot show up and that'll probably also

425
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,608
There's been a lot of talk

426
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,424
And like headlines about him like getting

427
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Arrested

428
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
Everybody understand

429
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,824
Was never really a likely outcome

430
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
But

431
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,128
If you were arrested

432
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,176
It would just be a situation where

433
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
Someone comes in

434
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
Gets him and makes him

435
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:46,880
Deposition debtors prison in Valley can pay off enough of those

436
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,696
Settlement in order to sit for they send at the Marshalls

437
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
I don't know

438
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Right

439
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,584
I feel like this video from Thursday morning

440
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,144
Glad you didn't show up for the deposition

441
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
The insane one

442
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
It's too important

443
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,496
To ignore

444
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
McCormick

445
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
The episode from the

446
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
So here's where it starts

447
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
And he's like a man

448
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Doctor doctor Barbie

449
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:16,576
The gentleman thank you so much for joining us on this live

450
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
Thursday Edition

451
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,416
They live on Shroyer Islam

452
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
TV off

453
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
I am taping this

454
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
In the morning for my home

455
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,096
Before I go against one medical test about on 48

456
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
I'm under a lot of stress

457
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
And

458
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,984
Studio-x gas cylinder issues

459
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,800
Monday and

460
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Awesome

461
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,896
Signs of some fraternity things check me out

462
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,200
Telescope

463
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
Regina

464
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
Stop by doctor

465
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,648
I can get into a clinic

466
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,208
Versus check myself in the emergency room

467
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
Wednesday morning

468
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
Urgent care centers

469
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
All over the place

470
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
It's not that

471
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,216
It's not accurate the only time I could go to this

472
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
Weirdo America's Frontline

473
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
Hydroxychloroquine yoga doctor

474
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
That's when

475
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
That's the look

476
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
I can go

477
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,920
To like a

478
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:20,320
Urgent care facility or the emergency room or I don't know about Backwoods

479
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
I could do all of those things

480
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,952
But if the yoga ladies available

481
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
You go to the yoga

482
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,072
I think it speaks to the fact that it's not urgent and it's not an emergency

483
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,608
First of all

484
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
And then second of all

485
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
If our Alex

486
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
Crutchfield

487
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
I feel pretty insulted

488
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:42,592
Liberty

489
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,688
I feel pretty insulted by doctor Marvels

490
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,992
Look at

491
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,576
Play Imagine Alex get PW

492
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,416
So he gets to the motion to postpone

493
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh yeah the deposition

494
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,216
My lawyers contact depositions on us

495
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
Jason X

496
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
5 * weeks.

497
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Document

498
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,384
Document other

499
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,224
Reset three times for depositions in the Sandy Hook case

500
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,296
Forgiven of over 300,000 pages of documents

501
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,392
How they got all our financial records everything for a defamation case

502
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,720
I thought you see my financials on the news when you

503
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:34,048
Definition to be on the news and then you see that I've been

504
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Defaulted

505
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:41,472
Clean when you see that I've been defaulted

506
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
These are show trials

507
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,056
These are staged event

508
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,104
I intend to sit for the deposition

509
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
I intend to

510
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,992
Fight

511
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
Court cases Texas with

512
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,344
Three different cases to in Texas

513
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
Want to Connecticut

514
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,184
Where I've been found guilty

515
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
By the judges

516
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
And the judges don't find you

517
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:13,728
Alex doesn't get to decide what is or is not a big deal for the court

518
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,360
He seems to think that his individual judgment determines what rules he is or is not bound to which is

519
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:23,968
Pretty disturbing mindset to have I'm just above the law

520
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,528
I mean is that above allies justy gets to

521
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,672
Like take it or leave it it's like this part of the line

522
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:39,072
It very well may be the case with other hearings are depositions have been rescheduled in the past but it was agreed to by both

523
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,864
Both parties and

524
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,144
Didn't happen with all those

525
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
No Lie

526
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
Time based on

527
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
Clearly very flimsy rationalization

528
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,104
If Alex is trying to suggest that this medical situation is really

529
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,640
Actually serious damn

530
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,688
His actions do not reflect that

531
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
Doing a show on Tuesday is a gigantic

532
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,576
Pick red flag that whatever Health concern he had isn't actually pressing

533
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:06,976
But just could be a convenient excuse to get him out of Heaven to do this deposition that he doesn't want to do and probably would be damaging if

534
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:12,608
He actually cooperated with I mean he does I will say that it in in all fairness

535
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:16,960
One-time the defense lawyers did the plaintiffs attorneys

536
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,288
I did have to reschedule because the dog

537
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Dog ate their homework

538
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:27,712
Sure and the judge was like well I mean clearly we have to wait until you can print that out because I

539
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
Texas score

540
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:35,648
This isn't an isolated case of Alex trying to postpone this episode

541
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:41,024
How much is legal team has been trying to get this deposition as well as that of their new corporate representative

542
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
His lawyer Brittany

543
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,072
Meat pies

544
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:47,168
I was trying to get those for phone for a while and according to a court filing

545
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
They have also suggest

546
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
They may need to extend the trial date

547
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:55,360
In this case lawyers are trying to push this back and take off down the road

548
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,944
It's one thing to need to reschedule something it's another two

549
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
Exhibit a consistent pattern

550
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
Creating fake

551
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,344
Excuses to drag out a process so you might never actually have to face the consequence

552
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
Better coming to you

553
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Yeah

554
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,256
And it's not like he Chevron he can't like a Florida judge and buy all that stuff

555
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
Now he's he's stuck

556
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
He can afford

557
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:19,424
Half a judge can't afford a little bit of a judge

558
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,032
Jicama clip you kind of get a towel from Alex that he knows he's full of s***

559
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
He says that he's already sat for a deposition

560
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,688
Three times in the Sandy Hook case any use of the singular noun

561
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:35,040
Later in the clip he shows that he's keenly aware that there's multiple different cases

562
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,600
Just part of the reason that he's required to say it first

563
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Separate deposition

564
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,952
And then there's the dynamic that he's completely

565
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,536
Use the discovery and deposition processes in the first phase

566
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,096
Is the trial

567
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
Is where there's a different set of facts

568
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,424
The depositions are set to

569
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Explorer

570
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,752
Bobby says it's going to be more times you required to stay

571
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,824
Alex knows all this but he's counting on his audience except

572
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
I think this b******* woe-is-me you take where the whole world

573
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
Has conspired against him

574
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
Initial trial

575
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,272
And honestly it's probably going to work with most of his listeners but

576
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Complete fraud

577
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,624
I I mean it is

578
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
It is weird how

579
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,744
Everybody knows that this is malicious

580
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,560
There's nobody who doesn't know that this is militia

581
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,864
You don't know that this is malicious

582
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
You're hopelessly naive

583
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,728
And yet at the same time it's like well

584
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:31,104
We've given other people chances before when it wasn't malicious so in the sense of fairness

585
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,896
We need to afford the same chance

586
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
Even when people are malicious and it's like this

587
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,016
We could just not do that

588
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:44,416
There's a limit I think we're well past that is the problem

589
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,280
Actual medical condition that is at the root of it I just

590
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,328
Bulshit the way he's using it I don't think it's

591
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:57,728
Well I mean if you're worried about the deposition being stressful for you my friend I'm afraid that's what a Depo

592
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,008
Position is going to be

593
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,104
. sure there's no Breezy deposition for him

594
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,640
I actually don't think

595
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,456
He is too stressed out by these depositions

596
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,528
Because he knows he could decide I don't know

597
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,832
But kill time

598
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,928
The issue to those like anything that

599
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,024
If stress is legitimately the issue

600
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,328
He screams

601
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
Freak the f*** out on his show

602
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
He constant

603
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:30,496
Any storms out of studio and ever use Madden

604
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:35,104
There's no more stressful experience for him then doing his show

605
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,432
Much easier to take this kind of a complaint seriously if his actual

606
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,968
Kinston dedicate that he was still

607
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,016
Like more than willing to do

608
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
Vignettes

609
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
Painfully I'll be

610
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Beasley stressful

611
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
Mommy maybe he's doing yoga.

612
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,184
No

613
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,000
So Alex gets into the issue of default judgment

614
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,792
Mets and I think he's steps in it

615
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
Default judgment

616
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
Somebody

617
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,192
Never shows up one time whenever showed up in quarter.

618
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
Smiling

619
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,640
With lesser sanctions

620
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,688
We have been fed

621
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
Into the Democratic party process

622
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,856
Even if that's the standard that Alex is using to determine when

623
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
Default judgments are Justified

624
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,184
He's case with Meredith all judge

625
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
Do you know entry or both

626
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
Didn't appear for schedule deposition

627
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,304
Surly and these case

628
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,376
He didn't respond to multiple requests or document

629
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,168
On multiple occasions he sent

630
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,008
Completely unprepared people to depositions to pretend to be corporate Representatives

631
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,848
Which may not be the same thing as filing fraudulent documents but man it's closed

632
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Also here

633
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,920
Ton of opportunities to stop a

634
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
Abusing the process

635
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
He was given

636
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:48,576
Smaller sanctions repeatedly and it was abundantly clear to anyone paying attention that he was going to

637
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,160
Was going to keep that behavior the fuk up

638
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
Any effect on his.

639
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Participation data

640
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Abuse of the process

641
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
He did all this to himself

642
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:02,656
And even by his own metric that he's laying out here he deserves that default judgment against

643
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,680
He has just

644
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:08,288
Condemned himself it's actually I mean you say that but it's like

645
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
What is

646
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
The words that

647
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,896
He says you know like what do they mean

648
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:17,760
And I feel like you're just being unfair with your interpretation of the meaning of words

649
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,808
Yeah that made

650
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,672
I was just mad at everybody that's like

651
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:29,024
They're the ones trying to cash it off and work

652
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,840
Contacts

653
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,632
Maybe the Sandy Hook man

654
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,264
Go to court literally the judge

655
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
They're making them up and

656
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,104
My king of the lawyers and

657
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,152
The BBC in a quarter

658
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,768
Buy my book buy my book it just came out in time for the trial

659
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:11,520
Elizabeth Williamson the book is available fire safety hook America

660
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,480
Yeah I think he's he's distorting the actual conversation

661
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,576
I don't know if anybody is saying that he made his career on Sandy Hook

662
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,136
Just that his actions

663
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
In the

664
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,744
Avenue of his career he profited

665
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
I'll buy

666
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,328
Inflicting

667
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,376
On the other people who experience

668
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,680
If he does not understand

669
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
Clearly.

670
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,496
What the problem is

671
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,544
After having it been explained to him

672
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,824
In so many ways

673
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
With so many

674
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
Carrots

675
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,664
So many sticks yeah

676
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Sanctioned

677
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:56,832
I understand it fully but he can't really can't appear to understand it or else the audience will be like

678
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,160
You suck man I know but isn't that weird that we're on like

679
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,256
For five years of this and he still has to pretend like he can't learn

680
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:09,632
Yeah you really

681
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,192
So Alex makes a

682
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,984
Claim

683
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,824
Could get him sued if he talks anymore about this

684
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,944
Donations

685
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
Some of the people

686
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
Personally

687
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,112
When we go to trial

688
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
One way or another

689
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Because

690
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
America

691
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,192
Controller system installed

692
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,288
Oh boy who cares with charitable groups of raised

693
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
Who cares

694
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:54,176
They make money and use it for charitable causes I don't know

695
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Nothing

696
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,832
You notice that I wasn't saying that particular plaintiffs in the case have brought in millions of dollars in Sandy Hook because of

697
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600
He did

698
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:07,488
He would get sued and that's kind of a problem he's trying to give the audience but

699
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
You can't say that

700
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
Because if he did

701
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,840
Hubie defaming them again

702
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:19,008
We saw this play out in the last deposition that Alex was in the one in December that I went to in in Austin

703
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Alex is complaints about a group called Sandy Hook promise

704
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:26,432
And there are some questions that Alex seems to have about their fundraising and their activism

705
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:32,832
I want to believe that all of the Sandy Hook parents are one monolithic group so he's decided that the plaintiffs in the case against him

706
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:38,464
Are interchangeable with Sandy Hook promise which he literally knows to not be true based on

707
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,512
Exchange from that deposition

708
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,048
What is honor

709
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
You know what that is

710
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
I think that's a

711
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Fundraising

712
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
Voldunai ever

713
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Cuz I know you're not gay

714
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
The news articles

715
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Tens of

716
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
$20 raise

717
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
Controversial

718
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
So I have heard

719
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
Like I told you about

720
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
I've heard of him in the honor

721
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Honor Network

722
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
I've heard that

723
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
I've heard the other day

724
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
I don't know

725
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,112
You're asking me

726
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,400
Alex may try to yell and derail the trial with this kind of stuff but it's not going to go anywhere or do anything because it's pointed meaning

727
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,984
You can use this insinuation here on a show to make the audience

728
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
I think that he's going to walk in like

729
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,544
The Conquering Hero

730
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,848
System on trial

731
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
It's all far

732
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,408
Alex knows that he can say

733
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,944
Exactly what he saying

734
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
But if you had one more.

735
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,112
Detail he's going to owe a ton more money and maybe create a whole new suit on the way

736
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:15,232
Also not for nothing but Alex's breathing is super heavy in this clip and it's kind of

737
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,280
Orient it doesn't sound good here

738
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:21,120
I mean at this point I'm waiting for him to walk into the

739
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
The court and just be like

740
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
Tubalcain

741
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,080
James Alex

742
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,872
Send to how I think

743
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:36,480
I think maybe he was talking to Marjorie Taylor Greene she told him about HIPAA

744
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,808
Oh God no cuz Alex husband

745
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,904
My health issues are my issues and their private

746
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,184
Under protected by HIPAA

747
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
And

748
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,304
You saw this judge, Connecticut

749
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:56,704
Yesterday you saw the lawyers he Democrat Party lawyers or Plymouth

750
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
You want him arrested

751
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
If he doesn't show up for some

752
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,856
You need to go home you need to go get these tests I got more test done today more tomorrow

753
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,184
And you stay away from the microphone well here I am

754
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,280
I should be on here because I have to respond to the

755
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,072
Hundreds of news articles

756
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,888
Associated Press

757
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
That are attacking

758
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,728
Williams

759
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,848
Don't know if anyone cares to cover whether or not you're a bad person

760
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,664
Taken as read

761
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,016
Texas Health privacy with HIPAA

762
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:46,368
Then he goes on to just immediately talk about his health situation

763
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,672
Just released my medical records make you all look like fools

764
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,000
Whatever

765
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,864
After I got covid last year

766
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
And I took care of them

767
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
Protein

768
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,104
And like everybody else get attacked the cardiovascular system

769
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
And so

770
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
Again

771
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,272
Somebody on death row is allowed to go get your medical

772
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
Carrington things are post

773
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
Somebody

774
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:20,928
On death row

775
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
Where

776
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:28,352
If you can believe anything Alex says then there's a decent chance he might be suffering from long-term complications from

777
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,632
The times he got covid

778
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,704
You may have also gotten it like again

779
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,752
Animal that exacerbate

780
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,080
Situation totally just based on what he saying this makes total sense

781
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:44,736
He's someone who's been super unsafe with his behavior he's gotten covid multiple times and as we've learned their many poorly under

782
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
Bestowed phenomena but with this

783
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
Virus Ware

784
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
Lingering effect

785
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
That's

786
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
Not too uncommon

787
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,928
I wouldn't honestly be too surprised if Alex has heart damage

788
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
That's that was caused

789
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,744
By one of the times he got covid-19

790
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,072
That being said he's also a super unhealthy person who's at

791
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,400
High risk of heart disease even without covid-19 want to jump to too many

792
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
Conclusion

793
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,824
The part that makes covid as an idea fit kind of neatly is Alex's claimed that he was getting sicker since he got covid that's

794
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,104
Second time

795
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
Maybe true and vessel symptoms

796
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,200
Maybe the way that is mine.

797
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
Experience things

798
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,296
Yeah it's not actually an accurate reflection of the progression

799
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Symptoms

800
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,880
He's out and

801
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,928
I actually don't think it's going to be that into

802
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,048
But I'll be keeping an eye on the situation and see if Alex

803
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
Just stopped

804
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,608
Talking about this

805
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,424
It's not a convenient excuse for him the reason

806
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,216
People bring up hippos almost

807
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:42,592
Exclusively when they have covid-19 don't want to tell you they have coded because what whatever

808
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:47,712
Well yeah I mean well yes reason I can't ever plenty of other reasons which becomes up in

809
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:54,112
Appropriate setting when I was in hearing aid I worked with him all the time

810
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
What about hippos

811
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,952
Class on it the whole thing none of it was like hey

812
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000
Don't tell nobody you got hearing aids

813
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:06,144
I recall it being relevant it was a temp for a short. Of time

814
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
Heyday a health and

815
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
That's company

816
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,984
I dealt with like

817
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,056
Underwriting

818
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
Things that I had

819
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
Understand about

820
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,616
Privacy

821
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:20,224
I mean one of the simplest is if somebody's like hey can I have my medical records you have to be like

822
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
Who are you

823
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
Can I see

824
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
So

825
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,880
Kind of bummed out

826
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,904
Actually that he doesn't

827
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
Get to go to the dentist

828
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,512
So much

829
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,328
To be talkin about here

830
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,472
Chris Madden

831
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:47,104
Crazy if you go to your own 1012

832
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
You can't do it

833
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,432
So I got some more tests coming up

834
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,784
Today and tomorrow I'm going to get those knocked out and I should be fine

835
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,904
Medication or whatever in this world I know

836
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
I've never really

837
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,768
Maidan-e-jung

838
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:11,936
Wait is it the stress of the world or is it long covid or do you have a heart

839
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
8 p.m.

840
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Anything he's

841
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,056
He's having trouble breathing Dan why don't you care about a man in struggle

842
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,848
I like the idea that

843
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:24,224
I was going to get in there and chill outside Chris Matic

844
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,784
Tried to put a million-dollar bounty on him

845
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
Some kind of yeladim

846
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,440
When was the last time a Texan put a million-dollar bounty on somebody and it didn't

847
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512
So

848
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,840
Alex's got a message for the leftist

849
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Sorry

850
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,984
Sorry leftist and it's really nice of him to apologize

851
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
And yeah sorry leftist

861
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,951

863
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,535
I'm just amazed

864
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
You just can't

865
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
Can't Stop

866
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
But you guys the ones that bread this up

867
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,703

You trying to say that I have not

870
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
You say that I have

871
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,647
You're hiding all this crap

872
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,183
Everybody knows Alex Jones doesn't

873
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:39,999
The situation

874
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,327
Record this

875
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,143

That's that's

877
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:54,335
Hitler in the underground bunker being like I've never hidden from a fight in my life I'm on the front line

Conflicted

882
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,527
I can't really tell if I think of that cough

883
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,575
Is real or is it like me

884
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,415
Trying to convince my parents I'm sick I'm right there with you

885
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
Problem with

886
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:14,815
Like trying to assess the information that's being put out by a liar like you really really don't know

887
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,119
Like if taken seriously

888
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,655
I think it's f***** up

889
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,471
That he's breathing so heavily and coughing

890
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751
Throughout this

891
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:29,919

892
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:34,527
Play them in my head like a like I'm in a 7 you know like just like

893
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,343
Is this a signal is there a site

894
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,927
Frequency variation that'll prove he's lying when you know like

895
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
I don't know

Good these people

912
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
I have rights

913
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
What

914
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
My medical

915
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,599
And I'm sorry you don't like it at all the world or taken to serve it as a Christian Healthcare away

916
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
Credit score

917
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,183
People are dangerous

918
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,487
Authoritarians and they know it and they're going

919
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,815
Owen Shroyer and alive

920
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
Infowars

921
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:59,007
I am fascinated by Amy first of obviously plug

922
00:44:59,263 --> 00:44:59,775
Obviously

923
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
Going to be in there

924
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,639
I'm fascinated by this consistent behavior and like

925
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,199
Is there something about his audience

926
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,991
That like really response

927
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
Dude like

928
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,319
Petulant baby outbursts

929
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
Lake II

930
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,879
I can't imagine

931
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
Hearing somebody act like that being like

932
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,255
F*** yeah that's what that's what that is a guy who is

933
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,071
Fight somebody who's really

934
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,863
Doing the work on the front line

935
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,679
13 year old

936
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,239
That is a thirteen-year-old in

937
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
Succinate

938
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,079
It's great it was like I'm just a little bit too tall

939
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
It's f****** awful

940
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,431
Call to listen to this whining

941
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
Wayne here

942
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
It's it's

943
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,271
It comes off like

944
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:48,927
They didn't let me on the football team cuz they don't like me or not too good

945
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
Videos on the baseball team

946
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,791
And yeah that short stopping it's whatever

947
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,327
Other than him

948
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,167
Now we jump to the

949
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,983
Land that is Tuesday

950
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,031
Decided to come to his show as opposed to

951
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,335
Who sang home under doctor's orders

952
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,407
I think it might be a critical mistake I mean like

953
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:14,015
Do regardless of what happens on the show there is still the

954
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,319
The image of him coming to do the show

955
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,599
Undercuts

956
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,367
His argument

957
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,647
So entirely brakes

958
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,767
I'm done it if I were him 3-hour deposition

959
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,327
3 hours

960
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,375
Completely different

961
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:36,287
It's Tuesday March 22nd 2022

962
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:42,687
2220 2282 the old boys

963
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
Bones

964
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
What

965
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,271
Bohemian Grove

966
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
Titanic

967
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
Why

968
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:53,695
Hell-bent on establishing a new world order

969
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,743
Destroying the Christian

970
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,863
Absolute scientific

971
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Dictatorship

972
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:04,959
Now

973
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,263
A politician and leader

974
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,543
Going

975
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,663
Talked of a new world order

976
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:20,319
Who is Alex trying to suggest that there's some kind of a mystical magical spell that Biden was casting by using the words New World Order

977
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,111
Holiest of days of the globalist

978
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,391
322

979
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,951
Promise of the B inside them the day before I'm through

980
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
321

981
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,535
Whining about it

982
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
Bryant no

983
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:35,679
322 Zone the Skull and Bones logo

984
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,495
Different theories about exactly what the

985
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,031
Significance of that number is but

986
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,823
I don't know I don't

987
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
Like it matters

988
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:43,871
No

989
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,943
I could not be less interested

990
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,479
And it him

991
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:54,879
I also many a politician over the years has said New World Order

992
00:47:55,903 --> 00:48:02,047
At no point in time just like many of politicians having called for the New World Order and you claiming that every

993
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
They do so

994
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,143
They are creating that new world order that you sow fear and then

995
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,935
Still having not done so

996
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,215
Yeah it it does

997
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,751
It does seem to keep happening

998
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,823
0 * 1

999
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
Situations are changing in the world

1000
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:19,711
You know it here's what I would like in that too if I said many a Time the pass

1001
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,271
Pastor of a church has said that the end times are upon us

1002
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,319
The Following part would be

1003
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,367
And they still aren't because they're

1004
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,695
Right Center that would be the same response

1005
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,999
Define response

1006
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,791
What's a respond to this

1007
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,375
Something about the lineage of the term New World Order

1008
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,239
Be close to race

1009
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,287
Mafia

1010
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,591
A politician in l

1011
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
Going

1012
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:53,247
Has talked of a new world order

1013
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,807
Ewell's

1014
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,855
More than 100 years ago

1015
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,207
New World Order

1016
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,631
Nuremberg trials

1017
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:14,239
That the head of German propaganda

1018
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,775
Joseph Gribble

1019
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,055
Wanted

1020
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Kill

1021
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,151
Seawell's because of his book

1022
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,455
The New World Order

1023
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:28,319
Wait is that good or bad

1024
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,623
Then what the Nazis wanted

1025
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,999
G Wells the non-fiction also fiction writer

1026
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,631
The anglo-american

1027
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,167
Bad word

1028
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,727
Combine

1029
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,311
New World Order

1030
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,639
Adult Kayla was Hitler you may have heard of him

1031
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,455
Outdoor route to kill

1032
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:02,623
Well this is history so when you hear about the New World Order

1033
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,415
Popular's up a little bit

1034
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,951
Open your eyes up

1035
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Focus

1036
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:13,887
I think the extent of Alex's actual knowledge about WWII is that Hitler's middle name as a Lewis

1037
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:21,311
Says it all the time really aware of it was Hitler more than he says Barack Hussein Obama

1038
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,383
Yeah that's because it's Mainline news

1039
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
I

1040
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:29,247
I'm I'm flabbergasted

1041
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,039
You just give them their full

1042
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:37,695
A couple of important things

1043
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,511
It came out in the Nuremberg trials and expect that to stand is

1044
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
Compelling

1045
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:48,191
Imitation is actually I made that argument at the Nuremberg trials where it came out

1046
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:54,591
Francis Boyle was the lead prosecutor

1047
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,991
Material involved in the Nuremberg trials is so dense and copious that

1048
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,783
Look up a person's entire career

1049
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:09,439
If you want to fight something in that you really need to be more specific because to not do so put your audience of the terrible terrible position of

1050
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,975
Either taking your word for it

1051
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,511
I guess scouring thousands

1052
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,815
Thousands of pages of documentation to sieve

1053
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,095
What you're saying shows up

1054
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:16,863
Anywhere

1055
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
Another important

1056
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,167
Thing to keep in mind is that Joe's

1057
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,983
Gerbils was not tried at any Nuremberg trials

1058
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,287
Because he had already killed himself prior to the end of the war

1059
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:28,127
Do you want School through the Avalon project hosts

1060
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:32,479
Transcripts of the entire proceedings of the Nuremberg trials

1061
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,831
It is recorded that Wells Books were included in the book

1062
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,623
Books that were burned beginning in 1930

1063
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,951
33 but it's really unfair to pretend that Wells was the main target

1064
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,743
Like Magnus hirschfeld

1065
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,535
226 research was Daphne

1066
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,815
Amelia Central Target

1067
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:51,679
How many tons of authors who the Nazis didn't feel we're German enough for the right kind of German

1068
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,447
Heather work

1069
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,031
Just included people like F Scott Fitzgerald Upton

1070
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,567
Sinclair Franz Kafka

1071
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
Helen Keller

1072
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:04,735
Like it's a lot of people so much the authors as it was just like general knowledge itself

1073
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:09,087
Thunder under attack I think that the awareness that h.g. Wells

1074
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,623
Included in that book burning list

1075
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,439
Maybe with Alex's

1076
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:17,791
Maybe he's just combining that HG Wells had a book named New World Order and

1077
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,327
Nuremberg trials a great place

1078
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,887
To put it in makes up whatever you want

1079
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,191
So how to make fake points when he's trying to sell

1080
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,519
Some sort of a narrative whatever that days narrative is

1081
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:31,103
His Alex's movie endgame begins with a missed quotation

1082
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:36,479
Confirm h.g. Wells new world order it has never read that book

1083
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:40,319
Zero he almost certainly just saw that faulty quotation in a John Birch

1084
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,623
Society pamphlet his dad gave him

1085
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
Just been his

1086
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
Reality sets

1087
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:50,047
An important point to bring up here is they in some ways you could really see what Alex is doing here is being

1088
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:50,815
Pro-nazi

1089
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:57,727
I know that you wouldn't accept that characterization but it really feels like he's applying his own worldview and motives to grbl

1090
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,495
He ran away

1091
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:01,311
It's really only meant to get the audience to think that

1092
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:04,383
Maybe the Nazis were doing all that bad of stuff

1093
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:10,783
I wish we were fighting Alex's new I've been trying to parse exactly what it was he was saying and that's where I'm

1094
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,879
I'm getting stuck cuz it does sound I'm not sure if that's the only reading

1095
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,439
It is it sure is

1096
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:21,023
Alex constantly talks about the global list of the New World Order is

1097
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,583
Being working for the literal Christian devil

1098
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:30,239
Kind of paint the Nazis is not as bad as they seem if they too are fighting against me literal Christian

1099
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,007
Well

1100
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,543
I mean what he said was

1101
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,103
The HG Wells had a book named New World Order

1102
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Gerbils

1103
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,407
Wanted to kill him

1104
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,967
Because the Nazis had their own New World Order

1105
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,015
And we are told pretty

1106
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:46,111
Clearly that HG Wells is New World Order is the devil one

1107
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,135
So

1108
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,463
Unless the devil is like farming out like all kinds of Art

1109
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:56,351
You know it's this is like the everybody was playing in the minor leagues you know there were a bunch

1110
00:53:56,607 --> 00:54:00,191
Smaller town Devil's a barnstorming Devils who would come in

1111
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,751
They have their own kind of thing going on for a while

1112
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:10,175
Yeah I find this absurd but I can't say with any certainty

1113
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,479
How much of this is intentional but if Alex

1114
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,527
Isn't trying to be a Nazi apologist

1115
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:18,623
He needs to be way more careful about how we talked about issues related to World War

1116
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,439
The first step would be to stop making stuff up about it

1117
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
And then after that

1118
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,743
Stop saying things that

1119
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
The clearly indicated

1120
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,071
Personally identify with a Nazi leadership

1121
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
These would be

1122
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,143
Be admirable goals

1123
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:35,007
I-22 trying not to bring into the proceedings

1124
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,543
Politicians in Riders of

1125
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:41,663
Said the world words New World Order over the years and the one I agree with it

1126
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,431
Is grbl

1127
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:47,039
That's probably not the way you want to go right yeah probably not

1128
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,879
Alex might sympathize

1129
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,207
Alex

1130
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,023
Alex gets into talking talking about New World Order

1131
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:57,791
Stuff

1132
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,815
Turkey has been

1133
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,655
Of course he actually kind of lets slip a little bit too

1134
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Clearly

1135
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,703
Knows what people mean

1136
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:10,335
Politicians will say oh well I'm shuffling

1137
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,383
The power structure and Concerta

1138
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:13,919
Bouquet

1139
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,967
Compilation

1140
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,343
Prime Ministers and presidents and world leaders

1141
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,415
Findings are New World Order

1142
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,999
World government

1143
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,047
Autocratic

1144
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,839
Authoritarian

1145
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,655
World government in place wobbles come out saying

1146
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,079
Of world government was not just a world government

1147
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,663
It's a worldwide authoritarian government

1148
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:51,039
Abortion infanticide

1149
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:55,135
You alone nothing you will have nothing and you will be happy or you'll go to a camp

1150
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:58,463
Keep in mind this characterization that Alex is making

1151
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,743
Because he saying

1152
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,767
This compilation

1153
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:06,143
He's going to play it later

1154
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,679
The pretty big compilation

1155
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,775
Spoiler alert

1156
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:16,895
Has the model of the new world order that he wants to create

1157
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,175
Important

1158
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:24,063
Alex says I have the video in the same way that he says it's in the it's not

1159
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:30,463
He's got the video for his audience to be like it

1160
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,487
Never heard that one

1161
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:36,863
I also want to touch on the meme that Alex dropped at the end there the you will have nothing and you'll be happy

1162
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:44,287
This is something that's really caught on among s******* Skeptics who don't actually want to put any work in but want to present themselves as competent

1163
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,567
News and apologize

1164
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,639
Rogan Russell Brand

1165
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:55,807
Multiple videos where this Logan is used it in that nightmarish way to characterize the great reset

1166
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:59,647
That conspiracy that he's hard at work making his millions of fans scared about

1167
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,719
Never said you will own nothing and you'll be here

1168
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
That's not

1169
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,327
It's a paraphrasing if something was written by Danish and

1170
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,887
In 220

1171
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:17,311
Ida was envisioning what life might be like in 2030 and part of that Vision was that things that have been historically been

1172
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,335
Zenith products

1173
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,359
We're now service

1174
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:24,479
This actually is a little bit far-fetched but the essential premises that Innovation and technological

1175
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,015
Advancement will have made

1176
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,039
I think so available at

1177
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:27,807
What abundant

1178
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:31,391
But there's no real reason to own anything anymore since everything will be free

1179
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,183
From SA

1180
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,231
First Communication became digitizer

1181
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,255
Free to everyone

1182
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:40,095
Then when clean-energy became free things started to move quick

1183
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,143
Transportation dropped

1184
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,679
Dramatically in price

1185
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:50,079
It made no sense for us to own cars anymore because we could call a driverless vehicle or flying car for longer Journeys

1186
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,847
Within minutes

1187
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:57,247
They're also aspect of this Vision that are kind of dumb and as much as they seem incredibly inefficient

1188
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,015
For instance

1189
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,039
This part

1190
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,343
Once in awhile I'll choose to cook for myself

1191
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:05,183
It's easy the necessary kitchen equipment is delivered at my door within minutes

1192
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,743
Let's transport became free we've stopped

1193
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:10,047
Having all those things stuffed in our home

1194
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,375
Why keep a pasta maker or crepe cooker crammed in our cupboard

1195
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,167
We can just order them when we need them

1196
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,263
That seems like a step backwards

1197
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,543
Listen imagination

1198
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,847
Sure

1199
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:28,479
Conclusion is that this new technologically-advanced city provides literally everything a person

1200
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,551
Also afford to know actual privacy

1201
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,599
And quote all in all it's a good

1202
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,391
There's no specific

1203
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:41,791
Plan laid out here it's more or less a creative writing exercise or someone came up with some ideas of what life might look like in the

1204
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
The future

1205
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:48,191
An excerpt from this essay was included in the world economic forum's video blog post

1206
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
Quotes

1207
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,007
Predictions for the world in 2030

1208
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:56,127
Paraphrasing of the ideas that idle wrote out is included and summarized as quote

1209
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,151
You alone nothing

1210
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:57,919
And you will be happy

1211
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,247
This is not a description of some nefarious plan

1212
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,551
The stated goal the class swab is working towards

1213
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,111
The clunky brief synopsis of this

1214
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,135
Person's essay

1215
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,719
But that's not how it's reported by people like Alex or Rogan a Russell

1216
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,999
Willebrand

1217
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,023
It's basically a

1218
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,095
Rat like a parent saying you'll eat your peas and you'll be happy

1219
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,143
Do you know what's really funny

1220
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,935
What's up

1221
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,471
I remember

1222
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,263
Specific person

1223
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,287
Sang like

1224
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,079
Get rid of all your stuff

1225
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,871
You'll have nothing

1226
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,663
And you'll be happy about it

1227
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,455
Visit the devil

1228
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:37,343
No no it wasn't a death

1229
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,415
OK Google was a guy in the guy was like

1230
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,695
I've got all this s***

1231
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,231
What do I do

1232
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:48,351
And this guy was like I'll just get rid of it you don't need s*** because guess what it's not

1233
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,631
Making you happy

1234
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,215
Involve like a parable about a

1235
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:59,615
Camel no no no way absolutely not come on now

1236
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:05,503
People a f***************

1237
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,319
In some way I feel like that's the only way they can

1238
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,599
Experience the world

1239
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,647
Then it kind of goes back to Alex's like

1240
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,719
His whiny petulant non-central

1241
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,023
Response to not getting his way about the legal

1242
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,607
I mean it's not the first time that Daddy Issues will have a

1243
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,655
Outsized effect on the world

1244
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,727
Yeah I understand that

1245
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,031
I do

1246
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:31,103
Feel like there's a there's a certain aspect to it

1247
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,175
I realized this kind of

1248
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,455
Psychological

1249
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,503
Phenomenal

1250
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,575
Just didn't realize it was this profitable

1251
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:45,951
In terms of building an audience always thought that acting like this was a bad move

1252
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,999
Yeah I kind of thought it was embarrassing

1253
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,071
I don't have daddy issues

1254
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,631
Sure

1255
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:03,615
That's why we find out that Alex was a little bit late

1256
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,919
Finding out about Biden's comments

1257
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,783
And I was going to bed early

1258
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,575
Blowing up

1259
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,111
Well-known talk show host

1260
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,391
Calling me

1261
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,719
Did you see Biden did you see by Juicy B

1262
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,999
Call for a new world order

1263
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,399
Play Store

1264
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,959
Extra details

1265
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,239
It was

1266
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,311
Who's to be a symptom of Alex's covid-19 exhaustion

1267
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:36,895
Terrible stories but going to bed so early

1268
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,431
And this is me grasp

1269
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:42,271
Straws to build up

1270
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:47,135
It's honestly bizarre for Alex has anybody heard about this clip at 9 p.m. because it's antex

1271
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,439
He's clearly trying to apply

1272
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,231
The most important person in the world

1273
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:56,863
Speed bike games

1274
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,911
Conspiracy information spaces immediately

1275
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
I texted you at like

1276
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,495
7

1277
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,567
It's over two hours behind it like we're the tip of the spear

1278
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,639
I said no idea

1279
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,431
Pathetic

1280
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,711
So

1281
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
Pathetic

1282
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,319
Is this the way the media treats

1283
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,623
Oh I mean they're just so unfair

1284
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,671
They just it's like

1285
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,463
Oh you can't run

1286
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,047
Hundreds of millions of lives without somebody being like all me

1287
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,095
Hi Prosecco

1288
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,119
Here's the deal

1289
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:34,239
New World Order

1290
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,775
But then

1291
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,823
Biden says New World Order

1292
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,871
Nor

1293
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,711
X Washington Post

1294
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,855
I talked about a new world order

1295
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,927
Going bad and it doesn't exist

1296
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,815
America has a free speech problem

1297
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,375
New York Times on Friday

1298
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,935
Because they don't want us discussing

1299
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,263
The future of the world

1300
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,799
Levi's decide

1301
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,335
Humans

1302
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,455
That was real bad normal

1303
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:18,015
Worse than his badge

1304
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,807
Is very little rain

1305
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,111
More importantly though people criticize Alex

1306
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:25,951
Because you make s*** up and then he uses the idea of a new world order to push in

1307
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,743
Hateful political position

1308
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:28,767
To deny Act

1309
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,047
The right-wing terrorism

1310
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,839
In general

1311
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,655
Target marginalized and vulnerable population

1312
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:38,751
He's a meaningful distinction but I don't expect Alex ever recognize a pub

1313
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
Look like

1314
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:43,871
New York Times article Alex is talking about actually says the opposite of what he

1315
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,895
He's claiming it does

1316
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:51,807
The way he's talking about it reveals that he is literally just read the headline and assume that it must be about how freeze peaches

1317
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,343
The problem because it allows Alec

1318
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:59,231
He couldn't even read the first two paragraphs about realizing that this

1319
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,767
Article saying the opposite

1320
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:07,423
Quote for all the tolerance and Enlightenment that modern society claims Americans are losing hold of a fundamental right of citizens

1321
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,191
Of a free country

1322
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:13,055
The right to speak their minds and voice their opinions in public without fear of being shamed or shunned

1323
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:16,895
This social silencing the D pluralization of America

1324
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,175
Has been evident for years

1325
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,991
But dealing with it stirs yet even more fear

1326
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,527
It feels like a third rail

1327
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,295
Dangerous

1328
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,623
A strong nation and open society that is danger

1329
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,671
The irony of him

1330
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:31,743
Criticizing that specific editorial

1331
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:34,559
Is everybody at the New York Times

1332
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:36,351
Who is Alex Jones

1333
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,887
Wrote that editorial

1334
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:41,727
Yeah there's

1335
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:47,359
Shameful food is disgusting

1336
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:50,431
He could have written that all

1337
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,735
Decrying the scourge of cancel culture

1338
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:56,063
Because he's too lazy to read past the headline he's using it as a prop

1339
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:56,831
To build up a case

1340
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,855
What is under attack

1341
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,647
Pathetic stuff

1342
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,207
I don't know like it

1343
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:08,351
It's at times like this one like there's a lot going on in Alex's World lots of moving parts

1344
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:14,751
Lots of lots of things going around two stories

1345
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:20,127
Read this article you're complaining about

1346
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:26,527
Huge win for out Scooby like even the New York Times understands that people like Alex Jones should be listen to

1347
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,927
I bet that will be eventually

1348
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:37,279
Yeah I'm really really mad at that one understand I wanted to say mean things

1349
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,071
Guess

1350
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,095
Coming up

1351
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,375
Resume the show

1352
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
I think

1353
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,167
In terms of

1354
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:46,751
The sort of person you would want to come speak on the sort of topic

1355
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,079
We also have

1356
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:50,847
Economist

1357
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,615
Researcher

1358
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,431
Exposing

1359
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,967
Depopulation agenda

1360
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
The stock picker

1361
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:05,183
Released by the government UK

1362
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,487
Hospitals bribed

1363
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
AHS

1364
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,959
That meet Targets on Liverpool

1365
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,007
Care pathway

1366
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,311
Massive amounts of a

1367
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,223
Forgiven hundreds of thousands of old people they killed

1368
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,783
If you give somebody a shot of it that has pneumonia

1369
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,551
They always

1370
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,343
What

1371
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,183
A few hours what f****** magic is that

1372
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,463
It's for the Earth

1373
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:42,303
Kill your dog got to kill your cat has your son

1374
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,607
Got to kill the old people

1375
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,399
There's not enough resources

1376
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,703
You will owe nothing you will have nothing

1377
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:58,431
The Daily Mail

1378
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,223
It's not an article about covid-19

1379
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247
Concurrent Lucky's

1380
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,015
Reporting a

1381
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,855
2012 article is more complicated than what Alex

1382
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,623
Presenter

1383
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:10,975
Target's of between 130

1384
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:16,095
Two-thirds of the deaths that occur in the hospital being on what's known as the Liverpool care pathway

1385
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,655
LCP of the protocol that

1386
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:22,239
Is used for patients who are end-of-life and determined to be terminal cases

1387
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,543
And it's essentially away the doctors attempt

1388
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,591
Provide hospice type care in Ahoskie

1389
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
Little setting

1390
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:34,015
Once a patient was deemed to be terminal in there was no longer any treatment options they would receive palliative care to relieve pain

1391
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,807
But typically that page

1392
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,831
Kenwood end up dying

1393
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,135
It wasn't so much at the hospital

1394
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:43,487
Killing these patients as much as it was a case where end-of-life care was being done in a manner that

1395
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,279
Detached and bureaucratic

1396
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:50,399
The fact there was a target range of deaths that should involve the LCP and the fact that

1397
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,167
Its funding was

1398
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,959
Attached to being in line with these targets

1399
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:57,567
It really gave the air of impropriety even though no wrongdoing was necessarily

1400
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,847
Being done right it's

1401
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,895
Just people so divorced from the Omni

1402
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,687
The ground reality of it they're just like

1403
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,503
Looking at number now they don't feel yet

1404
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:08,319
Review found that when implemented well the Elsa

1405
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:11,647
BP is a good way to handle end-of-life Care at a hospital setting

1406
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:18,303
And in fact it appeared that the existence of the pathway made it much more clear to families of patients that their loved one was at the end of

1407
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,583
Their life

1408
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,863
Accordingly

1409
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,143
That's it

1410
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:27,007
When it was a diplomatic while it was a sloppy process they could lead to some amount of negligence

1411
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,823
And there were aspects of the pathway that worked

1412
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,103
Too difficult to formalize

1413
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:31,871
Right

1414
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:35,199
For instance diagnosing when someone is at the end of life is

1415
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,223
Imprecise thing

1416
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,783
Soca defined rules of

1417
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,575
I'll be difficult to do Broadway

1418
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:41,855
And such

1419
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,159
The panel that reviewed the LCP advised

1420
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
Phasing it out

1421
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,207
What's the NHS did

1422
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:46,975
In 2013

1423
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,767
Well they got them

1424
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,071
We got them guys we did it

1425
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:57,471
Alex is covering in sensationalizing a decade-old story which is just tip of the spear stuff

1426
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
Nonsense

1427
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:05,407
For the rest of that stuff is just bulshit ranging from transphobia to Alex mischaracterizing

1428
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,175
Pat is bad for the

1429
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,223
The environment mostly because the Dynamics

1430
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:14,111
Involved in pet food production drumbeat of the you own nothing and you'll be happy

1431
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,647
He said that a bunch of the

1432
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:18,463
The past but not as regularly as he is now

1433
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:23,583
And I suspect that he seen the success that folks like Russell Brand have had with using that is a mantra

1434
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,375
And Alex wants to signal to those audio

1435
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,399
Fences in Tryon

1436
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,959
Right right right right right

1437
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:32,287
See you again this is also like

1438
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:33,823
What is it

1439
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,591
Buddhism

1440
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:39,711
Like there's a whole organized school of thought around how having stuff is a bad move

1441
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:44,575
Wait is it Russell Brand of Buddhist I think he is

1442
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,879
F****** idiots

1443
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:54,559
Anybody catch yourself from the idea of not having things

1444
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,327
Alright

1445
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,887
Attach yourself

1446
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,423
Tuan attachable

1447
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,239
That you can attach yourself to

1448
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,007
Yeah

1449
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,543
I've been I've been

1450
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,615
Starting to think that maybe Russell Brand Deuce is

1451
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,407
Somebody who deserves a little bit of

1452
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:14,527
Don't be too surprised if we do some episodes about him in the future

1453
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,063
Wasn't seeing

1454
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:22,463
The guy from one Guy Ritchie movie with

1455
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,487
Like

1456
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,791
He probably has a larger audience

1457
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
But Alex at the

1458
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
This point

1459
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
And

1460
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,399
He's still on mainstream platforms

1461
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,423
Hugh

1462
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,215
Doing some straight-up Alex

1463
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,239
Exact same size

1464
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,007
Not exactly

1465
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,895
It is important and I will get into that little later day

1466
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:41,919
But like

1467
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,967
I was taking a shower yesterday

1468
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,991
I was thinking about is like

1469
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,295
He's probably radicalizing a lot of people

1470
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,087
And I wonder

1471
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,879
I know it could lead to trouble in like

1472
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:53,183
There's another January 6th minutes

1473
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:56,511
Because Forgetting Sarah Marshall came out

1474
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:02,399
Get me to the Greek or whatever getting launched his career

1475
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,679
When you really

1476
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,703
Think about it

1477
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,031
We are dealing with a triumvirate

1478
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:10,079
Of Alex Jones

1479
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:13,151
Jailbroken and Russell Brand

1480
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:19,551
Three purveyors Tucker well of course but I mean like this

1481
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:26,975
Bush-league b******* is not good we appeal to sort of different sectors

1482
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:32,095
Right-wing types

1483
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:42,335
Go to Joe Rogan Stone could go either way with Roadrunner Branch or not

1484
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,639
That is the difference

1485
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:46,687
Oh my God they're all like a

1486
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,479
F****** 20

1487
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:54,879
Rebuild a character in a f****** RPG where you just adjust the stats a little bit and you come out with these two

1488
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,183
Goddamn

1489
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:01,023
All I'm saying is brandx wasn't really like enough to Merit

1490
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:01,791
Occult

1491
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:11,263
Stuff in the UK before like obviously was already

1492
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,287
Nope not here

1493
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,823
He got back here

1494
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,359
BoBoiBoy

1495
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,407
Anyway I'm thinking about him

1496
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:20,223
Photo of the New World Order

1497
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:24,063
We know that the Nazis were trying to make one

1498
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:27,647
So we know that there are multiple New World Order New World Order

1499
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,695
New World Order

1500
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,975
New world

1501
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,743
Yeah

1502
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,511
So

1503
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:37,119
Alex gets into how there's a bunch of new world orders right now

1504
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,727
What does that even mean

1505
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,799
You're going to find out God

1506
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:49,663
Announces the New World Order

1507
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,687
Sure was one

1508
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,295
You like that one

1509
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,063
And you got

1510
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,255
Brewskis

1511
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:12,447
The real plans requires to unify the world and not kill each other

1512
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,031
What main line

1513
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,335
Psychologist

1514
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,383
Psychology

1515
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,151
Save the Earth

1516
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,687
Really really

1517
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,479
That

1518
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,039
Weitzman carryout

1519
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,831
Wow

1520
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,903
Decided to kill most people

1521
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,207
Humans become a new species

1522
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,023
Jobs on their own

1523
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,815
China Centric race-based

1524
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,119
Fascism

1525
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,935
I just want to be left alone

1526
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
Really

1527
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,287
They want to be left alone

1528
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,383
I think I might still be high from that Cali weed

1529
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,175
Wow

1530
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,991
F****** insane Meandering childish bigger

1531
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783
It's shocking

1532
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,367
An oppressive and it's crazy how all news World Order

1533
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:06,975
Don't include South America or Africa whatsoever

1534
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,999
So here are the teams

1535
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:15,423
You might start to notice that some of these groups are characterized as good or bad

1536
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:20,031
On the bad side you got China

1537
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
Two completely different

1538
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,567
Confirm what he wants

1539
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:27,455
Then you have the anglo-american establishment would just go to the globalist and we know that they work for the literal devil

1540
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:34,111
There's a slime which apparently will lead to the destruction of the world and then there's transhumanism

1541
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,135
Creative

1542
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:35,903
Sure

1543
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:42,303
Just right off the top you can tell this was an improvised list that I was ripping because

1544
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,583
He's a facet

1545
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,119
Of the globalist plant

1546
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,935
According to everything Alex has ever said about this topic

1547
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:48,703
Globalist

1548
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:52,287
Humanism is an essential element of their whole scheme

1549
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:55,103
Where they're trying to birds with machines and become God

1550
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:59,967
He talks about it all the time those are gold strange that he added them in as a distinct

1551
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,735
Group

1552
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:05,855
I think you did that because he realized how clearly is Christian identity nationalism was coming through

1553
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:11,231
Christianity good Islam at

1554
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:15,327
You starting to throw that out as a distraction from that

1555
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,863
I mean but even then

1556
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,399
Where we go right back to Chris

1557
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,679
Condemn

1558
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
Left

1559
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,727
We got China

1560
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:28,383
No we got America globalist we got Islam know so whose are bastards baby

1561
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:34,783
Well I doubt it just wants to be left alone another Underworld

1562
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:42,207
Which apparently is the true plan to unite Humanity

1563
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,255
Definitely name if you wanted to

1564
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,303
Really troubling questions

1565
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:52,703
And I guess the first is what is Alex mean by saying Russia wants to be left alone but they also want a new world

1566
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,031
Well the best way to be left alone is to rule every

1567
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,103
How does this work man it's like so far Putin is killing

1568
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,895
Tons of civilians in Ukraine

1569
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,943
Seem like it furthers the goal of being

1570
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,711
Left alone

1571
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,991
No I mean it does

1572
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:05,759
That's the

1573
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,807
Pointed that's the problem with every

1574
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,647
Every single person who's ever thought about the idea of an isolated Nation

1575
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:15,743
In the current Global structure is that if you want to be an isolated Nation

1576
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,279
There can be No Other Nation

1577
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:20,607
So you either have the entire world or everyone else is dead

1578
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,399
That's not a good plan

1579
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:29,055
Tulsa with Alex's suggested with his whole thing about Mass ecologist saying the Christianity is the plan that we

1580
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,615
What are you saying is that he wants to impose Christy

1581
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,895
Theocracy on the world

1582
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,711
From Alex

1583
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:40,831
He says the Christendom is the real plan that will unite the world whether you believe in Christ or not

1584
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,135
He doesn't care if you believe in God or Christ

1585
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,927
You're not so long as he's able to assert

1586
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,951
Power over you because

1587
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:46,975
He does

1588
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,511
So long as you have to submit

1589
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
I can

1590
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,327
Stick your fingers like this

1591
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:54,143
And not just think that Alex is losing even more of his grip

1592
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,703
And he's being a bit too over with his desires

1593
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:00,799
But he wants to SeaWorld characterized by Christian theocracy any Seafood

1594
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:03,103
Is the person who's most likely to Usher that in

1595
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,919
Which probably explains a fair amount of his

1596
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,223
More recent contact

1597
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,759
You're just getting it all wrong

1598
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:13,599
Okay that's why we can't have Islam because they want to impose

1599
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:19,231
A religious theocracy on us even if you don't believe in that particular religion

1600
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:24,863
That's not how Christendom works and it never has not once not one time I

1601
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:28,959
I can point to tons of Mainline historians will tell you that nothing good

1602
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,239
As ever

1603
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:33,311
Not feel like leaving isn't in line with

1604
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,359
Anything that Alex's said

1605
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,127
Is big

1606
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,431
Your stuff and like the major players

1607
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,455
No not really

1608
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,735
Like I guess

1609
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:44,319
His conception is vagina is stopping

1610
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,599
Working with a new world

1611
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,623
Loader or whatever

1612
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,647
Or with the global

1613
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:51,999
But Islam is still there's never been a break

1614
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,047
Yeah it turns out that he still thinks

1615
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,351
Entirety of Islam

1616
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,399
New World Order globalist

1617
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,167
His

1618
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,703
Conception of the world

1619
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,727
Is so small

1620
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,567
The Troopers just so little in his world

1621
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,615
But I think it also is just

1622
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,639
Made up

1623
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,407
True

1624
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,735
And that's why I mean it has to be because it doesn't think

1625
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:17,855
About like the global South at all

1626
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,671
He does only in as much as he liked.

1627
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,719
You'll be a lieutenant

1628
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:27,839
Boutonniere whatever talks a little bit more about this stuff

1629
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,631
Soda

1630
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,423
Defensive about how smart he

1631
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,751
But which is the things Market

1632
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,311
System as well but they're not

1633
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,079
Following

1634
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,871
The neoliberal model of

1635
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,431
Sterilizing

1636
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,967
Boys and girls and

1637
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
Destroying

1638
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:46,783
Acumen

1639
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,063
Civilization

1640
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,623
Thomson the Russians have broken

1641
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,183
System

1642
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,279
Just believe they're going to merge

1643
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,303
Weather technology

1644
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:01,375
What real debate going on

1645
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,655
What's the real today

1646
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,751
Bilderberg Group

1647
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,943
I've had

1648
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,479
Intelligence

1649
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,319
50 million dollars

1650
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,623
Science division

1651
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,903
Heads of harp

1652
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,719
Heads of major programs not trying to brag

1653
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,279
28 years

1654
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:30,559
And

1655
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,351
All day

1656
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,399
To be at the table

1657
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,191
Even though most of globalist don't like

1658
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,751
Wow

1659
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:43,871
Anyone listening to the show actually believes that Alex is having adult conversations with anyone and

1660
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:48,223
And the conversations are about this b*******

1661
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:54,879
I can kind of see how his supplements sell so well

1662
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,647
Wildlife

1663
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:59,487
No I'm allowed to go wherever I'm smart I'm just smarter

1664
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,791
I wasn't talking to anyone who's not insane

1665
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,863
In themselves and you can tell by the gas city has on his show

1666
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,679
They're all lunatics and most of them are lying about their car.

1667
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
Essentials

1668
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:14,336
How is it Steve pieczenik on a show for 20 years and never seriously ask himself if this dude was nuts in a liar

1669
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:19,968
If you're actually like a big serious person you'd never associate with Alex because you can easily see

1670
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,528
The company that he keeps and how he behaves

1671
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,088
He's an untrustworthy idiot who's

1672
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:28,672
Unpredictable and he's surrounded by white supremacists and neo-nazis and

1673
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,952
Parity level conman

1674
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:34,304
I do feel a certain amount of pity for anyone who could hear that and take it seriously because

1675
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,120
This is just Alex's child-brain lashing out again

1676
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:41,728
He knows he doesn't deserve to be taken seriously so he's creating a comical explanation

1677
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:44,288
How seriously is taken by imaginary

1678
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,872
That totally exist and they probably hang out with my psychologist

1679
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,640
Listen

1680
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,408
I know

1681
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,432
You aren't taking

1682
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,784
But these billionaires that you've never heard of

1683
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,832
All of them all support pillow

1684
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,856
Important

1685
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:00,928
Guessing the person who runs harp

1686
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:03,232
Is probably just Nick begich

1687
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,512
Sure

1688
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:10,912
We could probably pick out who all of us people are

1689
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:16,288
Seeing by the audience in a certain way because Alex knows that on the merits

1690
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,360
He doesn't deserve to be treated like that or seen that way

1691
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
At all

1692
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:22,944
But

1693
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,504
Big news what

1694
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,576
Alex could join the new world order if you wanted to not like

1695
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:31,648
You peons and peasants listening

1696
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,440
Do it can't do it man come on to it

1697
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:35,232
I could join the New World Order

1698
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,328
Just f****** do it man

1699
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,144
Myself for a short. Of time

1700
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,216
Someone's coming at an enlightened

1701
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,032
Calling

1702
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,080
Ennis Ennis this operation

1703
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:54,176
You really think you'll be safe driving with this

1704
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,736
A few thousand of you that are actually

1705
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,784
And the Millions

1706
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:02,880
To Valhalla

1707
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
Elysium

1708
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:05,952
No

1709
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:07,744
It's a lie

1710
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:12,864
We are

1711
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,704
There's a short compilation

1712
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,240
Just a few world leaders

1713
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:21,568
Talking about the New World Order and world government and what it means

1714
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,336
Paradise

1715
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,640
You know we are at inflection point

1716
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,944
I believe in dope World economy

1717
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,248
Manchester World economy in the world

1718
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,808
Occurs every three or four generations

1719
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:38,208
As one of my one of the top military people said to me in a secure me the other day

1720
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,536
60 million people died between

1721
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,840
1919 46

1722
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:48,448
And since then we've established a liberal World Order and

1723
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,056
That hasn't happened in a long while lot of people dying but nowhere near than chaos

1724
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,360
And Now's the Time when things are shift

1725
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,920
We're going to be a new world order

1726
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,712
We've got deleted

1727
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,528
We've got to unite the rest of your world and doing it

1728
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:09,184
I wonder if Johnny newworldorder would make it so Alex wouldn't have to come up with embarrassing excuses to not have to go to a deposition in the

1729
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,256
Okay studies already lost about the fame in the families of murdered children

1730
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:16,096
Maybe you should try that cuz I don't know what other option is left

1731
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,120
Please probably run

1732
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:23,776
I think I would love it if all the sudden we came in want to work one day and you're like I've got an episode

1733
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,824
Good for you here's your out-of-context drop

1734
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:30,688
I've joined the New World Order and then we go from there that's beat that's amazing

1735
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,456
Wingstop

1736
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:37,856
Alex just starts wearing black and doing the two sweet all the time

1737
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:39,648
Being like a foe life

1738
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,464
Gets the wrong New World Order

1739
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:47,840
Gangs out with Hulk Hogan what you might do I do what is yeah well you know Evan people who say the n word

1740
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
Stick together

1741
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,192
Recent comment about the New World Order

1742
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:55,264
And I don't think that it sounds evil or nefarious at all

1743
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,312
This is that compilation

1744
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:59,616
Alex mentioned earlier

1745
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:03,712
Compilation

1746
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,016
Horror the New World Order

1747
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:09,344
So far it sounds like someone describing others a change in the status quo

1748
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,368
It's happening as it relates

1749
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,160
It's the international power balances

1750
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,952
I'm going to go through each of these

1751
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,000
These clips one-by-one in the compilation

1752
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:20,096
The reason I'm doing this is because I need to drive home the point that the entire notion

1753
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,888
What is New World Order stuff being

1754
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,424
Some kind of an actual evil

1755
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,448
Conspiracy plot

1756
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:27,264
Even based on anything other than manipulative opt

1757
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:30,336
That an historical anti-Semitism going back to

1758
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,408
A lot of manipulative Optics

1759
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,968
So here's the next

1760
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:38,016
Again this time

1761
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,040
Team speech you gave up

1762
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:41,600
The annual conference of the export-import bank

1763
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:44,672
The affirmative task we have now

1764
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:47,488
Is is 2 actually

1765
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,280
Create

1766
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,328
A new world order

1767
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,096
Wow

1768
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,376
Adam B

1769
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:56,960
Interesting that I would choose that clip because if you actually listen to buy

1770
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,728
Cancel speech

1771
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,776
The only time he says New World Order

1772
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,592
Like for instance is just from a little bit earlier in the speech

1773
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,408
I understand better than almost anyone

1774
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,432
You understand

1775
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,992
Anyone this year

1776
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:09,760
Potential

1777
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,296
This global economy

1778
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,320
You forged United's

1779
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,344
America

1780
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,624
And you are

1781
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,392
What a weirdo

1782
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,464
Understory

1783
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,488
Interpol

1784
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,256
Warriors

1785
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,536
Post-world War

1786
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,816
Where are we faced

1787
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,864
A slightly different set of challenges

1788
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,656
The global economy re-emerge

1789
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,704
Instructions of War we knew that is

1790
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,984
Institutions in rolls

1791
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:33,312
We needed to navigate through this new world order

1792
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
And

1793
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,152
Because our parents and grandparents

1794
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,200
We're wise and because they were

1795
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:39,968
Committed

1796
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,784
We did what we've always done best

1797
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,344
We exercised our Global Leadership

1798
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:52,256
Allison use this clip even though it does involve Biden saying New World Order because to do so would undercut the point that out

1799
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,024
I was trying to make

1800
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:57,888
To be fully honest I'm sure Alex and never listen to this speech and has no idea where the Clippers even

1801
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:01,216
I'm from somewhere just send him a fear-mongering compilation or these

1802
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,752
Pieces to his

1803
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
Employees

1804
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:08,896
Put it together and they decided to include this clip

1805
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,224
He's just ignoring the other one because it doesn't work

1806
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:17,600
If all you have is our contact presentation to Biden saying who need to build a new world order that

1807
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:20,416
Could have come from any. Of time and your brain to match

1808
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:23,744
And that it's related to whatever you want to pretend it's related

1809
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,512
That only work

1810
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,536
Contacts

1811
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:28,096
Conversely if you hear the full speech and you see that

1812
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:31,168
He uses the words newworldorder to refer to the New World Order

1813
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,192
That appeared

1814
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:35,264
In the aftermath of world war and makes it to clear that the

1815
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,592
New World Order isn't a specific compound noun in this speech

1816
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:42,432
Really just referring to the changing set of circumstances on the world stage

1817
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,480
This case in the field of economics

1818
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,504
International trade

1819
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,296
Something speaking to the export-import

1820
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:52,928
The inclusion of this example in the compilation is a strong indication that this isn't making us

1821
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,952
But since your point

1822
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:57,024
It's just an attempt to use the image of people saying New World Order

1823
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,048
To make that into an argument

1824
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:58,816
Give me a quick hits

1825
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:06,240
I mean public what exactly are we going to wind up you know it's not like we're eventually going to have our politicians all go like

1826
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:11,360
So I think now the things are changing we're going to be entering a new

1827
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,664
A novel

1828
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,712
Global strain

1829
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,992
Sure

1830
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,064
Is an oldie but a goodie

1831
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,856
We have before us.

1832
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,136
Opportunity

1833
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,952
For ourselves and for future Generations

1834
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,960
When we are successful

1835
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:43,360
We will be we have a real chance at this new world order and order in which

1836
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,896
United Nations

1837
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:49,504
Can use a peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise in vision

1838
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,040
The un's founders

1839
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,832
We talked about this in depth

1840
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:57,440
Endgame episodes with this is George h.w. Bush announcing the beginning of the first Iraq War

1841
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,256
While announcing the war is no good

1842
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:04,864
Set that said to use the words New World Order in this beach are not in a

1843
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,168
If you read the full speech it's

1844
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:12,032
Very clear that this is a reference to The Changing State of Affairs between the US and the Soviet Union

1845
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,336
In fact the line that's right before this

1846
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,360
In that speech

1847
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,896
Is weirdly always cut out of these

1848
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,176
These clips is quote

1849
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,736
We have in this past year made great progress

1850
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:24,064
Since ending ending the long Arrow conflict in

1851
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,832
Cold War

1852
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:28,672
Long story short this was at the end of the Cold War in 1991

1853
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:31,232
The term New World Order refers

1854
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,560
The old world order was a state of

1855
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:40,192
22 largest super powers in the world to be too occupied with fighting each other to engage at the UN

1856
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:44,032
And their larger peacekeeping mission in the UN would be too busy worrying about

1857
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,080
Have you asked him Sophia Union

1858
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:48,896
You're free to scoff and disagree with the idea that the UN in

1859
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:50,432
In the Gulf War were great

1860
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,200
Escaping

1861
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:51,968
Please do

1862
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:56,320
Bush was not talking about a shadowy cabal and world government

1863
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,136
He's not going to change in status quo between the United

1864
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,416
States and Russia

1865
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,720
Which brought about the New Order of the world

1866
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,280
With all that's going on there

1867
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:07,072
Novel Global structure

1868
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,144
You're not going to like this next one

1869
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:26,272
I'm not going to spend any time to sending him or his legacy but this is a strange clip to use in this compilation

1870
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,856
This is from an interview he did with Charlie Rose in 2007

1871
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,392
And if you just use a 9-second

1872
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,672
Kind of

1873
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,976
Conveys the message Alex is trying to pretend it says

1874
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:37,024
Misrepresenting the larger Cohn

1875
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:40,352
Hey you just hear this clip it sounds like Kissinger saying

1876
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,144
It will have different characteristics

1877
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:42,912
Pics of different parts

1878
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,448
To the world and they

1879
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:48,544
Is implied to be the New World Order understood to be a one world government

1880
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,568
That's not what he saying

1881
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:52,128
Just prior to this clip roses ask

1882
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:55,712
Him about the Iraq War and its pouch

1883
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,760
Understood as revealing the limits of America

1884
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:02,112
Empower and if given the considerations of so many regions in the world

1885
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,672
States in the Middle East the rising power of China

1886
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:07,232
Was there a need for a new world order

1887
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:13,888
Kissinger saying yes that there was a change of Dynamics it was on the horizon but that would play out differently in different parts

1888
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,656
The world

1889
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:18,240
In terms of things Henry Kissinger said this is a fairly benign

1890
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:24,896
Yeah I mean you know I hate Henry Kissinger a lot and now they're doing that for us

1891
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:31,040
Series on Via behind the bastards holyshit I don't even know how much I hated that I'm guessing if you were Alex

1892
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:36,672
Your doctor advised you not to let you know I'm not doing good so I listen to it

1893
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,696
Yeah

1894
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,232
Yeah it's not Republic

1895
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:41,280
Our next flip we get bush

1896
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,048
Again

1897
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,352
Well I mean he's newworldorder class

1898
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:47,936
You know I think I found one person who use the term more than him

1899
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,216
In this compilation

1900
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,752
But you said it'll

1901
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,800
A world in which there is

1902
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,080
The very real press

1903
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,616
Seven New World Order

1904
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:59,968
This is from another speech in 1991 a couple months after the other one

1905
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,504
This speech is mostly about

1906
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,040
Declaring victory in operation

1907
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:07,392
Can Desert Storm it honestly I don't know why Alex didn't use a longer clipper

1908
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,160
From the speech

1909
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:14,048
Or possibly like there's even more menacing instances of Bush saying New World Order in that speech

1910
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,328
It's hard

1911
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:21,216
To listen to an entire speech then listen to this wouldn't be more impactful of Alex use this clipping

1912
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:21,984
Instead

1913
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,520
Even the New World Order

1914
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:24,800
Guaranteeing

1915
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:25,568
Era of

1916
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
These

1917
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,408
But enduring

1918
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,712
Must be armed

1919
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:34,016
Personally I think that sounds more ominous

1920
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:40,416
Like yeah even if you let us have our way there still going to be violence and War

1921
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:46,816
CIA director becoming president saying that nope that's who that

1922
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,352
Reason Alex uses the eclipse

1923
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:54,752
He does is because he's never actually watched or listened to any of the source material is just using clips that other people have posted online and me

1924
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,520
Memes

1925
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,288
And she

1926
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,824
So you're the next one

1927
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,128
A new world is Imagine

1928
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:03,200
It is a new world order

1929
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,480
Which significantly

1930
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,248
Difference

1931
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,552
And radically new challenges

1932
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,160
So this is a little sliver of the speech of that former UK prime minister Gordon Brown gave

1933
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:15,744
In front of the Confederation of British industry,

1934
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:16,768
Spell account

1935
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:21,120
It's unclear what year this is frowned because conspiracy sites online claim that it

1936
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:25,728
It's from 2007 but I found a transcript of the speech of the gave that year at the CBI

1937
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:26,752
And it doesn't match

1938
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,056
Some doubts about that

1939
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:33,920
Actually really frustrating because the backdrop behind Brown is definitely from CBI

1940
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:39,552
But it's also not the backdrop that matches with the conference used in 2007 nor any other years that I

1941
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,576
Can find videos from

1942
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,904
I've been able to find Brown speeches

1943
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:50,304
Other years that he was there and none of them match this other it's a real pickle

1944
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,168
Capodice look through all of the you know what the backdrop looks like

1945
01:32:55,424 --> 01:33:00,544
For each of the years will maybe not every year but relevant

1946
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:06,944
That's the problem dude also look through all of the videos that are posted on C-Span include

1947
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,992
Gordon Brown

1948
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:11,552
In the description

1949
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,320
So this

1950
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:14,624
Does exist this 32 minutes

1951
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:20,000
Clip that this comes from YouTube snippet that was posted in 2007

1952
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:22,048
So I can be fairly certain that it wasn't

1953
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,840
Said after that

1954
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:27,680
So beyond that I don't I don't know what to say fairly certain Bahrain

1955
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,240
SpaceTime manipulation ever know

1956
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,264
Never know

1957
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,616
Let's try the new world order

1958
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:37,664
You forgot who was more than book

1959
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:41,760
If you read any of his speeches he throws that s*** around like it's going out of style

1960
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,320
Here's an excerpt from another one of his speeches

1961
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,600
2070

1962
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,624
You see how the fairy is

1963
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,904
Some scary this stuff is

1964
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,720
Our task is government leaders

1965
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,744
And this

1966
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,816
This is why the theme of the conference is so Timely

1967
01:33:55,328 --> 01:34:00,192
Engage the citizens of our countries in discussing and then implementing with their active imagination

1968
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:05,312
The new policy program that ensures that the benefits of this emerging New World Order can be shared

1969
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,592
Not just buy some

1970
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,360
But by all

1971
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,408
Yeah that's

1972
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,224
Amanda

1973
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,528
That in W1 that's real scary

1974
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,064
You compared to all the rest of these

1975
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,624
Why is Kissinger again

1976
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,464
We got a new contender

1977
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:24,768
Baby development overall

1978
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:31,168
Strategy for romantic Hindi.

1979
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,704
Lunatic

1980
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,240
Dragon

1981
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:39,104
So this one is on a show called squawks on stocks

1982
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,152
Or he's being interviewed on the stock market

1983
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,712
Floor it's like the anniversary of

1984
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:45,760
Vagina

1985
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:47,296
Bank-owned OKC

1986
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:53,696
Yeah

1987
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,720
Insane

1988
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:59,328
The interviewer is discussing the ongoing hostilities between Israel and Palestine

1989
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,352
She asked

1990
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:04,448
If it's all going to stop after Obama get inaugurated for his first term

1991
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:10,592
She is straight up asking if the fighting in Gaza is something that's being orchestrated by Obama for political gain

1992
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:16,480
And this is on CNBC wow obviously f*** Kissinger but this interviewer is not looking at her 8

1993
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,784
Crazy

1994
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,552
What

1995
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:21,344
And the people around like

1996
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:27,744
Okay good somebody reacted it wasn't just like this is a totally door

1997
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,608
Marble question that we could ask her ask another question but there is there is a definite look on

1998
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,632
A couple faces

1999
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:36,704
Subtly likes me real quick

2000
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,544
Amazing record by the way are the Jews orca

2001
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,080
Castrating this to Alexa

2002
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,104
Barack Obama press

2003
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,896
Just real quick of your head

2004
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,968
If it's uncomfortable

2005
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:53,088
Clip comes after Kissinger is a strange question about what country's relationship with the United States

2006
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:54,368
Will Define Obama

2007
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,136
Presidency

2008
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:59,744
It's such a weird question that I'm just going to play it and Kissinger's response

2009
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,536
So you can sort of get the full contact

2010
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,328
Read the most

2011
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,608
Thing is for Barraco's

2012
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,144
We are here to talk about

01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,016
Indeed.

2028
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,808
Been really a new world order

2029
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:56,832
Created

Beethoven community

2031
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:06,048
When you hear the question is responding to in the full answer the context of this comment makes way more sense

2032
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,376
Surprising is that context is really the only way this works is

2033
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,656
Making it seem some kind of

2034
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,192
Dominus spooky

2035
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,472
Gary,

2036
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:14,752
Compilation

2037
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,032
Yeah it's not like you said

2038
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,176
You know what

2039
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:28,064
You are Alex Jones expression work has been a bad one

2040
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:33,952
A bay I guess I've never done it before I gave it a shot listen No One try things no one's accusing you like

2041
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:38,304
Being the man of a million voices I am not accused of that by anyone

2042
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,584
So this next

2043
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,608
Cliff is

2044
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,656
Feel like it's warm

2045
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,936
It's

2046
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:44,960
Not good

2047
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:47,776
Eventually once we discussed why

2048
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,312
Surface-level

2049
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,592
It appears a lot warmer

2050
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,408
2009 is also the first year

2051
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:57,248
Establishment of the G20 in the middle

2052
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
Financial

2053
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,184
Is another step towards the globe

2054
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:12,096
So this is a clip from a speech that Hermann Von Ruby gave after he was elected as the first president of the European Council

2055
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:15,936
Prior to this point there was a six-month rotation of president

2056
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:18,752
That's where whichever country was president of the eu4 that's

2057
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,032
6 months

2058
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:23,616
They also held the ceremonial position of President of accounts

2059
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,432
They decided to go a different way with that

2060
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,456
In 2009

2061
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,736
Therapy.

2062
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,272
Havana Rumba.

2063
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:32,064
But liked it

2064
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:38,464
Probably isn't talking about global government per se even say New World Order

2065
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,232
Nightclub

2066
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:45,632
He's talking about International cooperation that was prompted by the worldwide economic crash of 2007/2008

2067
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,656
What he says

2068
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:48,448
G20 was formed in

2069
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:50,240
2009 that's not accurate

2070
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,544
It was formed in 1999

2071
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,616
But in 2008 in response to the global financial crisis

2072
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:58,176
They decided that they should have annual meetings

2073
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:03,040
And that they would be the body where the primary economic cooperation conversations happened

2074
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,344
Prior to this that was mostly the role of the

2075
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,648
The G8 but in the wake of the financial crisis

2076
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:11,232
People recognize that you know there were other

2077
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,256
Countries that begin

2078
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,536
I'm f***** up bigger time

2079
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:18,912
Yeah the interconnectedness of world economies had more important actors in it than just those eight

2080
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:23,264
The reason that rumpy's says that this is the first year of global governance is be

2081
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,824
Because the EU isn't a member of the G8

2082
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:29,664
Individual EU states are members but the body itself is not

2083
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:32,480
Conversely the EU is a member of the

2084
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:33,504
20

2085
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,856
What rugby is saying is not that this is the first year of global governance itsvet

2086
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:41,696
Forum where International economic cooperation conversations happen

2087
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:44,768
Is now the body that the EU which he was just to let

2088
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:46,048
Like the president of easy

2089
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:46,816
Included in

2090
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,656
This one that sounds the closest to making Alex's point

2091
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:53,216
But if you know a little bit about the situation of the context

2092
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,496
Text of what Trump is saying

2093
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:58,336
This clip doesn't say what Alex's presenting it to sing at all

2094
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,640
It's not talking about a new global

2095
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:03,200
You know what I'm going to I'm going to say this right now

2096
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:05,248
And I've got strong opinions about it

2097
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:08,576
I think that maybe short compilation videos

2098
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:10,368
Aren't you should learn about his

2099
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,392
No but

2100
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,672
Good for slam dunk

2101
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:15,744
Amazing slam dunks

2102
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,512
CS

2103
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,304
Rex Chapman

2104
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,352
Don't go bring him up

2105
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:23,680
I feel like he's a better comforter that's m

2106
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:30,592
I would I would say

2107
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:36,480
Yeah so we have one last clip that within this compilation AutoCAD then Alex comes in with a sort of

2108
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:37,248
Dakota

2109
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:38,528
Are you up to

2110
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,064
Take a global system

2111
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,088
Can I

2112
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,416
It could happen

2113
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,208
Any practice in the world

2114
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,768
And they use that

2115
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,304
Landry crises

2116
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,584
Consolidate control

2117
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,352
Bankrupt

2118
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,912
Instead

2119
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,848
Because you will be dead

2120
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:09,248
So we have Soros on some interview show saying that a global system is in the works with absolutely no context about what's being.

2121
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:11,552
I think at this point you can

2122
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,880
Can see the game that's being played here and how all these clips are meant

2123
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:15,904
To come at you fast

2124
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,440
Stan without any surrounding

2125
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:22,816
If you're overwhelmed by what appears to be a ton of powerful people saying that there's a new world order a foot

2126
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,608
And then Alex comes back in the studio

2127
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:26,912
And says that this is their plan to kill you

2128
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:28,960
You might just accept him at his work

2129
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:31,008
However if you like

2130
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,288
Conspiracy theorists love

2131
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,824
Do your research

2132
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,104
And take a little bit of time

2133
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,408
Ask the question

2134
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,688
What's the context

2135
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,480
You'll easily see that

2136
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:42,528
The conclusion Alex tax on there at the end about

2137
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:44,320
The people plan to kill you is laughable

2138
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:47,136
This compilation doesn't establish or build

2139
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,160
The conclusion to Dolly

2140
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:50,976
It's just smoking mirrors because that's all this s***

2141
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,816
Where was Klaus Schwab wasn't in there.

2142
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:58,912
Images of you can see the drumbeat of you alone nothing you'll be happy that Monty

2143
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:01,216
Anchorage

2144
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:06,336
So annoying peating this phrase like he does is meant to logit in the audiences mind

2145
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:09,152
I connected to other ideas like they want to kill you

2146
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:10,176
Yep that's just

2147
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:12,480
Subconscious manipulation that he's doing

2148
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:13,504
Yep

2149
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,272
Real

2150
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,808
Real bad

2151
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,576
It is

2152
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,112
89

2153
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:19,648
I really really do

2154
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,416
Despise those types

2155
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,184
Texas logon

2156
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,976
You know that they're just like

2157
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:26,048
They're what you hear before the boot stops on your face

2158
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,584
Like that kind of s*** like

2159
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,912
They're taking everything away from us as right before they shoot you

2160
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:32,192
Is like it you

2161
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,984
Before I die I have to

2162
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,800
One second you realized

2163
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:40,384
Is that like obviously it did

2164
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,664
Come from

2165
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,968
World economic forum

2166
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:46,016
Video that they put out like it is

2167
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,832
It's on there

2168
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,904
But the actual context of it

2169
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,184
Is being abused

2170
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:53,952
Misrepresent

2171
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:57,792
I mean obviously you can't always be playing defense

2172
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:58,560
Like against

2173
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,096
What conspiracy theorists are going to

2174
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,632
Is your content for life

2175
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:02,400
But

2176
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:04,448
Something like that I feel like

2177
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:10,848
Maybe saying New World Order is an own-goal okay you don't always have to be playing defense but don't

2178
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,920
Kick the ball into your own f****** go to disagree because like

2179
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:20,064
As evidenced by you trying to come up with words that would replace it novel Global structure I think that work

2180
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:26,720
I'm going to use that one from now on

2181
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:33,120
That's only because we seen in so many conspiracy videos and movies and all that s*** before I head because of Scott Hall

2182
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:36,960
It's repeated in of it's just like where we where

2183
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:37,984
Take all your stuff

2184
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,520
Then you'll have nothing in the like

2185
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:42,592
That's the

2186
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:45,664
Here is just

2187
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,200
The some random

2188
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,224
Rambling

2189
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:51,040
When I go to a liberal area of Austin

2190
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,768
They are stupid

2191
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:03,072
How scared they are

2192
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,608
Feel powerful myself

2193
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,776
And for the globalist when they see the homeless Shel

2194
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,312
And the needles

2195
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:15,616
And the trend he's offering their children up

2196
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:17,152
Pedophile storytime

2197
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,272
Broken your will

2198
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,088
Badges

2199
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:25,856
Help me

2200
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:30,208
I want to be good and strong I believe in goodness

2201
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,488
You will begin to

2202
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,816
Spirit literally electrochemical

2203
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:36,096
North higher

2204
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,376
Vibration

2205
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:38,656
Sounds right

2206
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,192
New age that's not

2207
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,008
What's a science

2208
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:46,336
This is this is something you can be

2209
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:49,920
Replicated

2210
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:51,712
Science says

2211
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:55,808
That if you drop down on your knees and accept Jesus Christ into your heart

2212
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:01,952
Then you will electromagnetically accelerate to a higher plane on a different vibration

2213
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:03,232
Scientist

2214
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,512
Science science

2215
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,048
Vibration

2216
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,328
The Sunday wage

2217
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:13,728
These are the conversations that they're having at the big boy table

2218
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:15,008
Cool

2219
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,056
So we get to the bug

2220
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:19,616
Beatings

2221
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:23,456
I do so love when we booked at it something to the point where I live

2222
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:29,600
Completely forgotten about it by the end of that out half the gold

2223
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:38,048
You have nothing you're a failure you're ugly

2224
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:40,096
Used to that

2225
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:42,144
Start switch

2226
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,936
Instead of I will not eat your body

2227
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,752
And I will have children will colonize space

2228
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,800
New World Order

2229
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,848
Not God

2230
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,640
And we are not under your control

2231
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:55,456
God control

2232
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,480
And Justice and freedom

2233
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:01,344
Where to go to break I want to encourage Lester's understand that

2234
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:04,160
The battle for Infowars is here

2235
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:08,256
I feel my t-shirts now the time

2236
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,280
We're selling

2237
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:10,560
T-shirts

2238
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,328
Even

2239
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,608
Below cost some of the

2240
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,400
And 75% off

2241
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,936
We got to get all the funds in

2242
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:16,960
We can

2243
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:18,240
Right now it's

2244
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:28,480
He know who else said that you'll have nothing and you'll be happy about it Murray

2245
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:31,040
Condo

2246
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,600
I would say if

2247
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:36,672
This is accurate at all what Alex is talking about

2248
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,208
Things are looking real bad

2249
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:39,744
Things are a real bad

2250
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:45,632
If he's selling out things at prices that are under cost because he can't make operation operating expenses

2251
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,680
The goose is basically cooked

2252
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:52,288
I guess you could sell out all this s*** and then maybe put the Band-Aid on things for a bit but

2253
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:57,152
This problem isn't going to go away because ultimately this propaganda platform is a model that

2254
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,176
Doomed to fail

2255
01:46:58,432 --> 01:47:00,224
Actually Alex's propaganda

2256
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:04,320
Platform is a great example of how

2257
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:07,904
He stayed humble and kept things in the mid-range like where he was

2258
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:14,304
2008 or 2012 yelling about how Ron Paul should have won the primary and showing up at places of bullhorn

2259
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,584
Every once in awhile

2260
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,632
He could have been comfortable to Rich

2261
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:19,168
Probably for the rest of his life

2262
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:20,192
Any would have been able to

2263
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:22,240
Continue to pretend to fight an infowar

2264
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,776
Against imaginary enemies

2265
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,312
The Grove

2266
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:26,336
Is what's killing a

2267
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,152
It's be overhead and expenses on the

2268
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:31,456
Worthless employees on his payroll

2269
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:34,272
A propagandist doesn't need that kind of hassle

2270
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:35,552
Propagandist

2271
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:39,648
Is Born to Run free Hornet hand making up s*** but books

2272
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:40,416
Please never read

2273
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:41,440
This

2274
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:47,840
A man selling his Wares at a loss just we can afford to pay a dork like Harrison Smith to host a pointless show to patout

2275
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:49,120
The concept of putting out

2276
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,400
That's a debasement

2277
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,936
That is no good

2278
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:54,752
This is not how God intended a propagandist to live

2279
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:58,592
Also Something In that clip stuck out to me where Alex said

2280
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,872
We're not under York

2281
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:01,152
Control

2282
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:03,712
Control and we choose liberty and justice and freedom

2283
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:04,992
That thought

2284
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:06,272
Completely nonsense

2285
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,320
How does one choose freedom

2286
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,600
If they're under a deities

2287
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,368
Control

2288
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,392
If you're under someone's

2289
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:14,720
Control that means you don't have free will unless you can choose anything let alone

2290
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,000
Choosing to be free

2291
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
Confounding

2292
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,048
Idea

2293
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,120
But of course Alex believes that God is a free-will kind of guy

2294
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:23,680
Maybe being under his control is to have free will

2295
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:24,960
But in that case

2296
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,520
What does it even mean to have free will

2297
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,544
Pretty much nothing

2298
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:31,360
That would tend to imply the people who aren't under gods

2299
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,896
Control don't have free will

2300
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:36,224
But then how can they possibly be condemned for the fact that they're not under God's

2301
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,808
Control they can't choose to be under God's control they have no free will

2302
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:42,112
I just don't think you

2303
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,392
Okay then

2304
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:45,440
When God created the universe

2305
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:50,816
He also created the end of the universe simultaneously he knows everything that begins and ends

2306
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:52,608
He knows everything that will happen

2307
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,144
And that means

2308
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,704
That you have the ability to choose what's going to happen

2309
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:01,312
Can I tell you I read this really great book about Free Will and determinism recent

2310
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:03,104
Who's called knowing

2311
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,152
Starring Nicolas

2312
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:09,504
Which I have

2313
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,296
Some continuity

2314
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,368
Alex gets a little bit work.

2315
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,696
He thinks about the globalist

2316
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:20,000
Kill your pets

2317
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:22,304
That's the first time that I believe the globalist

2318
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:24,864
Maybe I've just been wrong maybe I should

2319
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:26,400
Submit

2320
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:30,240
Maybe we should all go out today with hatch

2321
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,288
Killer dogs in the backyard

2322
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,616
It's the same the Earth right

2323
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:39,968
We're supposed to give up everything we're guilty cuz we have dogs

2324
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,856
Greedy

2325
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:46,880
Monsters

2326
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:49,184
YouTube

2327
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,976
Be a rollover

2328
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:53,024
But I can steal the future there project

2329
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:56,096
Their Global is hatred of themselves onto you

2330
01:49:57,632 --> 01:50:00,192
All the beautiful nice things they have in the science they have

2331
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:01,216
Came from the Commodores

2332
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:03,520
Came for the people we built all this

2333
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:08,640
The Robots coming online

2334
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:10,432
Collective suicide

2335
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,456
Well guess what it's not going to

2336
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:13,504
Okay

2337
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,528
It should happen maybe

2338
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:16,576
Maybe I'm Wrong maybe I am the bad guy

2339
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:19,392
Because I want to kill my new puppy

2340
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,416
I'm the bad guy

2341
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:26,048
I want to apologize to the automation store

2342
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:27,072
The fuk just happened

2343
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:34,752
Bloomberg the owner owner of Bloomberg and the publication

2344
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:37,824
All the other groups that came out

2345
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,128
We should kill

2346
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:43,200
Savior

2347
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,272
She said that

2348
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:52,416
I have never seen this level of preparation on Alex's show

2349
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:58,816
The idea that he's in the middle of what appears to be a rant about something and then it throws do a video about the same sub

2350
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:00,352
Objective he did in advance

2351
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,632
Like you prepared to this

2352
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,400
JustBats

2353
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:03,424
I mean

2354
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,192
It's

2355
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,984
Really a low bar

2356
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:12,384
But it's impressive for him

2357
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,920
100% thought it was a

2358
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:14,944
Complete accident

2359
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:19,808
Somebody to accidentally like overlaid the broadcast with an old video or something

2360
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:26,208
Or maybe they would like hit the relay run out of the five second delay after you started talking about killing pets and then it got real

2361
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:30,560
Weird

2362
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:31,584
Impressive

2363
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:34,144
28 years ago his career he's figured this out

2364
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:40,032
Not once did that thought occurred to me independent I'm not positive

2365
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,848
So much of a show

2366
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:46,432
But I don't think I've ever seen anything that coherent

2367
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:49,248
Yeah like in terms of a pre-recorded piece right

2368
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,784
Maybe one

2369
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:53,344
Alfred possibly want

2370
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,624
You know it is

2371
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,416
Good to show some real growth

2372
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:59,488
You know at the end of your career

2373
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:03,072
It's a good time to really still show that you can learn nutria

2374
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:07,424
Be like if you saw this on a local access thing if you like

2375
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:09,472
See

2376
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:12,032
That was what he was doing 28 years ago

2377
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:15,360
That's a bizarre clip their Beyond

2378
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:19,200
Two features that look really bad when there's

2379
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:19,968
Further contact

2380
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,504
Ben you understand

2381
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:25,856
Just off the top of the Bloomberg and all these papers didn't say that you should kill your

2382
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,440
There was an op-ed in Bloomberg that was a bit tone-deaf perhaps

2383
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:31,744
But it was just about ways that people could deal with

2384
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:32,512
Inflation

2385
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:35,072
It wasn't even about like it's bad for the Earth or anyting

2386
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:36,096
Although

2387
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:41,216
Has been written about in the past like going back

2388
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:42,752
Print of pet ownership

2389
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:44,544
So one of the main problems

2390
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,336
About this Bloomberg

2391
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:48,384
Nothing that is lady was addressed to people who make less

2392
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,176
$300,000 a year

2393
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,968
So just from that premise

2394
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:53,248
It's going to piss some people off

2395
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:54,528
And they did get dumped

2396
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:55,808
I am shocked

2397
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:57,344
That people would he

2398
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,904
Here from bloomberg.com

2399
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,952
But you know things said

2400
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:04,512
Maybe are tone-deaf towards the Poor's

2401
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:10,912
Turn the in the tweet it said that you should replace meet with lentils but the article actually just said

2402
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:12,960
It suggested meat substitutes

2403
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:16,800
Essential

2404
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:17,568
Like

2405
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:20,384
Detail that missing from

2406
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:25,248
Another suggestion that's in the article is to

2407
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:28,064
Rethink those costly Pet Medical

2408
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:35,488
This wasn't saying that you should kill your Pat or that you shouldn't take your pet to the vet but that some expenses related to pets might not be

2409
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:36,256
Be good expensive

2410
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,560
The next line the article is quote

2411
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:39,840
It may sound harsh but

2412
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:43,168
But researchers actually don't recommend pet chemotherapy which

2413
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:44,704
Can cost up to $10,000

2414
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,728
For ethical reasons

2415
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:52,896
You know this article sucks it's really obvious that Alex is creating fake version of it.

2416
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:54,432
Get mad at ya

2417
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,456
Kill your pets

2418
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:57,760
The two things are problematic about

2419
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:58,784
This clip R1

2420
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:00,576
Alex is supposed to be in the grips

2421
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:05,184
So some really serious emergency situation with his health

2422
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:10,048
I stress but here he is on whether genuinely or is it performance

2423
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,840
Would you be pretty bad for blood pressure

2424
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:13,120
He's probably calm down

2425
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,144
Yeah

2426
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:17,216
Alex has a rich history of a talking about killing dogs

2427
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:19,776
On way more than one occasion in the past

2428
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:21,824
She's gone on and on about how he's killed dogs

2429
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:26,176
So I don't know if he's actually the best messenger for this right-wing fake outrage

2430
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:26,944
About this

2431
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,480
I think

2432
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:32,832
It kind of makes it supposed comedy piece got there at the end of the little bit less impact

2433
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:38,208
The satire that piece is supposed to be that it's outlandish to imagine Alex killing his pet

2434
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:39,488
But it's not

2435
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,536
You talked about doing everything a bunch

2436
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:42,304
To the Past

2437
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,608
I don't know it it doesn't

2438
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,888
It hits.

2439
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:49,216
Currently the get sick

2440
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:52,032
Kind of psychopath would talk about killing their

2441
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:55,616
KATU

2442
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:58,432
We do we need to stop on this dog's head

2443
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,200
Never

2444
01:54:59,456 --> 01:54:59,968
Thought about things

2445
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:00,992
For more than a second

2446
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:02,528
It's

2447
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:03,808
It's a total massing saying

2448
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,344
So

2449
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:09,184
There's a lot of time spent with Alex interviewing

2450
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,488
His former employees Savannah

2451
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:15,072
When she got kicked off Twitter after posting

2452
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:15,840
Videos

2453
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:17,888
Interviewing people about how

2454
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:20,192
Unfair it is that Leah Thomas is allowed

2455
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:20,960
Two competing with

2456
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:23,520
Oh she was doing some transphobia

2457
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:27,360
Yes scotches as it turns out she wasn't actually kickoff for the video

2458
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:30,944
To kick-off for creating a new account to Aveda previous ban

2459
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:36,064
And the way that her new video went viral in the right-wing media it brought division

2460
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:42,720
She was originally kicked off in 2024 election related misinformation

2461
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:49,376
Anyway she's gone on to become a personality and a producer at the blaze which is probably really smart for her career

2462
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:50,912
It's still a dead end

2463
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:56,800
Very least Glenn Beck isn't selling product at below cost in order to squeeze out a couple more months on air

2464
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:59,616
I'm not going to cover her interview because honestly I don't care

2465
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:02,432
I'm just going to play this one clip because I think it really

2466
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,200
Illustrate

2467
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:04,992
How little Alex does

2468
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,528
He doesn't know what he's talking about

2469
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:12,416
Savannah Hernandez really joining us bottom the hour to write down some really huge nose

2470
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:14,976
One of the swimmers that saw the complaint

2471
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,280
But you didn't like that

2472
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,048
Man

2473
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:21,632
Plus collar the other women

2474
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:23,936
I'm being able to

2475
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:25,216
Take over

2476
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,152
Weather

2477
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:36,736
Waterworld

2478
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:39,552
So you got multiple aspects of the story wrong

2479
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:46,208
The first is that the interview Savannah did was not with someone who filed the complaint it was just a person with some slightly critical comments about 2

2480
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:49,024
Thomas seemed to be about her friend

2481
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,304
Make finals

2482
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,072
And I guess

2483
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:53,120
Said she would have if Thomas had

2484
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,400
Swimming

2485
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:56,448
I don't recommend pursuing this line of

2486
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:57,472
Thinking to its logical

2487
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:58,496
Conclusion because it

2488
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,032
Doesn't go anywhere good

2489
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,592
The second thing that Alex has wrong here's at the

2490
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:05,408
Person Savannah was interviewing didn't get kicked off Twitter

2491
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,176
Savannah

2492
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:10,016
This is the entire reason this is a story and why Alex would be having

2493
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:10,784
Savannah

2494
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:13,344
He's doing a right-wing media blitz to

2495
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:17,184
Strike while the Iron's hot and her victimhood argument is fresh in people's minds

2496
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:22,816
Some sleep Hazard that Alex doesn't seem to understand the premise of the interviewees agreed do I show you

2497
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,864
Literally no preparation for this at all

2498
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,656
Anyway like I said

2499
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:28,960
Decide this interview was just transfer OBS that's

2500
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,520
That's all that's going on here

2501
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:33,824
Basically concern-trolling 2

2502
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:37,152
These folks attempt to mask their underlying intent bigotry behind

2503
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:39,456
Pretend sincere concern about women's swimming

2504
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:42,528
Yeah I hear I mean

2505
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,320
It's so f******

2506
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:46,624
Bulshit how dare you

2507
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:49,184
How fuk I mean they're not just that but

2508
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,208
Simply because

2509
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:57,376
Bill Burr made the transpo big joke that everybody has been dining out on on the far-right like 10 years ago

2510
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:58,912
In one of the special

2511
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:02,240
That it was done in a completely different

2512
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,520
Contacts

2513
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:04,288
Text to make it look like

2514
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:07,104
He's the idiot for having this kind of thought process

2515
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,896
Says whatsoever

2516
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:11,456
They're just going to do the same f******

2517
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:13,504
B******* because it doesn't matter

2518
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,552
It doesn't matter what it is if it's not

2519
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:16,576
Sports it

2520
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:22,976
Derivation be in the bathrooms if it's not the bathrooms it's they shouldn't be in the same restaurant it doesn't f******

2521
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,768
Matter it's just a thing

2522
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:27,072
I agree it's infuriate

2523
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:30,144
So if you're somebody

2524
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:32,704
Who's had his lawyer contact

2525
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:36,544
And say that you have a serious

2526
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:37,568
Emergency medical

2527
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:38,592
Condition

2528
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:39,616
I would say

2529
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:42,176
Probably wouldn't want to then go to work

2530
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:44,736
And do a ridiculous pageant of a show the next

2531
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,016
Baby

2532
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:48,320
Definitely if you did do that

2533
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:52,160
You probably wouldn't want to say on there that you're going to come back and do another show that he's

2534
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:55,232
Real this is all out the open

2535
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,280
The new world order something else

2536
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,840
I have a special

2537
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:02,144
Live Infowars broadcast

2538
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:02,912
Tonight

2539
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:06,240
From at least 7 to 9

2540
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,520
Commercial free

2541
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:08,544
Phone calls

2542
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,848
On the great reset on the New World Order

2543
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,664
Don't know what you think we should do is call her

2544
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:16,736
Stop this it'll be

2545
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:22,112
I don't know if he actually ended up following through with that but I would just not have done that

2546
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:27,488
Yeah the next clip is him saying like never felt better in my life

2547
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:33,888
This is as good as it gets for me I've I feel like I've lost like five pounds in the past couple of days like what I was

2548
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:40,288
Kind of hoping there'll be some clip of him

2549
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:43,616
One supplement

2550
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:44,896
31 Westcliff

2551
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:46,432
Santa it's because

2552
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:47,200
Alex

2553
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:49,760
For the third hour does interview that

2554
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,808
Economist stock picker guy

2555
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:54,624
He sucks

2556
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,416
I don't even care

2557
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:57,184
The clip Valley

2558
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:58,464
Getting into the interview

2559
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:06,912
Hade to have them give people

2560
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:10,240
These

2561
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:15,104
Morphine.

2562
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:15,872
Watch him die

2563
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:17,664
But you're read this here's the headline

2564
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,992
Hospitals bribe to put patients on Pathway to death

2565
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:23,808
By the National Health Service Trust

2566
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,624
Targets on Liverpool care pathway

2567
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:30,976
The third hours in Davis interview the stock Trader Edward out

2568
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:32,256
Sweetly insane

2569
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:34,048
He's on to talk about the governor

2570
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:35,328
What's killing everyone at Kojak's

2571
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,096
See and then what happened

2572
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:42,496
Central piece of evidence in covering the story seems to be this article about the Liverpool care pathway

2573
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:43,520
The current story

2574
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,544
It has to do with the pandemic

2575
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:45,824
You obviously forgot

2576
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,872
Got to check the date on the article he's reading

2577
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:52,992
He didn't look into this at all so he has no idea the decade-old story and that the LCP was

2578
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:54,528
Is phased out in 2013

2579
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,576
I don't know how else to put this

2580
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:57,344
Dish it's a

2581
02:00:58,112 --> 02:01:00,672
If I was scared at all about the quality of the work he's doing

2582
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:05,024
Realizing that he f***** this up that bad should be a huge issue for him

2583
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,840
You should do a big segment on the next episode about how to import

2584
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:08,608
It is to check

2585
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:09,632
Dates on stories

2586
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:13,472
Giving people assisted suicide drug

2587
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:15,264
Any of that

2588
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:17,568
His audience accepted ever trashy gives them

2589
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:19,616
There's no incentive to do better than trash

2590
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:20,384
MetroPCS

2591
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:22,432
It's trash absolute trash

2592
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:28,832
This show is at the present a more less combination of extreme bigotry and incompetently delivered false news

2593
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:29,600
Stories

2594
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:31,904
I think I see this a bit but it Bears repeating

2595
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:36,256
There's no value in the existence of Infowars as a piece of the information landscape

2596
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,792
It's full-on come

2597
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:38,816
Completely negative

2598
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:39,840
In terms of

2599
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:40,864
Society

2600
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,400
I like you do you think about

2601
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:43,680
Just would like the

2602
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:44,960
I came from

2603
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:47,520
Early on

2604
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:50,336
I think that I had a position that was far more like

2605
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:54,176
There's a place for something like Alex in the world

2606
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:56,736
I still kind of believe that that

2607
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:57,760
It's true there's there's

2608
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:59,552
There's a place for skeptical voice

2609
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,088
But that's not what this is

2610
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:02,624
There's a world where

2611
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:04,416
And Alex Jones

2612
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:06,720
Performance

2613
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:09,024
Is appreciated

2614
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:12,864
Because it is not having any effect on people's actual life

2615
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:16,960
Well I really unfortunate world where the performance is

2616
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:17,984
Very much hurtful

2617
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:20,032
I would take issue with how you phrase that

2618
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:21,312
I got agree slightly

2619
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,128
Even a

2620
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:25,408
Different

2621
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:26,688
Organize world

2622
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:27,456
This has

2623
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:33,344
Oh no no absolutely not that I think that there is a model of somebody who can be

2624
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:36,416
Generally wrong but asking

2625
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,440
Pointed question

2626
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:39,488
That does have a societal value

2627
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:43,072
Position that I kind of

2628
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:43,840
Felt like

2629
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:45,632
This is the idea of Alex

2630
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:49,472
It's not what

2631
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:50,752
Is the buffoon

2632
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:53,056
The buffoon the ark

2633
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:56,384
No no just that

2634
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,664
That f****** idiot

2635
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:00,480
Who's sometimes says something in your like a

2636
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:04,064
Instead of being the idiot who says Non-Stop

2637
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:10,464
I won't get what is the what is the buffoon is a hateful bigot and then also

2638
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:13,280
All the time

2639
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:16,352
And tries to sell you s*** there's no place in the world for that

2640
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:20,960
Not even in the media landscape in the world

2641
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:23,008
Think what I'm trying to get at when I'm trying to stress

2642
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,032
Isn't that like

2643
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:27,104
There may have been

2644
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:28,384
A Time

2645
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,920
Listening to

2646
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:30,688
Alex Jones

2647
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:31,968
Could give you like

2648
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:33,760
Maybe

2649
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:35,296
.01

2650
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:36,832

2651
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:42,208
301 info Buena compared to read a story which might be like 1

2652
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:43,232
Info

2653
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:49,632
Trace Amounts of info unit

2654
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:50,400
Open metric this

2655
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:56,800
Supermedia now it might be in the negative it is negative

2656
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:59,872
Dice lower faster

2657
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:00,896
It's a

2658
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:01,920
Little man

2659
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:05,248
I'm interested to see where his health

2660
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:06,272
Situation goes

2661
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:09,856
Proceed somebody's other court cases

2662
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:11,904
What's up what develops with them

2663
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:16,000
And whether he's back in studio on Friday

2664
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:16,768
Eddie

2665
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:18,560
Any outcome is

2666
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:22,400
Possible with this morning on Friday

2667
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:25,984
He's got a show

2668
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:31,616
We have about having late do the whole show laying down

2669

That's the way you do another I demand

2670

We will not get it but will be back on

2672
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,832
Yes we will

2673
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:47,232
We aren't Staten Island Resort fighting

2674
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:48,256
S***

2675
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:55,424
I feel like I can't see doctor marbles anymore since dr. William mount

2676
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,704
Nope
