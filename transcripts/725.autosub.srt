16
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,080
As you can see there's like boxes of but

17
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,896
Then I'm putting them in bags and then just

18
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,736
Thinking about taking the bags in the office elope

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,632
Ursone shot who's who's lost feeling in their fingers in order to choose

23
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
The correct but

24
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,960
I have put them in the right place I have

25
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,056
A non-problematic team of Olympus

26
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
It's like a Yakuza boss

27
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
So that's very exciting and I want to say

28
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
Brother Josh

29
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,184
The brother John just got laid off

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,024
I want to take this opportunity to see Josh

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
Keep keep yourself on the on the spirit

32
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
Prayer times when you lose a job

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,848
Being unemployed sucks

34
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:00,736
Manufactory creators I wish I could give you a button factory

35
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,064
Or Candy Factory or what

36
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,392
But I think that's when I look back on my life

37
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
A lot of times

38
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,512
There were times that I lost jobs and it felt like a worse thing in the f****** world

39
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,816
But it ended up being

40
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Positive

41
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
Eventually

42
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
Yeah

43
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,984
You find you find some brother job and you know maybe you never would have

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,568
Had the opportunity to find that other better job later

45
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
So John

46
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,992
Deeper keep your eyes to Bomgaars I have no idea why that what came up

47
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
Because I am not somebody who's good at expressing optimism

48
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
Things will get better

49
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,376
BoBoiBoy

50
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Jordyn Woods

51
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,728
Bright bright spot I'm going to keep

52
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,824
With the theme of cartoons Harley Quinn just finished its third

53
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,664
Season and it's a really good cartoon

54
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,064
Start from this place like imagine the old classic Batman the animated series with Kevin Conroy sure

55
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
The best cartoons of all time

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,863
Imagine if you started with that show but from the premise that we have

57
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
I've landed on now where

58
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
Batman is a billionaire destroying the world using his money only to serve his

59
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Your game right

60
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,919
Right to start from that point of view and then make Batman the Animated Series

61
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Fantastic

62
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
Really really great Batman's a piece of s***

63
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,855
Like it's it's so good Commissioner Gordon is the absolute worst

64
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
A cab all day like it is it is a very

65
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,607
I rarely check things out the maybe I will check that out

66
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
The only problem that I have

67
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,959
I have not seen the show so I'm not entirely sure but

68
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,615
There's a pervy preoccupation with Harley Quinn that I'm not comfortable

69
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:09,503
And the centerpiece is a relationship between her and poison ivy which people who have taken too creepy

70
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,903
But I would argue that it's actually way more of just a positive representation kind of situation always the create

71
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
Leaders intent ND

72
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
Material isn't always the problem

73
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:25,631
You're not wrong you are not wrong but yeah I feel weird

74
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
He's a great voice he's fantastic

75
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
What's grits great show

76
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
Sure

77
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,919
So Jordan today we have what was not a great show that is Alex's show at night also Alex's trial

78
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,527
Connecticut

79
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
BP 13th and Fort

80
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
Tuesday and Wednesday of this week

81
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
Some clips

82
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,583
And then Alex's shows from those days

83
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,191
And he's up to while all this is going down

84
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Board exam himself

85
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:06,079
With a certain level of respect that he hasn't shown in the past right

86
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
Yeah man he's classic

87
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,783
Before we get into anything and even before we talked with the wind so I wanted to say we always used to talk about this

88
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,647
Logistical stuff on are all that much but you know today

89
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
We were set to record at a certain point

90
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
I needed to push back half an hour

91
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,631
And Jordan you accommodate me when these things come up from time to time

92
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,703
And I really just wanted to say

93
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Nope nope

94
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
I just wanted to say

95
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,527
I really really really do.

96
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:51,135
Will be gone and all that will be left as you're selling board I mean here's what's going to happen

97
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,999
Where can I return to the beginning eventually there will be 50 people listening

98
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:01,631
Because it's just going to be you and me is old man with you just playing soundbites at me

99
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,703
Giggling it's possible yet

100
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,031
You really thought I was going somewhere sincere with that didn't you

101
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,943
Until I turned it was all over

102
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367

103
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,439

Next my fiance Emily cuz she gets annoyed when

109
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,199
When I come to bed and turn this on to sleep from Laura Elise

110
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
Thank you very much

111
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551

112
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Lake Orion

113
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,391

Very much so either way this could be Buttercup you or buttercup

119
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,519
I'm not sure but either way you're not a policy wonk

120
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:17,407
Thank you very much to your door so first

121
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,223
Suspect has no Heroes

122
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,319
Do you want our technocratic

123
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,135
Delayed on this and I'm very sorry about that but

124
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,975
Marcy the walking bear thank you so much you are now a technocrat

125
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
I'm a policy wonk I have

126
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
Risen above

127
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,495
A little break e for me

128
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
And then we're going

129
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
To come back

130
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
And I'm going to

131
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
Start the show over

132
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
F*** you

133
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
F*** you

134
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
I got plenty of words for you but

135
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
At the end of the day

136
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
F*** you and your new world order

137
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
Horse you rode in on

138
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
And all your s***

139
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Maybe today

140
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby

141
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
5 years

142
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
And you never see me again

143
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Really what I want to do

144
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
I apologize

145
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,711
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

146
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Better tomorrow

147
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
He's not now I didn't

148
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
So

149
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,623
Jordan I wanted to

150
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
To say

151
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:37,535
We got the Connecticut case started we've been watching the stream and texting

152
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,559
Execusource

153
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,143
Quite a bit I think we both came into this with the plan of like

154
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,495
I don't know if I'm going to watch the whole thing this time end

155
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,591
Actually

156
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
I would say

157
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
My defense

158
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,479
I came in with the perspective of I don't want to do this

159
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
Again

160
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Last night was a lot

161
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,599
And it was very concerned about redundant

162
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,415
The same thing again

163
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Right but it is

164
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
It's not

165
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
It's a different

166
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,791
It's a different Beast than be the Austin

167
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Situation

168
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
First

169
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
There's a lot more planes

170
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Second

171
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,959
The case accuses Alex of slightly different violations

172
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,775
How it has a bit more to do with the business end

173
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
Of his his operation

174
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,383
So there's a bit more there a bit more meat

175
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Study can look at

176
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,247
Then third and most importantly Norm pattis is akam

177
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,599
Sweetly different brand of lawyers and right now is representation in Texas

178
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:38,719
We've long wondered why it is exactly that Norm is Alex's lawyer

179
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
He seems like a mope generally and he's a really embarrassing loser outside the courtroom what with his stand-up adventure with

180
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:52,287
Who's actually so bad that there's no need to list a second thing here in this month

181
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
That you're that forever

182
00:10:54,591 --> 00:11:00,735
It's a little bit it's already like I've been a bricklayer for 30 years but you f*** one monkey

183
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:07,135
And they call you monkey f***** Jim you know they never call you bricklayer Jim they call your pants down racial slur Jack

184
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Exactly

185
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
Norm gets paid because he will do anything

186
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,375
He's a mercenary with a law degree and he doesn't give a s*** how awful the things he's saying sound or who they hurt

187
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:23,263
That became crystal clear on day one and it really gave me a sense that as bad as how it's his lawyer wasn't Austin

188
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
He at least had some boundaries

189
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
He didn't seem like it at the time until I saw Norm

190
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,943
And realize how shity raynol could have been

191
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
If you had wanted to

192
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
80s crazy

193
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,831
We're going to start today by looking a bit at norms open

194
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,879
Statement and Toca Boca

195
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
Particularly shity things that happen

196
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,279
And then we're going to tune in to see what Alex was doing while this was happening

197
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,399
It's always good Whenever there is simultaneous like you can put up

198
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
Suck my side Brock

199
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,775
Sued into Oblivion

200
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
Airbnb like

201
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,383
We're winning that our asses off yeah things are pretty good

202
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
Do things considered

203
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,807
Also there's a pleat I want to yell about the most important we find

204
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:13,951
So here is a little bit from Norms opening isn't great on this

205
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
Yes I have to say

206
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
It's from the law and

207
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
Sort of

208
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Big Heath

209
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
What money is

210
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Award enough

211
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
He was mocked

212
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Wild

213
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:32,031
First of all just being so blunt as we like we're just going to say if their claims are exaggerated

214
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
Yeah

215
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Hey listen

216
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,223
That's fun and say that maybe we didn't actually do it and this time we're like

217
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,295
Sure we did it we did it we're already guilty

218
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,159
But it wasn't that bad it is to come on different

219
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
I think it takes a certain level of

220
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
Hello Miss to

221
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,631
Just say something like that out loud

222
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:02,495
Yeah one of the things that I noticed is the norm did have a bit of a faulty delivery

223
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
There was

224
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,103
Moments where it almost felt like you was

225
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
Thinking I'm going to say this

226
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,223
But I might be attributing that to him unfairly based on

227
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,855
What do you like the way he ends up comporting I don't believe he was

228
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,439
Like worried about things

229
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,839
I mean in my in my thought process I didn't see that so much as Occam's razor

230
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
Told me that like

231
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,167
He's just kind of winging

232
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:36,031
Delivery is not great

233
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
So

234
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Norm

235
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
Does he does

236
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,199
Maker basically

237
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Partisan

238
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Xanax

239
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
The plaintiffs

240
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Yep

241
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Why not to chill

242
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
PowerPoint

243
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Evil

244
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Remember this

245
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
They walked into a

246
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Divisive

247
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
Naruto

248
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
Your honor

249
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Okay

250
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,919
So yes my client murdered this purse

251
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,735
But he did we saw the evidence

252
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
He did fight back is he a victim

253
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
Obviously not

254
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
There is a

255
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Sickly

256
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
I can

257
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
What do you put in for theater is is

258
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,559
It essentially saying that they put themselves in the arena

259
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,655
It's just Alex's words more laps today

260
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,703
There was a sense that it's like alright

261
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,263
This is the guy who's taking direction from Alex

262
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
Trying to do something like a lawyer with Norm it really feels like all right

263
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:23,551
Swing is hard and in the direction Alex want

264
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,903
Hey and I'm going to use me words and tactics that I've learned in law school

265
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Yeah you know it's f***** up

266
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
It felt like

267
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
Rain always trying to transmute

268
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,095
Alex is b******* into something that you could

269
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Pass

270
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
In a courtroom

271
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,543
Enormous like you can put a powdered wig on Alex's bulshit

272
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,687
I say some b******* that's what's going to happen

273
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
That's not great

274
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
I think

275
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
That

276
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,575
This also is

277
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,415
Inappropriate for the damages portion which is obviously why we have

278
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,767
Some of these objections if he's ours is Chris Mattie the plaintiff

279
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Lawyer here is

280
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,119
Contesting this is an attempt to unravel the

281
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:14,751
Default judgment litigated in a place where it is inappropriate

282
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:19,103
It is a bit like non of your honesty he's a public figure

283
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
No

284
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,175
We're past that

285
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Yeah

286
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,527
Norm's continues to behave poorly after the sidebar

287
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
20 presidential

288
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
She never got it

289
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
Proper

290
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
That was

291
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,751
It is opening statement

292
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,567
Reservoir chinos like this is going to be bad

293
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,639
This whole thing is going to be bad

294
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
Based on Norms Behavior

295
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
He clearly knows that this isn't appropriate

296
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,295
And then

297
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
How many times did Iowa Jack

298
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:38,719
Kind of a response in open court is like this guy is unhappy

299
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,791
This could go any number of directions

300
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,399
As I described it to someone

301
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Feel safe

302
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:53,567
When I'm watching this threat to me personally but I feel unwell like I'm not in good hands

303
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,383
Yeah yeah there is

304
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
I appreciate

305
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
How willing

306
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,295
Everyone else in the courtroom is to abide by Lexi

307
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
Oh I can't wear shorts

308
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,903
You know like that kind of s*** and he's just walking out here like

309
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,719
You hear how many times I f****** objected

310
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,839
How about that s*** judge

311
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
To the judge it's

312
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:23,007
While I mean we'll talk about that a little bit more later but if you do on the second day he wasn't

313
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,079
Standing up to make objections till Friday

314
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,151
He had to be scolded about that which is

315
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,223
That is a huge disrespect to the Core

316
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:38,623
I think some of the core perceived your stuff is a little bit silly from the outside hilariously stupid

317
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,951
You've agreed to exist within this space

318
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,767
You are a lawyer you know the rules

319
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,071
What are the rules are

320
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
You respect the f***

321
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Can Court

322
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,799
Listen I'm on your team if you want to be like hey standing up two objectives f***

323
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,615
Stupid we're all sitting down here this is fine

324
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
If you want to argue that

325
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
I'm on your team

326
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
We're back

327
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:09,855
The time though you've already been in court for hours at a different setting I'm hearing that argument 100

328
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,415
Hey call about it

329
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Search

330
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:20,607
Too late now that it's bizarre the way we do this stuff and I'm not entirely sure why we do great

331
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:25,983
The waterslide you like maybe we should add water to this you're already halfway down bad

332
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
So he's been scolded

333
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
About the Hillary Clinton angle

334
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
Who tries another one

335
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
2000

336
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
He worried if you

337
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Deptford m

338
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
I mean it's just

339
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,335
You know I was texting you I'm like

340
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
You keep swinging

341
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
Yep know there's something to be said for persist

342
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
I don't think my parents

343
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
When I was a kid

344
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
Persistent about things

345
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:19,232
Like being able to stay out to ride my bike or something and I wouldn't get my way and my parents

346
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
Very much like

347
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
This is bad

348
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
You shouldn't do this

349
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
But

350
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
Persistence is a trait that may pay off in

351
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,104
I feel with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade like you lost this one today

352
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,224
Vacated let me put the Hat on you and you're still trying to get it back into the museum 20 years later I get it

353
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Yeah

354
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
In some contexts

355
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,624
Persistence is a very admirable trait

356
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
In this one

357
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
New

358
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:53,792
I mean why fast just on a like from what I've seen level

359
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
Because

360
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
At assert

361
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Points

362
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,448
You can only say one more time and you're done mr. pattice

363
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,800
Before I don't give a s*** anymore how many times you say one more time

364
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,848
Cuz we've got no one more time

365
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Literally every day

366
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Yeah that's

367
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
True I think

368
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
That's

369
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,296
The one more time maybe as a

370
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,320
I'm being serious

371
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Blackpink

372
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
I think

373
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Giving a lot of

374
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
WYD

375
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,488
Birth to this

376
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
I think that that is

377
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
Still appropriate

378
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Like

379
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
It's it I've made this point

380
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,216
Before in these circumstances like you don't want to

381
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
To do any

382
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
People have babies

383
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,592
You don't want to give them

384
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
The ability to

385
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,736
Credibly argue that they're being poorly treated and so I think

386
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,296
I think that kind of have to act that way

387
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
There is sucks

388
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:53,184
There is a certain amount of your watching Wylie Coyote run off the

389
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
The cliff

390
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,536
And he still being a dick and he still running

391
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,584
And you're like there's nothing beneath you

392
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
You got to stop running

393
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
But he just keeps running your like

394
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
I guess I'm not going to be the one to tell him

395
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:11,360
When the floor it doesn't exist but sooner or later the floor will not exist and he's going to fall a long way

396
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:15,712
Yeah I don't know I don't I don't see much floor here

397
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,600
I just there's just parts of this that I was like I don't know why he's saying these

398
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
At the end of the face

399
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
What exactly

400
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
The world is filled

401
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
Allison

402
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Liar Liar

403
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
When did flip

404
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,560
What is he even say

405
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
IR mean

406
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
There is a

407
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:09,472
First of all this very bizarre admission that he seems to be making there that is like

408
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,384
I ate you got to take it on face value that Alex has a liar like that losing a loved one hurts

409
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
That Alex is a liar

410
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,480
We know these things

411
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
Okay so that's great

412
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,064
Is this song up there

413
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
So

414
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Guess

415
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
Hard to

416
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,744
Come back from that and be like well Alex is actually

417
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
Dunno you serious and tell the truth

418
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,400
Try some how to save this which is

419
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,680
What he has.

420
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,264
There's no continuity here second thing is that

421
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
You know

422
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
Yeah

423
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Sticks and stones

424
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
Maybach price

425
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
That's good when someone's insulting

426
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,480
Right you know riseabove

427
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,320
The insults share whatever

428
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,136
I don't know me sing the Norms of

429
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
F****** child

430
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,952
Rise above it.

431
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
When your

432
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,280
Defaming somebody

433
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,120
And there is material harm that is done by Your Word

434
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,424
Osos no longer

435
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,008
I'd like the lies that Alex is telling I'm not Jeff Blake

436
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,568
Fun lies

437
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
Defamation law

438
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:25,248
If you do I mean words can never hurt you until you print them out in block letters

439
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,832
Out of a titanium that weigh 1,000 lb and then drop them on your head

440
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
Adventure

441
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,208
Just the words analyze or not

442
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,792
Necessarily the end-all-be-all of what this case is about

443
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,072
Right right

444
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,912
So that that's the other illusion that Norma's perpetuating

445
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:49,056
This this idea that Alex is just like questioning things the idea that it's just words and stuff

446
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:53,920
Is the attempt to unravel the default judgement

447
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,736
Deeply inappropriate

448
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
I mean

449
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
It is

450
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,672
A little bit I the result of the default judgement

451
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
But like

452
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
The default judgement

453
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Is a default judgement

454
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,608
Because all of the arguments that they would have made in court

455
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
Are essentially it admits of

456
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
And they're still trying to make

457
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
Those argument

458
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,776
And you can't say

459
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,592
You guys don't get to say anything now

460
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
Because you lost

461
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
You can't say that I mean as you said you know

462
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:31,040
Giving them a wide berth is a reasonable thing to do

463
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
But yeah

464
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,368
Listening to his opening argument I was sitting there going like

465
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904
Technically you can't say that

466
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
Michael you can't say that

467
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,768
Technically you can't say that you know just checking it off the list

468
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Yep

469
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,096
What you going to do persistence pays off

470
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
I guess

471
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,960
Well that is long as those checks from Free Speech systems

472
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,032
Exactly as they do that

473
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
So this I took

474
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
Particular issue with

475
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
Another book

476
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
Injection Ian

477
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
You're welcome

478
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Worries

479
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
The trails

480
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
Did Hillary

481
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
Shut off

482
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Regard regard

483
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:12,416
An interesting tack that Norm is trying here because he's essentially arguing that Alex has simultaneously real

484
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,720
Serious and important in on the right

485
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,792
Track but he's also a raving madman who you should just ignore

486
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:24,448
At first glance this seems like a message message at Alex shouldn't endorse but if you think about it a little more you can see

487
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,008
This is exactly the kind of ambiguity

488
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,592
The cultivated about himself in official Circle

489
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
For his audience

490
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
You serious all the time

491
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
And all that

492
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
Stuff about Chemtrails and s*** is

493
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,552
Very much sincere and real

494
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,856
The rest of us and in a courtroom

495
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
That isn't going to fly

496
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,440
A different tactic needs to be employed

497
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,560
And it's bit sometimes he serious and sometimes you should just write off what he saying is crazy

498
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:57,472
It's a perfect evade any responsibility for anything you say but simultaneously allow yourself to feel like a big boy

499
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,776
Hero about things you want to be taken seriously

500
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Shreveport

501
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:07,200
There's an uncertainty about whether or not any particular thing Alex says should be taken seriously and that works really well

502
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
In this

503
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:17,952
Take that deadly seriously and recognize that Alex was way ahead of the curve on that is essentially a profit

504
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,072
Claiming that murdered children's family members are actors and the whole thing didn't really even happen

505
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,888
Come on he's crazy you can't take what he's saying seriously

506
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,960
You can see how this game but Norma's playing works

507
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,240
Very transparent

508
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,288
I don't want to take this one step further

509
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,944
I do think that the things that Norm is listening off as the crazy stuff Alex says that you should discount as the ravings of a Madman

510
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
Are things that you should absolutely take seriously

511
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,088
Alex isn't someone at a street corner is Norma wants to

512
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Implied

513
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,160
Talking to himself about outlandish theories

514
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,464
How does a multi-millionaire business

515
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,072
Is Miami's greater career out of disseminating these outlandish theories to masses of people

516
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,912
He's not the one on a street corner he's a demagogue with International reach

517
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,984
And the Ravens that are just supposed to be ignored

518
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,104
Those are things that is audience or supposed to know that Alex's lawyer would describe that way in

519
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,176
Court these are very serious very real

520
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:14,016
Completely documented conspiracies that are aimed at killing you and your family

521
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,856
This isn't up for debate on Alex's show but mysteriously

522
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,696
When you're a formal setting surrounded by people who aren't indoctrinated into the full

523
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:26,816
These are examples of things that Alex says that prove you shouldn't take what he says seriously

524
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,608
The ludicrousness of the thing

525
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
Things Alex says is used as a defense

526
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,448
Against him taking responsibility

527
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
For the real-world damage

528
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,824
Causes and I think that is something to take very seriously

529
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,152
Even beyond that the thing is Norm is listing offer

530
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,200
F***** up conspiracy theory

531
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
Many of which have their roots

532
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,272
Anti-semitic trope sarmista

533
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,136
Leah the eating of children and drinking their blood is A holdover from the blood libel

534
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:57,792
Many of the conspiracies about poisoning the water in the air hearken back to well poisoning accusations about Jewish people intentional

535
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
Please brighten the body

536
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
Plague

537
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,400
Leaving aside these bigoted route to this talking point

538
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,728
They're just very serious dangers in the way that

539
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Anon

540
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,544
Insignificant number of people and

541
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,944
Some elected officials are using pedophilia accusations to rile up their followers into a state where there

542
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
Causing real damage to people

543
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,552
Primarily aimed at members of the lgbtq community

544
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
Even if we

545
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,904
We aren't supposed to take Alex's theories themselves seriously

546
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,024
If we responsible members of the public we do need to take the reason they're being spread

547
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,792
Seriously

548
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:35,936
We need to take the impact that they have seriously and the game Norm is playing here is an attempt to run cover for that

549
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,520
I'm pretty sure he knows what he

550
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824
He's doing cuz he's a piece of s***

551
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,128
Fisher-Price ball bat sticks and stones

552
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Make it balance

553
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
Dark yeah

554
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
I feel I feel like

555
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,552
We like watching this

556
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
Like

557
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:59,744
You know we've discussed in the pastor that the world got lucky that we haven't become

558
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,280
Right-wing Nut Job

559
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:07,680
On account of you know we went I

560
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:12,544
Failure of the time you know

561
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,360
That is that is right for becoming a right-wing s***

562
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
That kind of thing

563
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
But

564
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
If I were

565
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,968
Were one of those

566
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,272
Then my legal strategy would be

567
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
F*** it

568
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Every

569
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
Nothing I say is crazy

570
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
Everything

571
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
And then I go into it in court and be like

572
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
Why would you be racing

573
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:37,632
I do not see that there's no genetic-based like I would go ham on everything I've ever said and be like sea

574
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:43,264
Look at how silly it is that people believe any of this s*** and then go on air and be like

575
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
I didn't mean any of that

576
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,104
Nobody cares

577
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
Nobody cares

578
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
It's yeah it's

579
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
It is a little bit

580
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:59,136
It's a bit strange that there is like the rails for them where they're like I won't come out in

581
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:05,536
And say that hating gunman you hating like anti-gun she stupid

582
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,096
Also they don't want to blow up their game

583
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:14,752
I think the problem is that you're imagining a situation where you don't have like an elaborate business to protect

584
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,848
If you could do that in your hypothetical scenario where there isn't like

585
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
A warehouse full of pills

586
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,760
For me it would also be like oh I see the writing

587
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:31,904
This business is not going to be mine for that much longer so I might as well get me taken care of

588
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:37,536
Cuz I'm a right-wing psychopath s******* like these people are just aren't smart I honestly think that

589
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
The more you talk tomorrow

590
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
Realize you wouldn't cut it

591
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,424
I really would

592
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,752
Accepted into the circle

593
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,288
Is

594
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:53,152
Cut the kind of chaotic energy they don't want around your house

595
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,784
Hey I am the Joker I'll burn the bottom half of the money

596
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
Yes

597
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,880
Listening to Norm's s***

598
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
For now

599
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,720
But we were going to jump in here on the 13th

600
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,744
Alex's

601
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
It starts often

602
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,632
Maybe I was feeling too picky

603
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
That kind of data yeah

604
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,008
Everybody knows about the frog in the Boiling Pot of water

605
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
Analogy

606
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
It's actually

607
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,152
Louisiana Mississippi

608
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Like to eat

609
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,224
The crawdads in there

610
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,504
Bullfrogs

611
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,112
Well sometimes they just throw the whole frog

612
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
In The Boiling Pot

613
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,256
Maybe throw one in the boiling water he'll just jump right out

614
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,584
Water

615
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,936
Turn the heat up slow he thinks it's a hot tub at first and then

616
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,080
America and the world is right

617
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,384
We're in the middle of the New World Order

618
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,408
This isn't true

619
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,736
Frogs don't just sit in water as you turn up the heat

620
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,296
People have conducted tests on this and its really can

621
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:07,136
Consistent 30 frogs have a way to get out of the water as it gets hotter they do

622
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,208
Also they don't just magically jumped out of boiling water

623
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,792
Also there are less people conducting this test for obvious

624
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,584
Humane Animal treatment reasons

625
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,888
Biologists have discussed the Prospect and it's

626
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:24,032
Pretty clear that you know frog being thrown into boiling water would just be burned immediately by the scalding water

627
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
Headache try to escape but probably die

628
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,384
Yeah even if it made it out of the boiling water

629
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,688
Probably circum to injuries

630
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,016
Prom viburnums

631
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:40,672
Barely get back out of boiling water

632
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,464
Response

633
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,144
This is a fun analogy for Alex to make because he comes from the school of anti-communism that he was all social Prague

634
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,496
Grass is the incremental change that is the metaphorical temperature of the Water Rising

635
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:00,896
It's all kind of a fantasy though and the real metaphor is that the rising temperature of this particular water

636
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,736
His Eye Is killing off Alex's ability to live in a society that caters

637
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,784
Solely to the needs of straight white Christian

638
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
The metaphor understood appropriate

639
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Yeah

640
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,512
Yeah I hate I do I do appreciate he has a what would I say and almost

641
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,584
Fermental commit

642
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,680
Back to taking any down-home country aphorism and being like

643
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:30,080
And that's 100% true yeah you know Hugo Outback you catalog and then you're going to break your leg

644
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:36,480
That's 100% true if he comes from the old country

645
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
Ironically

646
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:44,672
The phenomenon that's described by this boiling frog analogy actually kind of does apply to our Collective response

647
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
What's climate change

648
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:52,352
And that scenario we are all frogs trapped in this pot and Alex has a frog yelling at all of us at the water is not getting any hotter and

649
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
In the globalist

650
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
Does pushing that idea

651
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,192
To get us to give up our frog guns

652
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,496
Senpai frog taxes

653
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
So

654
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,592
I just got out I just got an image of like a giant

655
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,128
Gumbo Pot with

656
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,200
Like 20 frogs on either side of it armed to the

657
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
The teeth playing a game

658
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,272
The chess that kind of that kind

659
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,808
To feel sure

660
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:18,720
And this is one who's just yelling at them the water's fine

661
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,512
So

662
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,072
Maybe a little nitpicky but I was bored

663
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,864
Anyway Alex has a big nose

664
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,424
And that's where we are as a culture

665
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,496
As a civilization

666
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,776
The culture War

667
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,616
Tucker Carlson talked last night about the horrible next level

668
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Deception

669
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,432
Censorship

670
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
That is taking place

671
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,016
Master of Lies

672
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
The New York Times

673
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
Okay

674
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,440
Dishonest is the New York

675
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,328
Any idea what this is about

676
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,168
Do you want to guess what this is about God I don't know

677
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,448
I hate okay

678
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,520
New York time

679
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,104
The New York Times must have published I don't know maybe

680
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,688
Maybe Aaron judges 57th homerun wouldn't have gone out

681
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,248
Interesting

682
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
What C

683
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
How drunk was the

684
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,928
How angry is Hillary Clinton

685
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
Have her husband

686
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,232
What

687
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
Caucasus is very

688
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Extremely

689
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,096
Is hard to put in

690
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
Towards

691
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,192
Describing the dishonesty of the New York Times

692
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
Sample

693
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Connecticut tells you more

694
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
Paper towel

695
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
Set the best-selling book

696
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
United States

697
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,688
The titles called my mom died

698
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
Buy a child

699
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
Best-selling book

700
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
In America inside

701
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,720
Showing book in America last week with my God

702
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
Oh my God

703
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,144
I never of predictive it out of here

704
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,544
He's whining like Alex about Alex on his show and Alex's playing Tucker walking

705
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
Fuct

706
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
So one thing we should just

707
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:17,504
Get clear before I get into any of this is it for over a decade and probably way longer than that people have been a big can

708
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,552
Confused about how bestseller list work

709
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,344
There is not well

710
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,696
Really precise science doing any different publication

711
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,976
Guilty different listings

712
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
Because they use different metric

713
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,424
I went to check the New York Times list and sure enough I'm glad my mom died is the number one but if there's some kind of

714
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,216
Weird systemic bias

715
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
On this list

716
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:42,080
I don't have Jared kushner's book breaking history is coming in a number

717
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
Free

718
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,384
3rd week on the list

719
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,152
Seamstress

720
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
What about number 30

721
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,528
Team on the list of being a book battle for the American mind

722
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,088
By Peter gexas and David

723
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
Which is described as quote

724
00:39:55,392 --> 00:40:00,256
Fox and Friends Weekend hosts makes his case for what he calls a classical Christian education

725
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,560
Time to just say no

726
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,328
Thank you to that

727
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,632
If they're just manipulating their s***

728
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:11,008
Inclusions I just don't believe for a second that there's like a systematic bias against Alex's book

729
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
No course not

730
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,104
There's one factor that I think is working against al

731
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
Alex and that is

732
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,248
Pain of his books are being purchased directly from his website at a giant marker

733
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:26,624
Stop playing quite a bit about how he has to sign them all before shipping them out

734
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,696
What is Wednesday show he said that he sold 14,000

735
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,976
Copies on his own web

736
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,048
Tri-C purchases through Infowars wouldn't

737
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,120
Confirm purchases the times of factored into the rankings

738
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:40,448
Partially because Infowars store doesn't report sales data to the

739
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,264
The time

740
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,592
This is a major part of how the time to make their lips

741
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,664
From their website about the list methodology

742
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:54,016
Quote rankings reflect unit sales reported on a confidential basis

743
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,368
By vendors offering a wide range of general interest titles published in the United States

744
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,024
Every week that wasn't the diverse selling locations report their actual sales on hundreds of thousands of individual Tire

745
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:11,936
The panel of reporting retailers is comprehensive and reflect sales in tens of thousands of stores of all sizes

746
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,960
And demographics

747
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,240
Across the United States

748
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,336
So you know they have like some smaller

749
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,664
Operators of smaller bookstores some chains

750
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,200
Amazon course

751
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,248
And so they have these

752
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,784
To get a sampling of

753
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,112
Where books are sold

754
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,672
This is where Alex is probably hurting

755
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,768
I would guess that he doesn't have like really great distribution for this book

756
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,328
Probably not being carried in many stores

757
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,632
You got his own website and Amazon

758
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,984
Buying is done online picture that is often

759
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
Ignored

760
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,056
Alex's book is currently number five

761
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,616
On Amazon's top seller list

762
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
That's just

763
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:56,223
Based on purchases so it's a little more straightforward in terms of ranking

764
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:02,879
Incidentally number four on that list is I'm glad my mom died so he's not beating Jeanette they are either

765
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
Also number two is

766
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,511
Cookbook written by Steve Doocy and his wife so really.

767
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,303
Why isn't the New York Times charts

768
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,631
Steve Doocy up there everyone should be asking

769
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,679
King is why try to write well

770
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
Why

771
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,751
It looked the point is the Tuckers not making a

772
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,031
Listen to your argument

773
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
No absolutely no

774
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
Also

775
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,943
Please remember this is apparently the top story on Alex's show the day his trial in Connecticut is beginning

776
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
As this episodes airing Norma's in court

777
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:36,671
Like anybody's Book Sales in the New York Times snubbing him well for his doing his disgraceful bulshit

778
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,487
Oh no that's all in character and s***

779
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
You know like

780
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
F******

781
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:47,935
Tucker Carlson is going on National to little degrading TV

782
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,495
New York Times

783
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,775
I mean that

784
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
Painful

785
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,383
You're the most important man in the world

786
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:02,783
It's a little other that is why he's the most important man in the world

787
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,343
Stryker gets into the numbers

788
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,463
56000 copies of his book last

789
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,511
Whatever

790
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,583
34000

791
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
86 copies

792
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,055
Look in the country

793
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,407
Tucker's number for McCurdy's book is pretty specific

794
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,967
EXO is pretty simple to track that down check

795
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:36,831
This is from the Publishers Weekly list of top hardcover front list nonfiction

796
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:42,463
On that list McCurdy is number one with 30 4686 units sold

797
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,999
And Alex's number

798
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:48,863
2 with 30649 with 50

799
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,399
54 something thousand

800
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
No

801
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,823
Number of book sold from Alex

802
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,103
The several thousand copies

803
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,199
Please that he signed I'm guessing that he took the number of McCurdy's book sold from Alex

804
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:08,063
Stew because it cited in a bunch of Infowars articles about how the times is Shadow Banning Alex share

805
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,855
What's this

806
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:14,207
Books don't only come in hardcover and nonfiction that doesn't sound true

807
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:18,047
On the overall list from Publishers Weekly and McCurdy's book is at number 7

808
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
With four of the

809
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,375
Top 6 books being by Colleen

810
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,143
Hoover

811
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,935
I was just leaving on the top 10

812
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
Bipolar

813
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
Brutal

814
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:32,127
If Alex really wants to make sure that all is right in the universe and make sure that the book that sold the most copies as number one

815
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:36,991
Adult romance novel

816
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,271
Should be at number one

817
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,807
Not McCurdy

818
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
Yeah

819
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:43,903
He's not doing that because he doesn't actually care about other times Alyssa's

820
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,279
Compile this is just about him taking his own Petty grievance and insecurities about feeling left out

821
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,583
A pretending it actually reveals a political

822
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
Four point

823
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,679
You also very clearly sees the potential this has is awaited

824
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
Drive sales

825
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,007
I have the article on Infowars says quote

826
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:03,615
The New York Times excluded Alex Jones as the great reset from its rightful place on the list

827
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,407
It's time to end the censorship

828
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,711
Put conservative voices for bestseller list

829
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,807
That articles maybe 700 words long and it includes

830
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:16,671
6 hyperlinks to the Amazon page to buy Alex's.

831
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:23,071
Also I should know that the book is 36% off its original price like a week into its release

832
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,863
Which definitely doesn't scream

833
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,983
We fleeced people on pre-orders and now we're trying to sell off the rest of these books at a cut-rate

834
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,775
Play don't fill up the warehouse

835
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
Alex did well

836
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,359
He cashed in a bit on a book

837
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:40,735
HP proud of himself returning his incoherent something thousand books

838
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
But this whole thing is a bit

839
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,063
Really pathetic

840
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,855
For Tucker to be jumping in a basically doing

841
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:50,975
Based on an Infowars article about how the cool kids at the Times aren't letting Alex sit at the table

842
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,511
Yeah it's a little bit

843
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,815
Yeah yeah

844
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,863
And not just that but like wow

845
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,423
Only 50,000

846
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,959
Inbox

847
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
Like the biggest

848
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:08,383
That's the biggest book in America is 50,000

849
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,223
Rough it does go to show the numbers of book

850
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,551
Soldar lower a lot of the time than you think

851
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,855
Yeah but then the second thing it goes to

852
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,879
To show you is

853
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,927
Look up

854
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:24,511
It's great like if you were to sell 50,000 books

855
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
I would say

856
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,559
Amazing

857
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,607
Yeah that's awesome congratulations bro

858
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:32,447
If Alex is selling 50000 book that's not good

859
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
No

860
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,495
I was because

861
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,311
It's because of who he presents himself as

862
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,919
He's the biggest thing in the world is the number one media source is the Howard Stern of Truth

863
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,199
Absolutely

864
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,271
The Patriots in the CIA and the FBI and all this s***

865
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,575
World

866
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:54,975
Friends with all the most powerful people bolsonaro listens to his show everyday bright now that he doesn't want to directly associated

867
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:59,583
What's up with Putin listening to show all the time. It's much easier for him

868
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,167
50000 is like this is sad bro

869
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,703
No I think I think

870
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,287
Overall I think I had in the first two weeks like

871
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,615
10000 downloads which to me was

872
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,895
Approximately book

873
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,687
A hundred percent of our audio

874
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,711
You know like

875
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,295
That's the best conversion rate we can get that kind of vague

876
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:24,415
That's amazing it's not I don't have Billy I don't have a hundred million dollars in my back

877
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:30,815
It's good it's good for you and what you are great for reports to be

878
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,351
A bat

879
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,167
Also like you saying that 14,000

880
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,727
No sales through his

881
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,495
His website

882
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:42,591
He's selling something and I'm just giving something away

883
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,615
But

884
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,151
The number of button

885
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:53,599
Like if we're just talkin about straight-up response rate number doesn't look so impressive

886
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:57,183
If you look at my inbox true but

887
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:00,255
What about that Faraway necessarily

888
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,559
Tempe free Bryson

889
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,631
That's a variable

890
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,983
Anyway this whole thing is really yummy do know why he's doing this

891
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,031
And the bandwidth

892
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,359
Hundred thousand dollars a month

893
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:21,759
And the more popular we get with our own platform the more money I got to pay so I'm not bitching and complaining

894
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:30,463
Zeitgeist we are in the pole position we are winning we are hurting them we are inspiring Liberty movements worldwide

895
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,487
That means you are

896
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,535
But I need funds

897
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,815
Quite frankly

898
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,887
Find the books in the message it's the Death Star plans

899
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:44,543
Cam

900
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,151
Some money

901
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,735
What's this song

902
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,039
Green fiber capsules the highest-quality

903
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:58,367
Everyone loves green fiber capsules

904
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,439
Really even though

905
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:04,255
The playing of the Tucker peace

906
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Sales

907
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,095
Whole beginning of the show is just saying

908
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
It's

909
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:16,543
Sad saying that if it was like

910
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,567
These swords

911
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,615
Are the best swords we have on the market

912
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,639
Actually know what

913
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,919
Play clip

914
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,455
Of somebody saying these swords

915
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,807
And then we'll talk about it because these doors are so f****** great

916
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
Yeah

917
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,695
So there's big news

918
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
He's done his peace

919
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
Bacon

920
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,911
Inflation's off the hook

921
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,215
Business sales

922
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,519
Across the border down

923
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,823
Stagflation

924
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,855
Football games all this crap

925
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,903
Please set aside some money

926
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
Bankruptcy

927
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,327
Continue on or this shuts down

928
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,119
And we are barely profitable

929
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,679
Able to show we're profitable

930
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:21,567
Those forward in just six weeks

931
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,711
So we're going to talk about this towards the end of the episode does Alex

932
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:34,111
Like it's a little bit more clear about this chat the way he's talking about his bankruptcy leads me to believe that he might be trying

933
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,159
Trying to defraud the bankruptcy court

934
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:42,559
And he might be discussing this plan on are in a way that is

935
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
Hello flagrant

936
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,655
NADA hide in plain sight

937
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,959
Do your crimes on the radio

938
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,055
Inflation is on fleek

939
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,615
Stagflation

940
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,943
That's in Britain that's what you do before you get married

941
00:50:59,455 --> 00:50:59,967
Haversack

942
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,551
I need more money stuff

943
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,087
Sheriff keeps trying to

944
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,903
Pick me with this I'm going to get to the news thing

945
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,183
I like that

946
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:12,255
He played the Tucker clip as a way to sell his book

947
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
But the whip

948
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,327
He sold his book as a way to

949
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,703
To sell something this has a higher profit margin by saying don't buy my book

950
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,983
It's

951
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
It's a sale within a cell

952
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,895
So we actually do get some news on that this isn't a baton

953
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:35,807
We have them

954
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
And the good news is

955
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,511
Unjustifiable

956
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,863
John Hopkins go public with a major study

957
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,959
Shots 28 X

958
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,079
Worse than the virus

959
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
Okay

960
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,919
How would you do 98

961
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:05,759
I don't know

962
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:09,599
Substack

963
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:15,999
We kept this little gem for himself second smartest guy in

964
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,023
In the world which is pretty

965
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Pretty cool

966
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,815
Guessing first place

967
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:25,215
Isn't his twin brother still Ben Stein

968
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
You still up

969
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,031
You was

970
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:32,639
Yeah see what what a weird what a weird life we've all had that show

971
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:40,063
To that's the weirdest part about it I have neutral feelings but Jimmy Kimmel now a negative

972
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,719
Of all the co-hosts Jimmy Kimmel has had

973
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,023
Never have made it past

974
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:55,423
What how many years talk about the Iceman 12

975
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
He likes

976
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,471
You're a good person

977
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:04,383
Person question who's worse benstein or a Syrah Cola

978
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:10,271
Probably Adams worst movie

979
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:14,623
I actually enjoyed the hammer when I was younger but I don't want to revisit it that's fair

980
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
The question

981
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,999
Is definitely answered

982
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,791
With Adam and here's why

983
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
He fell

984
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:29,983
Like there was rude you know you had a feeling that he was somebody who was being helpful

985
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,263
He was very funny

986
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:37,919
Maybe again I don't go back and revisit it about it but then to now off terrible

987
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:44,319
Was speechwriter for Nixon

988
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,367
Bueller

989
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,207
That's what that's not enough for me currently it is

990
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
Jim hoft

991
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:00,703
So this is as always what they're talking about is a preprint article that's being reported on by a covid denial propaganda

992
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,263
So this isn't even really getting my eyebrows raised

993
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,055
Skipping freon

994
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079
Kind of thing

995
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:12,735
Absolutely did not read this study it's 50 pages long and he doesn't even sound like you read the title

996
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
Jim hoft

997
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,807
Blog before cold reading it on air

998
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,855
You just making up what he thinks he's reading

999
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:24,255
To the study itself is a cost-benefit analysis of mandating booster shots for people under 40 particular

1000
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,023
Early in the contacts

1001
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:25,791
Text of college

1002
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:32,959
The argument is that these mandates may not have heard that many hospitalizations and I can see where that may may

1003
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
Make some sense

1004
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:40,639
I think that would be very reasonable if people under 40 of people over 40 never came into contact with each other but seeing as we all

1005
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,663
Intermingle

1006
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:47,807
And vaccines are a community-level solution to a problem not an individual level one I have some issues with the

1007
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,343
It is the very idea of

1008
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,159
That being said Hawks headline is b*******

1009
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
The study did

1010
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:57,279
Say the directions are 98 times worse than the virus is Alex's work

1011
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:04,191
That number 98 is used in the paper is the high-end estimate of the number of serious Adverse Events you might expect

1012
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:08,543
Seeing hypothetical College of 30,000 students were all given the Boost

1013
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,615
Also the paper hasn't been peer-reviewed so their numbers

1014
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
Methodology might be

1015
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,663
We suspect

1016
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
Play self-reported

1017
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,759
I mean hypothetical University

1018
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
Who knows

1019
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:23,903
In this covid time preprint articles have like just math

1020
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,951
Problems

1021
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:29,023
Calculated wrong I don't know what to do with it

1022
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:29,791
Yeah

1023
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
Let's get that

1024
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:34,399
Peer reporting in World talk

1025
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,167
How do you

1026
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
Claim that

1027
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,983
Without having some

1028
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,799
Concept of what it is that is 98 time

1029
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,359
You know Snyder times worse

1030
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,687
Mathematically how

1031
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,991
Like Okay so covid

1032
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,807
This is one covid

1033
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,879
Is 98 covid

1034
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,927
But I don't know what that be

1035
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:00,767
It's like a Nicholas Shay of danger 98

1036
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
Worst cops

1037
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,095
Every cough

1038
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:07,167
98 Topps 98 cost

1039
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,359
So anyway Alex is the leader of the resistance

1040
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,199
We are the American resistance

1041
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,295
Pleasure

1042
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,879
Glisters a bat

1043
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,671
Your commissioning of this operation

1044
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,695
Vicious

1045
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,999
This is the Platinum standard

1046
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,791
This is it right here

1047
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,839
I don't know that

1048
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,143
Don't think it isn't a giant weight on me

1049
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,215
If you could

1050
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:42,751
Temporary

1051
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,079
Remind

1052
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,151
Obviously of course America is

1053
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,759
Resistance in America is coming out of a place like that

1054
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,599
It's the way the world still is

1055
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,647
Texas coast

1056
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,439
Crocodiles

1057
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,463
So goes the world

1058
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,743
Who said that

1059
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,279
The Eisenhower

1060
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,815
When was first elected president

1061
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,727
I looked it up did you look it up

1062
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:20,127
Eisenhower won the 1952 election but he was inaugurated in January 1953

1063
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,943
This court does not appear in that inaugural

1064
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,759
Speech speech ever gave cuz it's

1065
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
Not good

1066
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,391
I believe if I had to guess Alex's misremembering this line from that

1067
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:36,255
Whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first

1068
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,047
Come to pass in the heart of America

1069
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:44,959
You can interpret that as being like the Heartland and Alex might think that's Texas or just the Texas is the heart of America either

1070
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,263
That's as close As It Gets in this

1071
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,543
Incidentally

1072
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:54,943
In that speech Eisenhower also lays out 9 basic principles that is Administration would be guided by in terms of achieving

1073
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:01,343
Let's hear those one of them is quote respecting the United Nations as the Living sign of all people

1074
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,367
Hope For Peace

1075
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:05,183
We shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent

1076
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,719
Simple but effective for

1077
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:13,119
That doesn't sound true seems like Alex would think that this is a dirty globalist speech

1078
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
Yeah

1079
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
You just get your just never going to get over

1080
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,239
Quote not going to happen

1081
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,543
No because in order to get a real quote

1082
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,079
You would actually have to go look

1083
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:22,847
For it

1084
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,663
Or learn about it or read it in a book

1085
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:33,343
Even Q eyes book of General quotes or whatever it was whatever they really said

1086
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,135
Some of those were fake as s***

1087
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
What you don't know

1088
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,951
You don't know about quote

1089
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:38,975
Yeah

1090
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:45,631
The what is I can't remember exactly what state it always was

1091
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,703
Azaman

1092
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:54,079
Goes so goes the Country

1093
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:57,151
IMM Thursday's expressions

1094
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,455
I like the Electoral College

1095
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:04,575
Yeah yeah yeah size Iowa does yeah yeah that way

1096
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,367
Kind of framing has been used

1097
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,647
About a number of states

1098
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,951
It's over the course of our our

1099
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,743
This thing

1100
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
In terms of Eisenhower's in Ark

1101
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:18,911
Colony of the Carolinas goes so goes the 13

1102
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:22,495
So here's where I wanted to throw my hands up and just say I quit

1103
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:28,383
Tucker Carlson the massively spending

1104
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,455
Department attack

1105
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:36,319
All every major national Trump supporter including Infowars

1106
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,879
Shocks the conscience

1107
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,415
Everyone who sees it

1108
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,743
This should just be a Tucker Carlson recap show

1109
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,303
Like it's just he's running a rerun of Tucker Carlson

1110
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,839
This is nonsense

1111
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
Why

1112
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,655
Why are we why does this

1113
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,471
I mean it's

1114
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,543
Yeah it's national news show

1115
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,335
Set wind for me

1116
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:03,199
So I'm going to dedicate my entire broadcast to rebroadcast convention

1117
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,991
Tucker segment

1118
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,527
Much

1119
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,599
Anyway Eddie Bravo side Alex

1120
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:14,207
Sure that's a thing that we should say today

1121
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:16,511
That's it out loud thing that should exist

1122
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:21,375
Silence is reporting on this Instagram video that I'm reporting

1123
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,191
It was just a light person but that's the most important people

1124
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,007
Hundred thousands of years on

1125
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:27,775
Instagram

1126
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,919
Astrologist ashamed economy should I plug

1127
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,991
Astrologist Shinigami implodes

1128
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,295
All the stars

1129
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,927
Why not

1130
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,487
The globalist saying they would do this but

1131
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,023
They do a good listing

1132
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,559
Of some of the top back

1133
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,887
Just canceled going out giving shows the next

1134
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,215
Is 56 days out from the election

1135
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,495
They're planning false flag

1136
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:04,895
Alex is a lot of nerve talking down on astrologers and he gets his information from prophetic dreams he's had envisioned

1137
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,175
Brought on by Chicken Fried

1138
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:11,039
But those were sent by God not the Stars that's stupid

1139
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,343
So this Instagram video that

1140
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:19,999
Eddie Santa Alex has to do with like a bunch of musicians cancelling tours and stay

1141
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:26,143
And it's like it's because they know that something's going to happen like a false flag terrorism concert

1142
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:32,543
Frank is going to be another coronavirus lockdown or something I don't know

1143
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,823
He has any Chosen One

1144
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:37,663
So I found this video that's laying out there

1145
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:40,223
Conspiracy

1146
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,503
Cancelled events to make

1147
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,039
The point that a lot of stuff

1148
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:43,807
Getting canceled

1149
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:50,719
First is the Weezer Broadway residency which of the headline that they showed says quote

1150
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,743
Low ticket sales

1151
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:58,399
So I don't know maybe it's not a surprise that Weezer on Broadway as not a hotdog Broadway

1152
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
Bright

1153
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,543
The next is about Luke Combs canceling a single concert because he had problems with his voice

1154
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,567
I don't know

1155
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
That happened

1156
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,407
Shawn Mendes

1157
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,711
Canceling a tour to take personal time

1158
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,271
I've no idea who Shawn Mendes is good for him

1159
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,807
After that is quote

1160
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:22,207
Carlos Santana cancel Six concerts as he continues to recover

1161
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:25,791
4 years old Nick collapsed on stage in July while performing in Michigan

1162
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,839
Rob Thomas okay

1163
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,679
Assembly

1164
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:37,055
Like when when atoms become entangled I assumed that the how the what happened after smooth

1165
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:46,015
Well I mean like when Carlos Santana collapsed onstage Rob Thomas said I'd give my world to lift you up

1166
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:49,599
Pick you back up off the stage chair that does make sense

1167
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:54,719
He was away though it has stood up in a middle of a restaurant

1168
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:59,071
And started singing that and then somewhere off in the long-distance

1169
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,375
Everlast is pissed off that

1170
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:07,775
Put your lights on

1171
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,567
My bad boy

1172
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
Skip song

1173
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,383
I think sure and don't Revisited

1174
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,199
So that is another never heard of

1175
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,479
The canceled

1176
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:21,343
Fighters cancel all tour dates after drummer Taylor Hawkins

1177
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,367
Death

1178
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:26,463
None of these cancellations seems suspicious at all they're all

1179
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:32,607
Pretty well understood we are ticket sales weren't going well Carlos Santana is old and collapse.

1180
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:36,959
What guy canceled what got there cuz he had a voice issue and then

1181
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,751
The drummer of their band.

1182
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:45,151
Man did you see you didn't I assume you didn't see the the tribute concert his son playing the

1183
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,575
Not a

1184
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,343
Super

1185
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,111
Easy song

1186
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,671
DriveWise got it you got to have the string

1187
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:02,047
Like to hit yeah you got to have the strength to hit on those and Euclid

1188
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:02,815
The Poise

1189
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,887
To be able to perform the path at all

1190
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
Let alone

1191
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,703
Free Foo Fighters

1192
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:15,103
This crowd for your dad's got a lot of pressure it's rolls eyes

1193
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,711
Does you play the drum solo that he wrote it's very impressive

1194
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:25,855
Do to be able to be on that stage enough freak out yeah

1195
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,391
I would be ready for it

1196
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,415
Nope nope

1197
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,951
Weeping

1198
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:35,071
I think it's 60 I might have done a musical or a play at my school in it

1199
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,095
Freak

1200
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,399
Anyway

1201
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:44,799
Honestly this is some of the stupidest most early 2000s conspiracy message bored as shyt

1202
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:48,383
Eddie Bravo tipped him off on this one

1203
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:55,039
Fingers crossed that we get to see Tucker dual segment about it next week and then Alex can cover Tucker covering it like honestly

1204
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
Between

1205
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,087
Playing

1206
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,111
Multiple Tucker

1207
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,903
Segments and on this b*******

1208
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,231
I felt so embarrassed that this is the show we do

1209
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:09,631
I feel embarrassed that this is the world we live in

1210
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,655
Aaron the funny timer

1211
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,959
This is turned into just like a water we

1212
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
We doing here

1213
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
Very stupid

1214
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:19,871
Yeah everybody's making choices actively against their own

1215
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:22,687
This is the part where I want to say

1216
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,015
When I when I say going back to the past

1217
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:29,599
Is more interesting for me there's more to do

1218
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:33,183
A lot of it is because Alex is doing this like Tucker segments

1219
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:39,839
The covid conspiracy of the day that I from so dumb asses sub stackshare and then Eddie Bravo sent me a

1220
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:43,679
F****** Instagram video about some b*******

1221
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,703
Skype

1222
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:48,287

Totally

1224
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,407
Dumb nonsense that I see people post that got like

1225
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,479
100,000 views on Tik-Tok I don't think it's that hard

1226
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,015
It might not be that hard

1227
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,063
I don't know

1228
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
Anyway

1229
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,647
Alex is selling lots of books

1230
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,207
And that money is going straight back into the show baby

1231
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,487
Also the other coin

1232
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:08,767

Lawsuits

1239
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,151
The trials the attack

01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:29,247
Fall the appeal should make $80,000

1241
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,295
For years and keep this operation going

1242

I would like to see all of my business

1254
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,831
It's done quickly

1255
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,623
Slowly

1256
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,999
I love to but he was like alright we're doing this series of four coins

1257
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,815
Cisco before coins

Also hey I got a fifth

1259
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:22,751
I remember when Batman Forever Came Out

1260
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,287
You could get these mugs

1261
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:30,687
From McDonald's or whatever is Frosty

1262
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,711
I tried to get all of them

1263
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,247
I tried to get all of them

1264
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:37,343
You know what I feel like those are worth as much now is that coin will be later

1265
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,647
Right now I mean it is over price

1266
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,303
So lucky take some calls

1267
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,839
I don't care they're dumb

1268
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,119
Boring

1269
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,655
So let's go to the fort

1270
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,447
Another

1271
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,215
Covid-19

1272
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,007
Conspiracy of the day story

1273
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,823
Water broadcast you got lined up

1274
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:03,199
Headline up on screen it tells you

1275
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:03,967
All

1276
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,783
Global bombshell

1277
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:17,023
Confirmed covid vaccine causing a massive side effects and death

1278
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:21,375
Top stories not going to show trial in Connecticut

1279
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,423
All the fraud that's going on up there

1280
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,175
Is the proof of the premeditated

1281
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:38,783
Global un wef big Pharma directed mass murder

1282
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,551
Wow

1283
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:45,951
Curious about this bombshell report Alex is covering here so I searched for the words he was saying and imagine my surprise

1284
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,047
He's just reading the headline for the article on Infowars

1285
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:53,887
That includes the embedded video of the show that he's in the middle of doing

1286
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,983
This is just a headline outlooks himself has written for this day's show

1287
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:01,055
You can see the exact same wording

1288
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:04,127
Repost it on tons of really shady looking blog

1289
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,943
All of which are just reposting Alex's video

1290
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,479
Weirdly none of them have links

1291
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:12,575
Do these documents in this Israeli study that supposed to be the bombshell

1292
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:16,159
But a little digging around and I found Alex's covering and it's

1293
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,463
Just another post on Steve Curtis sub stacks

1294
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:24,863
Jesus Christ there's a video on Rumble that purports to be from the Israeli Health Ministry having a meeting where they discuss

1295
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,911
Findings better that

1296
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:32,287
That's their Samba longer-term side-effect of the Pfizer vaccine that hadn't been known previously

1297
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:36,895
Findings which are being said to have been covered up by Pfizer and Israeli

1298
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:43,551
I can't find coverage of this on any outlet that I find even halfway respectable and I don't speak Hebrew so

1299
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,343
So I don't know what's being said in this video

1300
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,111
Right

1301
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:52,767
The context in the original narrative framework for the story traces back to a post on Twitter by a woman named

1302
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,791
First-year Roth

1303
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:58,911
Who is credited generally as a health and risk Communications researcher and a health Journal

1304
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:04,543
This translates to her running a website called real-time news which is kind of

1305
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:09,663
It comes off as an Israeli version of a lot of the dicey sources that I run into on the show

1306
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,735
Things like WorldNetDaily Gateway pundit

1307
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,015
Steve kirsch's substack

1308
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,807
If your name makes me wince

1309
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:19,135
Then I know you know real time it is

1310
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:25,791
That's not going to hurt its on creative and so Bland at me like you're trying to get something

1311
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,631
I don't know too much about she

1312
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:35,519
But it's worth noting that she was a major source of the fraudulent narrative that tons of soccer players were dropped

1313
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,543
Dead because of facts

1314
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,311
Seen side effects

1315
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:41,407
You fudge data and miscalculated shocking numbers on that front

1316
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,199
Which then became big talking

1317
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,759
Points in the anti-vax world that we cover

1318
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:52,671
For this reason and because there's absolutely zero reputable coverage of this video I'm skeptical of the way it's being.

1319
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,999
These particular information sources haven't are the benefits

1320
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,303
The doubt so I got nowhere to go on this

1321
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:04,703
I can cover it as it's being told by these people and the ways that Alex is come

1322
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,983
Coverage of it doesn't even

1323
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,055
Match the version of it

1324
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,335
I have no idea

1325
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,383
Your day I mean yeah you're not going to win

1326
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,711
Also why is Alex

1327
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,991
Music I mean

1328
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,807
So the Israeli Health minister

1329
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:23,135
Has come out and said that Pfizer's lying about

1330
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,415
Ostensible

1331
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,975
That's the conspiracy no

1332
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:30,815
So the video is of a zoom meeting

1333
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:31,583
That

1334
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:36,703
The is is like a group of researchers that were commissioned by the health Ministry

1335
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,495
Tattoo look at side effects

1336
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:41,055
And they apparently found some

1337
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,847
Longer-term side effects

1338
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,895
Handsome side effects that hadn't been

1339
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,687
Seeing the signals

1340
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,015
That Pfizer head

1341
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,039
Take a note of

1342
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:55,647
Haha I been Apparently after this the health Ministry put out a report

1343
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:00,511
Or maybe even in conjunction with visor date covered up

1344
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,815
These are the side effects

1345
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,839
Better

1346
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,911
That's alright

1347
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,703
So then the government

1348
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,239
Was covering it up

1349
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,775
Yeah

1350
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,335
Yeah the government advisor so

1351
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
Okay

1352
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,895
I mean

1353
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,455
He'll just accept

1354
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,503
Anyone who says what he wants to

1355
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:27,903
Stepsis I like it doesn't matters like there's any resources that should be off-limits for him except

1356
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:32,255
Anybody who says what he wants them to say and he'll also make up things

1357
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:36,863
The add-on to thing right right

1358
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,655
So we got another covid

1359
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,679
Conspiracy of the day

1360
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,543
But still won't release

1361
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,943
They're desperately needs me some prison time

1362
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,975
Thousand October report

1363
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,071
So this is a fraudulent story

1364
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,119
Essentially what it boils down to is semantics

1365
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,935
The epoch times was running some stories about the

1366
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:17,567
Cdc's monitoring of various data and they were contending that the CDC was not analyzing the data at all

1367
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:24,479
The CDC it made some comments that they had used to data analysis method called proportional reporting ratio or PR

1368
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:27,295
But in fact they'd only use that method

1369
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,599
Between March 25th 2002

1370
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,879
July 31st

1371
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,647
S2000

1372
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,671
22

1373
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:38,815
This is clarified in the letter from the CDC director to Senator Ron Johnson who's questioning her about this

1374
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:45,983
CDC and FDA chose to rely on empirical Bayesian data mining more robust technique used

1375
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:46,751
To Analyze This

1376
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,775
Proportionate reporting

1377
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,823
Rather than prr calculations

1378
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,359
To mitigate potential.

1379
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:58,783
CDC perform prr analysis between March 25th and July 31st 2022 to Carrabba

1380
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,087
The results of the EB data-mine

1381
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:07,743
Notably results from prr analysis were generally consistent with EB.

1382
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:08,767
Unexpected

1383
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:09,791
If you signals

1384
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:16,447
This isn't the story about the CDC not bothering data it's just about them using a different methodology that they felt was more you

1385
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,215
Useful

1386
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,519
Possibly someone misspeaking at some point of the

1387
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,079
It is it is so funny

1388
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:24,383
And end so just the world

1389
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,175
Of humanity

1390
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,735
That the idea of somebody

1391
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,271
Going out of their way

1392
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,831
To double-check if something's right

1393
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,367
Is the source of a

1394
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:39,743
Conspiracy for people are suspicious

1395
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:43,071
That's only something that Liars would do sure

1396
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,095
What

1397
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,167
Fact-checkers throw people they're supposed

1398
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:47,935
Flyers

1399
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,055
Everyday

1400
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,895
Articles

1401
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:01,759
Football

1402
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,551
Adjust

1403
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,087
You're crazy

1404
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,879
Not a single blood clot

1405
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,927
But it's 6 ft of blood clots

1406
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:14,815
Right so this is a headline that Alex's reading from CBN which of course is the Christian Broadcasting Network

1407
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:19,935
This is about a high-school student named Kayden climber who had a large blood clot

1408
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
Multiple

1409
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:24,031
Nowhere in the story doesn't mention climbers vaccinations

1410
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,567
Status outages make

1411
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:31,967
Combat off because reporting every story about a young person who gets hurt as being the consequence of the

1412
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,247
They're getting vaccinated

1413
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,271
He can't make it

1414
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:38,879
Point by discussing reality so you just makes up whatever works best for him so he can keep his audience

1415
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,159
It's scared and it is sway

1416
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:45,791
Incidentally the CBN story include this but Alex never talks about doesn't mention this at all

1417
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:52,191
It's unclear what caused the extensive clots in his body but doctors diagnose climber with a condition

1418
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,263
Called inferior vena cava at Tri-C

1419
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:59,103
I just disorder can be acquired or congenital

1420
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:02,687
Even the CBN is letting you know that there's a decent chance

1421
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,711
Climber was born

1422
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,991
With this condition

1423
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:09,087
I looked up other sources on the story and no one mentions whether or not he was vaccinated

1424
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,903
I did find a lot of angry blogs

1425
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,999
Stories don't say whether he was vaccinated as proof that he is and they're covering it up

1426
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,279
I think that's dumb

1427
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:23,935
Also in July 2021 Ohio where this High School is located passed a law prohibiting mandates

1428
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,471
For public school so there's

1429
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:29,055
Literally no reason to just automatically assumed that he was vaccinated

1430
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,079
Howard Stern

1431
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,871
Care about the reality of the situation

1432
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:38,527
To him this story is useful if the kid was vaccinated so we can make it look like this is a consequence of vaccinations

1433
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,831
Don't need any proof to justify reporting

1434
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,855
He was

1435
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:45,951
That's so simple is brain is and how little he cares about what he tells his audio

1436
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,743
I want to I want

1437
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,071
Alex to sit and watch like a Premier League game

1438
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:56,703
And just every time a soccer player goes down just be like

1439
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,519
Forget all right next time

1440
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,055
It's back to nation that cost

1441
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:06,431
Default

1442
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,455
It was

1443
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:11,807
Actually

1444
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,647
Five at least references pre-2000 today I think

1445
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:22,047
I think we're old and I think I don't know forever was like 97 or

1446
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:22,815
Something like that

1447
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:23,839
I want to say

1448
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,863
IWatch

1449
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,399
World Cup with

1450
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,167
My brother

1451
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,215
Cuz it was like a hot dogs last

1452
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:32,031
Emerald shop 2004

1453
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,823
That sounds about right

1454
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:40,223
Try to remember years I saw I saw that headbutt live

1455
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:43,807
Yeah I feel like I did because I remember having a woohoo

1456
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:46,367
Reaction today

1457
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,415
And then there was a rap lyric

1458
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:56,351
I'm like zidane how I kick it

1459
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:01,727
And remember that I think I told you about it as no one else has ever heard

1460
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:02,751
Probably

1461
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:07,359
Some Nida debarros yelling at you

1462
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,383
What is the date today

1463
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:11,199
My brother was big into the French

1464
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:13,503
Love tarot reading

1465
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,063
That's all I remember

1466
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,343
No

1467
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:22,719
I only remember a couple of those French players and then the US

1468
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,999
World Cup team

1469
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:28,351
From when I was a kid they tried really hard to make like Alexi Lalas

1470
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,399
Like a really cool grunge

1471
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:32,447
Figure ghetto

1472
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,727
Red herring

1473
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:36,287
Yeah and then there was Marcelo Balboa

1474
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:40,895
Very cool name wrong with a Marcelo Balboa I feel like he did the bicycle kick

1475
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,175
And that

1476
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:47,551
But you know sometimes remember you sometimes you think of you see somebody's name and you think of the moment

1477
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,831
That their parents named

1478
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,623
And you're like what were they thinking

1479
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:57,279
But after like a Marcelo Balboa they must have high five like that's the best name we've ever come

1480
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,047
Come up with

1481
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,607
We nailed it feel like there were a couple other

1482
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,655
People I remember on that team but let's

1483
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,679
Let's move on

1484
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
Cuz

1485
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,495
A big name is about show up

1486
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,799
Okay mediastar Bobby bar

1487
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,103
But he's not on to talk about the trial

1488
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:18,015
Constitutional lawyer historian good friend of mine

1489
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,343
In the next hour

1490
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:24,671
And no he's not here right now to talk about the show trauma Connecticut

1491
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:29,535
He's here later to talk about

1492
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:33,887
But he's involved shooting Pfizer Robert Kennedy Jr with the big whistleblower

1493
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,447
The help this whole ball start rolling

1494
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,519
Are butterflies around

1495
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,055
Hollywood stars

1496
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:41,823
Quarterbacks

1497
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,639
I do like

1498
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,407
Aaron Rodgers

1499
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,175
Loving

1500
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,967
But I I just get butterflies

1501
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:51,039
Weather for Liberty

1502
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,343
Wherever there's a battle against

1503
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:59,743
Outside to save himself because he had just spent a while talking with her cool Aaron Rodgers was right he was on Bill Maher shiting right

1504
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,791
I was doing the mityvac not Sanjay

1505
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,911
Adult

1506
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:12,287
Defrauded the welfare system not talking about that one right

1507
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:16,640
So yeah Barnes is not talk about the trials you're talk about his

1508
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,456
Doom the lawsuits

1509
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,224
30

1510
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:26,624
How do you how did he swindled JFK jr. Robert Robert Kennedy

1511
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,392
It was hard

1512
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:30,976
That's fair I think it works it's a

1513
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:35,328
Perfect arrangement for the both of them it's a going nowhere and they'll both

1514
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,888
Scam a bunch of money off their followers for it

1515
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,424
Is true

1516
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,496
Alex got to complain a little bit here about his trial

1517
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:49,152
Number one again every major News Channel demonizing us lying about us

1518
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:52,480
Explaining that you don't find somebody Guilty by a judge

1519
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:55,040
And then have a show trial about how guilty

1520
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:55,808
The are they

1521
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,416
Time and the lawyers in Texas tying the hands in Connecticut with a difference is

1522
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:07,072
And a wallaby like turn it off when she was spending hours lecturing

1523
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:15,520
Because you took their own trial but then we can't defend

1524
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,480
Borders are for me at this time

1525
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:27,552
He's able to lay this out he's been doing live streaming with

1526
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,600
Million viewers yesterday

1527
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,904
With his colors

1528
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,208
When Michelle got a bunch of Clips but just

1529
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,376
Tell me my lawyer

1530
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:43,936
You can ask questions about this you can ask question about that

1531
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:47,008
We want to shut them down and take them off air

1532
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,800
I asked these people

1533
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,712
Question

1534
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:58,528
It's incredible explain what's happening

1535
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:05,184
Accurate at all but looking really expect

1536
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:11,584
Insist that the plaintiffs are political operatives who transmitted their grief about a tragedy into activism against the second

1537
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,888
Amber exaggerating the trauma in order

1538
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:16,704
To use money in the legal system as Weapons against Alex

1539
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,752
Because he's the only true supporter

1540
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:20,032
The Second Amendment or something

1541
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:24,128
I have a consequence of their default sanctions algaecide is

1542
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,152
I'm permitted to make certain

1543
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,432
Client which they could

1544
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,992
Is contested and raised in an actual trial

1545
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:33,856
If they hadn't engaged in a very clear pattern of malicious non-participation with it

1546
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,624
Discovery process

1547
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:38,720
It's the third day of the trial really seem to make clear

1548
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,304
Many things that were intentionally withheld from Discovery

1549
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:48,704
Particularly Google analytics data and it's not hard to see the reason that they were withheld probably has to do about it

1550
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,544
How bad they look for Alex has ever use Google

1551
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:56,128
Yeah I can only go by what Infowars says

1552
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:56,896
Now sure

1553
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,176
All those emails

1554
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:04,064
They they look like we did Sunday 3 what we're referring to here

1555
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,416
We have largely been the

1556
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,184
Questioning

1557
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:14,816
Of

1558
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:18,912
And a lot of Thursday day 3

1559
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:21,216
Had to do with the question of Google Analytics

1560
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:24,544
Because they were supposed to turn over these Google Analytics

1561
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,616
Fix data and claim

1562
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,664
I just didn't use it I don't even use it

1563
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Decision

1564
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,736
Right

1565
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,528
And so it was

1566
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,576
A lot

1567
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:40,928
Of instances Bill brought up of Google analytics being referenced

1568
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,696
In

1569
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,000
And emails

1570
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:46,816
And snapshots of Google Analytics

1571
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,584
Yeah yeah

1572
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,608
Witches.

1573
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,400
The date of that

1574
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,704
It's full without a full picture

1575
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:53,984
It's not what was

1576
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:59,104
Demanded and Discovery chat but it does very clearly illustrate that they were lying

1577
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,432
And not turning over this for a reason

1578
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,712
Well okay

1579
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,504
So so okay

1580
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:09,088
So here's what you're going to say when we turn this data over to you

1581
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,648
Because we had a huge spike in traffic

1582
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:14,976
And we knew about that by checking Google Analytics

1583
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:20,352
We use that to decide what our coverage about Sandy Hook going forward would be

1584
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:21,376
And we saw the

1585
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:27,776
That the right way to do it was to lie about it and apparently there's a deposition of

1586
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,568
Alex's dad David

1587
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:34,688
Who said that when something works well they try to replicate it

1588
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,992
Conjunction with

1589
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:39,552
Looks really bad good doesn't look good

1590
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,576
Have you considered

1591
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,112
I've never heard of Google

1592
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:48,512
The latest example of things they clearly didn't turn over that were responsive to Discovery demands

1593
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:53,120
The texted Mark produced in the Austin case they'd included the word Sandy Hook

1594
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:56,704
Clearly demonstrate either inactive decision to not turn them over

1595
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,800
Or that Infowars didn't even look for the stuff that they were required to look for

1596
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:01,824
Which is still

1597
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,408
Against the discovery all the rules

1598
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,432
Don't exist

1599
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:11,552
Got old long ago but we're in another trial so we're going to hear this quite a bit

1600
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:18,208
Ultimate irony is that Barnes was Alex's lawyer during a lot of the beginning of the discovery abuse so he might not

1601
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:22,048
Alex's lawyer now but he's in essence the architect of getting out

1602
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,840
Into the situation he's in now

1603
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:28,704
Seems like the perfect person to interview about how you're being wronged by the courts

1604
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,520
I mean that you can't help but look at this as

1605
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,800
Barnes's idea

1606
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:36,384
Write like from the beginning the idea was don't cooperate

1607
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,176
Barnes was their lawyer

1608
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,456
I think

1609
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,736
I think

1610
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:43,296
You could maybe make that assumption

1611
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:48,160
Incompetence is certainly a possible explanation

1612
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:51,232
Strains credulity a little bit

1613
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:55,584
I don't know if Barnes intended it to get to where it is now

1614
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,912
I mean that is definitely

1615
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:02,496
Open the air for sure because we have replaced a lot of lawyers

1616
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:04,544
Many of whom in depositions

1617
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,336
We have heard implied

1618
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:08,128
We're not stoked about what they were doing

1619
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,664
Mylanta

1620
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,760
Said that they're considering suing Barnes her malpractice so there is that

1621
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:20,928
The judge in Texas didn't turn off the internet feeds and lecture Alex's lawyer for hours that's just completely made up and actually might

1622
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,952
Might be defamatory

1623
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:28,608
Chris Murray the plaintiff's lawyer here in Connecticut did say that A fitting punishment for Alex's to get him off air

1624
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,632
To make it

1625
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,680
He can't profit off hurting people in the future

1626
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:36,288
That could possibly be argued to be a little bit out there in terms of an opening but I think

1627
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,056
It's fine

1628
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:42,432
It's a damages hearing and the lawyer saying that fitting damages would be to impose whatever punishment makes Alex

1629
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:45,504
Unable to continue doing this damage in the future

1630
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:50,112
Misrepresenting the issue with Norms questioning of the FBI

1631
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,416
Who was the first witness called by the plaintiff

1632
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:58,816
Had to do with Norm asking inappropriate questions about whether or not he was one of the people in Connecticut

1633
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,864
NBC-2 not are the mega

1634
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
Can Kelly energy

1635
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:05,216
It wasn't trying to take Alex off air per se

1636
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:10,848
And Alex himself filmed a bunch of videos where he was trying to get that interview pulled so I don't even know what the point is here

1637
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,920
Also Norm had no reason to believe that the guy was

1638
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:16,224
Involved in that and his conduct was way out of line

1639
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:22,880
It was part of a chain of things he got reprimanded for where he was trying to present to the jury that I was only getting sued because

1640
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,904
Hillary Clinton

1641
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,440
Putting on a Target on

1642
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:28,512
Compromises that cool documentary Alex's War

1643
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,560
Betfair

1644
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:34,912
Partial documentary Alex's wargrave sounds very similar to Alex's

1645
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,680
Defense

1646
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:40,288
You know that I I just saw one of the best

1647
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,312
Soundtrack

1648
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,080
At 10

1649
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:47,968
That is what Alex is war just did

1650
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:53,088
It was a great soundtrack if nothing else

1651
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,624
It's a Barnes has some thoughts

1652
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,648
What about Norm

1653
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,440
What are they

1654
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
Well

1655
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,488
Thurgood

1656
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,256
Are they

1657
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:04,096
I would have good. If you want to see what good

1658
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,120
Advocacy looks like

1659
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,912
Against a rogue judge

1660
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,704
Play hostel setting

1661
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,984
There's no better example

1662
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:11,776
Does represent a

1663
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:13,824
And I recommended

1664
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,640
Watching that that video in this part of the trial

1665
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,920
Do people all across

1666
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,224
Interested in this

1667
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:21,760
Particularly

1668
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:22,528
Because how do you

1669
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,088
Alex Norm pattis

1670
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:26,880
You don't come

1671
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:34,304
On the first day of the trial Norm almost got the jury excuse because he wouldn't stop making inappropriate statements in his open

1672
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,072
Remarks

1673
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:38,400
On the second day Norm got chewed out for openly disrespecting

1674
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:41,216
By not standing up to make objection

1675
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:44,544
On the third day Norman fell asleep for a short stretch

1676
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,312
And then quote

1677
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:49,664
Cuidate post from Mike cernovich about busing immigrants

1678
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,432
To Martha's

1679
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,480
You tweeted

1680
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:56,576
Katie fell asleep I just the moments

1681
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:02,208
Like we texted about it because it was the setup for a Three Stooges B where where it was like

1682
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:05,792
The judge saying to the lawyers in the jury like hey

1683
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:12,192
You know it happens sometimes where the jury has to get up and go out and get up and go out and I'm going to try not to make you do that

1684
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,728
We're just going to talk to the lawyers here

1685
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,496
And she's

1686
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:18,848
Don't do what you're doing you can't do that

1687
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,408
I'll have to set the turkey

1688
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,200
He's like no

1689
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,224
You're right you're right

1690
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:24,992
I won't do that

1691
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,576
And then 5 seconds later he doesn't she just screamed

1692
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:31,136
Over here that was the moment

1693
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,160
It was like

1694
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,696
You can't you got to be kidding

1695
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:39,072
This isn't allowed like an hour later

1696
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,864
He's asleep but he's got like

1697
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,680
Ping pong balls

1698
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:47,008
It is an idiot

1699
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,800
This is not a good job

1700
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:51,872
If you would never seen a trial before

1701
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:52,640
Ever

1702
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,664
In your life

1703
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,712
You would watch this s*** and go man

1704
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,320
Bee stings are a lot crazier than I ever would have imagined I thought they were just

1705
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:05,184
Quiet summer fairs I mean it's not it's not like

1706
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:11,584
As chaotic as maybe you're making it seem

1707
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,144
He's going to get a little loose

1708
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,680
He's got a power up button

1709
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,984
Yeah and I'm like I said

1710
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,264
It's not fun

1711
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:21,312
It makes me feel on it

1712
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:22,848
It makes me feel worried

1713
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,152
Cuz it's so disrespectful and

1714
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,176
You know

1715
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,224
Family members

1716
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,760
Are in the court

1717
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:32,320
You know that is something that has been brought up

1718
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:36,928
Right and the cameras panned a couple times I've seen a couple people that I recognized share

1719
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,976
That is a reality of this

1720
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,512
Being

1721
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,304
A s*******

1722
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,328
Bright

1723
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:44,864
Satisfactory

1724
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,168
You should grow up

1725
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,728
Woke insurance

1726
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,264
So

1727
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,312
Some bonds are pissed off

1728
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,616
I want to make this about Hillary

1729
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:57,408
What's the one name

1730
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,432
That is all about

1731
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,504
That this judge says campamento

1732
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,040
Stampy asked about

1733
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:03,808
He talked about

1734
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:05,344
Opening statement

1735
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,136
Disgusted in direct examination

1736
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,816
Call Joshua question

1737
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:17,120
Apologize about of contacts hurt somebody's feelings

1738
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:22,240
Wow you will not bring that up

1739
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,288
The closing months of the campaign 2016

1740
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,408
Because of Hillary Clinton

1741
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,224
And yet Hillary Clinton is the one name that can't be talked about

1742
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:42,720
No it's a

1743
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:44,768
Trying on

1744
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
Do

1745
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,632
It's it's a stab

1746
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:52,704
You are liable

1747
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,496
You are doing

1748
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,520
By default

1749
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,080
You can't pretend that you didn't

1750
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:00,128
That's going to

1751
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,200
Going to

1752
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,992
F****** the entire kit

1753
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,416
Hate to admit that she's lying

1754
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:16,000
And he kept saying the word lie and Norm objected like

1755
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:18,560
You can't say lie that makes it end

1756
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,352
The judge has to be like overruled

1757
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:23,680
It is a lot she can't just say like

1758
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:26,496
No don't answer it's like yes you she's lying

1759
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:28,288
What else is there to say

1760
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,056
Not much

1761
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:32,896
And the whole thing with Hillary

1762
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,944
That's a really interesting

1763
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,480
Thing you could have done in

1764
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,760
In court if you had

1765
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,296
Not gotten yourself

1766
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,832
Assaulted by clear pattern

1767
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,856
Of abuse

1768
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,160
I mean

1769
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:44,928
Sales

1770
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:45,696
I-55

1771
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,976
Yeah

1772
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:47,744
Ridiculous

1773
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,816
But it would have been appropriate in that other setting

1774
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:53,888
For a while until the judge was like

1775
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:57,216
You know this has nothing to do with anything rest

1776
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:01,824
You are I believe allowed to defend yourself by being

1777
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,152
No just completely like saying

1778
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,968
Stuff that is like well that doesn't make sense

1779
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:11,040
That's fair entitled to a nonsensical the fence

1780
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,320
Suppose you're not

1781
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,344
In this setting

1782
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,648
Write the damages hearing it is a damaged

1783
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,696
Just hearing things

1784
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,464
Is real

1785
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,232
Yelp

1786
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:22,304
So they don't seem to understand

1787
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,328
I mean it

1788
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,608
Obviously

1789
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,400
False not understanding

1790
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:32,032
But why Bill Oldenburg the FBI agent is a plaintiff

1791
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,824
Doing that you haven't

1792
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,128
Damages and yet almost none of the oven

1793
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,712
And look at their lead Witness

1794
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,784
The media has

1795
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,064
Covered everybody except

1796
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,648
The lead plaintiff in the case who's the lead plaintiff it was the first Witness

1797
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,000
It's not a sibling of anybody who died

1798
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,608
It's an FBI lawyer in FBI lawyer

1799
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:03,008
He's the one who's there lead number one playing at

1800
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,824
I questioned something he can sue me

1801
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,128
This is bureaucrats setting the precedent

1802
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,920
To shoot people that disagree with him

1803
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,456
No no it's not nope

1804
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:14,784
But Barnes has decided that because he was the first Witness

1805
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,088
Tell what this is all about

1806
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,112
It's not evidence

1807
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:18,880
Spell that

1808
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:19,904
It's not about

1809
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,184
Alex

1810
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
Being

1811
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,232
Call the person

1812
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,000
Then who did

1813
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,280
The thing at Sandy Hook

1814
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:28,608
If the FBI agent isn't a member of the

1815
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:33,216
I will say that Alex does again say that hit

1816
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:35,008
People he knows and his lawyers

1817
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,824
Don't know who Adam Lanza is which again is

1818
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,872
Accidentally

1819
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:42,688
Poor preparation on their part if that's true

1820
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:43,712
The witches.

1821
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:47,552
Here's a high-ranking well-regarded FBI

1822
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,320
Council

1823
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,648
This isn't some low-level smut

1824
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:55,488
This is in he's there lead number one plane

1825
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,512
Define Witness

1826
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:00,864
This case

1827
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,632
This is not about

1828
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,448
This case is not even really about

1829
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:07,008
The parents and the families or they would have been the first Witness

1830
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
Are these lawyers

1831
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,312
Usted

1832
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,360
It's a FBI lawyer

1833
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:19,808
You never even mentioned you never even reference

1834
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:26,464
Has likely their first witness because he's a very powerful story about being one of the people who responded to the school

1835
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,024
The horrors of what happened for sand

1836
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,840
And then was subjected to a campaign of harassment in a text

1837
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:35,424
Because of information put out by Wolfgang halbig and endorsed by Al

1838
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:41,568
This has to do with the accusation that he was an actor and accusations that he and one of the parents were the

1839
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,592
The same person

1840
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:47,456
So it is all connected to the exact same stuff that is relevant

1841
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:51,040
Barnes and Nobles this he's just a piece of s*** and he's pretending

1842
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:54,368
This is just an FBI lawyer because Barnes is a piece of s***

1843
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,672
Sticks and Stones buddy don't worry about it

1844
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,696
Just an insult

1845
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:05,376
Also weird that Barnes doesn't bring up that the second witness was Carlee Soto who was a relative of the

1846
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:08,704
Toria Soto the teacher at the school who died

1847
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,032
I guess you can really only get the sense of a case by the

1848
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:12,800
Witness.

1849
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:15,872
Probably want to just ignore that because it was

1850
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:18,432
Especially

1851
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:20,224
Call Julia for week-long

1852
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,064
Another thing to keep in mind is that what

1853
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,368
Covered does have a lot to do with images

1854
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,904
And that aspect of this case

1855
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,488
It's just acknowledging that is really dangerous for Alex and barn

1856
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:35,584
First of all the anguish that these people live experience is incredibly real.

1857
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:42,496
Secondly the details about Alex's business operation and how things work internally demonstrate the extent to which

1858
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,288
The profitability

1859
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,568
Of acting in ways that

1860
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,848
Cause that anguish

1861
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,432
It's all super relevant and if Barnes really wanted a chance

1862
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,992
To deal with his stupid arguments in court he had his shot

1863
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:57,344
I guess you could probably bring some of the stuff up to defend himself and Alex Susan for malpractice

1864
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,368
Is that ends up happening

1865
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:00,672
But yeah

1866
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,440
Probably won't

1867
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:04,768
Baby will

1868
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,304
Deal right now is

1869
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,096
Is trying to

1870
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:11,168
Obfuscate the the connection

1871
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,704
10 points between

1872
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,752
Cuz here's the here's a fact

1873
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,032
Do you know this is how they're busy

1874
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:17,568
It's works here this is Avec

1875
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:21,920
This is what they did this is a fact this is what happened all of those things

1876
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:23,968
There are those Connecting Point

1877
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:26,528
It's that the that the lawyers have to get

1878
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,320
Do you know Alexa

1879
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,088
Directly

1880
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:29,856
Connect those

1881
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,136
Thanks Jeff

1882
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:33,696
The only place where they can argue is just like

1883
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:36,512
I'm going to attack this connection and if I can't attack.

1884
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,280
Flick connection

1885
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,560
I'm going to attack

1886
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:41,888
Whatever this space surrounded Hillary

1887
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,424
Well I mean it's all healed

1888
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,448
That's what connects

1889
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,984
All of them

1890
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,008
I mean

1891
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:49,056
Alex I think you could argue

1892
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:49,824
He's afraid of

1893
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,384
Actually occur

1894
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,920
Alex is not afraid of any

1895
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:07,488
Should be evident

1896
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,176
I don't have fear

1897
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:31,040
A a a painter the dentist

1898
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:33,088
We are now

1899
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,880
On the Frontline

1900
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,464
The New World Order

1901
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:45,632
You want to back your family you want to back the future you want to fund something that's at the tip of the Spheres of slacking

1902
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:51,520
We're at ladies and gentlemen so go now

1903
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:58,176
The 1776 koin.com is a fundraiser

1904
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,456
NPR fundraising

1905
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,320
Yeah

1906
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:10,208
You know there is something about a good Jam that either makes you a dancer say inspirational yelling things

1907
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:16,864
You know what they'll have any true that MPR sells memberships and you get gift to the memberships that would cost less

1908
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,168
If you just bought them at a store like a mug or something

1909
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:25,568
Proofpoint difference though and I don't think I would be super into paying that much for a mug if Kai Ryssdal was desperately

1910
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:30,688
Yelling at me to buy the mugs we can pay his legal expenses to fight a lawsuit that he's already lost

1911
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:35,808
About how you define family members of murdered children into the pledge

1912
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,576
Yeah

1913
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:38,880
Hey

1914
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:41,440
Marketplace is a show that I do just

Opening subscriptions for as many people as we can because

1918

As we have been

1919
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:52,704
Sued by

1920
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:58,848
Families of Remington's owners really it is just a Hillary Clinton said it all

1921
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:04,736
Something about the BBS

1922
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:07,552
We're not allowed to defend ourselves in for

1923
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:10,624
The connection

1924
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,904
Offer

1925
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,696
Clear end

1926
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:14,720
Kangaroo court

1927
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:19,840
They have already decided

1928
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,888
So

1929
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:23,680
Barnes has some Choice words

1930
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,448
For the

1931
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:26,240
The conservatives out there who aren't helping

1932
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:28,544
Alex

1933
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,592
Conservative

1934
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:31,616
Oppress

1935
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:33,408
Anybody that's involved in the legal size

1936
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:35,200
I should be embarrassed and humiliated

1937
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,760
I dare any of them

1938
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,040
To watch yesterday

1939
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:41,600
Proceeding and call that a fair trial to call that the

1940
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:42,880
The beacon of America

1941
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,976
America's justice system is supposed to be the beacon of Justice

1942
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:47,744
The world

1943
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,280
And right now it looks like it does

1944
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,048
Dystopian

1945
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:54,144
Just now

1946
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,168
Alex

1947
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:59,008
What Venezuelan show trials have you seen

1948
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:05,408
What are you talkin about

1949
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,176
Jabez

1950
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,712
What

1951
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,784
They were tried in Venezuela which one

1952
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:17,184
Woodward trial we talked about there

1953
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:23,584
By the Castro

1954
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,632
He's out

1955
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,424
And Alex has another gas

1956
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,472
That's our boy Rogers

1957
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,264
Any of them interesting

1958
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,080
Shocked

1959
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:35,872
It's to block

1960
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:37,920
It's bizarre

1961
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:40,480
It's not something that we're not supposed to talk about on Infowars

1962
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,552
Let's let's go to the Waterfront Arrow Trucking in Florida

1963
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:50,464
One of the things that's a disturbing me right now Alex are the actions of a Peter teal

1964
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,768
For those of you don't know Peter tail is a

1965
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,048
A billionaire was

1966
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,120
Major financier of Donald Trump's candidacy

1967
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:59,936
So real quick just a just a butt in here

1968
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:03,776
Peter tales and brought up on it for

1969
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,056
Second

1970
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:08,384
You're not supposed to acknowledge that Peter till was a giant

1971
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:11,712
Founder of Trump's campaign while he was self-funded with

1972
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,736
Peter Thiel

1973
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,016
Right button

1974
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:15,552
Associating this

1975
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,832
Right wing

1976
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:18,368
Billionaire guy

1977
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,904
With funding Trump

1978
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,696
Is not something that is

1979
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:23,488
Generally an acceptable

1980
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:25,280
Rogers bringing it out

1981
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:27,328
But he has some other problems

1982
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,376
And he's

1983
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,144
Forward

1984
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,192
Essentially the underwriter

1985
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:36,032
Millions of dollars of the endorsements of JD Vance

1986
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:38,080
For the US Senate in Ohio

1987
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:41,664
And Blake Masters in Arizona

1988
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,248
Strongly support

1989
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:47,808
Both of them America First candidates

1990
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,136
But having Finance their nomination

1991
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:53,184
Richard teal is now declining

1992
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,232
To finance their General

1993
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,048
And both of them are behind their opponents

1994
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:58,816
Slightly

1995
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:01,376
Behind their opponents

1996
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:04,448
Mister chill comes forward and says wow

1997
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:06,240
The Republican party has not

1998
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,520
Defined enough of a

1999
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:08,544
Positive

2000
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
Image

2001
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,080
Appositive

2002
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:10,848
Program

2003
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,920
All election

2004
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:15,456
About the incumbent

2005
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,480
Party about

2006
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,784
The job that is being done

2007
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,624
By Congressional Democrats in combination with the Biden

2008
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:25,184
So Rodger is problem with m

2009
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:30,304
Is that he gave these guys a bunch of money in order to run their primary campaign

2010
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:35,936
They are unpopular and not raising money and Peter Thiel isn't

2011
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:38,752
Continuing to give them millions of dollars right

2012
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:41,824
To to prop up their General campaigns

2013
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:45,152
That's an interesting gripe here's the problem

2014
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,688
Okay these candidates

2015
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,712
Alright

2016
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:51,552
Sold themselves to a billionaire right in the billionaire bought them

2017
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:58,208
But then the billionaire toss them away that's not fair place this with a Democratic candidate and George Soros

2018
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:59,232
And

2019
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:02,304
Here's how much here's how much it cost

2020
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,632
To own a politician

2021
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:11,520
Would you like to own a politician this is how much you have to spend

2022
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,800
Wow Rodger

2023
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:18,176
Rodger and some other complaints this one about Kevin McCarthy

2024
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:21,760
This is what I want of the

2025
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:23,552
When is your bedtime

2026
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:28,160
Secondarily you have Kevin McCarthy

2027
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:30,208
The following

2028
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:31,232
Footsteps of

2029
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,256
Newt Gingrich

2030
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,024
Has

2031
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,560
Put forward of a

2032
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,328
Proposal

2033
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,120
That is

2034
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:40,448
Kind of reminiscent of the contract for America

2035
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,496
Problem with this is

2036
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:45,824
Honored to have a policy

2037
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,896
Broad enough for every Republican

2038
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,176
To support

2039
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:52,480
I'm all one needs you to look at

2040
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,272
The flipside of The Binding

2041
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,320
Another words

2042
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:59,648
I don't care for everything forward

2043
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,672
Pale pastels

2044
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:04,256
We need to have a bowl policy but it's easily defined

2045
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:07,328
As being the direct opposite of that

2046
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:08,864
Which of the demo

2047
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:11,680
See Rogers really smart key

2048
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,496
You can create a fake version of your enemy

2049
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:16,032
And then to find yourself is

2050
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:17,056
The opposite of it in

2051
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,336
Trick people into supporting you

2052
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,104
You for no reason

2053
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,920
Basically the story of Alex's career

2054
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:24,736
Guys

2055
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:25,760
Stop it

2056
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:27,808
Just say you're the opposite of this

2057
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,088
We don't like this

2058
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:33,696
All of this is basically Rodger his entire take on the midterms

2059
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:35,232
And this interview is

2060
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,024
Just classic Rodger

2061
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:38,048
Attack

2062
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:39,584
Don't defend ever

2063
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:46,496
If this midterm is going to be about us being worried about your trial after the Sandy Hook stuff

2064
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:47,264
About

2065
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:52,128
Abandoned getting arrested but Michael lindell's phone being taken away

2066
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:56,992
Trump being in trouble if they're Mar-A-Lago raid if we're going to

2067
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:59,552
Like play those games at all

2068
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,088
Fuct

2069
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:01,856
Attack

2070
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,904
Ignore everything

2071
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,720
Just classic Rodger Stone tactics

2072
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,768
You're not

2073
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,536
No

2074
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:15,936
No it mean it would be better if he was like reminds me of whenever I was an intern

2075
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:16,960
Her Nixon campaign

2076
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,728
And he was like

2077
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:19,776
Should we just say why

2078
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:21,568
And I was like no don't say it

2079
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:27,968
Young Ben Stein

2080
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:33,344
Are you going to say whites only on your Shoney's at

2081
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,904
So Alex wants to know

2082
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,184
Big Quest

2083
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:39,232
Straub running bra

2084
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,280
Rodger Stone

2085
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,888
We know he told a lot of people including you and mg

2086
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,728
Well I'm going to run

2087
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:57,920
What is the inside base

2088
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:09,696
Alex the only thing that's predictable about Donald J Trump is that he's entirely unpredictable

2089
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:14,304
In a certain that's not good presidential on his home in Mar-A-Lago

2090
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:18,144
Has galvanized his support so that I don't think a

2091
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:18,912
Immediate

2092
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:20,960
Announcement

2093
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:22,752
Is a either

2094
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,544
What you do in the offing

2095
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,848
Or necessarily desirable

2096
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,152
So maybe it'll be a little while

2097
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:31,200
Maybe I mean

2098
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:37,856
Re-enlisting the Mad Hatter to run for president

2099
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:41,440
Because if the only thing that you guys need

2100
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:43,232
Is that he's unpredictable

2101
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:46,560
Dude I've I got news for you

2102
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:49,632
If you don't want to study ham

2103
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:56,032
That's crazy

2104
01:47:56,288 --> 01:48:02,432
Necessarily going to announce anytime soon wrong to play around but I wasn't doing on 4th of July

2105
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:08,320
But yeah looks like Rodger get another definite

2106
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,648
I happen to believe

2107
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:12,928
The governor

2108
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:14,464
Who's the governor of Florida my governor

2109
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:17,536
Intends to announce his candidacy literally

2110
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,072
Immediately

2111
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,096
The election

2112
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:23,936
And I think the president remained needs to remain mindful of that

2113
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:26,752
I still think it is more likely than not

2114
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:30,848
The heat will be a kid

2115
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:35,968
Rodger stone is rarely wrong about his political

2116
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:36,992
Sorry what

2117
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:37,760
Analysis

2118
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:41,088
Your opinion

2119
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:43,392
DeSantis will announce after the midterms

2120
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,416
In 56 days

2121
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:47,488
A daddy's that's hard andjelija

2122
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,512
Alex

2123
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:49,536
Just my instinct

2124
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:51,840
That's hard intelligence and by the way

2125
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:54,400
As President Donald Trump has said

2126
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,424
Ron DeSantis

2127
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:59,264
Has the right to do that it is just bragging if to run if he

2128
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,824
Wishes to run well Trump said it was cool

2129
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:02,592
Wow

2130
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:07,968
Is Trump's permission to what a good boy what a good boy he's been he got a pat on the head

2131
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,016
It's hard until

2132
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,296
We'll see

2133
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:16,160
I told him you would be too surprised if it doesn't make sense

2134
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:20,512
Make as much sense if you did it on the 4th of July

2135
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:22,560
Taking back America

2136
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:23,328
Taft

2137
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:25,888
Another idea about this

2138
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:29,472
Horses Australian got a secret agreement to run together

2139
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,824
The Electoral College prevents that

2140
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:39,968
Correct you cannot have a president and vice president from the same state

2141
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:44,064
Because if you do you would forfeit the electoral votes of Florida

2142
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:50,720
27 V that's too precious for us to do but couldn't rub your swing back

2143
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:54,304
You think he wants to pay New York State income taxes I think

2144
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,352
Wow this President seems cool

2145
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:03,264
Shriya billionaire do you think he wants to pay us light percentage think that he

2146
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:07,616
He cares enough about this country to take more taxes I mean

2147
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:10,432
Come on man that the amount of

2148
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,200
Grifter

2149
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:11,968
Open

2150
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,016
That Rodger can just talk about

2151
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:16,064
As being a grifter that's wild

2152
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,112
Acceptable to say it happened

2153
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:21,696
What's Rodger found God

2154
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:28,096
I guess maybe it's a I don't I don't give a s*** anymore

2155
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,144
As God intended

2156
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,448
About how I lied everyone all the time

2157
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:33,216
Yeah

2158
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:35,520
So we have two false Flags coming right

2159
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:37,824
Horse absolutely

2160
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,104
Football Flags

2161
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:41,920
When you got

2162
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:44,480
Hillary Democrat Party members like

2163
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:45,248
Tim Ryan

2164
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:53,440
Eagles

2165
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:56,000
We saw the witmer staged attack

2166
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:01,632
The number 141

2167
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:03,680
They're obviously provocateur

2168
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:07,008
Your take on that

2169
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:11,872
You know as I have said here on the show and another places

2170
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:13,152
I still yet

2171
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,432
A fear

2172
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,712
Some other kind of

2173
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:17,504
Manufactured Health crisis

2174
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,296
It's some kind of additional

2175
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:24,160
Joke

2176
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:26,976
How

2177
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:29,024
How did it not work

2178
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:35,680
They tried monkeypox cuz they didn't kill enough of the rest of us. How did that work if Alex has misconception that these super

2179
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,728
Powerful evil people

2180
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:38,496
Can just launched

2181
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:41,312
Pandemics whenever they want and all this

2182
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:42,592
Why didn't it work

2183
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,128
According to Ali

2184
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,152
What is

2185
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:46,944
How

2186
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:51,808
How is there a super villain group

2187
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:52,832
That goes

2188
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,624
Who's through all the effort

2189
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,672
Right launching a bio-weapon

2190
01:51:56,928 --> 01:52:00,768
And then they're sitting in their their bunker their underground base and they're like

2191
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:01,792
F***

2192
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:04,096
It didn't work well well well

2193
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:08,448
You need to understand though is that the devil is impa

2194
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:09,216
Patient

2195
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:14,592
Which is why he did the whole falling thing in the first place and he was behind and he's a quitter

2196
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:18,688
Heize ain't listed the monkeypox thing it didn't work pack it up

2197
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:21,504
Packing up around to the next idea

2198
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,784
Pinky and the Brain

2199
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,856
This is stupid Alex's fighting against

2200
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:28,160
I told you we get back to Alice's bankruptcy

2201
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:30,976
Dicey

2202
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:34,304
Yes and that's that comes here this after Rodger leaves

2203
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,072
And like

2204
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,608
There's a weird tone

2205
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:39,680
After I will discuss that here in a minute

2206
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,960
Bankruptcy

2207
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:44,544
Trial where I'm already found guilty

2208
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:48,896
Budgies promising goldlink

2209
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:54,016
On my children

2210
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,064
I don't have

2211
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,856
$1000000

2212
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:01,184
Operations that says that's like

2213
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,768
All those but

2214
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:08,864
Just a week ago where like they were doing well in the chapter 5 bankruptcy

2215
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:15,264
Ether is the future

2216
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,568
Who cares

2217
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:20,384
Open

2218
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,712
The judge

2219
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,736
Supposed to do

2220
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:27,040
If you understand what he's saying

2221
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,064
Basically what

2222
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,112
He's trying to do in bankruptcy court

2223
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:33,184
Artificially inflate the amount of money that

2224
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:37,280
It's coming into the business to make it appear that he's profitable and solvent

2225
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:40,864
Bye-bye just doing these things like

2226
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:43,424
Do you know the release of the book

2227
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:45,728
And it's 1776

2228
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:50,080
Coin share all this stuff is like really pushing that hard

2229
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:52,128
In order to

2230
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,664
IMDb

2231
01:53:53,920 --> 01:54:00,064
The presenting things as a fundraiser be overpriced Menace of the coin Demarco

2232
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:00,832
Bone the book

2233
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:01,600
GameStop

2234
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:06,208
These things are in order to create the appearance of a business doing well

2235
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:07,232
So he can

2236
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:09,024
Coast through

2237
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,560
Bankruptcy Court

2238
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:12,608
I am Baker

2239
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:14,144
He won't be able to

2240
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:14,912
Go to

2241
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:18,752
Keep it up after that but then ideally I guess

2242
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:22,080
His image of it is that like they won't crush me

2243
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:23,104
I'll just

2244
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:25,664
Not have money to give them later

2245
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:28,736
Or something it's a bad strategy but I also think it's

2246
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:29,760
It's it

2247
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:30,784
Feels fraudulent

2248
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:33,600
I mean it does feel like Alex is just

2249
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:34,368
Coming out

2250
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,904
And saying on his show

2251
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:38,720
I'm betting they won't find all my money

2252
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:42,048
Like a baby and it might as well he might as well be like listen

2253
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,096
I've hidden a lot of money

2254
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,632
They're not going to find all the

2255
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:47,936
Like that might as well be what he say

2256
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:49,472
It does feel that way

2257
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:52,032
We'll be able to like just sort of

2258
01:54:55,360 --> 01:55:01,504
Sully sullenberger land history

2259
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:07,648
Nobody's going to be happy but we are we're going to get Awards when we land this thing because it is impossible to land

2260
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:13,536
And this just really captures the vibe but towards the end of the show

2261
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,072
It's a bummer

2262
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:45,024
Today

2263
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:10,624
Time's the vaccine poison will bring all my job or will bring us down

2264
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,680
Murder me process

2265
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:31,104
The judge the public judge the planners have already found us guilty

2266
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,664
Show trauma damages

2267
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:38,272
Dupree Scream by lawyers questions

2268
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,368
He just plays

2269
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:43,136
Clips from

2270
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:44,672
The trial by himself

2271
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:48,768
I like comes in from break if there's a weird lanadelrey thing but like

2272
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,048
Here's the vibe

2273
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,072
It's like

2274
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:52,864
You've had his friends on

2275
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,144
Party

2276
01:56:54,400 --> 01:57:00,544
Yeah I know like Barnes and a talking about the case they're having fun he's coming in with like a freezer

2277
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:06,688
Now he's looking at his empty bottles on the counter

2278
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:12,576
Show got the baggies putting s*** in there like

2279
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:17,952
No no no no no it's 3 a.m. 4 a.m.

2280
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:22,048
Still drunk Jim drunk

2281
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:22,816
He's just like

2282
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,864
All my friends have gone home

2283
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:27,680
Up here alone

2284
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:31,008
Soothe Myself by doing a

2285
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:35,360
Amazing duet with Lana Del Rey

2286
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:38,432
Complaining about my own victimhood

2287
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:41,760
Myself if that was a commercial and Alex was like

2288
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:45,088
Sitting on a bus with his head leaning against the window

2289
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:46,368
As the song played in

2290
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:47,904
Money

2291
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:49,440
Power

2292
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,976
Like that's that's what else

2293
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:53,024
Zoloft like that's what we are looking

2294
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:58,912
It just it just had the vibe I can't I can't stress this enough

2295
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:01,984
Felt so much like a guy who's friends of laughs

2296
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:04,032
But he still is drunk

2297
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:05,824
And has to finish something

2298
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,616
You know there's something that like

2299
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:14,016
10 minutes left to do his job so he can't stop

2300
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:20,672
Right right just play Special Report better thanks to complain about how he's getting jammed up

2301
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:27,072
In the vodka bottle right it's right in front of them and he's getting better but I can just go to bed

2302
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:30,912
So I can drink these tomorrow night

2303
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:35,008
It made me sad but then I realized

2304
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,800
I don't really care it's Alex

2305
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:38,080
That much

2306
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,104
Much

2307
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,176
Exactly

2308
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:43,712
So

2309
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:48,064
I would say that the first couple days of the trial have been

2310
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:49,088
Interest

2311
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:51,904
2 days of

2312
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:52,928
Just

2313
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:54,720
The

2314
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:56,000
Plaintiff's attorney

2315
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:57,280
Questioning

2316
01:58:57,792 --> 01:59:00,608
The corporate representative Brittany Park

2317
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:02,656
Banded with theirs

2318
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:03,680
Still probably

2319
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:07,776
Do you know tomorrow Friday absolutely still going to be some questioning apart

2320
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:10,336
There's going to be cross-examination

2321
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:12,128
Are you know like it Norm

2322
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:14,176
Going to get to come in there and I'll make

2323
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:16,480
I got ask some questions that I don't know

2324
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:18,528
What is a Libra match

2325
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:23,392
Do you like me

2326
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:25,696
The only question I could

2327
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:27,232
Am I cool

2328
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:28,768
How do you say

2329
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:30,560
How do you feel about that check I said

2330
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:36,448
Not big enough is it a going to come work for me we offer a lot of friends benefits

2331
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:40,288
Woke insurance

2332
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:42,592
I do

2333
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:48,736
I will be back on Monday with a check in on Thursday and Friday

2334
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:52,320
For sure trying to keep up with the things going on during

2335
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:53,088
Trial

2336
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:54,880
Which is important

2337
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:55,904
Because the show sucks

2338
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:56,928
But

2339
01:59:57,952 --> 02:00:00,000
Ben is what it is

2340
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:02,560
