1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,544
We're couple dudes like to sit around and drink

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,104
Talk about Alex

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,176
We talked about usually a day

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,200
Currently

6
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:25,344
That is something we generally do and the twist is that you listen to a lot of Alex

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,904
Listen to any Alex

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440
Which is the right amount

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,512
Hope I wasn't too way too much

10
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:37,376
No amount and there lies the fun of the show I get to tell you

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,144
All about

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
What's happened and I get to scream

13
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,384
And that's why we drink

14
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,176
Which is in French

15
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
Before

16
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,696
Well as far as I would prefer if it was

17
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,816
Susanna

18
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:11,168
Hey Ma alright alright

19
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Recertify

20
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,496
Just weak ale

21
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,896
So tell me what we're going to be doing

22
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,248
A donation from my best friend in the world Nikki

23
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
I'm a policy wonk

24
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,368
You donated to the show Apollo if you want

25
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
But he bumped up his donation in order to get himself a time travel episode

26
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
Yeah man we're going 2014

27
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
Considering all of the news

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
That's why we had to escape

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
I don't think there's any

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,664
There's my Twitter feed and seen even the slightest

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
Cute puppies

32
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
In Alex Jones

33
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,368
His show has been dogshit the last 2 days

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
Right he's at Rodger Stone in studio

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
On Monday

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,352
It was just the two of them having a Skype conversation with Mike cernovich

37
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
And they were just like

38
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,936
Aren't we great

39
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:21,824
Who's kind of just like

40
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
And the whole time

41
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,688
They were talking about how reince priebus was the leak

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,064
And they had information from their sources that reince priebus was leaking everything

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
And how like it

44
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
It finally time we can come out with it

45
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,952
That afternoon

46
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
The news broke

47
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Trump

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
Giving information

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Tuesday Russian

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,424
I forwarded bassador lazaroff

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,728
No no

52
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,568
The president has

53
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,384
Even better than that

54
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
It's even better

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
Because it's happened

56
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,808
They had to adjust their narrative because it had to be someone who was in that meeting

57
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
That was

58
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
The person who leaked this to the washing

59
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
The post

60
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
Ansel

61
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,024
Human Rodger Stone just do like a Facebook

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,816
Video in a hallway

63
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
Weather like

64
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:22,752
We knew all along it was McMaster

65
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,568
Invalidating the last day of Grace

66
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:30,944
That's such a snapshot of the Republicans forget what happened

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,016
Coralville

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
And then today Tuesday as we're recording this

69
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:43,232
Alex had Rodger Stone in Studio City

70
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,840
I like Rodger Stone being very close to the border of Mexico

71
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:53,728
Personal reasons

72
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,056
He's a Flight Risk if it ever has been one

73
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,200
So he was on and then again we're just talking a lot of s*** and it was really uncomfortable cuz I think Alex was drunk

74
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,040
Really

75
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
Like he couldn't

76
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
Stop losing it like

77
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
Controlled himself

78
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
I wanted to pull some

79
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,696
Clips of it cuz it's just like

80
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
It's out of

81
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,024
Control Impressions left and right

82
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,607
He's doing like Chuck Schumer as some sort of

83
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Wizard of Oz villain

84
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Kind of

85
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,775
Issue where it's at the disaster

86
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,127
Not if you mess with her this guy cannot can

87
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
Control himself at all

88
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
So then Rodger Stone

89
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,247
Adductor group comes in

90
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
They do about it

91
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
Hour-and-a-half

92
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,951
Maybe an hour little over an hour commercial for a new product

93
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
They put out

94
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
Best basically

95
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,583
As best I can tell the function of it is it makes you pee more

96
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,775
I already have proof

97
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
Prostate

98
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
It's against your prostate cancer

99
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
Is in the light-bearer no

100
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
Heavy metal

101
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
And stuff like that

102
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,207
Utopian s*** menstrual blood enough that is basically what they were saying

103
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
They were saying that if you don't like

104
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
If you don't discharge

105
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Enough

106
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
It will however you discharge

107
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
Metals

108
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:33,311
Philippine you in like funguses on your break married on specific

109
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,151
Do they know that

110
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Mint

111
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
And women men's

112
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
That's in the Bible

113
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,135
Nothing is not a consummate Christian

114
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,743
Missing out on

115
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Although

116
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
This Thursday

117
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
Looking forward to it

118
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
Jon rappoport should be back in

119
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Studio cuz it's been a week

120
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
I know you like that

121
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
God is

122
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
If you wasn't

123
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Studio

124
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Master

125
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:17,087
Worlds would Collide in studio

126
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Things to find

127
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
Jon rappoport

128
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
In some

129
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
Stray episode

130
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
I have not yet but I'm looking forward to it

131
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,351
LabCorp

132
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,423
Origin story

133
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
Appearance

134
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
So

135
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
To see how it goes from

136
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
Oh yeah

137
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
A problem

138
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,503
He comes out all googly eyes with a huge beard

139
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,319
I'm just driving myself now

140
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,999
Do you have a cross-eyed you have a big beard

141
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
My teeth are going to fall out

142
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Certain

143
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
S***

144
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
I got it I got to start

145
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Your optimism

146
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Is insane

147
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
But then I'm going to turn into Rappaport that you're going to live that

148
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,687
So today I will Iowa and play this out of context

149
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
The date we time travel back

150
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,039
Conclusion

151
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
More than most

152
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,623
V not so much

153
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
He is not a detail guy

154
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,559
That really sums up third of how Alex Jones lives his life

155
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,863
Not really a big deal

156
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
So

157
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Today

158
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,959
Got my assignment

159
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
From the gift

160
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
Eddie told me

161
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
You got to go back

162
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
To March 8th

163
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
2014

164
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
What Jordan

165
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
Was Mark you don't remember March 8th

166
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
Ifucking remembered

167
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
This is this is a disgusting

168
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:58,719
If you if you give me a humorous collar a man of letters

169
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
OK Google

170
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,399
Open and I tell you to think my brain works the Malaysian plane went missing

171
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,031
The greatest day of my life so

172
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
March 8th

173
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,615
2014

174
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
A scholar

175
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:21,503
DJ for all of us

176
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,343
Also on March 8th Alex is doing his show and 8

177
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,927
Awful he doesn't mention the plane at all

178
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,303
So

179
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,775
Sxsw Music Festival

180
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,591
They're trying to push an anti-gun agenda

181
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
With Bloomberg

182
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
What have you

183
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
I don't know

184
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
It's nonsense

185
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:55,039
So he's he's getting really excited to most of that show is him talk about how they're going to

186
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,855
We've got guns March

187
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Revlon has gun

188
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,559
Progressive

189
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,631
It's like a can

190
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,823
Horrifying racist

191
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,407
Torches

192
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,015
There's no negative connotations associated with a bunch of white people holding

193
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
Torches

194
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,695
Which is a whole lot better than the old

195
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,511
Yeah dammit that's what 2.0

196
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
Yeah

197
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
I guess

198
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
Next episode

199
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,287
I think David Knight was hosting the next 12 Mike I don't even care

200
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,383
I'm starting to notice at Redwood big things go down

201
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
Auto Studio

202
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
The David light was in like right after

203
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
Director for the last one

204
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,623
I don't care

205
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
The next episode

206
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
Is backing

207
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Studio hosting

208
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
Everything is back to normal

209
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Is March

210
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
11th

211
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
2014

212
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
Recovering

213
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,423
Hey man I'm glad cuz

214
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
This episode is

215
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
Profoundly stupid

216
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
Waterfall

217
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
But

218
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
Siri

219
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
He is

220
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
Out of Studio

221
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
When big things have

222
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
Because

223
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
The people who work for him are like Lissa

224
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
We have to

225
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Hispanic

226
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
Because if you go on there

227
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
You're going to say

228
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
All kinds of crazy

229
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
Right

230
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Are not going to sign off

231
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:47,935
I know I disagree with that theory because he has such a like an iron grip on

232
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
On Infowars

233
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
Rob Dooley

234
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,919
Just because Rob do his narrative it doesn't mean that Alex is going to Buck that naira

235
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,247
True

236
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Can't be contradict

237
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Did everybody else can

238
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:08,671
What's the matter if he's there.

239
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Anyway

240
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,327
Alex Jones The Bells calls

241
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Alex Jones

242
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Wheel shakes

243
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
Alex Jones fan

244
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,407
Ice shockingly small amount of this episode talking about the Malaysian plane

245
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,063
Right up his alley though in the Wheelhouse it's like

246
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,439
So here's how he begins the episode

247
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
A little bit about the

248
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,887
Mystery

249
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,703
You have it this Malaysian

250
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Airline

251
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,079
Disappearing

252
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,895
Of the Iranians that were boarding the flight

253
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:05,503
I got to tell you looking at the eyes and the bearing of these two guys

254
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
They look committed

255
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
And I'm not saying they're guilty but my gut tells me

256
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
And they're very serious automation

257
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
They look like

258
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Iranian Republican guard or something

259
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:27,775
Looks like the exact type of infiltrators

260
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Ashley

261
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
Infiltrators

262
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
Looking at this photo

263
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,855
Infowars.com or any other new server that Mattern

264
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,159
Drudgereport.com

265
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
Can't possibly be true

266
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,583
Back whenever he was afraid of Muslim man

267
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
And it hadn't yet

268
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Extended

269
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
Small Muslim girls in Starbucks

270
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,567
Yeah islamophobia doesn't really go over it but

271
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
He's talking about is there was a story

272
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
About to gentleman

273
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,783
Who'd gotten on the plane

274
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
So it's actually

275
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
Spookier

276
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:18,207
Jesus Christ

277
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
Sketchy

278
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
Where was

279
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,143
I don't remember

280
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
We're dumb

281
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,031
Flight 370 was a scheduled flight in

282
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
In the early morning hours

283
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,919
The vaith of March 2014 from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia to Beijing China

284
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,759
It was operated by Malaysia Airlines

285
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
The Beijing Capital

286
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
International Airport

287
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,159
Scheduled to depart at

288
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Boo

289
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
I don't know how to

290
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
Translate military time

291
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
Hahaha

292
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
That number

293
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,447
Another number and then 20

294
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Too difficult

295
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,823
Airplane flight duration was 5 hours 34 minutes which would consume an estimated

296
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,127
37200 kg

297
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
Aircraft carried

298
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
49100 kg

299
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,063
The fuel including reserves allowing 7 hours 31

300
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
Extra fuel was

301
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,391
Ultimate Airport

302
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,463
Which would require bubble by little extra

303
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
Airport

304
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
If that was like rid of emergency

305
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
5 hours

306
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Caring

307
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
Heartless heart

308
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,919
Billion other atrocities

309
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,247
Who's one that was right in the middle of the whole situation the Ukraine

310
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,087
So

311
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
The fun distraction

312
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
For everybody is like

313
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,975
LA Galaxy

314
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,583
Repeat that Alex

315
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Does fingered

316
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,727
Term

317
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
I know but I'm

318
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:14,687
A little twelve-year-old walk

319
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
Fraudulent passports make

320
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,783
Situation reasonable

321
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,343
He doesn't talk about

322
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,951
He holds up a pictures they're brown

323
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
That's basically all he say

324
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
Yeah it's crazy look like

325
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,191
So he goes on a little bit more profile

326
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Of people

327
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
Commit terrorist Acts

328
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Disappearing

329
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,151
Just like when the playing who would like if you were trying to commit a terrorism

330
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Committed Terror

331
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,735
About now

332
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
What you want

333
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
A giant explosion

334
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,935
Quite a few of those getting hijacked out of Egypt another area

335
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,287
They will take over and they will get the cockpit and they will fly the plane into the water

336
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
General

337
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,711
Firearms are bombs they smuggled on

338
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:24,831
It was a false flag you have naked body scan

339
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,183
Christmas

340
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
Is the CIA

341
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,815
Videos putting his face into

342
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,655
Muslims

343
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
Airline are there in Amsterdam

344
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,919
So that testimony

345
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,527
That was a staged event because

346
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,111
Because of this

347
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,231
And the outgoing head of Homeland Security shirt off

348
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Affability

349
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:12,959
What's the total TR Rolla

350
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,007
Promise

351
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:21,407
Because there's no weird thing

352
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,223
Garden-variety

353
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:30,623
Globalist

354
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
Yet capitalized on the crisis

355
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
Right which is

356
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
I would say

357
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,447
Cuz if you're if you're a secret evil Corporation

358
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Globulin

359
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
You wouldn't

360
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
In-N-Out

361
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Favorable

362
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
Right so if the outcome

363
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,271
You're describing the hegelian dialect

364
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
That's basically what it is

365
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,439
You create circumstances to get the outcome that you want

366
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
These bodies

367
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,583
There is an internal logic to it it's not

368
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Sensible

369
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,703
Like you need to do more ground work on it

370
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
I'm not going to get to

371
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
Through Alex

372
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,359
I'm just going for trying to understand what his

373
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,687
I think you have done that there

374
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
If your

375
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
I'm listening

376
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,295
Amelia Earhart

377
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
She came back

378
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
She's the one who made all

379
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
Has disappeared

380
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
Did Amelia Earhart

381
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,791
She's responsible for like the Devil's Triangle

382
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:47,167
This has as much legs I haven't why hasn't her body

383
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
I'll tell you what

384
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
Still hijacking

385
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,823
A lot of the Malaysian plane

386
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
Because Amelia Earhart

387
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
Great at high speed

388
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
Mypoints

389
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,295
My point that I want to make on the Alex's

390
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
Siri is

391
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Reasonable

392
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
Daily readings

393
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
Obvious

394
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Assertive

395
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
Watch to Learning Channel

396
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
So

397
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,031
But that part that added bonus part

398
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,079
That you can't eat and is disgusting

399
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Is

400
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
Fondant decorative

401
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,343
Traverse in the fancy parties that you go to

402
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,439
Adjusting people on television so you're not supposed to eat it I have no idea

403
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
I don't like cake

404
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Anyway

405
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,727
It's a foolish expectation that if something is

406
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
Is being done

407
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:00,383
If something is real then nothing will be done after it is something is fake

408
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,943
By the shadowy organization

409
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
Then they will be ready to push

410
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
That doesn't

411
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
It doesn't make any

412
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
No it is

413
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,647
You need a lot more ground work or else

414
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
Anyway.

415
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
King idea

416
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,727
Now he starts to in the sex with a mediately sore waffle on it a little bit

417
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,823
Can I put a real hijacking does especially

418
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,895
Stop connected Greaser involved

419
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,175
Airplane

420
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,735
Into the water

421
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,535
I don't know a lot of suspicious check people on board but my gut tells me is a hijack

422
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,863
Are car Old Alexandria

423
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,751
Really suspicious people

424
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
Where's the special

425
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:04,127
They were the ones who made the Arabian guys

426
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,711
Is this is Alex in 2014 and the complete difference

427
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
From Alex Jones today

428
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,295
Alex would never say

429
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
I don't know

430
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
Today

431
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,135
True

432
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,536
But the thing about caring water is you always have to

433
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
Have to have a source

434
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,400
Where is

435
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
Basic news

436
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
Even

437
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
Nobody knows what happened

438
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Asian

439
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,480
Did men tell no Tales

440
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Like Amelia Earhart

441
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,184
Dead women tell Tales I don't know

442
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,768
Look at their new stereotype for women

443
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
Seances

444
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,584
Anyway where we started

445
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,424
We have now played a couple of clips

446
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,728
Is that pretty much all of his coverage

447
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:07,616
Which of the Malaysian Airline things go off the rails pretty hard and

448
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,176
In this next clip go

449
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:16,832
Most a lot more about how sxsw to try to take your time

450
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:22,208
Go on that tip he gets into a bunch of TVs

451
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
He raps

452
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
About a

453
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
Bunch of nonsense

454
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
Then he ants

455
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
With

456
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
I don't mind spoiling

457
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
The weirdest

458
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,664
Longest commercial for his product

459
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
That I have ever seen

460
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
It all of my time watching Infowars

461
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Amen

462
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,600
So crazy

463
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
Back then

464
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,696
He was only on the radio for the first 3 hours

465
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
The signal

466
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,400
Whatever he was only broadcast online

467
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
Phil's wife

468
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,496
20 minutes

469
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,288
Talkin about

470
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
And then continued

471
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:21,856
Ends up cuz he would literally just like a like he's in the middle of his commercial and then

472
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:28,256
I'll just cuts

473
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
44 minutes

474
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,936
40 more minutes over drive where he takes phone calls people about the Malaysian plane

475
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,008
None of them have any good theory it's

476
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
Terrible

477
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
But

478
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
Okay we've laid out these

479
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
Like the syllabus of what's

480
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
But now we got to get down to the meat

481
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
My man

482
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
This neck

483
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Clip

484
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,552
We're going back to episode 2 of our pocket

485
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,880
We're going back to something that came from Y2K

486
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
Episode

487
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
A little place

488
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
A very special place

489
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
In Colorado

490
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,960
Anyone that did this would be informed

491
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:16,640
Catherine Herridge Fox News Channel Hiester taking my question Datacenter hold the data of Amir

492
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:21,504
American citizens know

493
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:28,160
Part 1 I can't go into all the details of the Utah Data Center

494
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,232
Hold data on US citizens

495
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,792
The head they do and did

496
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,864
Cybersecurity that's the Pentagon branch

497
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,680
Northcom domestic

498
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:46,080
That should already operating completely illegal

499
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
Operating

500
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
Call Rhonda

501
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,160
Space command that runs everything

502
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,608
Space command

503
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,424
Nexus Quincy public space

504
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,104
Most from sources other eye

505
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
It's unbelievable

506
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:27,040
I'm already gone

507
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,624
The General Public

508
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,952
Start a war with Russia

509
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,280
I'm not saying Russia's good

510
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
The witch is starting

511
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
He is now

512
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,120
Well

513
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,424
Vivint

514
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:50,080
The real fun there is space command runs everything

515
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
Secret behind NASA

516
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,248
We're going to go to bed

517
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
In space command is like

518
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Start a war with

519
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,392
Russia

520
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:09,024
This is 2014 15 years after the Y2K episode

521
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,816
He's still on space command

522
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:17,472
How many times has space command come up in the intervening

523
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,384
Quite a bit right and so but the other thing is

524
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
The context of what's going on

525
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
In March

526
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,224
2014

527
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
Is that

528
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,808
Invade Crimea

529
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Sam

530
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,648
That was why people were mad at Russia at that point

531
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:42,048
Yes leasing the globalist

532
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,888
Maybe some people did want to

533
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,680
Be like hey don't invade

534
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,216
Your neighbors

535
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,544
Cuz that's kind of a

536
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
Kind of big thing

537
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,456
Call neighbor's wife and also don't Annex

538
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,784
Player like

539
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
Slickly Russian

540
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,648
Tire country

541
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,696
Also did he say did he say

542
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:15,072
Interstellar program flashlight Interstellar program

543
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,168
4 or contrary

544
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
That mean

545
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,056
Within Stars between Stars

546
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,664
That's a long way away we're going to Stars

547
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
We are man

548
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
Is it easy

549
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:38,368
You got a f****** watch The Mindy Project Camelot Interstellar the movie come out

550
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,184
24K Magic

551
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:49,632
They're responsible for Interstellar is a movie because it's predictive programming

552
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,776
You know before we can reach the

553
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
The stars with the shake off

554
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
The shackle

555
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
Of the programming

556
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,176
Infested our brains in our souls

557
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
Alex Jones

558
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
About the downfall of

559
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
Humanity

560
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,344
Got coming from a very high place

561
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Where were you

562
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Together

563
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
We did

564
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
To now

565
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
What we have

566
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Become

567
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
Animation

568
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,888
They're all sitting around

569
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,240
There there there there

570
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
There

571
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,616
Kissing a girl for the first time under 12

572
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,968
They're getting in a fist fight

573
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,392
Suddenly everyone has a television set

574
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,720
It's a sign of status of your two television sets by 1955

575
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,632
Not in the real world you're entering the Proto Matrix

576
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,448
Don't disagree with him the TV is our kind of

577
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Shity

578
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,520
Theory

579
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,224
I think the more important Wally on everybody and we're all going to be fat sitting

580
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
I think I'm in leg list

581
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,624
I think the more important even

582
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,416
3 years ago and

583
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
System piece of his

584
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
His sort of ethos

585
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,560
Is that the human

586
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,352
Rag a kiss girls

587
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,888
Your fist fight

588
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
Exactly

589
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,192
Stars

590
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
Fishing in a creek

591
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
I thought

592
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,016
You get a little crawdad URI

593
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,320
That's exactly how I replace

594
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,416
With crawdaddy

595
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
Do you know if it's possible

596
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,768
Possible

597
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,584
You talk about TVs and basically

598
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,120
They take over your life

599
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,680
He's basically saying they can hypnotize

600
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,568
But let me tell you this

601
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,384
I'm not sure how far we're going but I want to say this

602
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,432
TVs aren't the only thing that can happen

603
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
You're welcome

604
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
Allen and 19th

605
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
Joan

606
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,416
Suddenly they all gravitate around the television

607
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
Flicker rate

608
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
Design

609
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
Hypnotized

610
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
False reality

611
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,568
I can't

612
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,640
That's why they're so dumb that's why you can't get through

613
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,688
That's why they're so suggestible

614
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,624
I don't even try to be manipulative

615
00:30:54,976 --> 00:31:01,120
Using basic systems that they use in television and the people literally go back into trances and

616
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:07,520
Identification

617
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
Alex Jones Alex Jones

618
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,184
What's going on

619
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,976
Watching television

620
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,048
They're having interact with people

621
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,704
Deal with all sorts of crises

622
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,664
In the military is a white cuz I seen the corruption

623
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
But like so he

624
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,760
You can hypnotize anybody into

625
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,808
Just happen to their programming

626
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,576
That's nonsense

627
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Okay

628
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
5 vets

629
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,744
But his secondary thesis is that

630
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,704
His wife

631
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Can tell but like

632
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,032
He goes on

633
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
He's like

634
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,360
The police and the military

635
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
They're more awake

636
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,552
Good God damn

637
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,136
But his demographic is largely police and military

638
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,928
How do you know it's not to insult them

639
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:35,328
So he says everybody else is stupid

640
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:40,192
Way smarter than everybody else

641
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:45,312
Show

642
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:57,600
I just don't know why it is such a weird 121

643
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,184
Compare like donate money to us and not idiots

644
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,744
Like I don't know why there is just that relation

645
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:11,168
Will probably probably never know why that is the case but I

646
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,800
Give me money

647
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,128
Because and I don't like revealing

648
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,688
On the show this should be an offer conversation

649
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
You can

650
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
Tap into their program

651
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,112
Right

652
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:40,096
I'm a regular person out there

653
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:44,704
You're hypnotizing me now the evil cross-eyed

654
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:54,176
The powers for good he hates the Matrix

655
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
So this whole

656
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,528
This whole idea that the whole good old days

657
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Right

658
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
Is it

659
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
Like this

660
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
People worth

661
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
Smarter

662
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
Before TV

663
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,768
Because you just said people have only gotten

664
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
Dumber and dumber

665
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,840
So does he think that before.

666
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
TV

667
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
Everyone was just

668
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
Walking around with

669
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,448
Knowledge

670
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,728
Rare

671
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,544
Like the interstellar program

672
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Because of

673
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:26,944
TV like that's what's really going on people would just go down to the creek

674
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:38,720
All these pencil-necked with their TVs that are educated

675
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,256
Chicken neck

676
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,792
I'm using I'm using

677
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,816
My colloquial

678
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:52,288
Alex Borstein

679
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
You know that

680
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,640
Accepting to crawdads sing

681
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,176
It's just social program

682
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,248
It wasn't until the Supreme Court legalized

683
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
Relationship

684
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
It's part of the

685
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
Conditioning

686
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
Matrix that were in

687
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
Thoughts about the Matrix

688
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
Yes

689
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,888
Something incredibly dumb

690
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:29,920
Everything is about getting people and just for themselves

691
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,992
See what's around them you're never going to

692
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,272
Tell them about it

693
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,064
They've got to see it

694
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,120
Unfreeze the truth

695
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:54,496
I feel so good

696
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:01,152
Dumbbell press are are heavier

697
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
And 6070 hundredths

698
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,320
Because I'm not used to listen to White weight

699
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:14,720
Muscle memory

700
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,120
Addition in the wind that is going to rain will not try appointments in the wind and rain will grow and thrive

701
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Pressure

702
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:26,240
Sweetness leaving the body

703
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,520
Your money

704
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:33,408
In the real world clips

705
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
Yeah man

706
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
Yeah

707
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
They drove math

708
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
The Dons off cliff

709
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,136
We need to get back to that time whenever also Couldn't Write

710
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:49,792
Will could draw some of them

711
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:54,656
But yeah

712
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,752
Is weakness leaving the body first of all are blowhard assholes

713
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
There a gym shirt

714
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,200
Red pill thing is is the

715
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
Bulshit men's activist

716
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:15,648
Are men's right assholes

717
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
What the

718
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,256
Voters

719
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,584
It's the gamergate Buckhead

720
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
This is all

721
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,192
All of them

722
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:34,848
And a million pound dumbbells

723
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:46,368
It's been pointed out of 100 times but the whole red pill mythology does comfort

724
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:50,976
The Matrix movie made by trans women

725
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:54,304
Innovative

726
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,632
The time and the only reason

727
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,472
Was as a f****** that's it

728
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
The other thing is I was

729
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,616
Thinking about this redpill idea quite a bit late

730
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,712
And I realize that we are really took a wrong turn

731
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
What a bunch of people

732
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
Realized

733
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
That they could present

734
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
Being tricked

735
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,880
Is being red pilled

736
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
You're mean

737
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,208
Alex is tricking people

738
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Right

739
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,048
Most of these online communities that are about men's rights

740
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,864
A certain things

741
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,912
Into falling into their world

742
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
They're not

743
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,752
Opening up anybody's eyes

744
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,032
Truth or reality or

745
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,824
The Matrix Man

746
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,712
If there's any community of people who are actually doing that like

747
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,504
Broadly speaking

748
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,088
Like some of these hallucinogen base communities

749
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Maybe

750
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,184
Baby p.m.

751
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,792
Baby we're seeing with the red pill stuff is just yet another

752
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
Application for doing

753
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,352
What you already wanted

754
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,984
I am taking the red pill

755
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,336
It's getting others to do it to its Evangelical in nature

756
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:14,688
Any idea is tricking P it's almost like an intellectual pyramids

757
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:21,344
Like you don't get much out of it unless you get other people to fall in line with your ideas

758
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,880
I mean like

759
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,184
Say religion

760
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,048
For one month

761
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:36,448
Community wherein they become an echo chamber for themselves

762
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,752
How's the naked talk s*** on women all day

763
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,800
They can do I call

764
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:46,688
Matter really the victim

765
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,992
Why they need to evangelize

766
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,296
Is just standing alone in saying that

767
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,904

The penny

770

Collective

771
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,304
Does any Collective Community entirely

772
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
Like

773
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,120
Even a small

774
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,656
Towns have that same

775
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Chamber Of Life

776
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,472
Is it to live in a small town

777
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
Sure

778
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776

India

783
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
Case

784
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
Some parts of it are great

785
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:26,880
Support small town living are fantastic rights activists

786
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,160
You have all those dudes

You get to hang out with dudes all day

788
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,864
Angry

789
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,568
Miss f****** aligned like Monsters dudes not thrilled with it

790
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
Jim root

791
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
Broom broom

792
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,736
Watching that dude

793
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
Grunt

794
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,576
Scream and then pi5 is Bros because

795
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,880
It's not great you know what is the best

796
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
What is the best

797
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,512
I remember back when I used to

798
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
Wasn't it the best

799
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,960
Flip out of church and I'm sure you're in the same boat

800
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,032
Not a great sermon

801
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,824
But it is a sermon

802
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
F****** Alex Jones

803
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,736
Trying to hyper match at the next

804
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:29,600
Pay-per-view between himself and the devil and it's a little long

805
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,440
But I wanted to fight all the way through

806
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,000
I think I would much rather have had

807
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
My pastor

808
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:48,544
Do I have the Lord on my side

809
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,663
More or I'm thinking

810
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,943
He's going to play chess with

811
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
I'm not sure which

812
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:02,879
The first the prior is closer to it Alex is about to do on this one and just let it ride

813
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,415
This is

814
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439
F****** crazy

815
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,255
In the middle of this

816
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
On the screen

817
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,095
They flash up the Wikipedia page

818
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:19,519
So like as a reference

819
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,127
You know how great that is because you can

820
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,407
Really flash up

821
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,735
Any verses of the Bible talk about the

822
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,527
The devil really

823
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,087
We are being sucked in

824
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,647
Evil

825
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
Animation

826
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,791
The animation that I want people to come up with

827
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
I'm sorry

828
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,351
I forgot to

829
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,655
Interrupt red setup totally correctly

830
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,727
He's also wanting people to draw an anime show

831
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,031
He wants a cartoon

832
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,615
He wants other people to do he's doing the contest

833
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,431
He's very lackluster about pitching it

834
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,991
So I have to explain he wants people to

835
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,527
Draw cartoon of

836
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,855
He's describing @ms where he loses his shift

837
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,655
Human Spirit expression

838
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,727
Of the Mind Control

839
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,311
Controller

840
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,127
That is the ultimate against free will

841
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,991
God gives us free will to the enemy the devil

842
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,927
It's in front of you on our road

843
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
Tennis stars

844
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:48,351
Human development

845
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,679
They control us in thomastown

846
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,751
Play God and build an artificial system

847
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,055
To predict the future

848
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,711
Omnipresence the devil is trying to use human made in the image of God

849
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:09,855
I got machine over everything

850
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
He is a Deceiver

851
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:41,855
What the frog

852
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,655
Is going Interstellar

853
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:58,239
Challenge

854
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,287
And a smartphone to the NSA

855
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:04,383
Culture destroying the chemicals in the water and the war on the Family

856
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,991
Coming down

857
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,551
The fire

858
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,111
Beyond

859
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,415
Animating contest of Liberty

860
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:23,583
The devil's doesn't give you the animating contest the devil lies and tells you

861
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,919
Bedeviled

862
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
Nothing

863
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,527
The Creator

864
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:48,415
We are made in the image of the master builder

865
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:55,583
The Supreme architect of the universe in idiots

866
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,399
Heavens

867
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,895
We are made in the image

868
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
And the lightness

869
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,319
In our bodies

870
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,647
Supreme entity

871
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:26,303
Systems that our minds cannot even begin

872
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,423
Jen to imagine

873
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,055
And the devil wants that's because the devil is never a maker

874
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,383
The Devil is a taker

875
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,223
Counterfeiters from the beginning

876
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,247
And a fraud

877
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,599
With a false light of Black Sunshine

878
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,815
History there

879
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,935
You know what that is

880
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:09,311
Got to fill time

881
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,383
Talking about either

882
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
Here's the problem

883
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,455
Because he

884
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,735
Two things that plays

885
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,527
There is a contest

886
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:22,367
Then he's trying to run cuz I shouldn't have to give $10,000 to do this

887
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:29,535
Designer you here

888
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:34,655
But if you're also still does to this day

889
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:37,727
He talks about the animating contest of Liberty

890
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,287
What makes us Ally

891
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,383
But animating is imposed to us not being

892
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:53,087
Talk about an animation contest but also talked about the animating contest

893
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,999
To mean a lot Olive

894
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,119
God created us music Eminem

895
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
And the devil

896
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,727
The devil warranty never would have created a woman

897
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,871
He wants to make a god machine

898
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
Tell the future

899
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
That's what I would do

900
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
Sure

901
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,783
The flamingo

902
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,575
And how would you do that

903
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,111
Smartphone

904
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,927
Destroy the family

905
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,975
Crawdad

906
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,303
Problem-solve

907
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
Yeah

908
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,911
He's trying to steal the power that God.

909
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
Benevolence

910
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,055
Do we have a do we have a reason for that

911
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,847
Like does he have a goal

912
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,919
His goal is to create a god machine cuz he wants to know the future

913
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
What's the endgame

914
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,247
Control the present

915
00:48:54,783 --> 00:49:00,927
But that's what he thinks I mean it's all it's not really about a literal devil even though he is yelling about

916
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,975
It's all about the global

917
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,791
Wright Road no that's that's a good point

918
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,863
Create a god machine

919
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,167
It's just a convoluted metaphor

920
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,703
Screaming about

921
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,751
Biblical scripture in the literal devil

922
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,031
Right it's just

923
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,359
It it really comes down to it that's a lot of fun

924
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,895
And he's losing it

925
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,943
But it's just filling time

926
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,223
He's not saying any

927
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,295
What if you were

928
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,831
If I went to church

929
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
This is great

930
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,559
I've never I've never seen any Pastor lose it like that

931
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,863
But thankfully never seen some of the guys who handle

932
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,631
Snakes though

933
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
19 videos

934
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:47,519
Yeah but I mean I thought I went to church that had that

935
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
To get bit

936
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
Boca

937
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:55,967
Friend

Gets me we're going to break sign

939
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:06,719
He comes back from break a little bit

940
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
America

941
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,279
Weekly turns big

942

In the fraud and it's basically

945
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,719
Human species

946
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,559
They want to ban the word bossy

947
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,119
Because it's associated with women henpeck

948
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,983
Well when they're supposed to be

949
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,287
What the man

950
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,591
Never happy when they are bossy

951
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,919
The men are supposed to act like men as well so I don't blame women

952
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:08,927
Sxsw

953
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,975

959
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,551
They're actually

960
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:41,951
Aaliyah really interesting example

961
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,743
Some

962
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
Feminist

963
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
Push

964
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,559
But Alex is mad about

965
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,863
Because it's one of the ones that I can

966
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,911
Really understand what they're saying

967
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,935
Better

968
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,239
Alex is missing entirely

969
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,823
So

970
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,431
The whole thing about like a Beyonce had that campaign about

971
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,759
The word bossy being sort of

972
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
Negative

973
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
Right

974
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,855
That is a great example

975
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:22,143
I never watch Thomas Bergman

976
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,423
Show that just got

977
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
Conservative

978
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,223
The budget was way too high his salary was ridiculous

979
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,783
Can't have

980
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,111
Voices on ABC

981
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,767
I hear a campaign like that

982
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
And what I hear is

983
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:54,143
I don't enjoy it when you use this kind of language

984
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,679
It makes me feel bad

985
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,471
That's what I hear

986
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,007
And my response

987
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
No big deal

988
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,407
I'll just a little bit out of courtesy

989
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,199
No big deal I just want to call you bossy

990
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,295
You know what gender do people throw around

991
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,343
I'm not sensitive to it because

992
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,903
Another woman and maybe your experience is different

993
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,743
Is Alec

994
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,095
Asia

995
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,399
If I knew that

996
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,191
You know what we should have done

997
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,727
It had a trigger warning

998
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,519
To let him know that we were going to

999
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
Need to be staying the word

1000
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,359
Cuz I know you really angry

1001
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,151
Alarm is I love his anger

1002
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,687
Women are never happy

1003
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,503
No it's not what they're

1004
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,527
Supposed to

1005
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,831
Women are only happy when they're doing what they're

1006
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:48,415
Opposed

1007
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:59,679
Rent-A-Center

1008
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,519
They're trying to outlaw this word

1009
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,567
They're trying to ban this word

1010
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:08,383
They're trying to take away my ability to say things

1011
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
Better

1012
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:16,319
You can still say it but you can still say it but once people have alerted you to the

1013
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,111
Doesn't make him feel good

1014
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,159
They just got to wrestle with the fact that

1015
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
Your choosing

1016
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,231
You know make people not feel good

1017
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,303
People tell me

1018
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
Natsu

1019
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,351
Rachel

1020
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
Sure

1021
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,423
Horrible

1022
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,751
Assholes

1023
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,799
That it's a it's like

1024
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
Alex

1025
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
Fine fine

1026
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,919
Don't use

1027
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,711
The word because that has a

1028
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
Connotation

1029
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,271
End of yours

1030
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,039
Towing with

1031
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,575
You're acting

1032
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,367
Bad for the way that I take

1033
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,743
So it's the word bossy when used

1034
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,279
In that regard

1035
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Memes

1036
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
You know

1037
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,911
I am supposed to be

1038
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,383
So I mean

1039
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,503
1st Timothy 2:11

1040
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,807
Sure woman learn and also

1041
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
Submissiveness

1042
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:23,391
I permit no woman to have authority over man

1043
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
For Adam was

1044
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
Suck it

1045
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,511
Scripture

1046
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,047
Yeah which you appear

1047
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,839
Really cannot do

1048
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
Give the broad stroke

1049
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,143
That's important

1050
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:37,215
We will be putting that scripture up on knowledge fight so you guys can

1051
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:40,543
Confirm for yourself

1052
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:45,407
1st Timothy

1053
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,967
1st Timothy

1054
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,647
It is fun for me how

1055
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
Little

1056
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,951
These assholes

1057
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,487
Call themselves

1058
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Christian

1059
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,303
Like if you're going to be a men's Rights Act

1060
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,839
Wouldn't that be the

1061
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,887
First Bible verse you put up

1062
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:14,079
You would think

1063
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,615
Not at all

1064
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
Because of You Reba

1065
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,711
Believing

1066
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,991
The tube is being slow

1067
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
Stockton B

1068
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,295
Yeah well

1069
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,599
So before we had all this technology though

1070
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,135
Alex Jones

1071
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,439
Used to get information the old school way

1072
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,743
Pony Express

1073
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,071
There similarities

1074
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:52,735
With the biotechnology

1075
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:01,183
It's a lot more seriously I'm an engineer

1076
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:12,959
Television show Washington

1077
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,199
Now

1078
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
That is a

1079
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,503
The bad experiment

1080
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,599
I don't understand why you would do that experiment

1081
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,367
I don't

1082
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,671
Understand what the goal of that experiment would be

1083
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,207
To figure out

1084
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303
But that would be

1085
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:44,959
Yeah it so I mean you don't really even know it still people anymore but

1086
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,751
An engineer at

1087
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,519
UT

1088
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,567
Yes

1089
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,847
100

1090
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
Videos of wires and their brain

1091
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
The Monkees

1092
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,527
Or did it just risked

1093
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,551
I'm not sure

1094
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,903
Was it just like like

1095
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,951
Jimmy I see the the

1096
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,767
The blast Shield doors

1097
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,631
You just see a s*** ton of monkeys

1098
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,239
You put a

1099
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,055
An infinite number of monkeys

1100
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,127
You get the new girl I don't know

1101
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,151
I don't know what reference

1102
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
To make their

1103
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:30,271
So you talked a little bit more about it

1104
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,855
You thought that was it no it's not

1105
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:39,999
You trying to warn you folks weapon system

1106
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,047
It's so advanced

1107
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,631
They got a monkey Farm in Bastrop close

1108
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,447
Rhesus monkeys all night

1109
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,263
We got chimeras

1110
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,079
With their humanized

1111
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,103
TV and crying

1112
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,919
Over closed circuit television

1113
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,575
DARPA facility

1114
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,023
Excuse me

1115
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,815
I just spoke

1116
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:20,191
It half measures are not going to defeat

1117
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,175
With wires in their brain

1118
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:40,927
With flicker right to mind control

1119
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,743
Governments were going to do this

1120
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,375
That's the first thing I would do

1121
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:52,703
He he made one unfortunate piece of information

1122
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,471
Public

1123
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,871
Trucking rant or whatever it was

1124
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,735
Bastrop

1125
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,271
Go to the town Intex

1126
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,087
I thought you said it was at UT

1127
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,159
Aquarius Restaurant

1128
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,463
And then he said he saw it over closed circuit

1129
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,999
Okay

1130
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:23,423
Which of the monkey wrench so bad I've looked into this

1131
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,471
There is a place called The Screaming monkey Ranch

1132
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,287
Basically

1133
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:38,527
There's some outdoorsy but I found their Facebook

1134
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,575
And it's mostly

1135
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,343
Keybar

1136
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,671
Pictures of people drinking gentleman's Jack

1137
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,719
The guy who looks like someone I know

1138
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,023
The bar public

1139
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,071
How would you hide

1140
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:51,839
Ranch

1141
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,631
You would make people think it was

1142
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,911
The regular bar

1143
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
What's the name

1144
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,983
Public it in the white paper

1145
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,543
They're doing this program in front of everybody

1146
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,335
In front of you

1147
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:05,407
Hypnotize by the idea of bars

1148
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,015
Old 5 Star reviews one of my favorite places

1149
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,807

Open Instagram page

1155
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,863
I don't believe it

1156
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,399
Snooze

1157
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,679

Fake boat

1161
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
We're people can drink

1162
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:42,015
Nefarious and there's probably tons of torture experiments that are going on there

1163
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:45,343
Because that you can just Google

1164
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,927
Just clearly what he's talking about

1165
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,463
Absolutely

1166
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,231
Now

1167
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
I guess

1168
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,559
If you want to go like

1169
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:00,703
We might as well do you know how in Lake

1170
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:04,287
Roswell restaurants

1171
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
Scream

1172
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,663
At the

1173
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,039
If only it was a pizza place

1174
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,695
Basement

1175
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,719
So

1176
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,743
And the monkey

1177
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,511
Pedophile

1178
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,583
Seams are on the up-and-up

Ultima 40-year program

1180
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:32,703
Monkeys don't live that long

1181
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,727
Doing 440

1182
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:34,751
Also it's

1183
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:38,335
Like if you're talking about monkeys you're not you're talkin about 8

1184
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,151
Just to be very specific

1185
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,199
You're not going to get many great experiments on Monday

1186
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:50,367
Does chimpanzees or what you really want a mica Pusheen

1187
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:56,767
We don't want a bonobo

1188
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,535
Closest

1189
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:04,447
Right on their super close which is which is the evolutionary theory

1190
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,215
Human beings

1191
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,007
Bonobos

1192
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,823
Chimpanzees rip your face off

1193
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,103
We're somewhere in the middle

1194
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,175
So I don't believe you Alex

1195
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,015
Let's try another thing I don't believe them

1196
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,879
Obama Surgeon General

1197
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:24,927

1198
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:29,791
Guns are public health issue seeing one's about two steps ahead of us on this

1199
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,607
Is narvon yesterday

1200
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,495
And the mayor of London

1201
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,799
Has called for anyone

1202
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:49,247
Visitors

1203
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:53,087
To the screaming monkey

1204
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,391
Shell for 300,000 lb

1205
01:03:55,647 --> 01:04:01,023
Airport for no reason

1206
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,119
We'll grab your shoulder

1207
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,679
Kids are gone

1208
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:12,799
Harsh

1209
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,127
Harsh

1210
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,663
Can your kids away and

1211
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:21,247
Sending them to salary.

1212
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,271
Dude

1213
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,391
That I have a Tor Browser for this reason

1214
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:31,487
I am saying that I'm sure you can buy a kid for a lot

1215
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,583
I don't even want it

1216
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:40,447
Engage that line of horrified

1217
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:43,007
Is not as expensive as you might think you just make it

1218
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:50,431
The very

1219
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,807
The very idea

1220
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:59,391
If you yell at your kids

1221
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,927
Exactly nonsense

1222
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,511
Because

1223
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,791
Cuz if you're in the air

1224
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:08,351
Right and you're a fine upstanding citizen

1225
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,167
Just one time

1226
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,447
Apparently have not been

1227
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,775
You look at those parents yelling at the

1228
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,359
Somebody should take those kids away

1229
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,919
Icing parents hit their kids

1230
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,711
In public in the airport

1231
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:30,367
Nobody public airport. I've seen people not do anything about it

1232
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
No it's

1233
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
That's working

1234
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:41,631
Stupid thing I wanted more point out though is in comparison to his modern tone

1235
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,935
He's not saying things that are different

1236
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,495
Like you still saying that your kids are going

1237
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
It's backed up

1238
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,591
And sent to a Dungeons and what have you

1239
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,407
You still saying the same stuff but his tone is so different

1240
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,687
Now he's like

1241
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,599
They're going to end up in a Saudi dungeon matter-of-fact

1242
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,623
Flippant

1243
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,183
Flippant

1244
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
I don't enjoy it

1245
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,999
Are you sure it's a little different

1246
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,791
I'm just I like to know.

1247
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,071
Differences between

1248
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,351
Current Alex

1249
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,119
And passed out

1250
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,935
Especially when he's saying the same thing

1251
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,983
But now everything is so

1252
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,007
Black and white

1253
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,311
Where is before I do believe believe

1254
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,103
No

1255
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,895
Kind of kind of on

1256
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,687
Say in this

1257
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,223
Like from what we've done

1258
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,247
As far as our previous

1259
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,319
This is kind of

1260
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,111
Alex Jones

1261
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,135
Tumi

1262
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,183
Like he's been doing the show for 9

1263
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:37,951
19 years of this

1264
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:42,047
And he's just kind of got his he's in his like little flows

1265
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,095
Now

1266
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,631
We're seeing him taken

1267
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,167
Sweetly out of that

1268
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,727
20 year flow and he is

1269
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,007
Always under attack

1270
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,799
He's

1271
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:56,127
Get this wagon to the worst president in history

1272
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,175
I was I was like

1273
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:04,063
I was before Trump was what I even did a bit about it where

1274
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,343
You know the worst president

1275
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,111
History was in

1276
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,183
Andrew Jackson

1277
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,463
Unequivocally

1278
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,767
Trump is be single worst president

1279
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,303
In the history of the United

1280
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,863
MLS

1281
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:23,263
Well if you're going to pick one you might as well go Whole Hog you might as well if Meijer number two

1282
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,823
Absolutely

1283
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:32,223
Music

1284
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,087
This

1285
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:39,391
Text clip

1286
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,951
Human Ed McMahon for the

1287
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,743
Prairie

1288
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,727
Reference

1289
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:56,031
From Publishers Clearing House

1290
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:00,639
Put that last clip I think

1291
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:07,039
I'm done with it

1292
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,319
F****** try

1293
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
We got to get to

1294
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:13,951
We got to get to this next thing I'm going to let you talk

1295
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,839
Cat litter up for that which does not speak

1296
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
So

1297
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:26,239
Taking my Dallas philosophy a little bit too far

1298
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:29,311
That last clip I believe

1299
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,847
Something

1300
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,615
Different

1301
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
About Alex

1302
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,663
In the past

1303
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,455
The present

1304
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,503
This next clip is something

1305
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,783
Clearly hasn't changed

1306
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:43,647
And that is Alex's accidental willingness to outsources

1307
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,463
Cuz he snitches on his cousin

1308
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,743
Pretty hard

1309
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:53,887

Apologize

1329
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,863
Special forces are going to be getting chips

1336
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:01,887
Stop by Southwest

1337
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:14,943
For sure

1338
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,783
Stuff that he's talking about in terms of troops

1339
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:21,087
Experimental PTSD treatment

1340
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,695
Sure it sounds pretty unconventional but also

1341
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:28,767
There's a rash of suicides that are happening with returning veteran

1342
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,583
Number one killer of American troops

1343
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:37,471
And so the idea that someone would try something unconventional suicides

1344
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,495
Doesn't really

1345
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,775
Doesn't seem to farias

1346
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,615
Studies that I

1347
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:52,063
Giving mushrooms psilocybin or lsv

1348
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,855
Houston

1349
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,879
Which is why

1350
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,695
I was saying the redpilling the real version of it

1351
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,719
Could be hallucinate

1352
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:02,559
To some extent but I again I don't want to fully step into that

1353
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,583
World cuz

1354
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,375
Some people are real idiots

1355
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,727
$50 a month

1356
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,751
To the patreon

1357
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,567
What do a time travel episode

1358
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,871
Will take a bunch of mushrooms

1359
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,151
And time travel

1360
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:20,223
What we will do I could not handle that

1361
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,503
Anyway

1362
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,551
More important things

1363
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,319
Is there a

1364
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,599
Within

1365
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,671
It would be so easy to figure out who is cousin

1366
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:35,839
Yeah his cousin was doing Secret work in Mexico just got out of the army alone

1367
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,911
He just said on a

1368
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,959
F****** public broadcast

1369
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:45,055
Cousin was leaking secret information thing

1370
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,335
But he did

1371
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,127
Clearly

1372
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:54,527
His cousin wasn't allowed to talk about it

1373
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:58,879
Because it's cousin didn't a cousin

1374
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:02,719
You know how I know that his cousin

1375
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,511
Is not responsible for it

1376
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,815
Hypnotism

1377
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
You're right

1378
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,679
Alex is probably lying

1379
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:13,471
But if he's not lying

1380
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,543
That the Christ is cousin he's just

1381
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,079
Snitched on cousin for a felony

1382
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:25,247
Great use of your time Alex

1383
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,783
Talk about the globalist

1384
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,879
Here are you snitching on your cousin

1385
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,159
Can punk ass Alex

1386
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,207
Betty White

1387
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:34,975
Could be

1388
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,047
You got a brain chip now is not the same guy

1389
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:41,119

Years ago

1393
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,151
Fits like a tracking chip

1394
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,783
That's basically find my phone

1395
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,831
Basically work

1396
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:03,135

01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:08,767
Traveling

1402
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:12,351
Killer whales dolphins

1403
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,119
Frankly

1404
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,167
Directions

1405
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,079
I get it there's privacy issue

1406
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,103
You don't want to be

1407
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,663
Where's like that

1408
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,943
As far as

1409
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,247
GPS chips

1410
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,271
If we can't open

1411
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,807
The Floodgate Of chip talk

1412
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:35,391
Because if everyone had

1413
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:42,047
They Carried with them at all times with GPS technology somebody couldn't

1414
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,143
Maybe there's a f******

1415
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,703
What's it called

1416
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,055
Whatever it is

1417
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,103
Specifically for the NSA

1418
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,639
Do you ever you are

1419
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:59,455
Turn into a recording right

1420
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:02,527
Like all of this

1421
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,831
You have a f******

1422
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,903
I do

1423
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,951
Anytime that mean

1424
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,743
Right now I have it in the refrigerator

1425
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,511
Definitely not

1426
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,279
Right next to

1427
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,559
You could have

1428
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
Sidekick

1429
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,167
Taking a sidekick

1430
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,239
I mean frankly at this point

1431
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:25,055
Walkie-talkie

1432
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:30,943
Isaias released on the internet now

1433
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,759
Stroom some horrible stuff on this

1434
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,807
Which is

1435
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,415
My advice to everyone listening to

1436
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,999
Download signal double-ended encryption

1437
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,279
You're much better off

1438
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,303
That is

1439
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,351
Publix

1440
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,655
The public service announcement

1441
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,983
It's a given this next clip

1442
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,335
Whatever the reasons you think

1443
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,871
It's not racing

1444
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,663
Really

1445
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,711
HBK

1446
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,991
Because

1447
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,295
They didn't love guns

1448
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:13,695
History of the Civil Rights

1449
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,975
To look

1450
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:21,631
0 understanding of that I'm putting words in his mouth slightly what I'm trying to say is that he believes that

1451
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,935
Gun March

1452
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,471
Is more important than

1453
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:29,311
Some civil rights

1454
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:33,151
People already there Center going to show up

1455
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,431
Weather firearm

1456
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:38,271
The Alamo

1457
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,343
Marshwood land commissioner

1458
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,135
And we can

1459
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,071
He went and ate the lunch counter and you can just go straight to hell if you don't like it

1460
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,703
Hardcore human rights god-given rights civil rights movements

1461
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,239
Liberalism

1462
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:01,311
In Thomas Jefferson Gunn property

1463
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,103

I'm so excited

1467
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:16,927
And I just can't hide it I think I may go down

1468
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,743
Even your flat Alex your Flats

1469
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,119
I can't think of anywhere

1470
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:31,775
Obviously you are a large group of all white men

1471
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:35,359
Only corollary to your situation

1472
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,407
You're so off base already

1473
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:40,735
Jakari Jackson the black dude and the woman

1474
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:43,295
I already off

1475
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111
Thank you

1476
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:51,743
So this next clip Alex Jones said some things about

1477
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,375
But I don't know what

1478
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:02,495
Alex Jones talks a little bit about foreign influence in the government

1479
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:05,055
Which is a little bit

1480
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,103
It's a little nowadays

1481
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:10,687
Alex UTSA particularly

1482
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:17,855
Being usurped by degenerate criminal scum.

1483
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:21,183
Control reality they're the trendy's

1484
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,279
Chicken neck

1485
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:32,191
Gatlinburg vacation

1486
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,567
You never want a serious crisis to go to waste

1487
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:42,431
What I mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could

1488
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,343
He's an officer in the Israeli military

1489
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,647
Call Manuel

1490
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:11,615
It's not fun is there is there

1491
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,895
Any position

1492
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:13,919
That

1493
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:14,943
The GOP

1494
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,271
Were you literally

1495
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,807
Butwell

1496
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,575
Everything

1497
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,343
Single position they

1498
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,623
You can go back

1499
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,903
Very short

1500
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,183
And find them

1501
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,463
India

1502
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,791
0 people free of this

1503
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:34,655
Especially endemic now because we had Obama in office

1504
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,471
And they hated him so much

1505
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,591
F****** McConnell said it

1506
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,639
My only job is

1507
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,431
Make sure that he is not allowed

1508
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,503
Things to do with gov

1509
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,063
And everything to do with

1510
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:52,831
Don't want him

1511
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,903
Forgot about this

1512
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,463
So the craziest part of this is vague

1513
01:19:59,487 --> 01:19:59,999
The

1514
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:02,559
Situation that there a debt work

1515
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,351
We're in our government

1516
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,375
Utterly

1517
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
Worthless

1518
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:11,263
You can't work with anybody because they already set the

1519
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:15,360
You can't do it and you know they're going to get snake bit

1520
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,920
Somebody back bite you

1521
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:21,760
I totally forgot about this

1522
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,296
Today on the show

1523
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,320
Rodger Stone

1524
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,624
What's going on why did Jag

1525
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:33,024
About how Joe McCarthy was a good man

1526
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,560
In Hollywood

1527
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,376
Where were they were they all red

1528
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:44,544
And he's like

1529
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,336
You know what who has real Blacklist

1530
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,104
Oh no

1531
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:52,480
The Blacklist

1532
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:57,856
Calling black anchors on CNN

1533
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:01,952
You can't do that

1534
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:08,352
Also repeatedly has Roland Martin calling him a quotes

1535
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,656
Stupid negro in a fat negro

1536
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,192
So

1537
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:17,312
He also referred to Rowan Martin is

1538
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,848
Quote quote

1539
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,128
Spy CNN

1540
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,920
Rodger stone is

1541
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,480
Is attack

1542
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:26,272
Last year tweeting Misfits

1543
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:32,160
Immediate matters funded by Dirty Clinton money try and orchestrated hit on me for calling out idiots and Navarro

1544
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,184
And Roland Martin

1545
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,000
Really not that you called about it

1546
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,280
You called him

1547
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,816
Negro

1548
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:44,192
You're not allowed

1549
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:48,288
Well we find this behavior unacceptable

1550
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,104
Anyway

1551
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,152
So yeah McCarthy School

1552
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:53,920
For now

1553
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,480
We're going to get to some meat and potatoes

1554
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,808
Supposed to be about the Malaysian flight

1555
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,856
Again you forgotten already

1556
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,648
It's hard it's hard not to

1557
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:07,744
After the death unless he ties the devil in

1558
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,024
The reason the Malaysian

1559
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,304
Play

1560
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,840
I'm going to forget he's talking about the

1561
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:18,240
Play Devil Went Down

1562
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,312
Now he doesn't do that but he does

1563
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,128
Think Siri Amelia Earhart

1564
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,968
Plane went down

1565
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:31,552
Can I talk about

1566
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:34,112
I told her 11

1567
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:37,440
Came out

1568
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:49,216
Free smart devices smart cars appointment

1569
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:55,104
California Australia

1570
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,152
So I would tell people about this

1571
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:03,040
The only real Ender phone calls.

1572
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,136
Battle came out

1573
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:11,744
The real are phone calls there's gas we can't breathe

1574
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:16,096
My alarm

1575
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,120
Regardless

1576
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,680
Don't know what happened in Malaysia

1577
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:24,032
They could have blown it somewhere else change the transponders we don't know

1578
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,568
They could even crashed

1579
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:29,664
Yeah Siri

1580
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,432
Right

1581
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,456
Lichen

1582
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:35,296
So Alex Jones apparently I didn't even realize this

1583
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,344
But that was the theory he landed on

1584
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,720
Control flown into the building

1585
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:48,096
I didn't know anything he landed on in terms of

1586
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,144
I guess that's

1587
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,984
Is that better than a false flag operation

1588
01:23:54,240 --> 01:24:00,128
It would be it would be like the NSA

1589
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:03,968
Control the government

1590
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:07,040
And this is also the terrorist around on it

1591
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,088
Revelation

1592
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,648
Which is why they're going

1593
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,608
Regional Alex

1594
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,912
What are the sources

1595
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,704
The devil

1596
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,008
Both

1597
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,288
They tagged

1598
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,872
Call Alex

1599
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,688
A real call

1600
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,224
The one from 911

1601
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,528
Yeah it's kind of interesting

1602
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:40,832
If you read the transcript of it

1603
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,112
But it doesn't

1604
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,648
Save it there's gas

1605
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,184
And we can't breathe

1606
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:45,952
What does it say

1607
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,232
They were saying

1608
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,048
Who was on the phone

1609
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,328
Was saying that

1610
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,608
She believed

1611
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,144
That someone had used me

1612
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:58,240
And that some people were having trouble

1613
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,312
If you want to go really far with it

1614
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,336
Extrapolate

1615
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,872
As Alex loves

1616
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,920
You could take that to me

1617
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:12,832
Hey there's a lot of hurdles of a story we don't know

1618
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:17,696
To overtake the attackers with maze

1619
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:22,304
Some of the attackers might have had mace and use their own people to

1620
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,144
If you had any

1621
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,424
Like if you had met

1622
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,704
Of course you're going to do

1623
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:33,568
There's a number of explanations

1624
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,872
That call

1625
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:38,944
Involve the planes being remote control

1626
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,224
Anyway

1627
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,248
I don't care

1628
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,272
So Jordan

1629
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:43,808
Be ready for this

1630
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:44,576
No

1631
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,600
It's time

1632
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,392
We've gone on

1633
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:50,464
A very Malaysia plane list Adventure

1634
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:56,352
So far throughout their what is

1635
01:25:56,608 --> 01:26:00,448
We need to go deeper into the zero we are

1636
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,984
Because Alex Jones

1637
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,312
Gets super defensive about super male vitality

1638
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,616
He starts a commercial that last

1639
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:08,896
For f****** ever

1640
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:13,248
I put up some parts of it but just to give you an idea it's at least like 15 minute

1641
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,808
This is how he starts

1642
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:22,208
Answer this s*** so defensive offence

1643
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:22,976
Is it about it

1644
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,256
Here we go

1645
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:34,496
Comments on YouTube

1646
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,896
Male enhancement drops

1647
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,688
Really

1648
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,712
Yeah you better

1649
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:48,832
Herbs concentrated blow your freaking stock sauce

1650
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:55,488
Yeah you bet

1651
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,792
They ain't even seen bone broth yet

1652
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:01,376
No idea what kind of male enhancement there

1653
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:04,448
Yeah

1654
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,240
Male enhancer

1655
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:09,056
Rent is coming baby hold on

1656
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:12,640
This is so important for our analysis of Alex Jones

1657
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:18,784
It is basically a boner

1658
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:24,416
We talked about it as a pill

1659
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,952
And we've been kind of glib

1660
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,048
Cape May

1661
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,864
You know that's a powder you put in milk or whatever

1662
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,144
It turns out

1663
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,168
Weave

1664
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,472
Superman Vitality is a liqueur

1665
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,008
It comes in a dropper

1666
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,544
And you put it under your tongue

1667
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:41,568
Basically

1668
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:45,408
What it comes like in an eyedropper bottle

1669
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,688
Lakers it's

1670
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,712
So

1671
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,296
What

1672
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,344
You take a dropper

1673
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,112
Yes

1674
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:59,232
You put supermodel Vitality underneath your tongue

1675
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:05,632
Is there a reason behind that I don't know does male Vitality come from

1676
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,056
To get into whether or not it's a boner

1677
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,360
At this point

1678
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,408
The time has come it has come

1679
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,944
And I'm going to tell you this

1680
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:22,528
We're not going to get a direct answer

1681
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:26,880
Between $10 each

1682
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,416
Process

1683
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,952
That is

1684
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:34,048
Male enhancement

1685
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,936
Nobody put shop products cost twenty bucks

1686
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:44,800
I'm about to buy a product for mitochondrial DNA nobody else is putting out

1687
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,848

Really powerful stuff okay

1695
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:14,752
And

1696
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,544
Disability

1697
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:21,152
Story

1698
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,944
Everyone in the office

1699
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,528
We don't advertise it as an aphrodisiac

1700
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,088
That is not the intention it is

1701
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,976
It doesn't have any

1702
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:38,048
Testosterone mimickers like most

1703
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,240
This is design

1704
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:49,568
2222

1705
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:54,176
Get your body to release its own growth hormone

1706
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,504
I don't know what it's doing

1707
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,832
So that's what

1708
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:02,112
So that's what group

1709
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,136
Says it's doing

1710
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,416
Now

1711
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,696
Dr. group

1712
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:06,976
Is the guy

1713
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:07,744
Who makes

1714
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,304
Right

1715
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,608
I looked up dr. Drew

1716
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:13,888
He works

1717
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:14,912
Run

1718
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,680
The place called

1719
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,960
The global Healing Center

1720
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,032
Based out of Houston

1721
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:24,640
And if you go to their website you can find a picture of him he looks crazy

1722
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:31,296
He looks like a hippie kind of weirdo look like

1723
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:34,624
I'm Petty there's a little bit of that like

1724
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:38,464
Unfortunately they give

1725
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,256
His educational background

1726
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,120
Ishq

1727
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:47,424
Well I like that

1728
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,728
It's from the Texas Chiropractic College

1729
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:52,288
Yeah it's a doctor of Chiropractic

1730
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:57,152
Can you even do that at the Texas Chiropractic School

1731
01:30:57,408 --> 01:31:00,736
I don't think that accredited

1732
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:01,760
Not accredited

1733
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:08,160
So you also went to the MIT Sloan School of Management which there's no real like graduation

1734
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,208
But I assume he actually went there

1735
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,512
Got the other is a diplomat

1736
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:17,632
A diplomat of the Chiropractic Board of clinicals

1737
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,400
Attrition

1738
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,680
From the cradle

1739
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,960
Board of clinical nutrition

1740
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:24,544
He's a diplomat of the American Board of functional medicine

1741
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:25,568
Britches

1742
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,104
Dubious

1743
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:34,272
He has a bunch of degrees from the natural healing Institute of neuropathy

1744
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,624
Greed from lies

1745
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:45,280
Is a neuropathic practitioner degree a certified clinical nutritionist degree

1746
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:48,352
Holistic healing

1747
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:51,936
What is certified clinical herbalist

1748
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,704
The Great

1749
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:53,984
From

1750
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,288
The natural healing Institute of harappa

1751
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,568
Do you know what that means

1752
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,104
WhatsApp

1753
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,152
Not neuropathy I'm sorry natural

1754
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:04,992
Little letters

1755
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,016
Okay

1756
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:07,808
I get

1757
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,344
Why you would

1758
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,368
Say it to

1759
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,184
But

1760
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,720
The mitochondria

1761
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:15,744
Is not where you find

1762
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,888
Perichondrium

1763
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,424
The engine of a cell

1764
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,728
It has no DNA and then whatsoever

1765
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,544
More important

1766
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,824
Alright

1767
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:36,736
Basic biology he also claims in his educational background that he went to the Harvard Business School

1768
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:40,320
Go to the Harvard Business of developing

1769
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:44,672
Bulshit Prada

1770
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,208

01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,744
From the Harvard Business

1772
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:48,768
I don't know what that

1773
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,048
No one really does

1774
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,584
The owner and president

1775
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,608
Management program

1776
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,656
The Harvard Business School.

1777
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:55,680
If you look into

1778
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,592
You pay $30,000

1779
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:04,640
You pay like $30,000

1780
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:07,712
And there's no educational requirement

1781
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,480
They just

1782
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:13,088
Like a fundraising business management

1783
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:19,488
Tyra Banks got in big trouble cuz she claimed that she went to the Harvard Business School at Trinidad it was this

1784
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:23,584
Everyone clown daughter real heart

1786
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,936
Institute of naturopathy

1787
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,216

1788
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,496
F******

1789
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,288
Homeopathy

1790
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,568
They have a Yelp

1791
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,408
Lotto one-star reviews

1792
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,712
I want to read one for you

1793
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:41,760
This is a terrible School

1794
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:45,600
I've almost completed the distance learning program for holistic health practitioner

1795
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,904
And I would not recommend this cool to anyone

1796
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,512
Far from a completely disorganized

1797
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:56,096
Trouble completely disorganized staff was asked me to resubmit work

1798
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,912
Typos on most of the task

1799
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,680
And hidden

1800
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,960
Extension fees for

1801
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,496
Completing the course with an 18-month

1802
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,568
At the top of each study guide

1803
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,360
Dear friend and student

1804
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,920
We wish to emphasize that there are no deadlines

1805
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:12,224
Complete your lessons

1806
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:17,344
Complete your lessons and submit your open-book exams and or projects at your own pace

1807
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,136
As your own schedule allows

1808
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,672
What they don't tell you

1809
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:23,744
Is it for every 6 months you go beyond 18 months

1810
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,792
They will charge you $5,200

1811
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,352
And hold your degree hostage until you pay them

1812
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:31,936
I'm only finding out this information at the very end of my training course

1813
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,216
It gets worse

1814
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,520
I took a shiatsu course

1815
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:42,176
I took a shiatsu class in person

1816
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:49,344
I took a shiatsu class in person with them

1817
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,672
So we could draw meridian lines with magic markers on each other

1818
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,256
I told him accredited

1819
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:58,560
I told him if that was how he felt

1820
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,608
You should make all the guys wear Speedos

1821
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,888
To which you replied

1822
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:04,704
No one wants to see that

1823
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:12,384
That is the type of school where dr. group

1824
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,152
Has

1825
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,016
Super weird but that is also what happened in

1826
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,296
English let 1014

1827
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,344
Who's the fairy difference

1828
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,904
Is it I had to wear a Speedo otherwise I

1829
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,184

1830
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464

Chiropractic Chiropractic

1834
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:41,312
He's a Chiropractic Doctor hold on

1835
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:46,176
The other doctor that involved at all the enforces dr. Wallach was a veterinarian

1836
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,736
Dick

1837
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:51,552
Hanging out who are fake doctors

1838
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:55,904
Dr. group

1840
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:03,584
Anna patch

So makes Alex's dick hard though

1842
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,776
Alex in that last clip said

1843
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:12,800
I don't know if I can

1844
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,592
And that

1845
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,360
Is a reference

1846
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,640
Throbbed

1847
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:20,224
Rob do what did Rob do do while we're going to find out

1848
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,992
Cuz Alex

1849
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:24,576
Is so obsessed with telling the story that he can't tell

1850
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:27,648
That he has someone go grab Rob do

1851
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:33,280
Who is putting together the Nightly News

1852
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:36,864
Yeah oh yeah

1853
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,656
Cuz I was like this is classified as

1854
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:43,776
So he goes and has someone fetch around 2 and bring him in

1855
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,312
And Rob do

1856
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,848
Precedes to give

1857
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:50,432
And Incredibly weird super male vitality

1858
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,504

So I want I wanted to stop here for a second

1863

This is going to be a little bit it's like

1865
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,592
3 minutes long

1866
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,872
A male page

1867
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,456
This is where it ends

1868
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,736

I can't prove or disprove

1876
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,512

About 5 minutes

1898
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:58,688
And I'm thinking clearly and I feel like I don't I don't feel overly abundant energy like when I drink

1899
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,600
It is definitely mellowed me out

1900
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:12,000

01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:24,800
And I like it

1902
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:31,200
And I've definitely noticed that maybe that's why they're all insane cuz they're all taking their own

1903
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,648
Project energy

1904

I just know that the entire time Alex is smiling more than I've ever seen him smile on the show

1911
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:22,144
We're so happy about the question he's about to

01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:50,464
You just could give a s*** about this person

2085
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:53,280
Dismissive

2086
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:56,352
Malaysian blade

2087
01:49:56,608 --> 01:50:00,448
Guy gives weird. About nukes

2088
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,824
Alright alright

2089
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,848
New Angle

2090
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:09,408
We've come

2091
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,456
Billy talked about whether or not Alex

2092
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,992
Is evil or stupid

2093
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,272
And when

2094
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,552
He's being evil

2095
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:16,576
Stupid

2096
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,112
Baby

2097
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:20,416
His brain is

2098
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:21,184
F***** up

2099
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,208
With all this s***

2100
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:28,608
He's taking all the time

2101
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:33,472
I think that this might be right around the beginning of his supplements

2102
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,240
Destroying

2103
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,520
Why would you put

2104
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:41,920
And you've already

2105
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:46,784
Lego full thing you get irritable

2106
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:52,416
3 minutes of the show

2107
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,184
Burger

2108
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:58,304
Rob has asked him to Steph

2109
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:03,936
Stop

2110
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,008
Telling Alex

2111
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,872
Imagine his ex-wife is probably telling him also

2112
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,432
So

2113
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,200
That

2114
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,480
Is so

2115
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:17,760
Dive on

2116
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:21,856
Weird

2117
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:26,208
Hallucinate

2118
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:28,000
I don't know

2119
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:30,048
I don't know

2120
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,864
This is this to me

2121
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,144
Is slowly poisoning

2122
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:36,192
They might be

2123
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:39,776
Jimmy

2124
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:42,336
When we talk about the stupid evil continuum

2125
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,616
That's genius

2126
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,408
Tumi

2127
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,432
Really funny

2128
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,968
It's hilarious

2129
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:50,272
I don't like the idea that

2130
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,808
Dressing up as the Joker

2131
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,856
I don't think of it like

2132
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:57,440
I like the idea of other people taking his supplements

2133
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:02,560
But just him doing it on air

2134
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,840
Overall this

2135
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:05,888
Boner pill on this burger

2136
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:10,496
This burger

2137
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,776
Without all this

2138
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:12,800
Satanic

2139
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:15,616
You put some super male vitality

2140
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:17,408
Not satanic lyrics

2141
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:20,992
I can't stress this enough

2142
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:26,880
The facial gestures and his body language once he starts eating a burger at gets on the phone call

2143
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:28,416
Are there

2144
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:29,440
There

2145
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,256
Like top-notch sketch artist

2146
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:33,280
Kind of nuance

2147
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,560
It's so funny

2148
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,352
Picton

2149
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,120
Physically

2150
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:42,240
How little he cares about the phone call all he wants to do is eat to supplement laced Burger

2151
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,336
Kind of want to try it it's like a

2152
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,104
Like a

2153
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:47,872
Like

2154
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:55,040
If a new drug comes out like I like if there's a better mvma I'm kind of like

2155
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:58,624
Give that a shot like I want to see what about adrenochrome

2156
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,440
That seems like a bummer

2157
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:03,232
Two more clips

2158
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,280
Left to play

2159
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:06,560
Work

2160
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,328
Vitality

2161
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:10,144
That's a good question I don't know

2162
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:14,240
If Alex is a false flag

2163
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,264
Which some

2164
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,800
Even harder right

2165
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:18,080
Conspiracy theorists believe

2166
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,640
Superman Vitality might be

2167
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:23,200
Be the first taste of adrenochrome for

2168
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:29,856
Could be could be

2169
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:31,648
We all know the elites

2170
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:32,928
Take all your products

2171
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:36,256
I want

2172
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:43,424
Super male Vitality on my burger

2173
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:51,360
Vitality

2174
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,384
Animal style

2175
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:55,456
In this

2176
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:56,224
These last

2177
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:56,992
Clips

2178
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,272
Finally gets

2179
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:00,832
Stop talking about Malaysia

2180
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:03,392
Playing up Malaysian flight 370

2181
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:06,464
Super male vitality

2182
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:08,768
Yeah and he's off the air

2183
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:10,816
Ladies in overdrive

2184
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,120
This

2185
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,400
Clip is about

2186
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:17,472
The best tea does it's been two sizing what do you think

2187
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:19,008
You don't think much

2188
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:24,896
There's really not much of anything here so I'll let him get to it

2189
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:31,552
Malaysia flight I'm leaning towards hijacking and somebody's flying

2190
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,976
I'm not sure about that

2191
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:44,608
Yes you do

2192
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:54,592
Persian Gulf

2193
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:57,408
Terry

2194
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:13,280
I don't know

2195
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:15,328
Whodunnit

2196
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:17,888
It's kind of sad

2197
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:22,240
We want him to come up with

2198
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:24,544
I imagine within like the next week

2199
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:29,152
After this key cop puts together something that's fun or something that's nutty

2200
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,944
But at this point

2201
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:35,552
But you you latched on

2202
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:38,368
Something

2203
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:39,648
Of course

2204
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:45,280
How to say is that it's

2205
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:46,816
They already

2206
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:48,352
I'm thinking

2207
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:49,376
Yeah they

2208
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:50,912
Facebook it down

2209
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:57,312
Everything

2210
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:04,224
Play Audible

2211
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:06,528
Iranians

2212
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:12,160
Are you talking about before I pretty much

2213
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:24,192
Appreciate your call

2214
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:34,944
I don't want sugar

2215
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:37,760
Reportedly

2216
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,600
I just think they look like capable very serious

2217
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:43,136
Automation

2218
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:55,680
Obama's innocent of everything as well

2219
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:58,240
That really kind of the pictures real feeling

2220
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:05,920
Yeah

2221
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:08,736
I do think that this is so

2222
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:11,040
This is so

2223
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:12,576
Considering this

2224
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:13,856
The guy who is like

2225
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:20,512
Yeah Chobani yogurt is hiring Muslim refugees rape people

2226
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:25,888
How how can you be so sure like this is a like I said he's on autopilot

2227
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:29,472
His his racism is just kind of like

2228
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:31,776
Like

2229
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,968
Look like

2230
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:45,344
The part of the most important part and I also do crafts

2231
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,904
Vitality relationship

2232
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:51,488
With my wife the reality is

2233
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,072
Could have been

2234
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:58,400
Could have been that wet the whole the whole thing was about Superman

2235
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:00,960
Do you want to divorce your wife

2236
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:06,848
I think I think they're still married

2237
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:10,176
You do with the lady asks

2238
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,224
Not if she's bossy

2239
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:17,088
Why didn't Alex use that opportunity

2240
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:20,928
To be like

2241
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:25,792
Beyonce would say cuz he's back by the bank's multinational corporation

2242
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:28,096
Bossy ass wife

2243
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,168
Coppell

2244
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:34,240
Spell rhabdo

2245
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:35,520
I don't know

2246
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:38,080
Colossal fantasy there

2247
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:44,480
That was a weird little reverie you dived into the other thing I was thinking about is like

2248
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:46,016
Akira

2249
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:54,464
It's not

2250
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,560
You're the one who's in love with Leah macadoodle in love with her

2251
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:00,096
She's great

2252
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:03,168
The other thing I was thinking was the possibility

2253
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:05,984
That his ba big on autopilot

2254
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,776
Is somewhat related to him being super

2255
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,824
Cuz he did say

2256
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:13,152
I forgot to eat

2257
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:15,968
I would never blame

2258
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:17,504
His being off-topic

2259
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:19,040
On being hungry

2260
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:20,064
But maybe he was

2261
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:22,624
Hungry to really ramp

2262
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,160
And get mad about stuff

2263
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:26,720
Like he's spent a lot of energy on that devil

2264
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:30,560
Right

2265
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:32,352
I don't know if that's possible

2266
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:35,936
There's no good series on air

2267
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:37,216
With supplements on it

2268
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:37,984
I've condom

2269
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:40,032
That's the most

2270
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:41,056
Disgusting thing I can

2271
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:42,080
It was rough

2272
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:43,616
