1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,816
Citarella

6
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
Text Jose

7
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,656
Indeed we are.

8
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,264
Aggressive

9
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
What's up

10
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,824
Request

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,920
Existed until recently

12
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,944
Grocery shopping

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
And I

14
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
What happened to spy

15
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
With my little eye

16
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
I saw

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
Frozen mini pancakes

18
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Frozen mini pancakes

19
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
Snoflo but it definitely not

20
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
I thought they were going to be really gross probably or just a disaster but I thought like that why the f*** not give it a try

21
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,824
That you feel I went to novel things shows up where you like

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Is going to be garbage

23
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,688
Eddie Griffin

24
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
It's

25
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
These things are great

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,296
Corsair

27
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,344
Good pancakes

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,904
And may take 30 seconds to microwave

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,000
Do you want a couple

30
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,096
That's great right now

31
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
Tell me you say the word I'll get you some little mini pancakes at episode of the coming weeks

32
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
Better make me a mini pack

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
Easy to make pancake

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
I can do that

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,200
But there are things that I don't always have in the house

36
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
Milkshakes

37
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
I don't know if I can make

38
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Pancakes with coconut milk

39
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
You can enter really

40
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
Oh yeah

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,184
Not as well

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
Not as good I like oatmeal more than I like

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,144
I'll never need to make pancakes again

44
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,728
Cuz I'm a little Frozen

45
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Come to the end of our show

46
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
What's

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
My bright spot is there is

48
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,992
The new album from the band royksopp Icelandic

49
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
Seen that name before

50
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,832
Play Icelandic answer to death punk

51
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,184
Do they they make some beep boop Noise music

52
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
They worked extended

53
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Chablis with cakes

54
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,144
Comedian said that's the Norwegian Simon and Garfunkel

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
What's the monarchy

56
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,496
Exactly you got Icelandic death punk

57
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,568
Norwegian Simon & Garfunkel

58
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:30,432
I'm pretty sure lady Trunks from Belgium look like my inability to understand

59
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
But yeah

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,624
I have been looking for some new people check it out

61
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
Today we are sticking around to the old pass because I don't really care

62
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,120
Care about Alex doing the present-day we're all dead already

63
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,520
I got another million-dollar difficult to get motivated

64
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,128
It may be more productive use of our time

65
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
Analyzing and looking at some of the stuff in the past

66
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
And recognizing how it implicates

67
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Expand

68
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
And actually provides greater context

69
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
4

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
List of the typing in the prison

71
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,536
Agree with you it does seem like listening to the show in the present is just a exercise in futility instead of being part of a larger

72
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,167
Yeah he's yelling about stuff

73
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
Yeah

74
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:29,823
Really depressed he got a million dollars now everyone's going to die the wrong about the Bible

75
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
But we might get into that even if

76
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
Just the case

77
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,039
Virgil

78
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,599
2003

79
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
It is actually Thursday and Friday I only know this because in one of the episodes

80
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,303
Said it's Friday

81
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,143

Thank you very much now I don't see the line in the case of Charles Dexter Ward

91
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,247
One of the I don't know

92
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,319
I don't know I've heard that one in a while that one might be problematic

93
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
Yeah probably

94
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,927
Oh no hold on I think

95
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
Not good

96
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:56,607
For most of his work

97
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:01,983
Whenever the nerdy thing is he for you cuz you got a you got to deal with it you got to go like my nerdy shout at them like

98
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,335
Estero that's all I just got to wrestle with affected Lovecraft was

99
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Monster for

100
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
The greater part of his career

101
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,991
Next to the three wise men

102
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,551

Thank you very much

105
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,167
Discover these to hear days in past hands

106
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:37,823
Past episode we saw him talk to John Sebastian Robo Global Research

107
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,151
And build

108
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,783
Never never a bad time for a bill boshears and the guy who was trying to get to Arnold

109
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,879
You can off the Davis

110
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:57,279
Taking out-of-office office by the guy who

111
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
Who wanted to do it but then had to drop out because he took some issues so we paid for it

112
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
That's right it wasn't a direct

113
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
Like he was being paid by hammer

114
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,335
I said funded a lot of the early efforts to get

115
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
The recall recall going

116
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,735
Not necessarily connected to this guy's name

117
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,087
Is collusion a fun name

118
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
That is important for today because

119
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,975
Nothing nothing is related

120
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
Here is not a complex drop

121
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Today Show

122
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,079
Who was that guy who was that guy Alex

123
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:48,479
Call Elijah

124
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
Okay you can't forget Laura

125
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
That's a that's a boy washing

126
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,695
Alex should know that one that you think that's not

127
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,095
So here on the 31st of July

128
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,447
Maybe I don't do a great job generally

129
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,127
Also I want to stop right there for a second

130
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,479
I really am coming around on the idea that Rogan stole powerful from Alex

131
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:25,087
Okay I think that there is a decent to eat

132
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
He's been going for so long with the powerful women 2013

133
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,351
I'm saying is a powerful breakfast and does that too

134
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,423
Restart his shows on Fear Factor with this

135
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
This is going to be a powerful broadcast believe so but he did

136
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:47,359
Blues radio every episode started with.

137
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:52,479
Yeah

138
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
Free imallexx

139
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Friday

140
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
It's true

141
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,735
That's nice of him to admit to responsibility for his is failures

142
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Swell

143
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,135
Responsibility of his descriptively saying that he is not covering the news

144
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,535
You would expect like a change of behavior

145
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,863
Subdue of wrongdoing and I promise no longer to continue that bad

146
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
I don't like it's time

147
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,727
He spends a lot of the show ranting about how he doesn't like sports

148
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,175
You're in a cult if you are watch this so the possibility that you could just

149
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
Is go up to somebody and say

150
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
I failed you

151
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:03,135
I've been move on that so nothing ever happened

152
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
How many does get to some

153
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
The news

154
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
If you want to call it that

155
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,631
No. Not any more than normal

156
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,983
Alex just be something here at the beginning that I think is really interesting and then he does

157
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,847
Not explain any further

158
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
This is fascinating

159
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
If you don't

160
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
Listen to this Joe

161
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Parameter

162
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
The New World Order

163
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
The Illuminati

164
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
The globular

165
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,775
What

166
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Understanding

167
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,503
Underworld

168
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
And that has happened

169
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,439
So I know kind of what he's saying cuz he said stuff like this before

170
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,839
But if you don't like taking active participation in the infowar sure what it's doing is

171
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:22,239
Acclimating you to these horrible things that the globalists are doing so you'll think they're normal

172
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:28,383
The pot getting a little warmer with the frog in it unless you're active

173
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,199
In some way but that's supposed to waking you up

174
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:37,599
Numbing you problem that I have is what are those parameters you have to have in mind

175
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:42,975
These parameters are that Alex

176
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,535
You need in order to engage with his work

177
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,935
Maybe I just don't have those parameters in place I think it's physics

178
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
But I think it's up down love

179
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,055
And then charm I don't

180
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
Forget the other two corks but I think those are the parameter

181
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
I think it's AABB AABB

182
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,927
I was thinking of the code for Aladdin

183
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,231
Text quite remember

184
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,327
Yeah I don't know I was really interested because I

185
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,119
I think that there is a

186
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
Like if there is a recognition that Alex is like

187
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Alright

188
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,079
There are these 3D glasses that you have to view this through it looks like a jumbled mess

189
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
I would like to know what he

190
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,687
Fink's 3D glasses are metaphorically

191
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
If maybe what we're describing here is is there an earpiece that you can wear that is analogous to the

192
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,415
Sunglasses in Vail ID right right or is there a cipher

193
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:50,815
That I can translate and then you spin the wheel to get the code

194
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
I get it but we don't have any parameters explained

195
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
So

196
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
I guess I'll just have

197
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
Have to do the best I can

198
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,055
So here's a story actually Alex getting to the news

199
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,943
Marriott

200
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
I really work

201
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
20

202
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
Millionday kill

203
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Call Dan

204
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Comparison

205
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,959
So point I really want to stress in my cupboard to these episodes from the past and the reason why I think they're important

206
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,287
The disgust is always right around the corner

207
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,943
Alex is no different than any of these doomsday preachers or try to rile up their congregation with claims that the end is near only to be

208
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,295
Wrong and then do the whole thing over again a little bit later pretending the first time didn't happen

209
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:21,183
When we hear Alexandra people like him in the right-wing media and parts of our government playing this game in the present day

210
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
It's important to understand that they're not Siri

211
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
This isn't

212
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
But they're doing

213
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
They're doing for RVs

214
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Yeah

215
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
Yeah you know I mean

216
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,495
I feel like even if you are making an absurd amount of money with

217
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
Still get old create

218
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
After a while right

219
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,895
You're coming at this with the expectation that there is a creative

220
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
Wow that's a really good that I mean.

221
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,135
Is driven by Lake necessarily a creative

222
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Sure

223
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
Some people are driven by like order

224
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Like you know liking

225
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
Spreadsheets and

226
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
Well I mean WhatsApp

227
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Show

228
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:06,239
That's not necessarily artistic not radio show

229
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,823
My head all like radio shows have to be based on some sort of

230
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,223
Creative desire or need to do that never occurred to me that you could do a radio show like go to a cold

231
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
Wine every morning

232
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:22,367
Put my little hat on and clogging it up but instead of something

233
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
Productive like mining your

234
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:30,303
Scaring people with b*******

235
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,631
It started with a story that Alex was talking about

236
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Camera

237
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Fanta it's

238
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
It's about Marriott

239
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,543
Security cameras and Alex is entirely misreporting that that story

240
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,639
There was a guy named Brian Brewer who found a camera in his bathrooms lights

241
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
Fixture at a hotel he was staying at in Tennessee

242
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,015
He'd accidentally broke in the light which is no yet

243
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,135
Hayden response he filed a lawsuit against Marriott for 1.5 billion dollars

244
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,255
I can't find the story that Alex is responding to here but the actual

245
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
Case was filed in September 2000

246
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,935
I'm guessing July 2003 either the case was dismissed or they reached a settlement

247
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:13,823
The issue was that the courts were never deciding or even asked to decide if the Marriott could put cameras in their bathroom

248
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
Because that's not an issue here

249
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
No you can't do

250
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
The presumption is that someone else

251
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
Possibly an employee or possibly a past

252
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
Put the camera there in the suit was again

253
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,367
A hotel because they didn't catch that and Brewers privacy was violated

254
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,743
Even Alex is doing this absurd performance being so overwhelmed by the news and how he needs

255
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,279
To cover these important stories

256
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,351
You can't complete basic details of the things he's talking about

257
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,423
That's holy Because the actual events that happened

258
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Don't help him reinforces

259
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
So he just makes it up

260
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Right

261
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,615
Well I mean let me throw this at you

262
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,175
Is it possible that the

263
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Twice

264
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
In order to make sure that

265
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,575
Nobody can put cameras in the Marriott bathrooms anymore

266
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,159
They put cameras in the Marriott bathrooms in order to monitor

267
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,743
That could be or they could have done a thing where they're like

268
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
We will put

269
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,375
So many cameras bathroom that there's no room for anybody

270
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,959
Get tricked by being like all somebody what if somebody's watching me

271
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,055
After the football game press conference

272
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,663
Cerulean

273
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,271
So we got we got a little bit of another story maybe Alex is actually

274
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
Getting to the news

275
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
He's not dropping the ball

276
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
They're building.

277
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
Another Resident Evil types

278
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Raccoon City

279
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,215
Plan is to prepare biryani

280
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
Pencil

281
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Chronicle

282
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,263
Epidemiologist

283
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
Bio weapon

284
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,111
Was just a reminder that everything Alex is doing

285
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,415
Has been doing with covid is just a huge

286
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,719
Extension of the same propaganda game he plays with

287
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,511
Every vaccine that makes the news

288
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:44,095
It's always a bioweapon and the top epidemiologist

289
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,911
The major prestigious universities of said Soca

290
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,823
Bizarre compounder Weber Resident Evil umbrella

291
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,943
F****** thing this is what I hear this clip is about the smallpox vaccine it but honestly it could just be about any

292
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
It doesn't matter

293
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:07,647
Also they didn't build dozens of bsl-4 labs is Alex calls them bioweapons lab but that didn't happen no

294
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,231
As of the present day there were only thirteen in all of North America

295
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
So

296
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
Amanda little off

297
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,839
You know the problem with that, another false story

298
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
Problem with that Clayface

299
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,679
Is we really could have used a

300
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
Bunch

301
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,567
Bureaucratic infrastructure built in advance for inoculation

302
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,967
Some of that may have been helpful in some ways but I don't know necessarily

303
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:38,367
If he has I don't know if they would be as productive towards that goal

304
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
Think that having

305
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,463
Dozens and dozens of bsl-4 labs

306
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:46,303
Really help us that much did increase safety or decrease safety

307
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
I don't know if you would actually he even having

308
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Benefactor

309
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
That's nearly as dangerous as Alex makes them have to be

310
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,615
Work that needs to be done at them that you delete them in every city

311
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:06,271
You know how it is in like SimCity or civilization you don't need a theater in every

312
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:12,671
Call linear settlement like Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin Donuts

313
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,535
Like that kind of thing so the DSL Laboratories are also working with like

314
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
Food processing plant

315
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,447
That's that's usually good certainly isn't a present day

316
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,495
So Alex is a fun story

317
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,543
The man I love the story

318
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
I am so glad that

319
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,639
This comes up more than once on this episode

320
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
Belmont working on

321
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
And there are.

322
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:01,567
Mind control

323
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:07,199
Go in there and get around some things you know I don't want him near me

324
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Kimbrell's.

325
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,367
Everywhere DARPA taking over everywhere

326
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,208
No way

327
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:29,728
Just filming and I accidentally stumbled upon mind-control play

328
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,056
Plans

329
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,848
Divine

330
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,432
Kids math I think that's what it was made

331
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
Define this a different way worse person in the

332
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,648
World because he didn't take those documents

333
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
What you put you could get in trouble

334
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
Sure

335
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:56,864
Division of information Warfare EP engaged in that he would find

336
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,264
DARPA mind control documentary

337
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,360
And put them in a folder and left it on the desk.

338
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:13,760
Slowly backed away from the shadow gate situation that I don't deal with this

339
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,624
This is terrifying right whatever man

340
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
But

341
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
I guess we've talked about

342
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
The toll road

343
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Internal

344
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Point

345
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,856
When you have to serve

346
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
I could golf

347
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
Don't call

348
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:14,432
Terror attack which would be a false flag by the military-industrial complex

349
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,760
License will be forced to do Public Service searching people's Vehicles a checkpoint

350
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Another 65

351
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
None of that is even come

352
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
Close to happening

353
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:27,488
Had about a thousand different things have happened that Alex is called Volkswagen Terror attacks committed by the military-industrial

354
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,072
Constantly wrong about everything you said

355
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:37,472
That's pretty much he would be right if he was just like you know after that next terror attack they're going to make you take your shoes off

356
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,520
Forever even after you don't need to any

357
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,944
I think he'll probably claim he predicted that after it happened

358
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,968
G-Force 2

359
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,064
Work on the side of the road searching cars until you're 65 that's a bigger swing

360
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:56,672
Alexandra concerned about seatbelt rules back in 2003

361
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,840
Is preoccupation of the past

362
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
Seemed a little bit larger

363
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:12,288
In this clip Alex's rambling about how the government is going to put tracking chips into cars so they can tax you by the mile as you

364
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Drive

365
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:19,456
This is something we discussed in the past as it was one of the proposals that was being discussed in terms of

366
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
The money they were losing on gas taxes

367
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,296
Since cars were using less gas

368
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
There's new technologies emerge

369
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,184
That shortfall of gas tax revenue has serious consequences and terms

370
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,512
The budgets that are needed to maintain the roads these cars are driving on

371
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,816
So the proposed was actually a pretty sensible one

372
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,352
Dive makes intuitive sense

373
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,240
How do I get to Sanger the 1998 National seat belt initiative was about funding internal checkpoints

374
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
Naturally this is

375
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
Is not true

376
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,896
Most of the document is about increasing the Public's awareness of the benefits of wearing

377
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,224
A seatbelt and framing the decision to not wear one

378
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Appropriately

379
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
This involves

380
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
Focus on the issue as one that relates to your health

381
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
As well as making sure that

382
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
The perception wasn't solely focused on traffic

383
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,584
Because a huge factor is the injuries and that the accidents caused and expenses the people racked up

384
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
In public

385
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
Frances for that matter

386
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
Throughout the document it super clear that state

387
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,568
Are the ones who make traffic laws and the president or Congress can express that they would like state

388
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Needs to do more

389
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,200
Did you propose a four-part plan and what are the parts is

390
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:27,040
Quote conduct high-visibility enforcement of seat belt laws

391
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,624
This is probably what Alex is exaggerating out to his dump

392
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,440
Conspiracy but it's just the report expressing that

393
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,744
If people don't think laws are going to be enforced

394
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,792
They're probably less likely to follow the

395
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Click it or ticket

396
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:43,936
As always Alex isn't making s*** up to craft scary stories

397
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
Based on

398
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
Bill Clinton

399
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,568
Being like a people we need to get more people wearing seatbelts fidget spinners

400
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,384
Empirically shown to save lives

401
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
Call Celesta injuries in an accident

402
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
This is one of those

403
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
Such a like

404
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:05,952
Where were like oh my God these anti-maskers are terrible what if they were in a different time would they be anti seatbelt yeah

405
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,512
Yes

406
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
They would be anti seatbelt and be coming up with elaborate reason

407
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
Haribol

408
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
NECA

409
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,872
So I called them and complaining about how

410
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,968
I guess that if you're an undocumented immigrant

411
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
You get to like

412
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,808
Live fifty people to a house

413
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,904
But if you're just a good old white American

414
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
That's not allowed

415
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,232
Is this a

416
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
Problem

417
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
It is released

418
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
What you mentioned a few minutes ago

419
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Illegal

420
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
Illegal aliens

421
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,056
Living here in New York

422
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
It's true because I

423
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
I see that all the time

424
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
Family houses

425
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Converted into multiple

426
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,760
Dwellings where you literally will have done

427
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
People who are illegal immigrants

428
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,232
Obvious

429
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
And they do nothing about it

430
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,984
What

431
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,128
For a month while they're moving or something

432
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
Your door

433
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
And you're right

434
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:44,256
So these sorts of regulations are going to be on the state or even like a lower-level kind of issues like that

435
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,816
Really that upset about the zoning or housing regulations

436
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:53,216
I don't I don't know what to tell them

437
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,264
You know it doesn't seem to be productive to be

438
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,664
Play National radio show take action on a local level

439
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,064
Naturally there is some guidance it's offered but on the federal level through the Department of Housing and Urban Development

440
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,416
Much of which goes back to a 1991 memo written by their general counsel Frank

441
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Cheating

442
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:18,816
The memo largely is a discussion about how many people should be living in a dwelling based on how many bedrooms they are

443
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:25,472
Keating concludes that the number is too but also that's not a hard-and-fast number and there's a ton of other factors to consider other

444
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,824
What is a bedroom layout of the house children

445
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
Yeah whatever

446
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
Lot of factors

447
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,456
Most of the reasons these regulations exist as todoist

448
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:41,600
Overcrowding is not good for my health or some even structural reason so it's typically avoided

449
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,416
That said if your cousin comes to live with you for a month

450
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,024
There is no way the cops are going to show up unless your cousin was coming to live with you because he was on the Run

451
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,048
From the cops right

452
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,704
You might get into trouble with your landlord if you're violating your lease but if it's your house this just isn't a realistic so now

453
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Mario that's going to happen

454
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
I mean

455
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Personally

456
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:07,456
I have seen plenty of movies and documentaries haven't you lived with

457
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,136
Cops come

458
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:21,024
Not for all the illegal but I don't think that I've seen any

459
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,096
Documentaries where they like holyshit

460
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
We better pass this ordinance

461
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:32,032
Otherwise there's going to be too many people living in single with their cousin

462
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,104
Got to jam about anybody come on over

463
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,176
I date people lived at your house

464
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,368
David Alex saying this caller people like them can express their hatred of Mexican immigrants in a way that makes it

465
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
Feel socially acceptable

466
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
It's be like

467
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,256
Figured way with it but

468
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,792
It's a false premise rooted

469
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
Just in white

470
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
Victim

471
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:01,472
Larger issue that people shouldn't have to live 20 people in an apartment regardless of their immigration

472
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
And status

473
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,592
That might be something we can make it through dressing and affordable public housing but Alex

474
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,616
Who's against that too

475
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
Because of freedom

476
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,688
Yeah it would be it would be in

477
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
Just seeing if that guys take on it was like

478
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:16,320
Man there all these immigrants living in their houses together ice

479
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,392
See it I see it need immigrants are living in their houses

480
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,720
And that's why we need affordable public housing

481
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:27,840
Coming from all directions we need to expand certain places we can't allow Advanced Property

482
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,888
To be sitting there empty on the market

483
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,984
Just curious to see how Alex

484
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,336
Got really mad about that

485
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,640
And end up saying

486
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
Stupid s***

487
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,392
Police

488
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
We have to look and see how many

489
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
Find an arrest

490
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,408
Absolutely not

491
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,272
There there are so many problems with this idea

492
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,832
That if you have an extra toothbrush I mean

493
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
First off

494
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,464
Man the cops are not smart enough to tell how may

495
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
Also

496
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,840
No you cannot

497
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:38,240
Yes you can I believe in America where

498
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
People can have two toothbrushes

499
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,872
Also I think what's going on here is that Alex is thinking of like

500
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
Maybe

501
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:51,040
A TV show where someone realize they were being cheated on cuz there was an extra toothbrush

502
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:57,440
Rye Rye or like a Murder She Wrote where she was like I noticed that you have a foreign toothbrush

503
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,744
Yeah yeah yeah

504
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,144
Does getting arrested cuz like the other significant other has decided to bring a toothbrush to leave in there

505
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
Now so f****** dumb I mean was it a Mechanical Tees

506
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,496
What do you mean

507
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,312
Diamond Resorts

508
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,104
We took a different directions

509
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,152
50 route that there are different directions

510
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,992
So Alex gets another call and it's one of my favorite calls

511
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
Types of

512
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,088
Call does it work and that is somebody who wants specific

513
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,440
And Alex doesn't really have much smell

514
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
Hello

515
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
Panda

516
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
Maybe

517
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
Another thing that you

518
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
You put up on your way

519
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
Adidas

520
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
Fluential

521
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
NWO

522
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
That out there

523
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
Well

524
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,384
We have

525
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,768
We have

526
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,840
What

527
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,680
County commissioner

528
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,944
The reopening

529
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,328
County Jail

530
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
Ward

531
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,472
Is going on

532
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,752
So is that the top five

533
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:57,152
Overall wildly out of context or things that you just making up of

534
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
Top of other stories

535
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:04,832
Mueller airport is actually something that goes back to his Y2K broadcast so that one's an old standby

536
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,928
Beautiful remember that one the chains at the airport hangar

537
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:15,072
So what's going on here is actually two different from the situation we saw on our last episode where a caller wanted Alex to say huku was

538
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,704
How to being ask for specific information and instead of answer directly launches off into a ram

539
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
About Vega

540
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,032
Insinuations that get the collar no closer

541
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,824
Diving any real information

542
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
Well he's saying

543
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,944
Things that sounds like like

544
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,480
Could be information right

545
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,552
In a way that's kind of condescending

546
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,344
So the caller probably feels put

547
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,880
Put on the back foot a little rat

548
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:45,280
I mean if you were looking at it through the wrong parameters you might see him actively doing harm to his cause to fight the glove

549
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:52,192
What are those brown bears are doing here because

550
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,240
He is the enemy of a conspiracy theorist

551
00:35:54,752 --> 00:36:00,896
You can be wrong about everything get away with pretty much all of it as long as you're really vague about it give yourself enough wiggle room

552
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
To pretend

553
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
You know

554
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:08,576
The curious because that was also a question that he could have avoided by going you know what you're right

555
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,880
I'm going to get somebody on that and then moved on

556
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:17,536
Just been like that be a great thing to put on my website let's get good ideas

557
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:23,936
Brother to take care of this do it the right time

558
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,960
Probably between 6

559
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
At eight years after this

560
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
Alexander been like

561
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:34,688
Maybe you should get a job

562
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:43,648
Every week

563
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
List all right

564
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Do you want to guess

565
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,744
I didn't BuzzFeed duallist on them

566
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,536
No okay

567
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:53,120
They got paid off not to globalists

568
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
Child in there

569
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,448
Okay I'm going to go with

570
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:02,848
You think he hates Gates yet right

571
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
But he's not top

572
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Globalist

573
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,224
I don't know I know bush is a puppet

574
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
Sure

575
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,832
My answers are

576
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,112
Arnold Schwarzenegger

577
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,184
Sylvester Stallone

578
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
Okay

579
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:22,560
But all they remember the cast of The Expendables

580
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
I wanted

581
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
Top 5 or 10

582
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
We always talk about

583
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
Right

584
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
What

585
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
So no Satan

586
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:16,576
No Bill Gates Epstein no world economic forum

587
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:21,952
Remarkable almost as if all these characters why does important to Alex in 2003 because at that point.

588
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
Conspiracy Community was still in the

589
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,096
It's all about the Rockefellers and Rothschilds phase and grown out of that yet

590
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:34,752
Now one of the things I think it's kind of just I was laying in bed trying to fall asleep last night like how

591
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
Much Alex's like

592
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
Bulshit

593
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,128
Is basically like how comic books operate

594
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,664
How like there's an ark

595
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,344
Foot Locker shoes

596
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,744
Pop up like way down the road and I can pretend that they've been there the whole time

597
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,144
He really does work that way

598
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,496
It makes sense

599
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
I guess

600
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,824
But isn't that also makes sense based on

601
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,712
His reading comprehension level

602
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,528
Syfy

603
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
What kind of runs

604
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,112
Hand-in-hand with someone who'd be at the comic books right

605
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
I don't know it's

606
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
It's interesting to me

607
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
Yeah I wonder if he's a silver age guy

608
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,816
Is probably a new 50

609
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
I don't know

610
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:35,168
We get back to the biolabs gallery here

611
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
And he's wrong

612
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,728
About everything

613
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,640
Timer 10:30

614
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,432
More

615
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,832
Level four

616
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
Quantity

617
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
I'm not going to build these

618
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
This is

619
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,848
More dangerous

620
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,944
PowerPoint

621
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,144
Now

622
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
Ireland

623
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,528
Levels of propaganda

624
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,584
Impressively wrong about just let everything in that clip

625
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,656
It is he has this ability to analyze data

626
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,984
The comes in from different strata of the media or whatever

627
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:18,336
They didn't make dozens and dozens or even 36 bsl-4 lab

628
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,384
These are bioweapons lab

629
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,664
They aren't super Dane

630
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Sporting down

631
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
They not only didn't

632
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,784
Admit that they released foot mouth

633
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,624
Actually released a statement saying that they don't do any work with foot mouth at that lab

634
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,952
And it never said the people couldn't restock livestock

635
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:40,608
They're just regulations in place where the outbreak needs to be contained and then after the disease has been eradicated you have to wait 21

636
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
Days to restock your animals for safe

637
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
Right

638
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
What they say

639
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,240
Everything Alex is telling his audience

640
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,776
Basically made up

641
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:52,384
It's astonishing to me and I honestly don't think that you can be that wrong without

642
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,479
Like to be wrong

643
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,247
Yeah

644
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783
Cuz that's

645
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,319
That's out that's out of

646
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:04,415
Control either that or he's really is just freestyling

647
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:10,815
You know just off the Dome just left he was freestyling he be right about more things

648
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:17,471
Probably reality

649
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,079
I don't know if it's just that he

650
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,895
Constantly and like only get

651
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Headline

652
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,711
X from sources that are

653
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,039
Intentionally

654
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:35,391
I can't I can't imagine this is an accident he's he's like a hole in the

655
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:41,791
The force you don't like any incorrect information could exist

656
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,655
Within the guy the University of our data analyzed

657
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:51,263
Well yeah good on you to analyze this strata. Okay

658
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,663
Everywhere earlier where I

659
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
Baltimore

660
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,023
About this story

661
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,303
The monkey didn't

662
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,375
Escape from a bsl-4 lab bio lab

663
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,983
It was a rhesus monkey that escaped from the California National Primate Research Center

664
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,823
The reason visit all relevant to the story Alex's covering is

665
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,871
Because that Center is at UC Davis

666
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,991
And there was talk of building a 150 million dollar biocontainment lab there

667
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:37,343
The monkey escape from their normal facilities made that investment look uncertain

668
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,975
The headline for the story that Alex is covering his quote monkeys Escape May sink bio-defense lab

669
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:49,375
Right so what's going on is that because

670
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,935
Makes up the stuff that he reports to the ADI

671
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Status

672
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
That's cruel

673
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
B I mean

674
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,799
Malicious Jay-Z

675
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,823
Lying

676
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,967
This incident was enough to put the kibosh on this plant never got built jucydate

677
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
With Outlet.

678
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:20,607
I don't know if they ever see million-dollar lab I don't know if they ever like figured out who did it or

679
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,055
Used to

680
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:34,431
Rihanna's documentary about this 11 monkey

681
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,711
Name Cesar

682
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,503
Caesar the monkey

683
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
Did he rise

684
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,855
Diddy

685
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,439
Your f****** did the Eros

686
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:48,511
Is like s*** man to Alex's just got these

687
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:53,375
F****** stories

688
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
Hearing about him

689
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,727
Stumbling into DARPA

690
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
Me tell you

691
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
YouTube

692
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,919
Always and placement

693
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,807
Literally

694
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Where are the ground

695
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,303
A researcher walk by

696
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,967
Okay

697
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,863
The stories evolved

698
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
I do like

699
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:01,983
Appreciate that there is a just an innocent bystander

700
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,519
Wondering why God likes

701
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,055
Hold on is that Alec

702
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
Jones

703
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,431
I do think I mean I ask somebody who has worked

704
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,271
In University offices or and

705
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,831
You know my dad's a professor and make some

706
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,623
Acquaintance with a how

707
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:25,279
I don't know how Alex is getting into these buildings at midnight

708
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,095
Why are some kind of special access or like

709
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,679
Somebody right allowing him to shoot

710
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,471
And I doubt that would

711
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
Be something that like

712
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,079
It would have to go through some sort of a

713
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:44,223
I saw this documentary where this guy just got out of jail

714
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,807
He had a plan he was like we got to take off this cuz

715
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
Casino

716
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,623
Cuz when you with cuz sometimes

717
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
Casino win

718
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,975
He's a little bit better he's like sometimes a casino win

719
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
But then sometimes you win

720
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:02,911
See here's the problem with this guy was clearly referencing Planet of the Apes

721
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:08,543
100 different

722
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,335
Plenty of other

723
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,527
See I thought that story is all made up

724
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,575
There's no chance

725
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:25,439
From a lady from Wichita

726
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:30,047
And she is a new listener

727
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,583
He's going to freak her out

728
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,863
Okay

729
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,423
And so you just tried to scare her a little bit

730
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
Awesome MoMA

731
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,031
I love this so much

732
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,847
Alex doesn't know anything about Wichita

733
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
What are the ways that he's able to

734
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,223
To Free People by throwing out specific

735
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,247
Yes like

736
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,039
The name of your local paper

737
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:55,647
Right or something right now to make it look like no I actually have research

738
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,975
No s*** about Wichita

739
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,279
Twice in 40 seconds here

740
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
That's awesome

741
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
I asked

742
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,287
Grocery store people about that

743
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
He said he's heard a rumor but

744
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
They have made it

745
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
All the way

746
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,039
Wichita Eagle Beacon I work tonight

747
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,303
Okay

748
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
Dylan

749
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,823
Yeah yeah

750
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,223
The right back at you

751
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,551
Buy checked at the Dillons in Wichita they do in fact

752
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
Accept cash

753
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:00,159
Can credit for groceries ask people to submit

754
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:06,303
I imagine they'd be out of business really fast cuz there's a lot of other grocery stores in Wichita. Snot like

755
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,887
A one-stoplight town or whatever

756
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,703
I guess Alex might be a coastal Elite thinking that all

757
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,727
Kansas is just

758
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,543
Tumbleweeds in saloons or whatever but

759
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:20,895
I do I do like that he's deploying like traditional cold reading tactic

760
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,919
Text to just like

761
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:28,319
I'm thinking it's another of the newspaper in Wichita my correct what's the name of that newspaper

762
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,647
The CEO of

763
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,439
Solutely

764
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,231
Single letter m

765
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:41,631
Could see through this is just like absurd so funny couldn't be clearer that I

766
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:45,215
Alex's just making s*** up here and he doesn't know any specifics about Wichita

767
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,287
What does this is embarrassing stuff I would ask

768
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,615
Why would a grocery store require a thumbprint to buy or sell

769
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,687
Have you ever gone to the grocery store to sell something

770
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:59,551
David Carter

771
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,343
You act like go there till like

772
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,391
You don't bring a sack of potatoes

773
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,951
Jewel-Osco

774
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:12,351
Make I make some nice homemade muffins and then when I go through the self-checkout I leave them up

775
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:18,751
Puffins on the thing and then I will check it out.

776
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:27,199
I think that maybe you that is just language that is meant to invoke the mark of the beast I think you might be right

777
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,247
I'm sorry just throwing it around I could be

778
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:35,903
So you're the last clip from this episode where Alex continues to try and freaked out this lady from Wichita

779
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,975
Disturbed I mean

780
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
Am I going to be one of them

781
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,703
Security Board

782
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,263
Want

783
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,591
And a lot of

784
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,479
Sure

785
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,135
To get rid of the body

786
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,415
What

787
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,167
Yeah

788
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,727
Okay

789
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
Toro Loco

790
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,567
Gestapo spouse

791
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,943
Boil you in acid

792
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,015
I'm going to come to your house cuz they want your husband

793
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:40,415
This might be a little little bit extreme borderline like Freak Out the Squares level

794
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:45,535
Definitely the vibe I was getting to my call

795
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,815
So we go to the first

796
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,887
Whole lot of clips of Alex being mad at sports

797
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,959
On the last episode

798
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,007
It honestly didn't really feel that important

799
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,799
Right on the 31st

800
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,079
But it continues

801
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:02,431
Yeah and that's that's why I was like

802
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,967
Took notice of it

803
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,575
Kobe Bryant

804
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,135
Colby Bryant

805
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,439
Respectful

806
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,743
Pork Gyros

807
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,055
Football

808
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,855
Worried about everything

809
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,231
Care about your liver

810
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:59,007
I mean like he just seems to think that it's impossible to care about sports and the country

811
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:04,639
I don't know how to respond to that I mean considering the amount of jingoistic military as

812
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:10,527
Bulshit that's Ram down of our f****** throat through Sports is a lot of it you think Alex

813
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,599
So he talked about Kobe Bryant there

814
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,367
Call Babe

815
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,439
This actually is a big part of why he's mad

816
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,999
Because there's a lot of news

817
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,279
About Kobe Bryant

818
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,839
Auntie is sexual assault

819
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,887
Yeah yeah yeah

820
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
Vinatieri

821
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,519
Alex has some weird news about the

822
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,919
31

823
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,735
Girl on

824
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
The news

825
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,167
Thousands of websites

826
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,031
But just

827
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,823
Watching her

828
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,431
Milo my God no

829
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,855
Of the TV show

830
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,623
Gwen

831
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
Pressure

832
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
I mean Armenian

833
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,471
Wearing

834
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,519
Dumpling around

835
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,903
What is an acronym

836
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,815
Bio weapon

837
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,727
About the good Alamo

838
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,895
Bewildered

839
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,855
It's really hard to deal with

840
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,647
Alex is 29 years

841
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,671
Irene fat

842
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:29,279
That sounds like he's going to end that would like I had cheese there Reedus

843
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,815
Like what are we what the

844
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:35,167
I don't know but I also think Alex has his story entirely wrong

845
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,519
Oh I might be wrong about this I can find no evidence

846
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,823
To the contrary

847
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,639
I think there was here's what's going on

848
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,431
So on July 28th

849
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,223
A couple days before this episode

850
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,039
Songs featured an interview with Tom Leykis

851
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,343
The notoriously disgusting radio host

852
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,695
Essentially just for being a chauvinist pile of s***

853
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,255
Right here decided he was going to out Kobes

854
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:03,583
Accuser which was the story that Hannity and Colmes were cover

855
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,399
From Hannity's intro to that interview

856
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,167
Quotes

857
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:13,567
Most news stations have a policy against naming sexual assault victims so why did Los Angeles nationally syndicated radio.

858
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,103
Talk show host

859
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,407
Feel compelled to identify Kobe Bryant

860
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,455
Accuser he joins us from Lost

861
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:25,599
I don't think I've ever had a person alleging to be Kobe's accuser on the show but

862
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:31,999
What seems to be going on here is that Alex is conflating dislike us interview with another thing goes happening at the

863
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:36,607
Time which is there people were circulating pictures of of a woman

864
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,679
Accurately claiming was the Accuser

865
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,959
Tom Leykis

866
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:44,031
Did get the name of the person

867
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
Yes people

868
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,455
Alex

869
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:57,855
Combined these two imagine review and is complaining about this person he didn't actually watch an interview with

870
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:02,463
Attention to detail and journalistic standards

871
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:08,863
But my belief that dreams are real I guess if anybody like I would be very open to that

872
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,447
Figuring out more about this like if someone were able to

873
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:18,847
Send me the Hannity & Colmes interview that Alex is talking about yeah I'd be happy to amend

874
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,639
My feeling on this

875
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:28,063
Yeah this is what I think you making up interview

876
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,903
It just seemed like the whole angry Sports thing that Alex has been on his

877
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,183
Mostly kind of about

878
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
I mean it

879
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,231
It is

880
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:39,839
It is when you see his misogyny and racism come into

881
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
Conflict

882
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,471
Trump's conflict

883
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:50,335
Well that's fair experiencing both simultaneously

884
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,127
He's really focusing on the misogyny

885
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,687
The primary

886
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,271
What it comes down to it I'm with all men overall women

887
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,087
Yeah that's the

888
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,623
You know they say

889
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:08,511
Got to have a code

890
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,047
It is right now for a Herald

891
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,583
I think

892
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,143
He's doing an improv scene with himself

893
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,935
Goodbye where he pretends to

894
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:20,799
Get into a conversation with somebody who doesn't like care the infowar cuz he wants to play golf

895
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:48,447
You know

896
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,463
I'm hard

897
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,991
This is me

898
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,439
I wanna go play golf

899
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:19,327
Fred

900
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:20,863
I would

901
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,887
I would

902
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,679
That his

903
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
Story

904
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,239
That he made up

905
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,775
Kids describe

906
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,567
Other people as insane

907
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
In fact

908
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,895
Atmore revealed his own in sand

909
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,711
Yeah sure but I think there probably is

910
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,247
Maybe a kernel of truth to it

911
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:40,063
Like maybe somebody blew him off

912
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:44,159
Outside restaurant or something and I mentioned that they were going to go play golf

913
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,207
Or something very reasonable thing to do

914
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,999
Alex's turned this into like

915
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:51,327
Right

916
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:57,727
People on the radio are like this person 38

917
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,079
All checks out

918
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
So I'm

919
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,407
In the present day we know that Alex

920
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
Is

921
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,711
The most important person in the world

922
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,503
The Trump Administration

923
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,527
Call Tim the Texan

924
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:13,599
I always wanted to know what the text and thought about that

925
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,391
Putin listens

926
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
Everyday

927
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:19,999
He needs to bolsonaro might listen we know his son does

928
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,791
I took that one might be true

929
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,095
But

930
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:30,495
The dude not so noticeable and a guy brings up something that makes out

931
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,263
Very

932
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,031
Excited

933
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,431
Says you're cuckoo

934
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:49,183
State senator

935
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,487
Read the

936
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,351
I just washed it

937
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,471
Okay

938
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:08,639
He looked at me like that

939
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:15,039
I was crazy but I was not

940
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:19,135
This is a huge moment for me

941
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,951
A little bit Lower State

942
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,975
Maybe

943
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,279
Alex has a interesting

944
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:28,863
Little bit of a story sort of pop culture

945
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,167
Pinterest kind of story

946
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:31,935
And he is

947
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,727
I'm so excited about it

948
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
Ronnie

949
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,135
Homeboys

950
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,207
Sounds true

951
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,839
Talk about it

952
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,655
Sounds true

953
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,679
Amazing

954
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:10,079
Amazing so just wasn't proven out of the KGB under orders installing it sent hit-squad secure

955
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:14,943
The claim that was made in the biography of Wayne called John Wayne the man behind them

956
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:21,855
According to an article on military.com Wayne learned of this plot and quote obviously not one to let a thing like

957
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,647
Communist assassin's get him down

958
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,719
Wayne and his script writer Jimmy Grant allegedly

959
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,743
Hitman

960
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,303
Beach and Stage the Box

961
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,071
Mocx

962
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
Locution

963
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,399
No one knows exactly what happened after that but Wayne's

964
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:40,799
Friend said that Soviet to work for the FBI from that day on

965
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:47,199
Who dodged the draft also apologized

966
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:51,039
Assassination attempt

967
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:56,671
I don't get a lot of heads of state apologize

968
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:03,071
I don't know how else to put this other than to say that this is a stupidly fake story being passed along his biography

969
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,351
Really funny that Alex

970
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:09,471
King of skepticism a guy who can see through all the BS is just taking it at face value

971
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,775
Makes them feel good about his worldview

972
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:18,431
By guy named Michael Mane and let's just say that accusations that he makes things up in his book

973
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:24,831
Are not uncommon for instance much of his biography of Frank Sinatra involves things that he claims

974
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:31,231
He remembers from Pillow Talk he had with Ava Gardner when she was 45 and he was 17 and they had an affair

975
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:37,631
During which he revealed all sorts of things that you never told anybody else God damn that is some good backstory

976
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:43,263
Like that I like that this one article in the guardian

977
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,079
There was a time that David Niven

978
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:50,431
Stricken with the motor neuron disease that killed him called Munn in

979
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,967
Mike I've got to see you

980
01:04:54,527 --> 01:05:00,671
He told him to bring his tape recorder and spoke of his secret love child his legitimacy and his failed attempt

981
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:06,559
Shoot himself as well as with Princess Grace Kelly

982
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,839
Sounds true

983
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,423
A lot of his work seems to revolve around made-up things that happened

984
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,287
To him that involve a one-on-one exchange with someone who is now dead

985
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:19,615
Maybe unverifiable information is kind of his stocking

986
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
Contrave

987
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,783
Tell me the story about John came from Bonne getting to know after you played a role

988
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,647
Telephone box in the film Brannigan

989
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:38,047
How do you said that John Wayne treated him like a son after that

990
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:44,447
325 telephone box

991
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,215
Just how

992
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:45,983
Bees

993
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:46,751
Weird

994
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,031
Stories

995
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,615
F****** fly through the world

996
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:55,455
Unsuspend sake posted an onion article

997
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
Absolutely true

998
01:05:56,479 --> 01:06:02,623
The families of people he's written about say that this is outrageous

999
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,159
Buy is fabricated backstory

1000
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:08,511
Download a s*** being made up by someone trying to sell narratives that are self-aggrandizing

1001
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:14,911
Think so just kind of makes sense why Alex what identify with this and accept it unquestionably

1002
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:15,679
Is it called

1003
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:21,311
To him

1004
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
So I noticed a trend

1005
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,407
Where was the thing that seems to happen a lot

1006
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,431
Especially in the past

1007
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,479
Maybe it's because

1008
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,759
Technology in

1009
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,551
Manpower is a little

1010
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,599
Gated at this point share

1011
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,135
Constantly ends up

1012
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,439
Hanging up on people while they're still talking

1013
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:43,839
I wanted to play a little clip of that reveals something about his politics

1014
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
Texel

1015
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,007
You over here

1016
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
And of course

1017
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,183
Job

1018
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
But

1019
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,447
Just remember when Alex is trying to

1020
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:26,847
Pretend to be like this enlightened libertarian type

1021
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:36,319
Pretend to be a little bit more moderate he actually is in order to

1022
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:39,647
Is transphobic

1023
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,927
Narratives of such

1024
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
No

1025
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,719
Now he is

1026
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,535
He's just shifted at Target

1027
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,071
Yeah what's what's important

1028
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,631
To think about whenever it comes to

1029
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,911
Repealing abortion rights

1030
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,751
Is that you know all of the Republicans who who as

1031
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:58,847
Times have changed in as the popular opinion has changed towards a lot of subjects

1032
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,383
Have come along with

1033
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,943
You know as things get moved back

1034
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,247
We're going to find out they were not coming along with

1035
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,551
They were playing along with another

1036
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,319
Very funny

1037
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
Indifferent

1038
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:09,855
So

1039
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,391
Yep be ready

1040
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,439
So speaking

1041
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:17,023
I will have to go all the way back

1042
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:17,791
This

1043
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,351
Who's a real weirdo

1044
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,399
Let me give you this there

1045
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,935
You know that thing where you are

1046
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
Were people saying he lauded

1047
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
Republican

1048
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
Fishing is not avoid

1049
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,311
Well there's more to that

1050
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:30,847
And a republic

1051
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
All laws

1052
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,407
Check the higher standard

1053
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,687
Blackstone

1054
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,223
Walk commentary

1055
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:37,759
God's law

1056
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,087
Higher laws

1057
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:43,903
Republic

1058
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,671
Reserved

1059
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
Biblical

1060
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:46,975
Set the government

1061
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,255
Is a minister of God

1062
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,535
Holding his

1063
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,559
Righteous command

1064
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,839
Honest evildoer

1065
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:52,863
Encourage

1066
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,631
Good

1067
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,167
Sounds great

1068
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,471
A democracy makes

1069
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,007
Majority got capable of

1070
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,287
Determining Good and Evil

1071
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,079
Popular opinion

1072
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,599
Mcall

1073
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:21,279
Wild against democracy and also Alex is responsive that color was

1074
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:27,935
Website called The Matrix has you

1075
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,495
And it's a blog post about how there's a secret

1076
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,799
13th amendment in the original Constitution

1077
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:36,383
That has been secretly removed and eliminated from history

1078
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
Secrets

1079
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,431
13th

1080
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,711
Amendment

1081
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:46,111
The original custody lawyers were barred from serving in government position

1082
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,903
That's basically just a piece of sovereign

1083
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,927
Citizen lore

1084
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,487
This was a reprinting of an article written

1085
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,791
Buy a roofer named Alfred

1086
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,423
Which was mostly about how much he hates Legos

1087
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:04,031
Lawyers better than where I thought it was going shirt

1088
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:10,431
This article was written in 1991 and then the next year Alfred decided to try to run for the Texas Supreme Court

1089
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,711
On a Libertarian ticket

1090
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:15,295
Here's a blurb about his candidacy

1091
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,599
Forty-seven-year-old

1092
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:23,231
Who attended college for a year to run for the Texas Supreme Court on the libertarian party ticket

1093
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,815
Despite the fact that the Texas Constitution says candidates must be a practice

1094
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,119
Lawyer or judge with 10 years experience

1095
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:36,031
Basis is kaposi on a personal interpretation of an old law that he said

1096
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:40,127
Not lawyers to run for judicial office in the 10 former Confederate States

1097
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:46,783
Of course my if my interpretation is ridiculous I'll wind up looking like another nut on a soapbox

1098
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,063
Hero

1099
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:49,855
How'd that go

1100
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,159
You look like a knot on a cell phone

1101
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:58,559
A big Sovereign citizen type

1102
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:01,631
Show about Sovereign citizens put together by a court administrator

1103
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,655
In Kansas City

1104
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:07,519
Discussing followers of that ideologies potential for violence it says

1105
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,823
One of the most notorious Alfred at sac

1106
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,103
Made a statement

1107
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,383
Quote we have the right

1108
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:14,943
To keep and bear arms in order to shoot our own politician

1109
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:23,135
Yeah this dude is a major figure in the community of sovereign citizen interpretations of that idea

1110
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,671
Ecology is the people art subject

1111
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,463
The laws of the country or state but

1112
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,743
To God's law

1113
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:32,351
He believes that this is part of the founding of the United States

1114
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,423
Supported by Alex on this show

1115
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:42,335
This is not sound or well-constructed as legal analysis it's beyond

1116
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:46,175
Zealot arguing that the country was established to be a theocracy

1117
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:50,271
Simultaneous with the time. If I recall correctly

1118
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,295
Everyone was

1119
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831
Screaming about Sharia law

1120
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,647
Through his website

1121
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,463
This guy offered me also published a magazine called so

1122
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,535
Suspicions which is about as awful as you might think

1123
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,607
Their volume 11 number 3 issue from 2001

1124
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,631
Gluten article

1125
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:08,447
Got titled the truth about homosexuality

1126
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,983
Which is about as homophobic

1127
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,007
As a YouTuber

1128
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,543
I was hoping it was like

1129
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,567
Is dope nope

1130
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:20,223
It defines homosexuality as a fetish homosexual relationship they quote horrendous perverted septic and

1131
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,503
Ethically dangerous practice

1132
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,063
The author also claims the quote nothing

1133
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:29,183
Turns gay men on both shocked

1134
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:33,535
This passage actually really stuck out to me in this essay

1135
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,095
Perhaps I'm more sensitive to the issue than most

1136
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:39,167
But whenever I hear someone described themselves as openly gay

1137
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:45,311
I automatically visualize them engaged with another man in a revolting active anal intercourse ruining my appetite

1138
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:49,407
That sounds like parody

1139
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,711
It's not if you would even though it is not

1140
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:58,367
This is the sort of garbage that this dude who the caller is quoting

1141
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,903
His publisher

1142
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:03,999
It's great stuff all around here everyone is is knocking it out of the park

1143
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:04,767
Yeah

1144
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:11,167
I mean I guess that sort of secondary inasmuch as like this legal analysis they were all living under

1145
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:13,727
God's law in the Republic is meant to support that

1146
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:16,031
Is written by the same person who's publishing this

1147
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,055
Tripe

1148
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:21,151
Honestly they are August 1st is

1149
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:21,919
It's not

1150
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:26,271
Very good nice mostly phone calls and a lot of them are really boring a disappointing so

1151
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:30,367
I had to try and find something interesting to talk about so that there we go

1152
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,439
We get Alfred adsic

1153
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,767
Another caller

1154
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,583
And this distract me is really weird

1155
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,631
Actually if there's to be any

1156
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
Any justice

1157
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,679
Cinemaworld bushes

1158
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:44,959
Detroit

1159
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727
And

1160
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,751
Painting services

1161
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,335
What

1162
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,103
The same crime

1163
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,639
Until then

1164
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:53,919
Is there will be

1165
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,087
Against

1166
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:01,855
President

1167
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:16,703
Coward there's two things that I think a really weird about this

1168
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:19,519
Semi-regular caller it goes by Jay Q

1169
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:24,383
I am like that could be a initial or a nickname buttons just because

1170
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:26,431
It's also code for the Jewish Quest

1171
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,503
Which is

1172
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
The commuter

1173
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:34,111
Instead of having to be open about it they talk about the Jake you

1174
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:38,719
Suno

1175
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:44,863
Whatever he's called in I've tried to keep my like ears open for possible dog with least

1176
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,679
So far it's mostly not but it is

1177
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,703
Still something that I

1178
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:52,287
I've never met anybody who goes by that alias

1179
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,151
That's no good no

1180
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,175
And second

1181
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,711
I believe

1182
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,271
Dating someone Alex understands

1183
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:05,087
The responsibility that he has to not engage

1184
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,367
In directed viola

1185
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,135
Rhetoric

1186
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:10,463
At this point in his career he understands

1187
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,487
The even

1188
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:14,559
Bandying about these ideas about Bush deserving

1189
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
To be hung

1190
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,375
A somewhat unhealthy

1191
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,423
As a way to communicate with the audio

1192
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
Sure

1193
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:25,567
I don't know if that's exactly what's going on such a far cry from what he does in the present day

1194
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:31,967
Call because the guy we can't listen hey

1195
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,015
Happy saying violent things like that

1196
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:37,855
The color is even bring even said to trial

1197
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:41,439
And I think it's a 100% reasonable thing to believe that

1198
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,743
George Bush should be tried at The Hague

1199
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:46,303
And then his punishment will be what

1200
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:50,143
Desert imagine like that compared to how we talk about fauci

1201
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:54,239
Like in the present-day who's just a guy it's outrageous like

1202
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,823
One of the only things that I can think of

1203
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,663
Maybe maybe maybe it's me

1204
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:04,735
Piano putting a little bit too much into this but like

1205
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:08,319
It feels like one of the only reasons that behavior would be so different

1206
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:10,879
Is there in the pasture wasn't awareness that like

1207
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:13,695
This isn't good I can't do this

1208
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:19,071
Maybe I'm wrong cuz I think that's

1209
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Definitely

1210
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,607
True

1211
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,423
I think it is irresponsible and wrong

1212
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,447
Do you know dangerous

1213
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,519
It's very weird

1214
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,567
I don't know why he would cut off the

1215
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,335
Call like that

1216
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:35,711
Maybe not sure might be that

1217
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,783
And I'm part of it might be a

1218
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,831
Maybe he knows the color

1219
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:44,159
Maybe on another level he's just better able to

1220
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,183
Controls f******

1221
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:51,071
Emotions such as stuff like that

1222
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:54,911
That's definitely true

1223
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,679
Clip

1224
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,007
I don't know

1225
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:03,103
Something's worth we're taking a peek at

1226
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,383
But I guess

1227
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,151
Alex

1228
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:11,295
You're one of the things do that I have to check in on his like Alex is so matted sports that I have to go through Alex sports headlines

1229
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:16,671
Come Around the World Cup or something else is mad about internationalism or something

1230
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,719
Nothing I couldn't find anything

1231
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,791
Will get back

1232
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,559
2

1233
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,607
Present-day probably next

1234
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:27,167
Squeak

1235
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,191
The past

1236
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:34,591
I like it feel like I'm in the past I think there's more meat on phones back then

1237
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:38,431
Learn a lot more indiscriminate screaming

1238
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,879
Fight Night

1239
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:49,951
I'm Leo

1240
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,999
Dzx Clark I hope you all have

1241
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,047
Great

1242
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,071
A email

1243
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,631
And maybe creamy also by the way

1244
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:00,959
Someone sent me a picture of a Starbucks near me

1245
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,239
Tango

1246
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:08,639
Cease and desist

1247
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,503
What the sex robot

1248
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:18,623
Alexandra Thurston color
