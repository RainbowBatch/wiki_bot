1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,936
Alex

3
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:16,640
Is unavailable today

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,408
I felt

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:20,992
Emergency episode because

6
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,136
Super excited to have her on the show

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,208
From

8
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,680
I wasn't fast enough when you said I'm Dan I was going to I was going to shout in my best Jordan impression

9
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:42,240
But I can't do a very good Jordan depression

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,688
GoFundMe

11
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
Reporting

12
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:03,232
Yeah conflict reporting have worked in like a rack and in Ukraine and I'd like to have also covered a lot of protests

13
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
Including a lot of the street fighting between fascists Nanny fascism Portland so I'd like to do more of that and I'm putting together a

14
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,424
Audiobook

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
All of the intellectual origins of all the people who have like invented right-wing terrorist as it exists like

16
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:26,272
Coast Guard

17
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,832
Interesting

18
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,136
The things our listeners are into

19
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
Dimension that up top

20
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,304
Alex Jones one hell of a stochastic terrorist he's he's one of the best

21
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,144
Robert

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,240
We're going to be going over

23
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,336
And I understand that

24
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,408
I really like the food in Austin

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,064
With with his with his choices

26
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
What a badass

27
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
Restaurant

28
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,632
I just wasn't Austin to beginning of February I ain't nothing

29
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
Everywhere

30
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
Why would you eat anything good barbecue if you're in Austin Texas

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,968
Aldi's story boy restaurants in Austin

32
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,344
And I need to fill you in on this

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,368
Aware of it

34
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
He came to Austin

35
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
Was he's leaving in

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Yeah

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,144
Alex's show on Wednesday

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
And he about to start his own operation

39
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
Very sad about that

40
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:58,432
I literally jumped impounded my desk with excitement when you said that

41
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
I'm not a fan of Paul Joseph Watson

42
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
And I am a fan of him having less money

43
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,744
Well I think I have a bunch of thoughts getting all of Alex's assertive support

44
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,096
Being able to run an operation at all

45
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Play Frank

46
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
He doesn't write

47
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,984
Other people

48
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
Lutheran Paul

49
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
Just devastate

50
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272
Alex

51
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
Started being the general consensus was

52
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
Caldo

53
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
Kind of shocking to me that that's happened

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,424
I might have to let Paul go

55
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
I can do my own

56
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,176
Brought it upon himself

57
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,736
I'm super curious to know who's

58
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
Call it was for Paul to leave

59
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,392
If it was Alex's that he wants to quit

60
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,464
Fan I'm not entirely sure if that is

61
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
Possibility

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Yeah

63
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Is him saying

64
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,887
And I want you to

65
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
Continue

66
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
Or something

67
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,639
How could you have Alex Jones say or intimated anything like that to you and not have your soldiers shrivel up inside

68
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,735
Being a being a real

69
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:43,135
Lifetime

70
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,695
Resistance

71
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,279
You in town on Tuesday and Wednesday

72
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,887
Alex

73
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
Complaining about Twitter a whole bunch

74
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,639
That they were going Beyond

75
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
With Owen Shroyer

76
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
Ama

77
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
Because Alex

78
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,183
Is so f***** up

79
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
He is

80
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
Profound lederach

81
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
At 4 in the

82
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
First. Just want to say

83
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:28,191
Super excited for this and I honored that you you brought me in to hear this

84
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
This beautiful things that we're about the experience together

85
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
Do it last night

86
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,711
And then as I was going over at cutting the clips

87
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
This morning I realized

88
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:47,903
Set a remor f***** up and I even remember it being last night and last night I was like

89
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:53,023
I'm so excited

90
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,631
I need to qualify and that is

91
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
That I'm Paul announcer

92
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
DePaul is leaving on Wednesday

93
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
But they know it

94
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,823
There's an awareness that this is sort of like

95
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,663
We can't publicly say drought you're leaving

96
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
But we all know it

97
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,783
So that is in the room at this unspoken

98
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,623
Probably was part of why Alex is drinking so hard

99
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:25,023
But there's another element

100
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
He was talking about

101
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
Look like

102
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,167
Just covering his bicep I don't know

103
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,215
Either way if you got surgery

104
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,519
He might be mixing booze with painkillers

105
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:43,199
First time that I'm on Alex's side because

106
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,039
Mix incredibly well together and there are no side effects

107
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,599
I'm no doctor

108
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,695
Alex's behavior on this episode

109
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,839
Here is an out-of-context drop from today's show

110
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,727
Liberal

111
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
I just want to say

112
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
I can smell

113
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
Bourbon

114
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Watching

115
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:25,695
From days ago your phone across the sky but across the country to 2 mi

116
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:31,071
My my desk are whiskey

117
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
I'm not going to play you most

118
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Beginning

119
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,215
Because there's a large portion of it before Alex

120
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
Paul

121
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,567
Probably spending

122
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
1520 minutes

123
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
Just complaining about Twitter

124
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,967
And talking about how it was awesome and

125
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,295
I'm broken and I'm not interested in that that's not a conversation

126
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
I'm not particularly Charmed by

127
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
So

128
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
Will jump in here

129
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
This is

130
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Forever

131
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
This is where they go

132
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,399
This is Twitter

133
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Description of

134
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
What he's doing

135
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
He will be bleeding out live

136
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
More or less

137
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
There's an irony

138
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
Marvelous

139
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,319
Alex

140
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
Is speaking a little bit too loosely

141
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,927
Auntie accidentally reveals

142
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
About

143
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
I'm not.

144
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,359
Sooners good Trump

145
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
This is the time

146
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,503
There's no better time than now cuz this is measurably

147
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
That is

148
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
If true

149
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,167
I want to know what they said as much as I never want to be in a room with Donald Trump jr.

150
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,263
Yeah yeah for sure if you could somehow bugs at lunch or whatever

151
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,455
Don Jr is Mike cernovich

152
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,575
The people involved in the

153
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,135
I give the most Credence to the idea

154
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,951
Yeah he let Alex

155
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
Usher

156
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Unsettling

157
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,959
That there's nothing good they could be talking about

158
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:52,639
I wish I had a funny joke

159
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,991
As a as Jordan but I assure you I am I am shivering

160
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
And

161
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,511
Contacts

162
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:14,911
I think maybe they flew him in and they were talking about how Trump needs to

163
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,471
Make an executive order that'll Force

164
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
Or something like that

165
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,639
The Free Speech executive order or whatever

166
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:31,551
It's one of those like a mark of with how Wild Things have gotten that like if that's a thing that happens if this year

167
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,599
President of the United States

168
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,695
Which is an executive order forcing Alex Jones back onto Twitter

169
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
I wouldn't be

170
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,703
Real bad

171
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
Push

172
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,799
Reality

173
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,151
Is literally the opposite of free speech

174
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,551
Cuz he's had the freedom to decide who can use their

175
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
Nightclub

176
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
View of the

177
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Specific

178
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
Complaints that he has bats at Twitter in Jack

179
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,119
Appearance that to Jack Dorsey had

180
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
And it seems to be that

181
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Alex's mom

182
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,007
Rogan show

183
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
To be friends

184
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
With Jack

185
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
And that Jack

186
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Is like

187
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
Being a dik

188
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Even though

189
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
Well I mean who wouldn't want to be friends with Alex Jones a man who accused his good friend Joe Rogan of being

190
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Part of

191
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,463
Horrible conspiracy and probably

192
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
Pedophile

193
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
Great friend Alex Jones

194
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,887
My friends call me Sneaky Snake

195
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,519
Promise to destroy me for my many crimes that that's the real Mark of a

196
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,359
Is promising to destroy you for your many crimes

197
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,431
Pick you up from the airport

198
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:10,367
My best friend's birthday just last year I hit a bag of heroin in his house and I called the police

199
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:20,351
You're a good friend

200
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:25,471
Alex discussing

201
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
Kind of rejection

202
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
Where is a weird head space

203
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
I see your eyes getting really why

204
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Okay so

205
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
Damn you're the expert here

206
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,799
I've heard Alex Jones drunk a number of times

207
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
Not as many as you but a number

208
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,663
And that is the drunkest I've heard him sound

209
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,735
I'm curious as to where he lands on your scale

210
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
I'm glad you asked

211
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
Goat

212
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Cocktail hour

213
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,439
This is like a happy hour getting off lunch truck

214
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,863
Relatively

215
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
They would go to commercials

216
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
Visibly more f***** up

217
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:37,407
He's just taking shots

218
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
You know he likes you like

219
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
Taste of liquor

220
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:47,135
I don't know much about Paul Joseph Watson personally but I've drunk with a number of British journalists and the drunk is nice

221
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,951
FR all I missed

222
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,351
Standing Rock because the British guy was working with an I got so drunk that we overslept their flight by five and a half hours

223
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:03,007
So I have to imagine that the presence of a British person here is exacerbating this in Norman

224
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
Well I mean

225
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,615
Be there

226
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
This episode

227
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
Miserable

228
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,807
But I do agree with you the presence of more drunk

229
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,135
But it specifically

230
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,695
To run his business

231
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,095
That's definitely a piece of it but

232
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
This is Joe

233
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:35,519
It's what I told you earlier it's a little bit sad

234
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Egypt

235
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
Someone Shoulda stopped

236
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Quite frankly

237
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
Anybody who cares

238
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
Anybody who cares

239
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,527
Would have stopped at yeah that's that's the Alex Jones

240
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,135
Tagline who cares should have stopped this

241
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,023
Disgraceful

242
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
These two dudes

243
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
20 minutes

244
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
Twitter all that stuff

245
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,495
Remembers that they're supposed to be doing

246
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
A business everyday

247
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
Phone call

248
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
This is real is not censored

249
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,191
Aw

250
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:47,711
Did remember that they're supposed to be

251
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,367
I mean I would I've never denied that about it

252
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,463
But Alex remembers their supposed to be

253
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:04,351
Promoted

254
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
Great

255
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
Paul Joseph Watson

256
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
And talk about how

257
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,895
You get to talk to Paul

258
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Call

259
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,903
Emperor

260
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,935
You are questions okay

261
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
No dry political stuff

262
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,591
What Donald.

263
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
Level

264
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
All children

265
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,247
Fertilizing fields

266
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
Cricket

267
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,511
Pollinating spreading the seed

268
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
Call m.d.

269
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
In the throne

270
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:20,383
Coronavirus

271
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
God

272
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,967
Meet me Anderson Hall God

273
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
And it's all God

274
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,903
So he is the goblin Emperor but he sits on the throne of the Neanderthal God now I'm really curious like like

275
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
How does this

276
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:39,583
What's the separation of powers between whoever sits on the anitol throne and the Goblin Emperor whose scene

277
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,679
Is probably at campi constitutional

278
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,823
Textual analysis

279
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,759
It's implied that the throne

280
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,063
The occupier of that head

281
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
Far gone past

282
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
I don't know if that metaphor works

283
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
But

284
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
I took

285
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,239
He saying

286
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
Paul Joseph Watson

287
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
Has successfully carried out a genocide against the tall

288
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
Is that is it first of all

289
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
Complement

290
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
I think that's probably

291
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,791
I mean

292
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,655
I don't know how you guys do it in the big city. Chicago

293
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
Not a lot of goblins

294
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,847
I'm not I'm not inherently biased against Goblin

295
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,431
I put you down as a goblin

296
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,783
Gobble gobble intolerant I would say

297
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,575
Is the Alex

298
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
Is the

299
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,159
Is the

300
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
Throne

301
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
Bearer

302
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,815
Or or

303
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
And it

304
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,399
The goblin emperor

305
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,079
Part of what he's trying to express

306
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Is it

307
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,943
Is it conceivable that

308
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
Alex Jones

309
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,783
Has honest

310
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,879
Sympathy and care for Paul Joseph Watson

311
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:45,279
And knows that his organization is going down in flames and 1/2 be okay in the

312
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,095
Concede

313
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
Okay

314
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:57,055
You know me I'm going to try to find the the best in somebody

315
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:03,455
That's a possibility that I

316
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,991
Imagine if

317
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,039
His primary care

318
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
I don't think

319
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,607
Somehow make Paul and charged when it does go down to get stuck holding the bag

320
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
I would be surprised

321
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,959
Yeah the thing that I've always

322
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
Hated about Paul is how

323
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,103
As may sound ridiculous but he's very smart

324
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:36,735
Is Eazy-E dead why he's the one f****** Twitter for one reason like he's

325
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,063
So much better at writing the line of

326
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,439
Doing a lot of dangerous propagandizing but not getting shitcan in

327
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
Yeah

328
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Yeah

329
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,143
Crafting intelligence whatever whatever it is

330
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,983
It goes back

331
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
Lucky

332
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
Model

333
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
Because Paul is grown up

334
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,687
Is younger man around a lot more

335
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
The technology

336
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
Yeah

337
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Yeah

338
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
Alex Jones was always really in is

339
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,440
Was that his best when he was just like

340
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,976
Ranting about kooky

341
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,792
Crazy stuff and Paul is an actual like

342
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
Fascist

343
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,888
Propagandist drumming up

344
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
Racial hatred

345
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,152
Trading underground VHS

346
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,272
Not a media organization 1:45 in the morning like

347
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,160
I just watched a documentary about the stretch and bobbito show

348
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:53,536
Underground hip-hop College radio show

349
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,888
From the 80s early 90s

350
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,680
Like freestyling on their show

351
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,752
Fix truck

352
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:07,616
A bunch of Hot 97

353
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,688
Instead of

354
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
Be at the college

355
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
Hey sort of didn't have the same

356
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
Ability

357
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Next

358
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,088
With folks

359
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:31,680
Yeah you should be a crazy person that we run into when we're exhausted and

360
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,520
Driving long distances or just got home from a graveyard shift

361
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
That's

362
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:43,200
Android UHF or whatever it was when he was on Austin Public Broadcasting whatever that way

363
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,760
Would like back in the late 90s

364
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
Comforting almost

365
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
If you don't

366
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,208
The feeling that I get it

367
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
When I'm watching

368
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:00,352
Drunk baby

369
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Where is he

370
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
It's that when I listen to him

371
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,056
You have this is a guy who is

372
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
Nuts but okay

373
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
What's do for a living

374
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Yeah

375
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,016
And now it's the guy who

376
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:24,672
Should never have stopped ranting about the aliens

377
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
Promising Lake

378
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:34,400
I want to get the stuff when I was fun

379
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
Yeah

380
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,472
Saleem's make a little cameo

381
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,944
Alex

382
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,528
Operate mostly do that because

383
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
Next Club

384
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,952
History of calling himself Neanderthal so here is that

385
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,328
Let's talk about neanderthal

386
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,608
Fishing right now

387
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:11,264
Tell me about the Galaxy

388
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
You tell me about it

389
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:22,016
You completely forget to put this is the other conversations are having a completely moves

390
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,368
There is so much condescension and Paul Joseph Watson voice

391
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:31,232
It's weird to feel angry on behalf of Alex Jones but how dare you

392
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Call

393
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
He made you

394
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,352
I feel I feel exactly the same

395
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
Mugli dismissive like this

396
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,824
Yep

397
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
It's really shady Behavior

398
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
For people who

399
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
Leaving coworkers

400
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,736
Ofrenda coworker

401
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Anybody

402
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,808
It's one of those things like

403
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:02,720
You can tell there's no one who truly cares about him as a person like

404
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,584
Took him into

405
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
His friends and family got him help

406
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Like he was

407
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:15,008
Institution because even as like you know

408
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:20,128
Famous and whatnot as he is he's got people who honestly care about his health and well-being

409
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
There's no one like that for Alex Jones

410
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,528
I think I think he probably that boat is sales

411
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
In many ways

412
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,112
Best Prosecco

413
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
5150

414
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Probably

415
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,232
Oh boy I'm worried about those kids

416
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,560
They'll be all right I mean is alright

417
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
If your potato salad

418
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
Tons of money

419
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
Good education

420
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
And stuff like that

421
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,312
I don't know I do feel bad for them

422
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:58,016
Alex realizes once I realized

423
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
Here's the problem

424
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,768
We did the show

425
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,376
WeChat

426
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
Talk to people that have been censured

427
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,080
Here tonight

428
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,360
Say what

429
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
They achieve these goals

430
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,624
Bwg really see that like

431
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,976
Everyone has this when you're drunk and you get that you have that point where you get more ambitious

432
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,560
Run tomorrow in the woods

433
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,960
Exercise

434
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:56,640
Already in the middle of

435
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,456
Yeah

436
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
That's rough

437
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,208
They get back

438
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:17,120
Yeah I guess to get right to it and it's productive

439
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,264
You are incorrect Alex complaints about leprechaun

440
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,248
Easter bunnies are walrus

441
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,880
We talked about

442
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
Leprechaun

443
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,288
Did you see some leprechaun

444
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,384
The point is that those of us

445
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
Personification

446
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,512
I love that Drogba

447
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
Desperately wish

448
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:30,848
There's an alternate universe somewhere where Alex Jones has never talked to a president

449
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:36,992
And spend everyday detailing the leprechaun conspiracy I wish we lived in that

450
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,344
It is what it is a better present a better hypothetical present

451
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,648
Think about this

452
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,696
Alex's talked to multiple president

453
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
If you

454
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,424
Cuz I know that he got arrested or at least escorted out

455
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
Add a route

456
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Yeah

457
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,032
Back when he was governor

458
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
So

459
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,128
He had some sort of a K'nex

460
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
Should with him

461
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,176
Lobster bush

462
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
Trump

463
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,016
Sure he's never talked to Obama

464
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,552
No

465
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
I bet

466
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,160
Yeah yelling though

467
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:21,280
I mean I wiretapped the first or the second President Bush but I didn't talk to him

468
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,424
Yeah I could especially back in the text

469
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:43,552
Different

470
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,832
Pretty out there in

471
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Not

472
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:53,280
Because he talks about leprechauns also I don't know if leprechauns

473
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
Additional

474
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,912
Not what I would have gone through

475
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
Number one

476
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,520
Pot of gold

477
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
Lucky charm

478
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
Alex again realizes they are not doing it

479
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
You're going to

480
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
Cuz that we're late

481
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,472
These people be mine

482
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Hellboy

483
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
What you want to do

484
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
Amanda

485
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
Spectacles

486
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,480
There's so much behind that you're in command

487
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:58,304
Patrick bet-david interview them and toxic

488
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,632
He lost his voice and Alex

489
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,912
That's horrible

490
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
Like if that same like

491
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,288
There's some real Emotion by that

492
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,824
That was a real thing

493
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
Wow

494
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,920
Jerks if we don't promise

495
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
Are good people

496
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,296
Therefore

497
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,344
You're in command now

498
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,184
You are the goblin Emperor you are in

499
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
In charge

500
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
Petsense

501
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,328
Question

502
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:42,336
Where is made very strong indications that he is not as interested in Trump as he used to be

503
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,176
Literally saying

504
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,528
Trump

505
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
Having a good time

506
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,184
Charleston

507
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,256
AJ's establishment type person

508
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,304
What's Alicia be abandoned

509
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,144
I'm happy about that seven persecuted for supporting Trump

510
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,008
I got

511
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,640
Cr1 updated properties of them

512
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,456
They just run me off Trump.

513
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
Trump

514
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
Trump

515
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,296
Maybe trying a shrub

516
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,600
And so it doesn't matter

517
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,160
Instead

518
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,280
Particular phone call

519
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:38,144
Wow no one even liked did they not at all address that

520
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,312
What did Paul Powell said something that like

521
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
Not happy with that

522
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,344
So the idea that

523
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,904
As he's walking out the door

524
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
He cares at all

525
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,256
He knows that Alex is f***** up this whole time

526
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,560
He's either laughing condescending

527
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
Or just like

528
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
Checked out

529
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,912
You are.

530
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,960
You take over

531
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
That sort of vibe

532
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,056
But

533
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
That is

534
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
Interesting

535
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,224
Turn on Trump

536
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:29,344
It specifically what is the idea that he's not been able to get back on Twitter

537
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,416
Like he's mad that Trump isn't putting that executive order out

538
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,232
That will allow him to have a social media presence

539
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,584
So that is what

540
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,264
So you sure it's that I mean you heard that you sure that and not him talking more about likes

541
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,712
Is it is it really just Twitter and not

542
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,760
I'm pissed the truck didn't

543
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,856
Jail the globalist mad about that for two years

544
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,952
Trump's actions are also like

545
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,256
Example

546
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
Because if

547
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,448
Trump a patriot leader

548
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,240
Describing him

549
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,568
All of the issues that Alex has

550
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,640
Globalist

551
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,688
The need to get me back on Twitter

552
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,112
It's none of that stuff

553
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:38,464
Invalidation of crazy president

554
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
Thinking that these are real problem

555
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,656
I mean it's a nice to hear him say that cuz I feel like maybe he's I hope he's speaking for

556
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,472
Other people that 2020

557
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,264
Is it a f****** disaster

558
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,872
I do like hearing Trump made me turn on Trump like that

559
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,432
Give me a little bit of Happy

560
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,272
Something you never expect to hear

561
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:08,672
You kind of expect that people are on the path that's are on

562
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:13,024
The possibility of sincerely like I'm done with it

563
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,192
I think he'll jump to it something worse

564
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
Then Trump

565
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Yeah but

566
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,872
New Jersey with one f****** thing at a time right

567
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,176
So you heard at the end of that last clip

568
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:34,784
That's a call

569
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,368
Getting down to it

570
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,256
Make a call

571
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792

00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,376
Were you in a bonsai

00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,312
Buckaroo Banzai is a cultural treasure

580
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
It's

581
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,272

I can't think of a West hillbilly movie

591
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:18,720
Conspiracy stuff in there if you ever read like the illuminatus trilogy or any Robert Anton Wilson fiction

592
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,792
It's like a movie that's very much in that sort of vein

593
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,704
Yeah yes

594
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,032

595
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,360
So you get another question

596
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,664
The goblin emperor

597
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,968

598
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,504

Presses that in

609
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,144
What you think about

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,960
Mainlining adrenochrome

611
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:40,384
Alessi establishments obsessed with the children's

00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,016

How you penetrate

618
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,144

00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:14,688
Has he taken at this point yeah

623
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:18,528
Earlier where we are on the drunk tail

624
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,880
This is the kind of this is the level

625
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
Leaping into this

626
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,024
Like so f***** up

627
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048

Cab

631
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,496
It's absurd

632
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,872
Oh I wouldn't leave anyone alone who sounded like that cuz they just think that he doesn't sound like

633
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:47,200
Wasted a hat like he sounds wasted in broken

634
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
Yep

635
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
That is

636
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
Heartbreaker

637
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,136
If you cared about someone you would worry about self-harm

638
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
Famous Tate videos

639
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,560
It's it's pretty bad

640
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,144
Where Alex tries to get some

641
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,424
He tries to

642
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
Exploring

643
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,544
I haven't long gaps in his sentences

644
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,592
But he tries to

645
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:22,016
And just talk about like ancient esoteric ideas

646
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,552
And I will tell you

647
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
It does not work

648
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
It was a lot of Lifetime show

649
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:33,024
That I made that decision

650
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,328
Alcohol teacher

651
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864

2019

653
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
God is on our side

654
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,032
And all these enemies are attacking us

655
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,592
Already sold out

656
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,920
I'm glad you're here in Texas

657
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,224
I'm glad that I was chared

658
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,784
Weather radar

659
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,600
My rollover dad

660
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,440
Make sure whenever they see my big big Valley

661
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,744
You know that was somebody

662
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,792
Jennifer Justice

663
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,400
That's where we stand right now

664
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,728
A lot of people that lot of stuff before us

665
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:19,104
Sure we got this far

666
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,664
The people don't appreciate

667
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
Wow

668
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Ship

669
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
But

670
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,608
Long positive

671
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
But no

672
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,192
That's deeply

673
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
Upcider

674
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:53,151
Yeah sorry recognize how much

675
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
Yeah

676
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,759
A little Philly

677
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,831
I mean I get pissed at the Ancient Aliens guys to when he

678
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,927
Takes credit for the pyramids away from the Egyptians but that's not the way to express that

679
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,663
Muscle memory

680
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
Like yeah

681
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:32,831
Used to talk about these things about the many lifetimes and stuff like that

682
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
Giselle

683
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,231
Stumbling into traffic

684
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,279
And he got hit by a boost truck

685
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,839
Yeah I think he hit the booze truck

686
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
So what are the pieces of Alex's

687
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,103
Mythology is that

688
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,407
The globalist

689
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,943
He's on buyout of

690
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,527
Xpressbet

691
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
Think they offered me everything

692
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
The entire world

693
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,903
Anthony gets asked about this

694
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,255
What do you expect

695
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,559
To be quite frankly

696
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,351
When the little green leprechaun

697
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,143
Showed up with a pot of gold

698
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,959
Instead Alex just come over to the dark side

699
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,983
How did you resist

700
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
Wow

701
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,463
Intoxication or if he's like feeling really f***** up about the idea that like

702
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,535
He's decades-long fraud

703
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,375
That the Elites in the global

704
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,399
Adidas

705
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
Wow

706
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,151
Except

707
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
Is

708
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,271
Taking literally

709
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,575
The question that I asked

710
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
Leprechaun

711
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,207
Right right you might be so drunk

712
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Abstractly

713
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
That is

714
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,375
So you're either too drunk to think abstractly or too drunk to lie

715
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:28,287
One of the two

716
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,639
The idea of him being offered a ton of money comes up

717
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
Is a couple minutes later

718
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,711
And Alex

719
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,271
Answer

720
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,135
How much was it

721
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,207
How many steps in a mile

722
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,655
Stepan Rangers

723
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,215
Harborview

724
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
Volcanion

725
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,823
Play Z-Ro

726
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,623
Hours of dinosaurs

727
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:21,279
Okay chicslook Freedom do you guys have to send

728
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
Hard-hitting question

729
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,887
Do they have to turn down baby constantly

730
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,471
No problem

731
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
Facebook

732
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,895
Christian conservative girlfriend

733
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
How do I suppress

734
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,319
So I guess

735
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,111
Millions of dollars

736
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,743
Differences

737
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,399
There are there are large didn't they have been three different offers

738
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
So some sort

739
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:04,287
He's so consistent

740
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
Is Owen

741
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:16,831
They're both being pretty mean to Alex I think he knows

742
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
Alex isn't going to remember this

743
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,903
I think that's part of it

744
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:24,767
And Alex never watches the content

745
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
To do that with all the

746
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,607
Turn on air

747
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,007
Roger's going to prison

748
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,055
Jeroan

749
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,335
It's never going to happen

750
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:47,295
Owen Shroyer

751
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,623
Choice between my cat

752
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,207
And I was bleeding out and needed a tourniquet applied

753
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,607
I think I'd try for the cat first you know it's not likely that they'll be able to pull it off

754
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,887
The cat put its possible

755
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,167
If possible

756
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,471
You don't have a fever

757
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,751
No no

758
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
No

759
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,335
Nor do I trust him to apply tourniquets

760
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:17,247
I thought this was no longer responsible

761
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:24,159
Play stupid s***

762
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
Owen Shroyer

763
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,535
Paul Joseph Watson

764
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
And everyone at Infowars

765
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:43,359
I take child endangerment it kind of sounds like that right now

766
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,919
Might be a crime

767
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,455
And this next quick was just like

768
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,503
You are so f****** awful

769
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:56,159
I'll buy you beer

770
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,719
Divides when you say something

771
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,255
Put it out in the universe

772
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,303
You know

773
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
All I know is

774
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:18,943
Associate

775
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,063
Really

776
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:30,975
Yeah in response to a question

777
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,983
And be like we have to take care of you

778
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,567
Like you are in right now

779
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,847
Insane

780
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:50,431
It's a profound abuse

781
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,855
She loses the ability to speak in complete sentences and

782
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,415
The course of that like 20 seconds

783
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,743
Do I go to bed

784
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,679
I don't know why on air

785
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,495
It's heartbreaking that the man who is

786
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,311
So drunk I doubt he can stand

787
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,079
Hits

788
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:24,735
That point of realization before either of his Sober Sober colleagues do

789
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,343
Really

790
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:36,255
Embarrassment for everybody like

791
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,279
Stop with embarrassing

792
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,095
Oxycotton stupid

793
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,655
This is next level

794
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:51,103
But

795
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,407
He also picks up the self-awareness

796
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
The people are laughing

797
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,735
And the Paul Joseph

798
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,039
Owen Shroyer are laughing at him

799
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:05,439
And he tries to express it in this next clip

800
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,023
Yeah that's days like I

801
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,959
SharePoint

802
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,735
Right now

803
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
Horseradish

804
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
That's

805
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,975
That's very that's very sad

806
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,559
Yeah most of those weren't even words

807
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:43,839
Nope

808
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,655
Starts with bomber Pilots

809
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,727
Everyone's laughing

810
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,007
Everyone is lying

811
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:57,919
I didn't even really here like up until everyone's laughing none of that wasn't eligible to me

812
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,271
I mean bomber Pilots are important

813
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,575
I got that

814
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,647
I appreciate you

815
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,975
Computing the ennobled bomber pilot

816
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,535
Oh man a good bomber pilot

817
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,095
Things to do

818
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
Vomit people

819
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,167
Is one of them

820
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:25,311
I think Alex is trying to use it as a metaphor but being really unsuccessful

821
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,383
Over over global of territory

822
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,919
Let's just

823
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
I would

824
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,503
Windy windy

825
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,039
In a year or two

826
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
I would love to

827
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:39,647
To see someone just completely re-edit Top Gun

828
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:45,535
Replace Tom Cruise with current-day Alex Jones

829
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:51,935
That would be be able to capture intoxication

830
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
Then leave

831
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,983
3 years yeah

832
00:51:54,495 --> 00:52:00,639
Okay alright

833
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:06,527
It's going to destroy democracy will get to see Alex Jones and Top Gun and

834
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,831
Gone with the Wind

835
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,623
The Democrat

836
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,439
Small price to pay

837
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:23,935
Paul Joseph Watson

838
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:29,567
Alex getting into the emotional part

839
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,127
I'm a beast

840
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:38,527
A lot of the time I know he's fake crying when he talks about like loving this country and stuff like that

841
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,343
Sure I think that this is real crying

842
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,135
I want to see

843
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,183
It's about is even more f***** up

844
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,255
By Twitter's lawyer

845
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,279
Congratulate your children away

846
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
Procedure wig

847
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,527
I didn't do anything

848
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,551
Rich woman

849
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,391
Vagina whatever

850
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:56,863
Is Alex

851
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,727
Vagina

852
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,519
So

853
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,591
Insulting her like that

854
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,687
The kids away

855
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,991
Which is really f***** up

856
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,319
That was just

857
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
Really sad

858
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:29,631
That was just a man who's lost or is in the process of losing everything and realizes it breaking down

859
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:33,983
Down in front of his friends and then realizing he does not have friends

860
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,055
Poking at my

861
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,223
If you know Alex at all you know what state

862
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:51,391
That's not going down

863
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,671
Crying about it

864
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,743
Bucked up these people

865
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,047
Awful people

866
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,863
I feel bad for Alex Jones

867
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,191
Yeah I know it's one of those really weird feelings

868
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
I hate

869
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:09,055
I hate him so much in this tiny snapshot at 8

870
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:18,271
Because for all of the many things that he is Alex is clearly not

871
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,319
And

872
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,463
Narcissist

873
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:32,095
He's definitely a narcissist we know that and he might have borderline personality disorder but like

874
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,143
I don't think

875
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
A real

876
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,703
Psychopath

877
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,263
Cry about his kids like that

878
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,335
That's a person who

879
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,639
Really cares about something

880
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,479
Alternative explanation

881
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,783
He's a sociopath who's really drunk

882
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,415
In that circumstance

883
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
I don't know

884
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:04,351
That seems like real crying to me but he does like Alex Jones has been doing this for 27 years

885
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,079
A thousand times

886
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:17,151
Which makes it harder to look at

887
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,503
People think exactly

888
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,831
Said they're like I hate that I feel sorry for how I

889
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,415
It's the reality of this

890
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,975
How many sets important especially for like

891
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,279
Your show is essentially

892
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:39,679
Analyzing this guy and what he's doing and trying to explain it because he has he's not unimportant he has a real

893
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:42,751
Impact on the world and it had one but he

894
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:49,151
Like his whole brand of what he does is so completely devoid of empathy which is why he's able to do such terrible

895
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,711
S*** like you did to the Sandy Hook families because

896
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,479
Like

897
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:59,647
Cut that out of his work almost entirely you get these little Snippets of it feel like when he's crying out but also like

898
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,415
During that

899
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,951
We first heard about Sandy Hook

900
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
Like

901
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:09,375
There were those little moments for you can tell like oh he might feel terrible about what he's about to do or at least

902
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,399
He's conflicted

903
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,423
He does it

904
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
Like

905
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,983
F****** for that but like

906
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,591
They're like those moments where you can like see him cross a Rubicon in his own head

907
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:21,919
Damn there's a choice involved with

908
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:24,991
Depressing whatever feeling you have

909
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Whatever like

910
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,295
You have empathy

911
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:30,111
But you ignore it in order to do the job

912
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,135
Or whatever the mission

913
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,743
And if you do don't look at him that way

914
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,303
Missing context

915
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,607
I guess there is a point

916
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,911
Feeling bad for him every now and again

917
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,727
Yeah you got it

918
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,895
He doesn't cry for long if I were them I would say over

919
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,687
This is it we are done

920
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,735
My boss is

921
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:01,343
Having a meltdown

922
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,135
I pissed at the cameraman

923
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,951
Pornography like no no no no

924
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
No

925
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,535
Whoever's the producer like where

926
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,071
Where is Alex's dad

927
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,887
His award

928
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,167
Where are these

929
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:20,799
About it

930
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Yeah

931
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,895
Scrying

932
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
Question

933
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,623
I guess in his

934
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:41,279
Why do they hate you so much though Alice what is it about you that they date

935
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:47,167
Music

936
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:53,567
Did he say I've got music or I like that music

937
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,615
Reflective

938
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,735
Bumper Music

939
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
Like that

940
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:06,879
With that

941
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,927
Yeah yeah

942
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:15,071
Yeah because even resist the a softball underhand pitch

943
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
People hate you

944
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:22,239
That question a thousand times

945
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:29,919
Pretty sweet

946
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:33,503
Earlier Owens

947
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:36,063
Alex

948
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,623
They're still on the air

949
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,647
They're on the radio

950
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,023
And so he knows that these stations

951
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,047
Playing the show

952
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
The country

953
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,911
Do not allow

954
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,007
Because towards the end of this house is so drunk

955
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,287
He just can't stop swearing

956
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,623
Alright

957
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,975
He lost control of his own abilities

958
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,815
Probably earlier

959
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,655
A little bit earlier the show

960
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,959
Complaining

961
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,239
Is a dick

962
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:34,687
Alex is bad that Jon Ronson a couple weeks ago Alex

963
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:38,527
Snake and it's trying to set him up for something like that

964
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
I'm not sure

965
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,647
Talking about

966
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,415
But

967
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:48,767
Towards the end of this

968
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:51,839
Jon Ronson

969
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:56,447
And I will let you decide whether or not this is a real Jon Ronson call

970
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:05,663
And we're talk about John earlier and Alex

971
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,455
I don't know what the screeners

972
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:11,807
Are fighting about now

973
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,343
Hello Alice

974
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:17,951
How are you friend

975
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
I'm judge

976
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,031
My friend a little busy man

977
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,615
So lonely

978
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,455
Are you lonely

979
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,183
Sounds effect Jon Ronson

980
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:56,095
Yeah who goes through like three accidents in three sentences

981
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:59,679
Is that a good point to bring up the idea to Boston

982
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:02,239
6 conservatives are getting better at comedy

983
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,823
Scaring scaring

984
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,943
Getting so funny

985
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,991
Conservatives are stained

986
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,831
Here

987
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,111
What the joke is

988
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:22,207
I take it to the Jon Ronson have an effeminate voice

989
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,767
Yeah he's he sounds a little like a lady

990
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,095
That's

991
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,119
Solid

992
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:32,703
Solid setup complete jokes

993
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,263
They didn't develop the theme at all either like

994
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,591
I know you can't rely on Alex to do set up work here

995
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:48,575
The two of them should have been able to ask a question to the comedy from the collar

996
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,647
He's there he's playing a character

997
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,559
Or anything like that

998
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:02,655
The elephant in the room is that you're not you're not really

999
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,935
Or something

1000
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
Nothing

1001
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,311
Emmett's next clip

1002
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:14,175
We get to see the psychodrama that's been building of there we can't talk about

1003
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,247
How Paul is leaving

1004
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:20,831
Kind of comes to a head

1005
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:21,855
Where Alex

1006
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
This

1007
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,159
Paul needs to

1008
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,439
Specific

1009
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:29,023
Better addictive of like taking over

1010
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,559
He's operation

1011
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,959
It-it's

1012
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,263
It's almost like he's trying tonight him

1013
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
Or something like that

1014
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,615
It's bizarre

1015
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,687
We don't want the leadership Paul

1016
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,479
Zyrtec-D leadership

1017
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,087
Radical Muslims

1018
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,391
Perverts

1019
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
Penniman

1020
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,071
Leadership

1021
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,607
Flareon

1022
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,687
You have to take me to ship

1023
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,735
Or someone else will say I

1024
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599
Italian

1025
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
Take it

1026
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,439
You don't know what else.

1027
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:34,815
That's so important

1028
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,583
For Alex

1029
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,863
Wow

1030
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,471
He really seems to care about this

1031
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,495
Yeah

1032
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:45,567
Performing

1033
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:52,223
Yet about having someone to carry on his legacy I think I think there's a part of it is that

1034
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:57,343
Work for will go to Dust in the Wind

1035
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,623
If someone else does

1036
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,903
Keep the fire

1037
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,719
Probably

1038
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,047
Is Paul Joseph Watson is the person who takes

1039
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,631
I might be able to still make some money off that

1040
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:13,983
Being in between responses

1041
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,799
Something

1042
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,711
He would have influence over Paul like he be able to appear on Paul's show

1043
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,991
And stuff like that

1044
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,015
His personal

1045
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,575
Even if

1046
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
410A

1047
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,135
There's some of that in

1048
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,183
This makes me wonder

1049
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:38,559
What we don't know about Infowars as Financial or legal situation cuz I

1050
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,351
It seems like something

1051
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,399
Calamitous is imminent

1052
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:48,799
Or even could be Alex's help

1053
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,359
Disclose for radios

1054
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:57,759
John being an elder

1055
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:05,183
Yeah but like 65 when you considered all the drinking

1056
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,607
From

1057
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,399
Childhood fights

1058
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,679
Stuff like that

1059
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,567
If you stop working with something I certainly would want

1060
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,591
Continue doing this

1061
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
But

1062
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,967
Suspicion

1063
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,247
Part of it

1064
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:33,343
And it's not necessarily the lawsuits.

1065
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,391
Because I'm not sure if

1066
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,767
But the stuff allowed

1067
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,559
Discovery

1068
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:45,375
Is Suffolk his financial records advertising

1069
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,167
I think like that

1070
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,471
Probably

1071
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,495
Concerned about that

1072
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,775
Information becoming public

1073
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,055
Oh yeah

1074
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,871
Destroy his entire thing

1075
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:00,991
Connection process

1076
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,295
It invalidates the entirety of his career

1077
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,111
Like he's been someone who is paid by

1078
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:10,719
A special interest or something like that

1079
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,535
He's not the man in the woods

1080
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,303
Screaming

1081
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,095
Stop profit

1082
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,887
He is just another shell

1083
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,959
I wonder if he's got money from the NRA

1084
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,263
I don't think back in the day

1085
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,799
Maybe

1086
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
More recent

1087
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:30,943
Yeah yeah cuz he used to be Auntie NRA controlled opposition and stuff but

1088
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:37,855
Gun owners for America or preservation of firearm

1089
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,695
Really big into as Gunn

1090
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:45,279
Groups back in the day if possible I don't know

1091
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:52,447
Specific Siri we have is like

1092
01:07:54,495 --> 01:08:00,639
I don't like not from Minecraft's been funding his operation for the Last 5 Years

1093
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,391
Episode

1094
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:14,719
He has a break and he's a

1095
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:19,327
And

1096
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,631
Before him on the show of being like

1097
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,703
Volume over you must be the leader

1098
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,055
The Muslims are perverts takeover

1099
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:34,175
The show

1100
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,807
This war

1101
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,623
March 5th 2019

1102
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
And

1103
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,047
From today's broadcast

1104
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,607
Not for a long time

1105
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,399
Wow

1106
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,799
It's almost

1107
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,359
I don't even know people to understand them

1108
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,151
I think we can

1109
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,479
He's right

1110
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:14,367
Jokes about fruit

1111
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,415
I feel

1112
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:23,071
Too gross to make fun of him for most of this funny to make fun of but

1113
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:30,239
Phoenix

1114
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:35,103
Difference of these people that he's worked with for

1115
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,639
Cancel lifetime

1116
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,431
That's

1117
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:44,063
At least Owen just came into the fold like a couple years ago

1118
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:51,231
Alex's known Paul Joseph Watson since he was like that like covid-19 or something like that together

1119
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,535
Early Infowars days

1120
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,583
Family

1121
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:59,935
Brother Houston

1122
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:03,519
There was a real connection there that should exist that appears not to

1123
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,055
The bomber

1124
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,591
Yeah it's hard for me

1125
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:10,431
Contacts drop

1126
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,455
Thumbs up

1127
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,527
Call Michelle

1128
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,463
There

1129
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,535
This will be talked about for a long time

1130
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,815
Is it car crash

1131
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,583
Except

1132
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,895
Anything you're walking away from this with

1133
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:44,479
I mean did he do we see him

1134
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,015
Walk away from the table

1135
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:51,647
No I don't believe so go to break and then

1136
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,327
Capable of walking

1137
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,935
Five pm

1138
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:10,335
It's not like a late night episode

1139
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:17,759
I don't know cuz I listen to the episode

1140
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,063
For now reasonably normal

1141
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,623
I think it's got going

1142
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,927
The fourth our host took over on his show

1143
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:29,279
Start slamming until start

1144
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,071
Hour and a half two hours

1145
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,423
That's plenty of time

1146
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:43,871
Is inspiration for this amount of drinking was because

1147
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:49,503
What did really come from a place of where he emotionally wasn't sure how to handle

1148
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,807
Paul's departure and so he was like

1149
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,111
Just started drinking like is that

1150
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:01,023
Does the timing of MS

1151
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,327
That sort of stuff

1152
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,095
Pasta

1153
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,751
It it seems important

1154
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,031
Timer

1155
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:17,919
Either that or some other bad news

1156
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:21,247
Definitely emotion

1157
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:29,183
Out of him than I'm used to thing that's like not just Alex Jones Telegraph rage but is like

1158
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
Human

1159
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:36,863
We'll meet at matters came out with a story about the vet

1160
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:43,263
Story about that the Sandy Hook victims families

1161
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,079
Recently to this

1162
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:50,431
And realize that information

1163
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,455
2 tons

1164
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,759
I don't know I think

1165
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:00,159
Alex is aware that you

1166
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,695
Piss without Paul

1167
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:07,071
When he knows he has to announce the next day that Paul is starting his own operation

1168
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:10,655
Hey Paul says it's within a couple weeks like it's a media

1169
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,959
He's going to start his own thing immediately

1170
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:17,311
I think Alex the part of the awareness that he hasn't I'm announcing

1171
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:20,383
The effective end of me being able to do what I do

1172
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,687
He overcame

1173
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:25,503
It made him so essential as an employee

1174
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,063
You need to hire

1175
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:35,231
He put all his eggs in one small racist British man

1176
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,047
Classic

1177
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,239
And that tiny and Englishmen

1178
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,519
Certainly.

1179
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:51,359
I think they're strong indications that Alex

1180
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:54,175
At least emotionally on his way out of

1181
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,527
How much of that is

1182
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,415
I'm excited to see

1183
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:12,095
Robert

1184
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,055
It's on iTunes Spotify where you were blue pods are casted you can find behind the bastards

1185
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:27,711

1186
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:32,831

Superman

1188
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Highlight

1189
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:45,631
I am grateful for that and for bringing me on I'm not

1190
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:52,031
Comedy stuff as usual man Jordan

1191
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:58,431
I was listening to you guys in the car on my way to drive to The Hollywood Reporter podcast today and when I

1192
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:02,271
I love your show and then and then happy to

1193
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:07,135
To be your your Owen Shroyer today

1194
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:12,255

1195
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,279
Guyger support

1196
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:18,911
Complement

1197
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,663
Owen Shroyer probably hasn't killed anybody

1198
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:37,087
Yeah I'm sure you're probably hasn't and I I don't say Paul never leaves his house so I don't

1199
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:40,671
Pause kill anybody

1200
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:44,511
Leaving now it's down the path that might lead to his own destruction

1201
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,119
You could say their accomplices to an eventual murder

1202
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,935
Pet spot

1203
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:58,335
