00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B B I'm sick of them

Knowledge vype.com

4
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,888
Alex Jones

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,216
Have you ever had a moment where you felt like you would be

6
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Old

7
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,800
You're like disconnected from the

8
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,080
Slang that

9
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
Maybe when

10
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,128
Disconnect

11
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,152
Did from the DU

12
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,944
Every single

13
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
Powerball NY on fleek

14
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:35,488
Really made me feel old even old at this point

15
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:40,352
Now I don't know I guess I'm in the VMAs were last night as we're recording this

16
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:45,728
I saw a bunch of stuff on Twitter about that I've liked I have almost no idea who have

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,640
I'm aware of

18
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
I don't know why I

19
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,760
I'm so disconnected from music

20
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:03,136
Because there were a lot of like a right-wing people who are kind of like

21
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:09,792
Sad about music or whatever

22
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,912
A bunch of these people I've absolutely no idea who they are

23
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Getting Awards

24
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,592
Baby feels a little bit out of it on Twitter people were talking about Eddie Murphy

25
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,432
SNL I don't care about that at all

26
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
The board

27
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,016
Of people who are hosting in musical act

28
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,344
I have no idea

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,208
Years and years ago every single person who hosted or where the musical act

30
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,328
Of their work who they were now's

31
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
I have no f******

32
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,960
Idea

33
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:55,104
Some of this was when I was 22

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,432
But I don't know judge

35
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Do you third

36
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,504
Are the the culture itself for like

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,808
Being something I'm out of touch with life

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
I've made that decision

39
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
Do basically just listen

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
The fucken Alex Jones

41
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:12,768
All the time.

42
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,608
Alex starts yelling about Billy English I promise I'll know who she is

43
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,656
Good for now

44
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,520
Not really any idea for you to stay in contact with

45
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,920
Current pictures of Alex Jones reviews on with everybody

46
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,480
Ubuntu album agree with his taste

47
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,392
Real Bubblegum

48
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,280
Real Housewives show

49
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
Would be amazing

50
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,960
About to pop culture but I do know a lot about Alex Jones

51
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,568
Today we're going over the past 2013

52
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
24th

53
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
Through 26

54
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
2013

55
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
The reasoning for that is

56
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
I started listening to Mondays

57
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
Show of Alex's

58
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,392
It was largely screaming about China

59
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
And I wasn't

60
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Super interested in

61
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
And I wanted

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
2checkout

63
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,583
Then the second variable is another

64
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
Reason I feel very old

65
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
And that is on Monday I woke up

66
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
And I could not hear out of my right

67
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
You're right

68
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
I was pretty

69
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,103
Not entirely but mostly deaf in my right ear

70
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:37,503
And it led to a bit of a freak out on my part on Monday

71
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
Little bit I'll be honest

72
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
And

73
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,183
It's going to be interesting to talk about because this episode

74
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,255
What is the medication towards the

75
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:53,887
Vu Sandy Hook crisis actor narrative felt like there's a lot of momentum going

76
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,727
Our predictions have been completely and utterly wrong

77
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
Not yet

78
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,311
It didn't

79
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,639
But they're starting to call the number of thing

80
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Things actor involved

81
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,759
Are you throwing in actors in the Aurora shooting

82
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
Talk about the

83
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
G20

84
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,367
Protested 2009 Meryl Streep

85
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927

To never let anyone

113
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Sweetly get that song out

114
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,863
The moment

115
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,959

116
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311

Would appreciate it

119
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Now let's get into it

120
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
So there was no snow on the 23rd

121
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
Alex comes in

122
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
Coming in

123
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
Pretty

124
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
In bloom

125
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,791
Heavy beginning to an epi

126
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,519
Add March 2013 for teaspoon 2013 will be

127
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:46,687
And the rear view mirror as well

128
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,159
Welcome to the show we will all soon be dead

129
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
That's Tuff

130
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,535
He's in a bad headspace

131
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
Is the bedside with March

132
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:08,447
If you said we're soon going to be the end of 2013 yeah

133
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,735
QuickTime passed over on January 3rd

134
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:31,231
But

135
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,279
What's important

136
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
Cool

137
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
So I thought like oh my God

138
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
He is f***** up

139
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,959
It is going to be weird Eclipse show

140
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,615
He said we're all going to die

141
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,431
Directly to

142
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,599
There's a couple of old interviews yes

143
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,671
Literally a producer

144
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
We got it

145
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,119
It's crazy cuz he was at work he was

146
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
Because I don't think that was pretty

147
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,775
Recorded it doesn't have the same tone as a lot of the times

148
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
It seems like he was just there

149
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
I don't want to do the show and work on something else

150
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,175
Replay that other interview

151
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:27,295
Jesus a pretty wild

152
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,879
We go over like an interview with rose

153
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,463
The Quarry about Agenda 21

154
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
Do the 25th

155
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Monday

156
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
March 25th

157
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Alex

158
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
Portion of the show getting into some

159
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,495
Something I never expected

160
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Defined

161
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
And is one of the weirdest things

162
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
I've ever heard Abby

163
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Confer aleksandr

164
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
Of the Koch brothers

165
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
Manufactured or fake

166
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
This is weird

167
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
Are you f****** with us

168
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,119
This is weird

169
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
Bright

170
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,223
Whatsoever 2013 investigator I'm not

171
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,063
It is very weird

172
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:10,463
Influence of the past and present

173
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
I know that I have heard clips of Alex

174
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
That's where he talks about

175
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
The Koch brothers

176
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
In one of them

177
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
That I've heard

178
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
He says that they're not

179
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,239
Weird weird

180
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
He had brought them up before

181
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,615
But not to be expected here on this 25th Avenue

182
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
He has a lot

183
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
To say

184
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,527
What are the things I find particularly interesting

185
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,551
Think about this news like

186
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
Let's imagine that the worst thing that Alex

187
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,439
Did find is that the Koch family broke

188
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,743
By helping with equipment selling

189
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
Oil refinery stuff to run

190
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
Even if that

191
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
True

192
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
Imagine is Soros

193
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,943
Deal if David Rockefeller it's older on equipment

194
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,039
In the first place is anybody who's breaking anything

195
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,599
Haha

196
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
Correct

197
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
It's weird

198
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
It's that it's a very weird line

199
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:20,351
That I'm seeing here and I don't know what to make of it

200
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
This for me to research

201
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,751
I'll tell you why

202
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:32,895
Yeah that is a good question I don't know I don't think it proves that he's being paid by the Koch brothers or anything like that but it's a

203
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Do it again

204
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
Super weird line

205
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
This is my opinion that perhaps

206
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
As a psychic link

207
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
2013

208
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,927
Influencing his own coverage post-facto in order to

209
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,511
Maybe that's some of the technology along with life extension

210
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Engine technology

211
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,119
For being such a dutiful servant

212
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
It's possible

213
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:00,799
Yeah I don't know whatever the case was able to dig up that means he's not look

214
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,663
Either doesn't want to look too hard

215
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
Or he has looked into it

216
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
And realizes like

217
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Well

218
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Well it's just

219
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:17,439
Say that no big deal

220
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:23,839
Funneling all kinds of money into things that I am against

221
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,495
Climate change or regulation bone

222
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
To do with the

223
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
Seized

224
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
The thing is though that I was only getting into this

225
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
I think

226
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Because he gets

227
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Accused

228
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
Working for the Koch brothers

229
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,951
A B natural

230
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
People to make

231
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,279
I mean he behaves like someone who would be

232
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Suspicious

233
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
You almost think he is stupid if he

234
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
He's not taking

235
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,871
Or principles which we know he's not

236
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
So Alex is responding

237
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Into that

238
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
Into that and those thoughts and feelings

239
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
He has about those accusation

240
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
Largest private Corporation in the country

241
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
Hours of it gets released

242
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
Alex Koch Industries is like a little mom-and-pop

243
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,135
That's why Walmart is taking over everybody

244
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
It's been awhile

245
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,839
It's insane he can be putting forth the idea that it's like

246
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
Family business

247
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,935
I meant at the same time sewer perpetuating

248
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Like

249
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,751
They're America's end

250
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
Simple things

251
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,615
Really occupy the same space

252
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:50,015
They're relatable it's just small business owners and the other one is

253
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:55,135
They are running the whole show

254
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:00,767
The guys in trading places if they were mixed with an anarcho-capitalist nightmare dystopia

255
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,327
There's nothing like that nothing

256
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:14,591
It's it's almost like that before we get too far into this

257
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
Text goes in

258
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Phrasing the Koch brothers

259
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
Makes me think he's a not getting any

260
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,343
Anybody from even for somebody

261
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,695
Who is on their payroll

262
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,231
Tons and tons of money from

263
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Like freedomworks

264
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,095
American prosperity

265
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:42,495
Almost

266
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
You're in the clear

267
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,615
Which opens up even more question

268
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
Trying to

269
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
But anyway

270
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,103
Is hot water.

271
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,063
Smartcore the founder

272
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,279
G in the 40s

273
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:44,959
For the night

274
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,559
Suspicious in his absence is any discussion of like

275
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
Fred Coquina found

276
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,399
Remember the John Birch Society

277
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:19,775
No we had

278
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,359
He should be like I didn't know anything about

279
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
12 dudes

280
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,807
It's

281
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:38,207
Very much especially from the 40s

282
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
50 more to say about the Koch brothers

283
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:44,351
Authorities in forties was the

284
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
Scientific

285
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,447
Pieces of it

286
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
Cool Power Plant

287
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
Fayetteville Texas

288
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
I don't know if it close

289
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
When he was saying it's due to close

290
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,223
I'm not positive that this is the exact

291
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,783
Same power plant in Fayetteville Texas

292
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
I would say that it is

293
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,879
Power plant

294
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
A cool Power Plant

295
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
In Fayetteville Texas

296
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Still open

297
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,071
Because I found an interesting article in the text

298
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,911
From January 2019 with a headline quote

299
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,727
Report Texas Coal Power Plant

300
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
Pollutants into groundwater

301
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
The report found that all six

302
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
Scene of a coal-fired power plant

303
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
Texas

304
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
Redwater

305
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,247
And it none of them were complying with regulations about spent coal disposal

306
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783
I just want to say that Fred Coke

307
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
Is a

308
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Genius

309
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,879
In terms of the Fayetteville plan

310
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:43,231
Specifically to argue that the pollution wasn't fault

311
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
Just naturally occurring

312
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,303
But samples taken from UPS

313
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,607
From the plant were compared to Once Downstream

314
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,167
And those Downstream head quotes

315
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,703
Significantly higher

316
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,263
And therefore probably not

317
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
What can

318
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Look

319
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
We all get it

320
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
You tried to pull one over

321
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,247
We caught

322
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:12,159
Like it we get it you tried to pull one over we've all been there

323
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
Polluting and destroying the planet

324
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:18,047
But now you got to fix it

325
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,607
Naturally occurring murdered

326
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,959
Plausible deniability

327
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
Oh my God

328
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
So

329
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
I don't think this is

330
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
Strong stuff

331
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
It's very weird

332
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
Keystone Pipeline

333
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
Because

334
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,623
Oh no he believes the opposition to the Cole

335
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
The Keystone Pipeline is just about attacking

336
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
The Koch brothers

337
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
Which is

338
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Sincerely true

339
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
Is he like once

340
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Step away from

341
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
It's not fair

342
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:00,543
But I don't I don't actually know his position on that but I do know he doesn't really care if they are protesting

343
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,144
Alex knows that it's tar sand oil

344
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,496
Doesn't good you should know that

345
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
Clean burning

346
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:36,896
Keystone Pipeline being built with lower energy costs

347
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
Is implying equities

348
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:42,016
Is that his feelings are loyal come to the United States

349
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,856
So that's a fallacious piece of propaganda largely pushed by people in

350
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
The pocket of Big Oil

351
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,464
In 2015 President Obama signed

352
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Spending

353
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,304
Which was a necessary step to avoid

354
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Be threatened cover

355
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
Shutdown

356
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,680
The GOP has lobbied hard to make sure that a provision was buried in that budget

357
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
Agreement that lifted the ban on us

358
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
Exporting crude oil

359
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,104
Which nearly all experts agree it's something

360
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
Us consumer

361
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:13,248
Because that ban has been lifted there's no reason to believe that the tar sand oil that comes

362
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,064
The US refineries will ever be sold on the US market

363
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,904
There's every reason to believe that if it's

364
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Profitable for the oil companies

365
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
A good batting

366
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Lowering the price

367
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
You're the US isn't there Prime profit

368
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
It strategy

369
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
Alex repeating this line of rhetoric

370
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:33,472
Is a good indication that he has no idea what he's talking about and is just bought the corporate propaganda

371
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Or much

372
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
Less likely he has some oil money

373
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,616
I don't think we have evidence of that bit like

374
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,992
Like I said this Behavior mirror someone who does or what

375
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
That's what makes this really

376
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Complicated

377
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,464
I'm not satisfied with his behavior being he's on a payroll

378
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,536
It's just like I get why someone would think that

379
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Anyway

380
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
Another problem is supported

381
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
Keystone XL pipeline

382
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
Is the building it would require using eminent domain

383
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
To take people's property away who are the path of Pi play

384
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
Totally find a broker

385
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
Curfew sanctions

386
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
It's not that big a deal

387
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,944
LaRosa's

388
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
He's he's

389
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,248
Essential

390
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Going to come

391
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
The private property

392
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
One of the most important

393
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
Pieces of the West

394
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
But I guess it building an oil pipeline to profit

395
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
But not a controlling dust

396
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
Of course which is weird it doesn't

397
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
It doesn't make sense

398
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,120
America

399
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
Can land and

400
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
That's it does

401
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
Account

402
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,288
So I'll talk about everything is getting shots

403
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
The energy

404
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,896
It's all getting shut down and take it all out

405
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
Probably cuz of the glove

406
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,736
But then everybody comes like

407
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,040
The Koch brothers are so evil

408
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:10,496
County

409
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:30,976
Open

410
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,584
He's on the payroll

411
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,400
You are some sort of

412
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
Business b w propaganda

413
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
You wouldn't

414
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
Allows that

415
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
I don't think you would allow that

416
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,360
Over the top

417
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
Stupid

418
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,968
It's too stupid its way out of line

419
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,760
It's it's too over

420
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,808
Exposed

421
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
The only like

422
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,928
That would be a contract that they would have to go into

423
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
Fully aware

424
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,304
Vets say something incredibly wrong

425
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,704
But even the business for himself

426
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,776
Business to go Rogue

427
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:51,104
You know it'll be a net gain for you so

428
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
You know that kind

429
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:57,760
Anybody who is interested in advancing a particular end

430
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
Would probably not work with Alex G

431
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,160
I think the idea of hiring him

432
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
Push propaganda is

433
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
Not in your best in

434
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,768
For two reasons

435
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,584
One is exactly where describing

436
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,608
Just go Way Off Script

437
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
Ecobee

438
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,960
It could either be embarrassingly over-the-top

439
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
Like this

440
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,872
It were this to be paid broker programming

441
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,152
Do you know

442
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,224
Not really a cheese your end result by what he's

443
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,296
Because of his own picadillos

444
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,344
The second reason is

445
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
If you approach

446
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,928
He's not interested

447
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
He will turn you into

448
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,488
His next villain

449
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:44,096
He's unreliable in that way and if you don't buy him for life

450
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
As soon as

451
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,936
He's free of whatever agreement you have

452
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,240
He now has information

453
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
That could bury you

454
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,824
There's no indication

455
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,176
He seems like someone it would be very dangerous

456
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
To try and buy off

457
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,504
On the off-chance

458
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
But he has

459
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,600
Principles or he sees a bigger payday out of

460
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
Rapping the script

461
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,464
Brothers

462
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
Would be

463
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Smarter than

464
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
And to do that

465
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,584
Glenn Beck

466
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
Today would not be

467
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Be smarter to do that

468
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,728
I am going to say however that

469
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
Billionaires are almost uniformly

470
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,640
Strategy do

471
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
IQ

472
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,480
I don't know I don't think we have many examples

473
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
You know billionaires paying off

474
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Folk

475
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
Who is an immediate

476
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,232
I think you just I think you don't

477
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,280
It could just be that he's

478
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
Trapped in the mythology of the

479
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,120
Society that his dad raised him

480
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,936
So before I even looked into the Koch brothers

481
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
Remember

482
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
And then he's just

483
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,640
Barbers all over their numbers

484
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
Maybe

485
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,200
I think that Alex

486
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,272
Pretty into all of the political thing

487
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
The Koch brothers

488
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
Support

489
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,440
I'm into all that stuff

490
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,256
He doesn't want to open up

491
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
Open the door

492
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
That

493
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,120
Into like oh my God they have a business

494
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
Teen maze

495
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
Of foundations that they used

496
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
The fund all this stuff

497
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
Politically active

498
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,824
And give almost exclusively to

499
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
To GOP candidates

500
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
I don't think he wants

501
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,712
Too closely mirrors that

502
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:40,320
He screams about the globalist

503
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
Pens that are not political

504
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
Support of them

505
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
He's just like

506
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
Based on this

507
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
There are business

508
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
People

509
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,560
Industry everybody for that

510
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,096
Internet way he kind of just

511
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,376
Uses criticism

512
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Brothers

513
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,448
The people might have

514
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
It is listening

515
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,800
They're able to

516
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
Just toss them aside as

517
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,896
Oh this is just cuz they're in the energy

518
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:09,760
I think it's theirs that I don't know if I don't know if it's

519
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
Strictly related

520
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,624
Possibly

521
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
Cursory glance

522
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
He realized

523
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,256
They were behaving

524
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
Exactly as the global

525
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
That he

526
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
It says are evil

527
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,520
But the real globalist

528
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:36,640
Who happened to agree with literally everything he believes that's the problem

529
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,968
The opening himself up for the globalist

530
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
On the right

531
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,368
It over complicates The Narrative for him

532
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,160
I don't think you be able to

533
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,464
We spend all the yards that he does

534
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,256
Were there to be the

535
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
The idea of

536
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:58,912
People who behave exactly like the demons that he yells about have

537
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,472
Exactly the same social and political goals that he

538
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,752
He does if he comes

539
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:08,640
It's too difficult of his own accord

540
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,176
Like without anybody paying

541
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
Cuz it does still serve

542
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
Hughes Internet

543
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
His world using

544
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,416
Explanations of Isis

545
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
But it's it's

546
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:26,048
Complicated like I don't literally no way without me

547
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,632
Seeing Alex's finances for me to tell you what

548
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,936
It would just be ranked speculation

549
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,728
I'm not I'm not super interested in

550
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
Creating a conspiracy of him being

551
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,568
Koch funded

552
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,104
Although the possibility

553
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,664
I just don't know

554
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
If anything

555
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,224
If any funds are involved

556
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,016
I would say it's more of a

557
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,880
Like they just they just give him some money in his like don't f*** with us

558
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,184
Get on out of the Wild

559
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,256
You do whatever you do just leave us out of it for the most

560
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,072
So in this next clip Alex

561
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,096
Is talking about like

562
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
The

563
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,656
Like how everybody wants to arrest

564
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
The Koch brothers

565
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,032
I'll allow you to do that

566
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
Spurs

567
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:33,376
Soviets

568
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,568
A bunch of t-shirts that are really simple

569
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:49,248
I get what you're saying and rest them all set

570
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
For me with Alex's angle on it is

571
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
Endocrinology

572
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:58,720
Arrest all by political enemies

573
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,280
You arrest all of Alex's political enemies

574
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:05,376
The day of arresting people on the right it's not going to come

575
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,032
Exactly

576
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,824
No we should arrest the Koch brothers

577
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,384
Does Iceland just held a funeral for

578
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,688
Glacier that was absolutely murdered by the

579
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,016
It's very it's very confusing

580
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
I don't know what to

581
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
It's isolated

582
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
It is

583
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Is just

584
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,488
On this episode is the only time I've heard this

585
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Kind of talk

586
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,536
And I do

587
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,608
Defensive a little bit but about his world

588
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144
Like I don't

589
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
I don't know what

590
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,704
To draw in

591
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,496
I don't know why

592
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
Now

593
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,592
In 2013 I don't know why it's happening

594
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
Obviously

595
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
Isn't the first time

596
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,688
I bet the accusations

597
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
Goodnight about getting Coke money

598
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,320
Like I don't know what's precipitating this

599
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
I don't know why you feel the need

600
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
Spontoon

601
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
You would have expected him

602
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,120
Going to be going on about this a lot

603
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Yeah

604
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,168
I don't know it's it's

605
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:11,936
It's

606
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,472
A does feel

607
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
Defensive

608
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Straight defense

609
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:20,640
Almost

610
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
Saying that

611
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
Paid by them so much

612
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,040
That he's defensive about them saying that he needs their money

613
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,856
So he doesn't need them while at the same time

614
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,392
He's defensive because he

615
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,184
Maybe or

616
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,976
Knows that he might want

617
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
Orbitz

618
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
In the future buddy

619
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,584
From them and so he is defending them as if

620
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Hip2Save

621
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:45,216
Look I'm not getting paid by them but even if I was there still fighting the good fight

622
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,544
I think about it the last

623
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
Inclined

624
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
I'm to believe that he

625
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,920
Like I don't think that this sort of it

626
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,480
Display is the actress someone who actually

627
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
It doesn't feel that way

628
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,672
It also doesn't really feel like an overture to them too

629
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
To get money

630
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,232
I I just

631
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
Just feel like

632
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,936
Brothers narrative which isn't really a narrative it's just a weird blip

633
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,776
I wonder if it's going to come back I have no idea it's very confusing

634
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,824
Because the next day as it is

635
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,128
Has nothing to do with Koch brothers

636
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,456
Of course

637
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,784
And he only he only supports the Koch brothers with the five

638
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,064
Polluting families

639
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
Get together and

640
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
Get rings

641
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
Bring him into

642
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,160
Perhaps

643
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,512
Next day Alex has an interview with the one

644
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
The only

645
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:45,888
He of course

646
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,704
Is that guy who wrote a book about where to bug out

647
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,776
Location to Alex's selling on his

648
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
Also

649
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
Apparently

650
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,152
Joel skousen

651
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,176
Survive the plane

652
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
And

653
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
That is big

654
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Baby picture

655
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,904
All right tell the story of it and it sounds a lot like

656
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,976
Used

657
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
I think

658
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
It's crazy

659
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
He did survive a plane crash

660
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
Okay

661
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:24,288
Feel like I was right next to me

662
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,872
One of the reasons that I'm pretty sure that this is a real thing

663
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,408
But he did survive the plane crash

664
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
Is it Alex

665
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,736
Is trying to sell subscriptions

666
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
Do his website

667
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,320
By offering to have people watch

668
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,368
Joel skousen

669
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:44,512
The balance of the hour

670
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,664
So I want to challenge

671
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,088
.

672
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
That's pretty strange

673
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:27,008
It's just barely 2,000

674
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,312
Can imagine that instead of playing the clip of the play

675
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
Crashing

676
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:35,200
Brief moment of

677
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
Your levity

678
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
Little rickrolling

679
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
Never going to have

680
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:43,648
No I don't I don't know I don't know I don't know why

681
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
Boxes using it to

682
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,976
Bushes that traffic to the website

683
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,560
I didn't I don't want to watch that

684
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,888
Real and not horrify

685
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,936
Crash

686
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
That does not charm

687
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,288
Okay and he has

688
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Pretty bad

689
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
Here's one of them

690
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:25,376
Everywhere I should point out that this is a written response to a caller

691
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:30,496
Who is that talked about how like Alex had Rosa Corey who hate the deaf

692
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,312
And the caller was saying like I really appreciate that

693
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,872
She's fighting a but she's a lesbian

694
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,992
Tech

695
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:46,112
To the gay agenda

696
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,744
Okay

697
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,816
It is very evil

698
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:11,200
Cannot exercise the right to vote

699
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,784
2

700
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,112
Whatever relationship

701
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,928
Force other people to accept

702
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,376
And it's a fundamental rights if you don't have the right

703
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,912
Disassociate

704
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:37,056
Then you've really lost a major fundamental right why don't you discriminated private

705
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:44,224
What can you allow interracial marriage

706
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
That is a

707
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
Wildly

708
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,344
Crazy thing

709
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:56,256
Crashed and burned if there's video of it on the website never got off the ground if you know it

710
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,352
Leash

711
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
We're losing right

712
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,424
Scrimmage

713
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
Cool

714
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,032
That was the problem with those whole civil rights

715
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
I feel like

716
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104
You still have every right

717
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,128
Discriminate

718
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Do you want

719
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,432
But State structures made

720
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:19,552
Have the right to discriminate arbitrarily

721
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:25,440
Then you could discriminate in your private life

722
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:31,328
Well you're at the job so no

723
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,352
Well you're right

724
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,656
Every right to be naked in private

725
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704
But you don't have that right at the office

726
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,776
Argument is making

727
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
So what I'm going to

728
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,224
How do you spell discriminate naked at the office

729
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,248
Cool

730
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,064
So it is next clip Joel skousen

731
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,416
Pretty concerned with demographics

732
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,256
2013

733
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
Probably before

734
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,328
Disease

735
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,632
These folks started yelling about it

736
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
Publix

737
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:13,824
Losing the battle of

738
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,224
More socialist economies are out producing us the American

739
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,040
Good

740
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:27,648
And we should be

741
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,488
We got to start Moore home schooling or using private schools

742
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,632
To generation that can

743
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
For Latinos.

744
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
Other minority groups right now

745
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:03,232
The argument against

746
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,792
Equal protection

747
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,608
Across-the-board

748
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,960
Is somehow being bolstered by the idea of we won't have that Minority

749
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,520
Gross

750
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,616
For the last week

751
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
We had a conversation

752
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
He literally

753
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
There

754
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
The same way that

755
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,320
Reverse though

756
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,904
He said they're going to treat us as bad as we traded

757
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,280
That's a translation of essentially what he described

758
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
The fear is

759
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,096
Is a f*****-up way to live your life

760
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,175
Episode

761
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
Enchilada

762
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,807
And I have a feeling

763
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,343
That we are getting close

764
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
Do Alex

765
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,647
Going for

766
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,695
The Sandy Hook crisis actor

767
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:10,559
Here on this 25th March 25th episode

768
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
Sandy Hook

769
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,607
I need does say that it's

770
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
Definitely stage

771
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
But

772
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,471
It's a little muddy what is point is

773
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,407
The reason that message is Muddy

774
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,711
Is that you think is all stage

775
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,015
But at the same time he's calling the murderer

776
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,343
It does seem like he's saying they killed they actually kill

777
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,695
It does seem that way with the muddiness of a message

778
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
Images

779
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
The audience

780
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,535
How are they going to

781
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,095
To hear that

782
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
And if I'm

783
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,167
Critically looking at these episodes

784
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,191
Is it going through them

785
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,495
And I'm not exactly sure what point

786
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
You trying to make

787
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,567
You've got to assume the people who are in

788
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
Is there any updated with the

789
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,663
Conspiracy culture that's going on at this time

790
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,711
They've got to be even more unsure

791
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,015
Like if you want to believe that their actors

792
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:38,623
Then you can hear that clip

793
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,671
And that reinforces your belief

794
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:47,071
If you believe that the globalist did it and kill people brain says they're all murderers that can you can hear it that

795
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:50,655
That way if you believe it they're all actors when he says they're all murderers

796
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
You can just make that's it

797
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,495
Additionally these are murderers

798
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
It doesn't necessarily

799
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,615
It fits whichever version of The Conspiracy you want it

800
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:03,967
I'm sure caught me off guard

801
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,271
I don't think they are unsure about what

802
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,295
He said

803
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:13,951
I think whatever he's saying right now

804
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:19,583
They don't need to think about like

805
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,655
What they wanted to hear there's a lot of utility

806
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,703
Audience

807
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
Consciously

808
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,175
Unconsciously he's behaving in such a way it's

809
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
Astronaut alien

810
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,503
People who believe

811
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,319
Tennessee

812
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
Good strategy

813
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,159
Seems like a good strategy

814
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,975
So we're done with the 25th and we jump to the 20s

815
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,023
I feel like when I when I listen to

816
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,071
25th and I heard all that Koch brothers stuff

817
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:51,839
I was like

818
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
Weird

819
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,167
What is going on with this

820
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,727
I was hoping that the 26

821
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,751
Give me some sort of a

822
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,287
A clue about that

823
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,311
But unfortunately

824
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,847
Vicky hit the eject button

825
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,575
It takes over pretty much the entire show

826
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,599
226

827
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,903
And again it's another thing I could never have predicted

828
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,535
Something

829
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,567
Watch Dogs

830
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,639
Individual

831
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
Jim Carrey

832
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Why

833
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
And

834
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,439
Define Deadman

835
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
Off-air 1

836
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,143
And I've never told that story

837
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,679
Because that's

838
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
Was private

839
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:09,151
Over the temperature this morning

840
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
Under the jeans

841
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,295
Upset

842
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,599
Because he was very close friends with

843
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,623
Charlton Heston

844
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,191
Authoritarian

845
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,031
Patriots Graves

846
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
Disgusting

847
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:42,431
I would say that thing that Charlton Heston was good friend

848
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,455
Enzo Ted Nugent

849
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Defaming a dead

850
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
That's speaking of a Deadman

851
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,295
If you see

852
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
Patriots

853
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,391
Dancing on a Thor attarian grave

854
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,743
Apocracy isn't irrelevant complaint

855
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,303
To make about Alex Jones as we just got the hundred times

856
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,327
Like there's no use

857
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
Like

858
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,263
You try to demonstrate how little anything

859
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,591
I mean but Alex says by pointing out at one thing someone else is doing

860
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,639
Complains about it

861
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,943
The worst thing in the world

862
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,967
Exactly the same thing

863
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
But he does all the time

864
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,039
Matter

865
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,135
I don't expect this to me

866
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:29,791
But I should tell you that

867
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
Enemies

868
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,119
Namely David Rockefeller is a big Newport

869
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,191
The only thing I think that is all in

870
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
At all about this

871
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
Is that Alex

872
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,311
Did the day those men

873
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
Guide

874
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,639
This episode we listening to us from March 20th

875
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,919
2013

876
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,247
It seems relevant the Charlton Heston died on April 5th

877
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
2008

878
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,063
Almost 5 years prior

879
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,855
Still

880
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:55,903
Sure

881
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
Ted Nugent

882
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
Trying

883
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,791
Sure

884
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,607
Bright

885
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:07,423
Also funny point in 2015

886
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,007
When I Jim Carrey was going against vaccines Alex is all about

887
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:20,735
What is Alex is a song on Spotify or

888
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,015
Call cold dead hands

889
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,599
The video is basically just making fun of people who are obsessed with guns

890
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,159
Messenger pretty good example

891
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
Mystery

892
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,023
Austin impression so

893
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:37,631
It's not really making fun of his death which again happened 5 years prior

894
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,423
It's really more making fun of the

895
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,959
Expression you can take my gun for

896
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,983
From my cold dead hands

897
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,287
Which is itself a reference to Hesston

898
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,335
2000 NRA convention

899
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:51,199
Are making fun of it by saying it has been couldn't get into heaven cuz the Angels couldn't get the gun out of

900
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:51,967
Cold dead hands

901
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:58,623
Alright Carey made a video that got them all butthurt about their guns so they just have to pick the cheapest

902
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,647
Lamest

903
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:00,927
Luzeri

904
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,719
Angle on it which is that

905
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,255
Your defaming a dead

906
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Sekiro exact

907
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
I am like if I'm being honest

908
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,447
If the video with Jim Carrey

909
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,519
Dad and suck that guy probably at least

910
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
Bizarre decision

911
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Strategy

912
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Standpoint

913
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,967
Possibly clunky attempted social commentary and parody

914
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:28,575
Whether or not it's effective or made its point is a question I'm going to leave alone but

915
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,599
Here is Alex

916
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Some Ted Nugent

917
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,415
Be the most sensitive gone weirdos

918
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,439
On the f******

919
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
Also Jim Carrey's backing band

920
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,071
Parody video

921
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
You know it was

922
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,911
Mighty Mighty Bosstones the Eagles

923
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,239
No I don't want

924
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,823
I don't want I don't want

925
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
Very personal

926
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
Better

927
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
Parody video

928
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,671
Making a few funny faces

929
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:11,071
And so what does it say about control

930
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:31,295
Sonic made super Bale

931
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,855
Years old

932
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,415
He's on the brink of

933
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,951
Can I

934
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,791
That cuz I was listening to that very clearly in the hog

935
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
Repair

936
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:28,895
English classes I really paying off your critical as you can stare

937
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,967
Yeah

938
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,807
How applicable data analysis

939
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,599
Madame Bovary

940
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,023
Dialysis

941
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,607
Approached

942
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,655
Parody it's it's a satire

943
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:56,031
And if you admit like I don't like people poking fun at

944
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,847
You look super weeks

945
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,415
So Alex says

946
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,439
Almost

947
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,463
Entire show

948
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,743
Complaining about Jim Carrey

949
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,535
Parody video

950
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:18,815
It is

951
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,351
How old

952
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,631
Him up so much

953
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
Restarts

954
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,191
Reciting the lyrics to that song

955
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,751
Really yeah

956
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,127
I assume the Johnny Cash.

957
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:44,415
Charlton Heston

958
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,399
Thomas Jefferson talking about the farm

959
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,055
Thomas Jefferson

960
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,335
Quote about farmers

961
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:38,175
Alex's referring to who I believe I recall it correctly

962
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
Can't

963
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,735
Put it in the ground

964
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:41,759
Watch it

965
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,783
Grow in

966
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,695
Croagunk

967
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:54,047
If we have to go strictly based on past history

968
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,071
It's not a real quote

969
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,863
Alex does not give me budget

970
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,911
To work with your but it does give me a little bit

971
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,703
Cuz earlier this episode

972
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,263
He said that you know

973
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
Charlton Heston

974
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079
2000

975
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,151
The night before and brought him to

976
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:09,919
Tears

977
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,967
So I kind of got

978
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:15,295
From there

979
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,343
Jefferson talking about

980
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
It makes sense attitude Beacon

981
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,047
In the speech has been says

982
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,119
That the warning smoke is always quotes

983
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,655
Smelled first by the farmers

984
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,447
Who come from their simple home

985
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,983
Define the fire and fight

986
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,103
None of the language

987
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,151
Seems completely inaccurate

988
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,455
The sentiment doesn't totally conflicted all recorded

989
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,479
Scholarship Jefferson

990
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
This is not a time to step

991
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:51,391
Iverson quote

992
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,159
A full sentence

993
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:59,327
Quote the era at the smoke in the air of our conquered bridges in Pearl Harbor's is always smelled first by the farmers

994
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,983
Who come from their simple home to find the fire in fight

995
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:10,335
Mystic figs in that

996
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,151
Good 150 before Pearl Harbor was attacked

997
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:17,503
Grave of Thomas Jefferson

998
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:23,903
Clearly the speech that Alex was talking about

999
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,695
Thomas Jefferson about the farmers

1000
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
That's the that's the way he's rough

1001
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,999
Farmers in that's

1002
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,047
Thomas Jefferson

1003
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:36,703
Around Monticello which houses all the collect

1004
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,471
Did writing the time

1005
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,239
Thomas Jefferson

1006
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,031
See what I can find dark about his feeling

1007
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:40,799
Songs about farming

1008
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,711
But that's not the whole story

1009
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,295
Hidden November 3rd 1807 entries of John Quincy

1010
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
The Adams diary

1011
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,135
He tells the story of going to a dinner party

1012
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:55,903
Attendance

1013
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,231
Quote there was a usual dissertation upon wine

1014
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,511
Not very edifying

1015
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,047
Mr. Jefferson said the

1016
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:06,143
The dude I had always been extremely but do nothing about it

1017
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,703
This seems to be a really good description

1018
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,727
Jefferson's relationship

1019
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,495
Farming

1020
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:14,591
He was into it but he knew nothing about it and he wasn't going to bother to learn

1021
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,383
He wrote a letter to William Brandt

1022
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,431
Giles on April 27th 7

1023
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:23,039
T95 say quote if you visit me as a farmer it must be as a conda cycle

1024
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319
Brian Buttle learner

1025
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:28,415
Ediger won Indy but yet desperate being too old to learn a new craft

1026
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:33,023
I'm not referencing this quoted all the s*** on Jefferson honestly I kind of relate to it

1027
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,303
I'm becoming much more in

1028
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
Didn't plant

1029
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,351
An apartment

1030
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,119
These days

1031
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,679
But I do feel too old to learn much about the art

1032
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:42,751
Much like Jefferson I'm eager to learn by doing

1033
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
Also it's interesting

1034
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,591
Reviews on farming

1035
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,663
Beliefs of the Alex might describe as

1036
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Communist

1037
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,015
In a letter to John Dougherty from June 27th 80

1038
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,295
Teen Titan he said quote

1039
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:58,111
I think it's the duty of farmers who are wealthier than others

1040
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:02,207
To give those less so the benefit of any improvements introduced

1041
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
Brought it

1042
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,535
I assume Alex just ignores that one choosing

1043
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,583
Instead of constantly repeat fake Jefferson

1044
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,631
I'm close to service dumb Gunn weirdo agenda

1045
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,679
I'm pretty sure

1046
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,727
Thomas Jefferson

1047
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,567
Would have been super into intellectual

1048
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,895
But maybe you didn't rise

1049
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:28,575
Incompatible super-rich bomber you have an obligation

1050
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,623
Tim to help out the less fortunate farmers

1051
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,999
You know if you

1052
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,303
Builta if you created a new irrigation

1053
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,607
Then you should share it with

1054
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,399
Probably

1055
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,423
Probably

1056
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:48,031
It's unclear exactly

1057
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,663
It also

1058
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,687
The trend in

1059
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,967
His comments about Farm

1060
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,783
10 towards like you should just run

1061
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,551
Small farm

1062
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,647
It doesn't seem like he's super into the idea of like

1063
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,415
Massive

1064
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,439
Agricultural

1065
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,719
Conglomerate

1066
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,511
Which Alex

1067
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,583
So Ted Nugent

1068
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
Comes on

1069
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,887
Alex

1070
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,655
Pentad

1071
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,935
Physically

1072
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,727
This is very well

1073
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,031
We understand that Alex believes in

1074
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
Erase memory

1075
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,407
They talked a bit about that

1076
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,991
I know we talked about it in the past but I think it's worthwhile to hear this

1077
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
Rambling

1078
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,551
Explanation of it

1079
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,319
Because I

1080
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,391
I think there's something you really got to think about

1081
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,927
Based on his under

1082
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
Alex

1083
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:47,167
You can feel it

1084
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:51,519
Split

1085
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,783
And in the NFL

1086
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,207
What does genetics mean

1087
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:16,607
Uterus

1088
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:26,335
Worried about you

1089
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,039
Is it related to George Washington

1090
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,319
Thomas Jefferson

1091
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:48,095
You are reaching thousands of people

1092
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:56,287
Not just spiritual or psychic connection is a physical Transmissions

1093
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
Okay

1094
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,807
If Alex believes he's literally connected to his

1095
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,463
Show me absolutely be in favor of reparation

1096
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:19,071
Shouldn't he be totally apathetic toward people whose grandparents

1097
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:22,655
The great-grandparents were enslaved seeing as they're literally their ancestors

1098
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:27,775
Like isn't this a hole in his entire worldview

1099
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,895
Right

1100
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:42,111
Separate entities exactly the same as the founding fathers

1101
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,903
Take a closer look at this

1102
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,183
You also see

1103
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,231
The except the super revealing about his

1104
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,767
White identity belief

1105
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:54,143
This idea that you are your ancestors is literally never applied to a non-white purse

1106
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
When is

1107
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:55,935
The way

1108
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:58,751
He applies it to all of this

1109
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:03,615
Forget it only has to do with his connection to Jefferson or whatever

1110
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,407
Who were the founding

1111
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:08,991
Founding fathers

1112
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,039
If you apply this

1113
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,575
Universally

1114
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,135
It forces you into a very

1115
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,415
Empathy

1116
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,439
Field position

1117
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:21,791
And because he doesn't it it makes me believe that he doesn't apply at Universal

1118
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:25,375
It's just some self-aggrandizing bulshit that he uses

1119
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,911
252

1120
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,703
To give some sort of a

1121
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:32,031
Otherworldly credibility

1122
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,055
It's b*******

1123
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,103
It's almost paradoxically

1124
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
Solipsistic

1125
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:36,895
In the

1126
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,711
It makes him the center of the universe

1127
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:44,319
He's also millions of people

1128
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Arrow

1129
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,647
It's very fascinating

1130
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,927
What kind of lunatic

1131
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,231
Yeah I mean it is just

1132
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:54,303
Expression of that white shift and that also has narcissist

1133
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,863
Its its interests

1134
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,399
T22

1135
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,935
To think about that

1136
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,471
Think about how

1137
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,519
Minimizing he is

1138
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,799
About the history of

1139
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,567
Horrible

1140
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Horrible

1141
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,615
This country

1142
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,663
To non-white

1143
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,455
Let's say

1144
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,503
How

1145
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,063
If you believe the things

1146
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:16,831
He believes

1147
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,879
All of those things happened

1148
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,671
Do the people who are alive today

1149
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:25,023
He can't make the argument there like slavery was hundreds of years ago

1150
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,071
It all is happening now

1151
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:32,447
Well Trail of Tears is happening now

1152
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,495
Bet he does

1153
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,543
He did

1154
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:42,943
Eagles picks

1155
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:48,063
It's frustrating

1156
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,879
What's even more amazing is

1157
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,927
He's basically going outside

1158
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,047
Because every woman is born with all the eggs

1159
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,071
Ever have

1160
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,167
There is an unending chain from every woman back

1161
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,191
And back and

1162
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,727
Forever Until

1163
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:10,591
Mitochondrial DNA

1164
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:17,247
He's somehow throwing the men in there as being like we're also the ones that have

1165
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,039
No dude

1166
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:25,439
Ramble a bit about how like

1167
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,703
Sure

1168
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:39,007
Yep they did it is amazing

1169
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,567
Verifying into misogyny

1170
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,335
It's

1171
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,615
It's it's weird

1172
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,407
It's weird I would like

1173
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:52,831
They're very few questions I'd like to ask

1174
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,879
Things I would really actually like to ask

1175
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,695
About race memory stuff

1176
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:04,351
Does is it a superpower that only white people have is the first question

1177
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
Yes

1178
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,143
Then he believes in White Oak

1179
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,959
If he answers know it opens up

1180
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:14,079
So many other questions about you care about the ancestral

1181
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,639
Memory and experience of people

1182
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,175
I better run like you

1183
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
Right

1184
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,783
I swear to you I don't know why but my

1185
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,855
Based on all the amount of time we've spent listening

1186
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,159
Is that his answer that question would be

1187
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,439
White people

1188
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:33,535
Like somehow he throw in a probably

1189
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,351
Yeah

1190
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,215
Great because he agrees to

1191
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
Come on Alex

1192
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
Stars

1193
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,567
Out there

1194
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:50,175
But they can't come on

1195
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,455
Like Christopher Walken

1196
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:57,599
Unless he's forced at gunpoint by the Bells

1197
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:07,583
I talked to Major Rockstar

1198
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,703
New world record

1199
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,983
I talked to

1200
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,263
Other

1201
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:23,199
I can't come on your show

1202
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,551
They're giving me too much heat just for going to Beer website or talking about you

1203
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,975
So I want to go play the major venues

1204
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,983
Major Rockstar

1205
01:05:55,455 --> 01:06:01,343
Financing

1206
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,999
Steven Spielberg

1207
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,839
Couldn't even name

1208
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:21,311
So if I had to guess these major Stars Alex is talking about

1209
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:26,687
Like they were trying to politely decline his invitation

1210
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,295
Going over his work

1211
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,831
It's at either Supercenter

1212
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,599
Dude

1213
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:36,927
If you're a big star and you tell Alex you don't want to go on a show because

1214
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,695
Toxic in

1215
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:42,815
Crazy the next thing you know Alex finds a white paper saying you're a globalist bent on depopulation

1216
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:46,655
He's a paranoid a******* so the absolute best way to get out of a

1217
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:52,543
Precision with him is to tell him that the

1218
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,079
Not to lose my career

1219
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:57,663
Or possibly I can imagine a situation where someone in a boat

1220
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,687
Candor told Alex

1221
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,503
Come on his show cuz it'd be bad for their career

1222
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,551
And now it's right into that the globalist

1223
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,343
Oregon

1224
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,647
The very real possibility that Alex's

1225
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,207
It's entirely

1226
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,023
Rockstar

1227
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:17,375
And the s*** though

1228
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:23,775
I think a lot of the crazy one

1229
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,055
Shelter

1230
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,639
A number of them have gone on

1231
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,687
Even some crazy ones record

1232
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,991
Big knives what's good and bad for the brain

1233
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:37,087
Going on Alex's show at buddy

1234
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
A career boost

1235
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,183
Is it toxic

1236
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,207
Connected to

1237
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,743
The Eurythmics where Olga

1238
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,279
Going to go on the show I drew

1239
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:48,351
It doesn't matter their big stars in the 80s

1240
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,423
The two examples that Alex uses

1241
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,703
Evil globalist

1242
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,007
Hollywood most prominent Jewish

1243
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,335
Jerry Bruckheimer is born in 90

1244
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,359
43

1245
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,895
His parents were Jewish immigrants were

1246
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,943
From Germany so you can draw whatever conclusions

1247
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,711
That you like

1248
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
He wasn't.

1249
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,015
Collaborated

1250
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,295
Conclusion I can draw

1251
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,343
Steven Spielberg was raised orthodox

1252
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
Easy directed was Schindler

1253
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,975
Gloves

1254
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:18,559
I understand that these are Big Hollywood guys but

1255
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,839
Hard not to hear this

1256
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,375
Is a sign of something that dwells

1257
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,167
Like at 12 down in Alex's

1258
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,215
There other names

1259
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:25,983
Secret pic

1260
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:30,079
Their other big-name non-jewish people in Hollywood with far more left-wing politics

1261
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,871
Ben Spielberg and brachii

1262
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,943
I don't know but I don't think that this mess early concert

1263
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,479
Does anything really damn good

1264
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,087
Has to pull out names of the

1265
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:45,183
The ones who are working with the NWO but globalist

1266
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:45,951
Hollywood

1267
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,719
The two biggest

1268
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,767
Jewish man in Hollywood

1269
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,327
Endive name of a

1270
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,119
Somebody who is willing to

1271
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,143
Fight back

1272
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:59,007
I was also told otherwise Tom Selleck

1273
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
Himself

1274
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,799
Tom Selleck

1275
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,199
Not the Indiana Jones movies

1276
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:11,039
The moron complaining about China

1277
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:14,367
And how Thor attarian they are at

1278
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,391
They are witch

1279
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,207
At least he's got consistency

1280
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:20,511
He's complaining about them in 2013

1281
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,791
Still complaining about it

1282
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:23,071
I'm glad history driving

1283
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,863
I'm so Alex

1284
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,167
A little bit

1285
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,703
Extreme and I

1286
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,007
You'll see you'll see what goes on here

1287
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,839
Infowarsstore.com

1288
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:04,287
The Western journalists, I got some footage of someone getting their dick cut off and just left in the street at the other globalist

1289
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:11,967
I mean

1290
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,039
That's a pretty evolve

1291
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:15,807
Developed

1292
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:19,135
Alex Jones at Disneyland

1293
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,671
There's not there's not yelling

1294
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,207
But it does have the

1295
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,743
That we come to

1296
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,511
The Impreza

1297
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:29,631
Emotionally evocative imagery and negative

1298
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,911
Horrible thing

1299
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,703
Smoothly pivot

1300
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,519
We got water filters on sale

1301
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,799
Plasticized into

1302
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,527
So Ted Nugent comes in

1303
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,319
Complain

1304
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,111
Jim Carrey

1305
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:53,951
So the first hour of the show is mostly Alex talking about Jim Carrey

1306
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,999
An a******

1307
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:59,839
Yeah the second hour of the show is Alex and Ted Nugent

1308
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,607
Sing about

1309
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,727
2 hours of old white men

1310
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:06,751
Yep

1311
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:10,079
Wolf so also Ted Nugent wants you to know

1312
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,871
Is there a lot of people who talk s*** about it

1313
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,151
Fat people disagree

1314
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:18,271
What about the people who think that they're all sucked up

1315
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,455
You

1316
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:05,119
How long

1317
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:10,751
Run amok

1318
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,031
This is a great

1319
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,335
To hear on a Libertarian program

1320
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,639
Antitrust

1321
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:19,199
All the critics are on drugs

1322
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:24,575
Newton has going for it is like

1323
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:28,927
An honest salable positive I guess I've never done drugs

1324
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,487
F*** off

1325
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:35,839
Whatever age

1326
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:42,239
I'm 64 years clean and sober doesn't drink don't do drugs

1327
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,823
So

1328
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,223
Can trade guy in his writing songs about children

1329
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:01,695
Completely sober when I wrote predator

1330
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,511
Oh man

1331
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:11,679
Drugs right cuz When You're Sober you write songs like Tango

1332
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,287
I don't know

1333
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,591
I think

1334
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,639
I don't I don't think it's a virtue

1335
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,175
To not have drank or done drugs

1336
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,199
But he does

1337
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,759
Uses that as a way to

1338
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,783
Attack

1339
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,551
KissAnime

1340
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,879
I can't because I am smoking dope

1341
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:35,743
You have smoking dope

1342
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:36,767
Invalid

1343
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,327
I have also smoke and a lot of dope

1344
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,191
The fact that I have

1345
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,751
Not morally

1346
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:53,663
He's applying morality or at least like if you have used drugs you're not a credible person

1347
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:56,479
But I don't think lines up with libertarian

1348
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:01,855
Weird version of libertarianism worth

1349
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:08,511
I think your invalid in your argument if you do drugs to be able to I guess that

1350
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,815
Is possible but that's f***** up

1351
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,863
That's just too much work

1352
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,911
Seems weird just too much work

1353
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,679
To believe all that

1354
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,471
Book convention

1355
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:23,103
Still criticize Ted Nugent even though

1356
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,911
Join the NRA

1357
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,687
That's so gross

1358
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:02,271
Get the call later in the show from someone who is like made me sick

1359
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:05,599
Soldier getting an RPG

1360
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,391
To the gut

1361
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,415
That was disgusting

1362
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:15,327
Alex's take on it is to respond like how the globalist use the

1363
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,375
Terrorist noted above above

1364
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,911
It was responding

1365
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:19,935
Into the wrong

1366
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,215
Complaint right

1367
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:22,495
No real

1368
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,287
Criticism or

1369
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,823
Pushback from the

1370
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,639
The Muslim Allah puke s***

1371
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
Which is the

1372
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,431
Disgusting

1373
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,527
Michelle and

1374
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,343
From Ted Nugent I didn't even catch

1375
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,135
At first I didn't

1376
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:48,863
Chicken Alla game

1377
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,191
And then

1378
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,215
Of course

1379
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,287
Really in

1380
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567
Enjoy listening

1381
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
Station

1382
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,175
That is

1383
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:02,943
Purelander

1384
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,967
Utterly

1385
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,783
With such

1386
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,807
Moral Authority

1387
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
Sure

1388
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,647
He says and does

1389
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,927
Is

1390
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,719
Nonsense s*** talk

1391
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,511
Won't

1392
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,559
Any meaning

1393
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,911
Here in that clip even that it's all in service

1394
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:28,799
Sign up for the NRA promoting multiple times during this interview

1395
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,871
You can do it

1396
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,663
Description to the NRA

1397
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:36,991
You got people in your life buy them subscription Cydia

1398
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,319
It's f***** up

1399
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,367
It's a large portion of what they're trying to

1400
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,391
To use this

1401
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,183
Charlton Heston

1402
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,719
Desecration app

1403
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,767
As a way to get people's hands

1404
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,303
That's what

1405
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:55,423
So Ted Nugent interview cuz it's largely

1406
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:56,447
Bulshit

1407
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:01,055
It's really funny once it's over Alex gets really mad at his audience

1408
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,591
He calls them pathetic

1409
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:08,991
This is a weird way to turn your audience clinically

1410
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:09,759
Maybe a little bit

1411
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,087
Because you're

1412
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,879
Nnn

1413
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,439
Pathetic

1414
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,303
Absolutely

1415
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,399
Completely

1416
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,447
It's so many levels

1417
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,919
Earwolf

1418
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:44,063
Coyotes

1419
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,695
Responsibility

1420
01:17:55,583 --> 01:18:00,703
Other speaker

1421
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:07,359
You don't know

1422
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:18,111
I just don't understand

1423
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,583
There is an amazing irony that Alex's

1424
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:33,983
Was yelling about people caring about people laughing at them after spending two hours

1425
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:38,847
Complaining about a f****** parody video on Funny or Die

1426
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:44,735
That is the most projecting that you can

1427
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,015
Can possibly do

1428
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:54,975
Turn off your shoulder

1429
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:03,679
He quotes Thomas Jefferson about farmers

1430
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
Yeah

1431
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:07,775
Yeah that's ridiculous

1432
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
Crazy

1433
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,871
Call

1434
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,919
And I think I know what that

1435
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,223
You will know what that mean

1436
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:16,991
Into the middle

1437
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:19,039
This clip

1438
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,855
1 Warren

1439
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,879
The other thing

1440
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,903
I mean

1441
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,439
Time for callers

1442
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,791
One last thing

1443
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,375
Armored vehicles

1444
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,679
Seriously

1445
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,959
Their windows

1446
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,519
Everybody has paintball guns

1447
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,799
And wrist Rockets

1448
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:44,895
Turtle you tipped over

1449
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,367
Look at them and look for their weaknesses and

1450
01:19:54,879 --> 01:20:01,023
You know you don't have a lot of weight with small-arms fire but their windows

1451
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:04,095
You know I can't see that can thrive

1452
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,399
And paintball guns are inexpensive

1453
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,215
So Alice beatbox

1454
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:13,824
Eating lunch

1455
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,968
Does not care alright call paintball guns

1456
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:20,736
Stop.

1457
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,064
Which is good

1458
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,856
He doesn't really mind

1459
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,928
Is taller advocating fighting

1460
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,256
So what you're saying is

1461
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,048
Defeat text why we defeating text

1462
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,840
Anyways I'll take my answer off

1463
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,376
I mean I would assume

1464
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,192
If you're at the point where you're shooting at tent

1465
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
The problem

1466
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:45,056
Are you back at you

1467
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:47,360
Maybe not a live round

1468
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:52,736
Probably

1469
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:57,344
Generally speaking to if you're in a situation where you're shooting on a tank

1470
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,368
It's just that

1471
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,672
There's no one else with the time

1472
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,400
First of all this college town

1473
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:18,848
Yeah I think I've started calling me when he's hungry

1474
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,128
Only does bunnies like

1475
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,152
I got it

1476
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:26,528
I'm so hungry I need some time off to college

1477
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,064
I want to

1478
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,088
I wish you would just

1479
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,136
Farmer Audible

1480
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,416
I want

1481
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:34,720
Eat chips on Mike Wiley State Park

1482
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,792
I want I want it so bad I want to hear at

1483
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:42,656
Satisfying like the life very fragile

1484
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:46,496
Alex

1485
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,264
Fight

1486
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,848
Alex has a new plan of how you doing

1487
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,616
Fight back again

1488
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,152
Explains it in the

1489
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,528
Strategy

1490
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:06,976
Particular operation

1491
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:14,912
And then put them in the magazine

1492
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:20,544
Bumper stickers up around the country

1493
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,200
Earnest

1494
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:27,968
So like

1495
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,528
This million bumper sticker operation

1496
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,320
32nd

1497
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,600
Can clip is Sotelo

1498
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,880
His two things are

1499
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,904
Very clear at

1500
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,976
One of them is at Alex's only strategy

1501
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
Insurance

1502
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,024
In terms of a battle

1503
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:44,352
These two seem to also have a heavy overlap with promotion

1504
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,168
Spell possibility

1505
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:49,984
The million bumper stickers going out there

1506
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:53,568
Is a amazing way for him to get the audience

1507
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:56,384
It's to do his advertising for

1508
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,736
So there's that Universal in terms of almost every

1509
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,808
Call to action that he throws up

1510
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:09,952
Are videos everywhere posted to your social media

1511
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,744
You just got to wake people up and then everything

1512
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,304
It's remarkable that every

1513
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,072
Single things

1514
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,096
To have

1515
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,632
Alex's bottom line

1516
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,168
Firmly in place

1517
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,520
Like that's why when the Google whistleblower came on in 2019

1518
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:27,360
Lake to your media on that we're going to show the Infowars article for it

1519
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:31,456
It's the information isn't as important as the conduit that Alex

1520
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:34,528
Super Motocross sticker operation

1521
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,808
Is first and foremost

1522
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,576
Advertise

1523
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:37,856
That is

1524
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
Keys under

1525
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:44,512
The second thing is he's like I'm doing this if it's going to cost me a bunch of money to put these

1526
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,816
In the

1527
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,656
Well actually I'm going to have to charge a little more cuz of the bumper sticker

1528
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:59,872
More in order for me to sacrifice

1529
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:06,272
This bumper sticker operated just advertising for my website this is how this works

1530
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,392
To make this lemonade

1531
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,184
And I charge you $2

1532
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:16,512
Now this time I'm only going to charge you $1

1533
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,072
I am going to add ice though which is

1534
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:19,840
$3

1535
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:22,656
Think about this

1536
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:26,240
That doesn't even include the amount of advertising

1537
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:30,848
I gets crazy

1538
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,152
Whatever cost

1539
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:33,920
That you would know

1540
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,456
Need to pay

1541
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,248
In order to get a million

1542
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:42,880
In the wild instances of his put up on stop sign

1543
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,160
Over that Ruby

1544
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,696
Prohibit it don't cost so much

1545
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,744
But if you masqueraded as a lie

1546
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,560
We're going to bring the community together with this

1547
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:53,120
Like you're able to get people to do it for free it's very sneaky

1548
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,144
Also

1549
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,168
Think we can learn

1550
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:55,936
And from that clip

1551
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,984
Daddy was a little high

1552
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,544
Now that he's had something to eat

1553
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,336
He is far less

1554
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:07,968
You guys are pathetic you're all week you're all doing for me

1555
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,504
Snickers

1556
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,784
Alright you guys

1557
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,576
The living Snickers commercial

1558
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,856
He really kind of is

1559
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,720
To Alex bring it up Sandy Hook

1560
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:21,536
And we get to see you a little bit more of what his thoughts

1561
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:29,216
Aurora

1562
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:32,800
Operation

1563
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:39,968
That is a control operation out in the oven

1564
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,064
It is just off-the-charts disgusting

1565
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,344
So one

1566
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,880
Illustrated

1567
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,672
Again you're not sure what

1568
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,000
There's provocateur there's staging

1569
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:54,816
Does that mean what specifically are you saying

1570
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,352
If you believe that are actors

1571
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,656
Do you hear exactly what you want from that

1572
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,448
If you believe the globalist

1573
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:03,008
Set up a patsy you hear what you want from that

1574
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:05,312
It's becoming much it's very muddy

1575
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:11,712
I'm not saying he was ever super specific about what he believed except for in that one instance

1576
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,480
From

1577
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,248
Months back

1578
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:19,648
Want to call her was talking about actors

1579
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,184
Absolutely that's

1580
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,720
The time it has been most

1581
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,768
But now there's such

1582
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:25,792
A Martinez

1583
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,840
But it makes me very uncomfortable

1584
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,400
Because I can't really nail down what do you mean

1585
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,960
Provocateur could be in a hole

1586
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:36,544
List of a ton of different

1587
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,104
Fight what I can't

1588
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:40,640
Is that

1589
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,664
It's very

1590
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,968
Did Alex talk about Sandy Hook

1591
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,016
Without the crutch of Aurora

1592
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:49,088
He needs that Solid Ground for him

1593
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,112
Stand-on

1594
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,136
Well he point

1595
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:51,904
To Sandy

1596
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,720
Which isn't good cuz it's arguments about a roar

1597
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,488
Terrible

1598
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,024
But he's established them

1599
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
What is rhetoric

1600
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,584
Two uses that as

1601
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,608
Play kids Waypoint

1602
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,632
To get where you need

1603
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,400
Needs to go

1604
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,424
If we did

1605
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,192
Know that the

1606
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,984
Conclusion eventually is going to be

1607
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:07,008
I'm saying

1608
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,544
It'll be very

1609
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:11,104
Yeah but since we know that it does

1610
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,664
Seem like he's using that as a way to get where he's at

1611
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,480
Inevitably going to go

1612
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,528
I just don't know

1613
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,064
Why that makes sense

1614
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,368
Likewise

1615
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,136
Currently

1616
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,160
He's being somewhat

1617
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,184
Somewhat

1618
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,000
Restrained on Sandy Hook but going

1619
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:30,304
Confidently and Whole Hog

1620
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,840
And say whatever bulshit he want

1621
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,864
About Aurora

1622
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:37,984
I'll get even ate like with

1623
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,800
Describes a certain intention

1624
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,104
And I don't know if

1625
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,128
Is doing it on purpose

1626
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:48,224
To set us up for the big reveal that all of Sandy Hook

1627
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,272
It doesn't

1628
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:52,576
I think it is probably a couple outfits

1629
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,696
What Alex was targeted at call her about how horrible it is

1630
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:01,280
The idea of treating a grieving father that way or thick

1631
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,816
Insinuating that their child

1632
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,584
Didn't die

1633
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,120
Is a monstrous thing

1634
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,912
Be the parent like

1635
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:11,264
What that would feel like a human level

1636
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,032
Understand that

1637
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,312
It doesn't want to drift

1638
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,592
Into this territory

1639
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:15,872
Without some

1640
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,896
I'm sort of a

1641
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:21,760
He recognizes that is a very marketable

1642
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:24,320
Right

1643
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,344
Community

1644
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,368
Because conspiracy

1645
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,696
Community so obviously in terms of

1646
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,232
Raising profit

1647
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:34,048
Be more interesting being on The Cutting Edge of that

1648
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:34,816
Community

1649
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,096
That's a place you want

1650
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,120
Bien

1651
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,424
But knows that entering it is monster

1652
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:45,312
Yeah you can rationalize away the Aurora shooting not being as monstrous

1653
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:47,360
To attack in this way cuz it was

1654
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,384
It was a dull

1655
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,920
It wasn't a

1656
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:50,688
School shoes

1657
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,712
It wasn't

1658
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,248
Children

1659
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,808
Evan the second piece of it

1660
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:59,136
There are a ton of things about the Aurora shoe

1661
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,160
Shooting that are f*****

1662
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,696
In terms of

1663
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,488
Call suspension

1664
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,096
Student

1665
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,912
5 in in ways that you can misinterpret to make sense

1666
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,216
There are a ton of things

1667
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:13,984
Better

1668
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,520
For him

1669
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,800
About that

1670
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,848
Yeah that make it very easy to spend

1671
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:19,872
And it doesn't

1672
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,152
Seem as monstrous

1673
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,176
It's doing that

1674
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,456
About the murder of children

1675
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,480
Right so I think

1676
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:31,648
Because there are so many what about swith the auroras that you know nobody ever going to have an argument and then have an answer for

1677
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,184
For every single thing

1678
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,464
Immediate

1679
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,048
Emotional

1680
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,072
Is much

1681
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:45,216
Do that there

1682
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:47,776
And solidify that as a talking point as

1683
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:50,336
World world

1684
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,360
And then

1685
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,408
He can use that

1686
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,944
To rationalize

1687
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:55,712
Right

1688
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:57,760
Sandy Hooks.

1689
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,296
So you're saying this is all

1690
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Almost ending

1691
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:00,832
Internal

1692
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:01,856
With him

1693
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,648
I would say I don't know I don't know

1694
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,584
You just need a

1695
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,376
A narrative myself

1696
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:15,424
You know how much how much

1697
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,752
Desire this to make sense

1698
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:23,104
I don't know it's entirely possible this is meaningless nonsense and it just happened totally

1699
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,128
It could be

1700
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:25,152
Completely subconscious

1701
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,528
Or any there's a possibility that it is a crass Financial

1702
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,064
Consideration

1703
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:35,392
They might like David realized it's a super

1704
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,160
Popular

1705
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,720
Conspiracies

1706
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,000
Just say it's fake

1707
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:44,608
Then we're going to lose a lot of people who recognize that's monstrous to

1708
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,168
To say

1709
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,448
Consumers

1710
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,496
If we just jump to it

1711
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:52,800
So let's do it

1712
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,080
That alleviates

1713
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,640
Concern

1714
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,664
Possible

1715
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,688
Where could it be

1716
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,456
Lake

1717
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,504
Blindly fumbling around

1718
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:05,088
You couldn't even get out

1719
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:06,368
Makes the most sense about everything

1720
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:10,208
Yeah I don't get to the point Alex's at

1721
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,488
Blindly

1722
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,768
He just going wherever the way

1723
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,096
I don't think you're able to make a million-dollar

1724
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:18,144
Billions of dollar operation

1725
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,424
Like he has just

1726
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,448
Coincidentally

1727
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,240
By being able to scream really well

1728
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,312
That possible there's some attention

1729
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,848
That goes behind the counter

1730
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
He puts out

1731
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:30,176
What exactly that intention

1732
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:30,944
It is

1733
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:31,968
Is very

1734
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,736
Difficult

1735
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,504
To nail down

1736
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:34,784
Yeah

1737
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,576
So we'll see about that

1738
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,368
I don't know

1739
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,392
I think

1740
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:45,280
My feeling on it is very similar to where we were last time that I still feel like there's

1741
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,352
So it is next week we get a call

1742
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,656
And I keep this call and it's

1743
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,936
Entirety which I rarely

1744
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,240
Because I think it's illuminates

1745
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,264
Very

1746
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:56,800
A rare glitch

1747
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,336
Alex's show

1748
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,384
This is a call that Alex gets

1749
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,920
From someone who wrote an article

1750
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,968
That was used as a resource

1751
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:04,992
And Infowars

1752
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:08,576
And this caller believes

1753
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,600
That

1754
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,136
And Infowars misuse

1755
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,696
Information

1756
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:20,864
Is it Annie wrote the original article

1757
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:21,888
Because

1758
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,936
First of all we know he's very sensitive

1759
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,728
Handle courtesy

1760
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:28,288
And also this is very threat

1761
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:34,432
2 minutes longer so

1762
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,248
So this

1763
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:39,040
This is Captain its entirety

1764
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,320
I think we should listen to it be

1765
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,856
Because I think it's an interesting Journey

1766
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:42,880
Through Alex's

1767
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:44,672
Is defensiveness sensitivity

1768
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,952
An inability

1769
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:46,976
To handle

1770
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:47,744
Or

1771
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:49,792
Respond

1772
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,072
The criticism

1773
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,864
When criticism is made

1774
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,888
He must have left

1775
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,168
Internet criticism

1776
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,192
Do something

1777
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,984
Bus create a strawman

1778
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:04,640
In Tennessee you're on the air

1779
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,712
How are you

1780
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:09,760
I'm good

1781
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:17,184
And a pleasure to be here and I wanted to take you out and he's working a lot of people up but I called them because I

1782
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,488
Picwood Infowars on an article

1783
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:24,352
Did I wrote last year that they used his when their Chief references Ethan up

1784
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:27,424
Recorded on the show and

1785
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,664
In memoriam Andrew word if you remember Andrew the chicken man they called him

1786
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:48,160
Well but they did indeed and my point was the banality of evil in this country and and the internal

1787
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:54,048
Enemy is more dangerous than the external

1788
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,848
Answering people around me

1789
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:08,128
It's

1790
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:15,552
The reported you sent turned it into an agenda 21 story when it really wasn't if you listen to his friends and family it was dubbed

1791
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,624
Banality of evil of local bureaucrats doing this

1792
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,512
Empower more scientifically designed

1793
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,816
Play

1794
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,120
Yes I do

1795
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:35,264
Make the correction I never got a response in that was

1796
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,248
I'm a piece of Filth

1797
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,552
So Alex is super defensive in

1798
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,576
Sensitive

1799
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:51,648
Turns it into field blue

1800
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:55,488
A terrible mother

1801
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:56,512
To try and like

1802
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,560
Facetiously deflect

1803
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,328
Criticism

1804
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,864
It's like that's not

1805
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,656
What are the guy is saying

1806
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
Kind of

1807
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,448
A nuance

1808
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:08,800
Point he's trying to make about his reporting that was misused

1809
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,592
He doesn't even substantially seem to

1810
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:11,872
The disagree with Alex

1811
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:18,528
On

1812
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:21,088
Story about a guy who got killed by the

1813
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:21,856
The state

1814
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:24,672
But you just misrepresent

1815
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,488
I reported the story

1816
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,768
Clearly this guy is talk to

1817
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,792
To the family members of

1818
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,816
The guy

1819
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,096
You talked about

1820
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:34,400
Long time ago

1821
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,424
So

1822
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,448
Alex

1823
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,984
To respond to that as if it

1824
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,032
It's some sort of an attack on his character

1825
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:43,616
Are you doing it all sorry I am garbage

1826
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,640
But that's

1827
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:47,456
That's a real vulnerable

1828
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,480
Scared

1829
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,016
Insecure

1830
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:53,344
Sensitive dude

1831
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:57,440
Yeah well there is absolutely the reason

1832
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,720
Where any

1833
01:35:58,976 --> 01:35:59,488
Daytime

1834
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,864
What would you ask Alex Jones Rd

1835
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:06,912
There's no point

1836
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,960
That guy didn't even say it

1837
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:13,824
He didn't even like he didn't even get the chance to make his full point before I was like

1838
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:15,872
F*** you

1839
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,896
I can't do any

1840
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:22,528
Okay fine then goodbye

1841
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,808
Go away

1842
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,856
It's it's you're never going to

1843
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,904
To get any Headway

1844
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,184
He's very sensitive

1845
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,512
Any mild criticism is traded as

1846
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,792
The

1847
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,328
The deadly attack yes

1848
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,704
The two-hour crying bins with Ted

1849
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,728
Nugent

1850
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,080
So Alex is like because you spent two hours

1851
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,872
Charlton Heston

1852
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:50,176
Jim Carrey nonsense right

1853
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:54,528
Covering up the news

1854
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,112
The news

1855
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,392
Go to Overdrive

1856
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:02,720
No no

1857
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,488
Mafucka

1858
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:07,328
The show

1859
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,120
To a guy named Richard Reeves

1860
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:09,888
Okay

1861
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,704
Who is a shill for youngevity

1862
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,752
They just do a

1863
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,776
20 minute

1864
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:19,360
Infomercial about getting on the Infowars

1865
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:22,432
Which is the multi-level marketing scam

1866
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,968
For youngevity products

1867
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,248
It is

1868
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,016
Crazy

1869
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,576
It's just this Richard guy interviewing

1870
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:30,112
A guy who

1871
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,392
Is a distributor

1872
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:36,256
Do the top-level distributaries like you know what's great about this product sells itself

1873
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:42,912
All you got to do is get this cleanse and study

1874
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,936
Compared to this study

1875
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,472
I do know what hey

1876
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:46,752
Real estate

1877
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,288
That's great invest

1878
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,568
But

1879
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:52,384
Wow man it's disgrace

1880
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,664
He's a con man

1881
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,200
The highest

1882
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:04,928
Level one clip of it because

1883
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:07,744
Everyone else

1884
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,024
At this

1885
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:11,840
Why Alex is

1886
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:12,864
Important

1887
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,144
Of the

1888
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,936
Like a people Buck back again

1889
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,216
Me whenever I like

1890
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,752
Alex has a definitive

1891
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:25,408
Being used for evil is a whole different question the course again

1892
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,712
But he has a talent

1893
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:30,016
And all you need to understand that

1894
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:30,784
Is listen to this

1895
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:31,808
35c

1896
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,368
Before we

1897
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:40,000
He's got his own radio show he's had the longest running radio show on

1898
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,280
Home business

1899
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,864
The home business

1900
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,888
Network

1901
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:55,360
Chenault

1902
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:57,408
I got a little bit nervous there but

1903
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,200
Tom had

1904
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:02,016
Long-running show based

1905
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:07,648
And he covers

1906
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,184
It's not good

1907
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,512
Wow that does not Inspire confidence in me to be

1908
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:14,304
Be tricked by your skin

1909
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:17,120
Alex would never fumble like that

1910
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,400
April

1911
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,680
That was

1912
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:26,336
Of a parody of somebody failing like that he repeated it I got it

1913
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:34,272
I've used the stuff I listen to the show all the time

1914
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:40,672
That's the sitcom Alex comes out of nowhere and tackled him

1915
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:47,072
Downwards

1916
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:53,984
He walked in later with a sandwich anyways bye

1917
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:58,080
The cool casual

1918
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:58,848
Collected

1919
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,688
Intensity that Alex has what are you doing

1920
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,504
Tried to convince you that your family needs

1921
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,272
These products

1922
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:10,112
How great it is for you to start your own Cottage business

1923
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:11,392

01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,160

1927
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,000
For you not

1928
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:18,560
Right it's so different than this

1929
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:20,096
If this is bad

1930
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,400
I would never

1931
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,192
Fall for his scam

1932
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,472
But I could see

1933
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,008
Someone falling for Alex

1934
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,800
I could not see someone falling

1935
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:29,824
IPad

1936
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:32,896
I don't know that guy sucks

1937
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:33,920
He's terrible.

1938
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:38,016
The rest of the show

1939
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:41,856

Forgiveness episode

1941
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,304
Rambling about the Koch brothers

1942
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,328
And I got nothing

1943
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:52,864

I want to trust me I want to

1945
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:58,752
He's talking about the Koch brothers

1946
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:01,312
And I can tell you for sure

1947
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:05,408
Alex is on the payroll I want to be able to do that but that would be dishonest

1948
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:06,944
Stupid

1949
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,480
I all all

1950
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:12,320
I can say is he's acting f****** weird and a Looper defending

1951
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,344
The Koch brothers

1952
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,160

You tune into the

1957
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:35,616
Eddie confuses the s*** out of here where I'm at I don't know what he's doing

1958
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:39,968
I want to tell you I know but I don't know what he's doing

1959
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:42,528

01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,320
