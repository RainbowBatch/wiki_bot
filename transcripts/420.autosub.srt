Limited-time-only Foods

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064
Okay we're sort of weird things that I've not tried before

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
Is a risky thing but I always

12
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
Especially in like snack foods or or candies or

13
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
Or something

14
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,584
I will never

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
Not buy them because of that Universe like

16
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,240

00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104

Completely yes

38
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:52,032
Congratulations like this sucks and this sucks in this sucks and you should rewrite the entire book

39
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:57,152
But how about you start a page want to give me another one

40
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,224
Page one rewrite from the very beginning

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,064
Do you have any titles you want to tell the walks

42
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,648
Seems appropriate

43
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,840

Okay I have a bad track

71
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,895
Or you can find a local charity in your area that helps

72
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
People

73
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
We would like either

74
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,855
I'm glad you've learned a difference between

75
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:20,255
Conjunctive versus disjunctive those are important concept

76
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:26,911
Schoolhouse Rock

77
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,007
I am in a difficult position

78
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:36,639
I'm in a bit of a pickle Barrel

79
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
He is no longer allowed

80
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
I am

81
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
Jack from Twitter

82
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,855
According to his at his relationship with

83
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
Our media his app is removed from our store for Shirley and I felt like it would be kind of

84
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,095
Lame if we just deplatformed him for one episode

85
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
So I was like okay we got to do something different

86
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
Again

87
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,495
And f****** K22 Project Camelot episodes

88
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
No good no

89
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
A lot of weirdos the tertiary weirdos that we have like Dave daubenmire or

90
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:16,319
Reverend

91
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,903
Very very boring what is brutal Criminal

92
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
Maybe bow

93
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
And then the other one is a reverend

94
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:29,887
So we have like it was it was a difficult time trying to figure out something else to do to keep Alex

95
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
The platform

96
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
And then

97
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,007
Trump had his coronavirus press conference

98
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,311
Where he said that the power of the president

99
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:43,711
Is Ultimate

100
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
Weird ways you could

101
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,391
You know weasel around it and I'll be interested to hear Alex do exactly that

102
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,791
Do not talk about it he spent most of 2009 yelling about the temperament yelling about the rights of Governors super

103
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:04,191
Proceeding that of the president he tried to get a constitutional convention going

104
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
All of the governor's work for the

105
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,055
Deep State and only Trump is there to protect the

106
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
It's because it's so fundamentally against Alex's professed beliefs about what

107
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
Our government is how we operate

108
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:24,159
I got to untie his response to that

109
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
However

110
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:32,095
On Tuesday which is a recorded episode what a mother

111
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:40,031
Galaxy

112
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:45,919
Around

113
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
So I watched a little bit of incredibly boring so I am not going to do an episode about what

114
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,903
Response

115
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,535
So I I found myself back in that same Pickle Barrel

116
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
And what I did

117
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
Cuz I I I sat with

118
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Some feelings

119
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:12,031
I reached out to our friend Robert Evans over it's a behind the bastards

120
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,967
Now he's got too much influence over this suggestion of Direction

121
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
Bill Cooper

122
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Let's do it

123
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
Unfortunately

124
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:29,951
Tell Cooper that I want to talk about and I think that a lot of audience

125
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
Us to talk about our gigantic

126
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
They would require essentially

127
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,375
The same sort of thing that we did with endgame

128
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
Even more than

129
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,823
Play I want to get into his stuff about the Oklahoma City to Waco

130
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,151
You know these are things that he covered as they were happening

131
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
But they're so

132
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,319
Much got to do like it's so much preparation will be required cuz he does

133
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,719
A lot of episodes and unlike Alex they're all about the same thing and their tents that he talks about

134
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
Yeah

135
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,583
Alex is rambling about nothing

136
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,167
Until I want to do those but I can't do them

137
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Today

138
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Can't do them just

139
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,031
No half-ass

140
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
That's why I'm thinking about maybe

141
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
We shift things around

142
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
And

143
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
For a little bit

144
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:30,111
Only do Bill Cooper and check in on Alex periodically

145
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:36,511
Audience wants us to do that but it's something I'm considering like slipping on Monday and Friday hours on Wednesday

146
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,351
I like it thinking about that only to be like a way to

147
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
Get through

148
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,775
Some of these larger topics that I want to but everytime I'm in the position to do a Bill Cooper episodes like wow that's

149
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
Way too much

150
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:55,199
That we have

151
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
Sandy Hook

152
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
I'm considering

153
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:04,415
So we will see but anyway I wanted to fulfill some some of the audience's desire for some Bill Cooper

154
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:10,559
And so I went 20

155
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:17,215
And so I listen to a lot of stuff trying to find a good episode that was like this is a

156
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,031
It has some content that doesn't

157
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,127
Not something it's going to take us 40 hours to go over

158
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
And it was.

159
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
I didn't really find

160
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Much

161
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
Immediately

162
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
I did notice

163
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
The bill doesn't number of Colin episode

164
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:39,231
Sporty looking just give him a call and talk about whatever that is exactly what I want

165
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
And

166
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
A lot of them are labeled

167
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,375
Calls call

168
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
Some of them

169
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
Are labeled calls

170
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,519
Good so those ones

171
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,103
You would think would be good

172
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
This one

173
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
That I got today

174
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,527
Is an episode from let me get the date on this one November 29th

175
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
2000

176
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,135
Okay A bit late writing bills career just after

177
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
The election of 2000

178
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,143
And this one is labeled calls

179
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,471
Really good

180
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,823
I do really good

181
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
So I decided we're going to go over there

182
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
And I think it will be good because

183
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
Thank you

184
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:39,391
I want one reason for that is that we know for listening to act like so much water the pixie does it take straws

185
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,231
How to eat lunch is very rude

186
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Solicitors

187
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:48,095
What they call in with stupid s*** like don't pop air bubbles cuz they come from China

188
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:56,031
Love it by the sandwiches

189
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,335
Frenchie ating some of the things

190
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,175

00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,575
We'll see your number of those okay opening up

192
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
Floor

Whatever you want to talk about

194
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
I don't care

195
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
Let's talk about it

196
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,839
Call hour tonight 50-33 3457a program

197
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,727
You can just say whatever you want to say something about whatever you want to talk about

198
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
I don't care

199
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,919
Movies coming up

200
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
To do

201
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
With a bunch of

202
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,599
Movie trailers are coming movie trailers and QuickTime

203
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
I fucken love this dude

204
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:49,535
Whatever I don't care about what

205
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,655
What is it what is a good 2000 movies

206
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:00,287
Actually doesn't want he references specifically blue my mind

207
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
This is Bill

208
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,383
The saying like I asked you to do

209
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Because that

210
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:11,551
Is something that I used to say a lot as he is want to do today

211
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
Friend Marty DeRosa

212
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:19,487
Impressions of measly

213
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,815
Bill throwing that out

214
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:27,679
Kindred Spirits if opposite sides of the dispatch

215
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
Yeah it's weird

216
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,543
Very rarely hear anyone use that expression

217
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,639
And in strange

218
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
We're in November 2000

219
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
You're asking yourself

220
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,551
What movies is Bill excited about

221
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:48,671
Put on a CD in little video files media player files

222
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,791
He's got one in particular that he is

223
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
Super excited

224
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Coming up

225
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,799
Avalanche

226
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Trailer

227
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
For the whole movie I mean

228
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
Quite beyond the norm

229
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
I thought it was

230
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:36,031
Kind of movie screen and keep your seat right on the edge of your chair and trailer

231
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,407
Is this Buzz Marketing

232
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,111
Can you name race on bills

233
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,183
No but I do think I saw it

234
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
I remember there being a point where there's a jump

235
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,887
Acrostic

236
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,447
Movie Hughes

237
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
Which was released on December 8th 2000

238
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
A few weeks after this episode was recorded

239
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,967
The trailer I know but I think I worked at the movie theater when it came out because I did see it

240
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
If it wasn't like work-related

241
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,391
I can't imagine shoes

242
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:31,327
Review on Rotten Tomatoes not agree with Bill

243
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
The trailer for the top and piled one on top of the other

244
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,895
This is completely off track but it also is illustrative of a good point

245
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
What's good for a trailer

246
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
Sometimes not good for the movie itself

247
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:55,135
The conspiracy theorist often doesn't understand this difference and it's closer related to how they often fail to understand

248
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,695
How what works well in terms of writing a headline

249
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,279
Men are always work best in terms of telling the whole story

250
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,935
Anyway Billy probably letdown by Vertical Limit but it warms my heart to hear this guy so innocently enthusiastic about this upcoming

251
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:13,311
The movie it is really weird he's not saying that this movie is secretly revealing the plots of his enemies

252
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,383
You just think that actually looks good

253
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,967
That's so surprising just like

254
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,831
Another one of those things that makes me frustrated with Bill Cooper because he's so

255
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
Human god dammit

256
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,415
He's just a child being like

257
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,743
I really want to see the new Terminator movie when it comes out

258
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,047
And not because there's a massive global

259
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:40,447
Beersy because Arnold Schwarzenegger

260
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,239
I see you trailer for like

261
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
Series movies and I'm like

262
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
That looks really fun

263
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,687
He's just saying that looks scary. That would be intense to watch

264
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
That looks great yeah I think it's that it's uncomplicated yet he does not consider that it a trailer is

265
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Full of Ebola

266
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
Wow

267
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:05,535
You know like now that we have Marvel movies where you can see a scene in the trailer that doesn't even happen in the movie

268
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,327
Trailers trailers

269
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
We put all the best parts in there

270
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
It's true

271
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,543
Movie corner and now he takes it to the calls

272
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,103
And I Source call Isaac

273
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,711
Vertical Limit

274
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735

277

This isn't like you want to hurt me

278
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Primer

279
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,919
Okay

280
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,527
Whatever driving book

281
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
Exactly the same

282
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
Always been

283
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
Every single night

284
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:15,167
Please get some fuzziness on the line I love that calls for anybody who wants to talk about anything

285
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:25,151
Calling my man my wife I isn't working that well right now what do you mean what do you think I should do

286
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,455
Actually be a problem of bills uplink

287
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,855
Broadcast

288
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Hicksville Ohio

289
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:44,095
He could have got they could have gone to a song or something like this if there was any production at all but instead we get

290
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,887
Okay

291
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
Disconnect me right now

292
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
Copart

293
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
2

294
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Ominous

295
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
Lego horror movie

296
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
When the phone is off the line you're like oh well obviously they're dead

297
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Hello

298
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
This is the one box

299
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Really good

300
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,223
Technical difficulties

301
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:09,343
I love it

302
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,999
In the same way it is like his movie reviews are like this naively kind of

303
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:22,143
Sincere whatever this is I can't handle this

304
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
Can't figure this out

305
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Who's on air

306
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,799
Tony boys

307
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,919
A little bit resign to like it's not going to

308
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:40,575
No I don't know which whatever he did fix whatever they call this problem

309
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
Was no problem

310
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,415
No idea but it seems like everything's better now

311
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,463
Answer another call

312
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,767
And this guy has an interesting

313
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
Question to ask

314
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,447
Actually think implicates a whole bunch of different things in the conspiracy theory world right

315
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
To alot of things that Alex's

316
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,567
Pitched in the bride

317
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:06,687
Even has some connection to present a narrative

318
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,015
It's largely about the idea that after the 2000 election

319
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,063
Quinton could stay in office

320
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,647
Oakdale Clinton could end up staying in office

321
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,696
Really fun to see how Bill response

322
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Canada

323
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,568
Vanilla yogurt

324
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Mario

325
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:42,528
Is no way in the world

326
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
Beyond the day

327
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
Battery Specialist

328
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
Comeback

329
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,448
I don't think that there could ever possibly happen I don't think anyone would even

330
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:08,128
Alex is suggesting kind of

331
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,016
Trump impeachment to bring Hillary

332
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,416
President Clinton Hillary

333
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,720
Hillary Clinton even things

334
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,304
Along these lines at the end of Obama's term

335
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,656
This is just something that is a consistent preoccupation of the very dumb

336
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:37,056
Parts of the right of course it's just something that they are they're really deeply invest

337
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,128
Sit-in thinking is going to happen

338
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,432
That is never going to happen

339
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Greeley

340
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,296
Cuz if that call came on Alex's show

341
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
He would be like

342
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
To do that

343
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Bill saying no

344
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,656
Shut up is a really fun thing anybody

345
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Dog

346
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,824
I seen the emails in the websites all over the Internet playing

347
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,432
He won't have to leave office when he coming

348
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
You'll be there

349
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:28,768
If you just

350
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Declare himself

351
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,568
And he would have to have the military behind him

352
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:46,432
So you're saying there's a way it could happen that's what I hear cuz I listen to Alex

353
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,224
So what you're saying is this guy

354
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,576
To declare that he has total Authority

355
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,648
NFL military

356
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:59,488
A lot filled with right-wing reactionary type folks

357
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:04,352
They would have to be directly behind the president are you saying that's is that what Bill Cooper is

358
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,192
Majestic I made that Z-Wave things could happen

359
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
Can't happen

360
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,848
In the circumstances surrounding Bill Clinton because

361
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,408
As Bill explains this next clip

362
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
Military does not like

363
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:25,088
Bill Clinton

364
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
War

365
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,864
Chances of the military

366
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,520
It goes beyond

367
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,760
People have a brain

368
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,720
Yeah man I feel you I just want to make sure that everybody knows

369
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,000
But that last caller

370
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,864
Is is got rocks for brains he's Beyond sheeple day as well be alright

371
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,656
Stupid be a rock

372
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,448
Probably calling again

373
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984
It's interesting

374
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,312
Too because I don't know this to be this case

375
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,128
Be two spies of Alex's trafficking

376
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
Some of those theories

377
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,992
Around this time

378
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,600
Websites pudding without

379
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't know really could be really interesting as I was going through some of these episodes

380
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:40,096
Things that like obviously this wouldn't be a whole episode

381
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:47,776
I think the bill hated Alex a lot more than even we recognize couple points

382
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:54,176
Obviously he did an episode about Alex being a liar he didn't episode about is Y2K show

383
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,712
Like things that he did

384
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Yo

385
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
Find

386
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:02,368
I think that he brings him up a bit more then than even we recognized

387
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,440
Here's the clip where he's at right after 9/11

388
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:10,816
Bill is talking about the out everyone's in a panic about anthrax

389
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
And

390
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,936
How everyone should just calm down there's no need to get

391
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,472
Crazy about this

392
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,032
Any opportunity to take a swing at Alex

393
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
Listen to me

394
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
Carefully

395
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
Directions

396
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,576
Performing

397
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Cutting drywall

398
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
Drywall

399
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
All of a sudden somebody

400
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Powder form

401
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
More

402
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,288
Coronavirus

403
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
Alex Jones

404
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
Florida

405
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:09,184
Ghetto Little Bill

406
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
I think if I were to listen to all of his episodes

407
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,144
1600

408
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,520
I think that you'd end up finding a number of Pop shots like that I think that you probably held his tongue

409
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,568
Well I didn't care for a while then

410
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,152
Two of them got into a little bit of a like I'll wait this guy sucks

411
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:34,784
He's lying restaurant started taking taken shots

412
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,856
I bet he takes it a lot more personally than

413
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
We were like

414
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
Of course because Alex

415
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
He's ruining his

416
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,512
Ideas

417
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:50,912
Spy parroting that you know like he's the real s*** and Alex is becoming more popular at

418
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,728
This time yeah more popular him baby

419
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:59,360
I don't know exactly going like

420
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:06,272
Why is that kind of how I feel like why is it that b******* is good so much better than this

421
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,320
Better be getting attention than the truth

422
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
Welco's bills not really giving me

423
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,208
Truth Network

424
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
More right about something

425
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
And I'm completely wrong about other things

426
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,656
I mean from his perspective

427
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,240
Percy used to be a good-faith effort to get to the bottom of things

428
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,544
Yes is being kind of hurt

429
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,104
Actions

430
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,664
If I were bill I would think that Alex

431
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:39,808
He's going to f*** around and ruin everything she gives what he's trying to do a bad name right

432
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
Gives the public pretty face

433
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
A crazy person

434
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
Yelling into a bullhorn

435
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,488
When it snow

436
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,816
I'm actually sitting here reading thing

437
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,400
Conceivably doing the info part of Infowars

438
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,192
If you were sucking it

439
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,264
Yeah it's interesting I think they'll really hate it out

440
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,824
But anyway back to the call-in show

441
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,128
Bill gets another caller

442
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
And this is

443
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,968
Again as you pointed out

444
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
This show was labeled

445
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
Really good

446
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,976
Whatever you want

447
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,832
The airtime that I'm paying for somebody's working out there and I want

448
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,624
Girls talk about coconut

449
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
How to do

450
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,672
I don't

451
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,232
Furniture

452
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
Did you want to talk about that

453
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,120
I can do something about it

454
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:07,616
Broadcast East Ryan is trying to do radio broadcast

455
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,528
You call that one an hour I want all of his fans to call it'll be like

456
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:20,928
We're going to get this sorted out and then at the end the last 5 minutes and like

457
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:25,792
He's calling in to say like hey someone's jamming you and that there's a

458
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,864
Conspiracy fun angle

459
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
I'm not

460
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,960
This is not what this show is for

461
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,800
Probably some other problem even goes on to be like all right fine

462
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,896
Find get like a radio transmitter identification thing

463
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,480
And figure out where the jamming is coming from they reported

464
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,368
Are solar storms going on that's much more likely to be affected your radio that somebody jamming the signal

465
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,928
I bet he would love Carrie

466
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,536
I think that he starts to get a little bit

467
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:03,680
What to do about crazy jitneys getting tech support

468
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:08,032
Well it's unfortunate though because sometimes calls do come in like this next

469
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,104
Guy don't want to talk about something

470
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,664
What pill does not have time for it

471
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,944
Good evening I'm here

472
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
3030

473
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,024
Doctor general

474
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
Are Newark listening to me

475
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,752
Listen to but you sure weren't listening

476
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,128
Are you don't have time or to even

477
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,456
One minute in the amount of time that you're going to be on the telephone

478
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,272
You need to go and

479
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:54,624
Listen to the mystery Babylon series on the internet that's why I put them in 40

480
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
3 hours

481
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,672
42 hours

482
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
God just

483
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:11,008
He's become the human Avatar of letmegooglethatforyou

484
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,336
You got to be disappointed

485
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
If you're him

486
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,432
She's really good so I do too

487
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,504
Disappointment

488
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,880
Padre two-time loser

489
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
But you got like

490
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
In bills defense

491
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,096
He did do it 43 parts.

492
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:42,496
That is true cover but

493
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
No I'm going

494
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,664
Going to do it

495
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,736
Either as a human or ghost we will

496
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:58,112
Coverall of bills mystery Babylon popular in hell

497
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
Yeah

498
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,512
Yeah yeah yeah

499
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,816
So at this point

500
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,888
The phone lines go little cold

501
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:15,264
Afraid

502
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
Builder

503
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,872
Sabila declaration

504
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,688
303 3345

505
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Rubbermaid

506
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
The number

507
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,344
Guerneville City

508
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
Pause

509
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:44,192
So what's going on here to silence the reason that he's waiting for a caller is because there is no

510
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:50,592
There's a caller

511
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:56,992
Talking to no one can call in

512
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,552
Wait for a call or

513
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,368
Straight up and waiting for a call

514
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
On the bed music

515
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Hello

516
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,456
Got to be disappointed

517
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:36,160
Grumpy Old Men go to bed no calls to because they're not

518
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,232
Are there because the chicken plucker

519
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,560
Is it this way of not cursing on Arrow though

520
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
He ends up causing a bit

521
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,632
Well obviously

522
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,288
Call me I guess you supposed to go to bed now but yeah

523
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
No

524
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:59,456
Diu doesn't up getting call pretty quickly after this is going to bed music

525
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:08,928
The guy was saying the Clinton could stay in office

526
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,256
Choosing the Vice President in these circumstances

527
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,328
And then a little mad at him

528
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
Hello

529
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,216
Turn the radio off

530
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,672
Read your car producing it's all there

531
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
Happy birthday

532
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,304
Easy-to-understand

533
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,680
Talk about it a million times on these broadcast you should have a copy of the Constitution if you are American

534
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,240
Will you do welcome to

535
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,384
Get out of here

536
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,320
You never had one to start with

537
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,464
503-334-5782 number

538
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:20,864
I could listen to grumpy old Don Rickles all day

539
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,936
Yep

540
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:30,336
Just a weird Patriot conspiracy theories to f****** fed up

541
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,408
Continue moron cuz what's great about it it's like

542
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
I want level

543
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Bill's right

544
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:41,600
These colors are trash

545
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:48,000
I agree

546
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,048
You got to feel for it

547
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,840
Don't trifle with me god dammit

548
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:57,984
You kind of feel for but at the same time you can't be too mad cuz these are the people that he has called

549
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,056
So I don't know babe it's it's very conflicting but I would

550
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,360
I would absolutely listen to H & H

551
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,152
Bill just being like

552
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:09,760
Progressively more mad at his listeners

553
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,880
I would really like to know what probably some

554
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,184
Deep cut by the Beach Boys

555
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
I don't know

556
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
So those were things kind of turned around

557
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,840
There's a decent caller

558
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:27,680
And he has a question about photography for Bill

559
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
Lidl near me

560
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
Bertolotti

561
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,880
Probably best

562
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
Great if you have a birthday

563
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Call Adam

564
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:20,672
Completely changed it totally different

565
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:27,072
Yep bill doesn't let the anger that he feels toward those other collars carry over into the next car

566
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:33,472
Individual

567
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,568
People still mad at the guy who lied to me about having a constitution

568
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:43,712
That's kind of nice that's a little bit ruin him for a day

569
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,528
The inverse color is the one who

570
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:50,624
Infuriate alexovich Montag left

571
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
Photography

572
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,952
You need a darkroom

573
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:02,656
Well in the same way

574
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,704
A human thing you like

575
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
This movie is excited to see vertical impact

576
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
You also have hobbies

577
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,616
It's like he had either fully drawn

578
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:16,224
Person like you someone who has yeah you know I love taking pictures

579
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,808
I'm in the dark room is like

580
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,136
And Bill gets to talking about how he has his own darkroom

581
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:33,888
Rihanna radio

582
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,912
It made rapper

583
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:51,552
Around here right now

584
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
Packer fomite

585
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
Darkrai

586
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,744
But very quickly now that the other room

587
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,280
Pregnant any prolonged

588
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:07,680
And all this stuff is going to come out of the dark room darker

589
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
For what

590
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,032
Video will be

591
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,360
Artistic

592
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:20,224
Creative interest outside of his conspiracy theories

593
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,296
It has to go a long way

594
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
In terms of dyke

595
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,648
Alex's interest outside of the

596
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
Drinking

597
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:37,888
Doing commercials for his product his staff

598
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,192
If there's anything like isn't paint

599
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:46,080
Doesn't doesn't write poetry or doesn't have anything that seems to be a passion outside

600
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,688
This

601
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,504
Twenty-something years like his entire career I don't know

602
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,576
Then cuz you can't call his documentaries anything other than

603
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,648
Slightly different extension of his show

604
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
Absolutely

605
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,512
It's interesting. Cuz of bills not taking pictures of

606
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,304
Fake documents

607
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
They're going to be like a landscape

608
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:16,288
Beautiful black and white

609
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,568
It's interesting

610
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,104
An interesting person

611
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Chubbies

612
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,664
I'd like to find some of his

613
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,688
Prince

614
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
Yeah

615
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
Lakers

616
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:30,112
I feel like find the nearest pictures as much as Kanye West High School drawing

617
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,976
I imagine whoever would

618
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
Have them

619
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
Wooden Park

620
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,352
Iced it seems like

621
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,912
Yes we had a couple kids

622
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Exactly how many

623
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
Because again

624
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,080
Another most interesting things

625
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,687
Yeah baby

626
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:59,039
I don't think they would part with him either remain bear

627
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,343
That call was a delight

628
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,415
Had a great time

629
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,231
Great-aunt

630
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,511
Good evening German

You're welcome

633
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,455
Call

634
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,039
He is saying that the Mormon Church bought Pepsi

635
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
That's so different

636
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
From

637
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,927
Alex would have spun a simple question

638
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Intuit

639
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,511
Oh nonsense all the way over here need

640
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,535
He'd not be like

641
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,583
Pepsi to be like

642
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,471
Mormon churches on all kinds of evil things throughout time in history

643
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:55,103
Maybe yeah instead bill just gives it a yes or no answer

644
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,503
Absolutely not

645
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,879
Conspiracy meth it was originally Pepsi and then later iteration

646
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,463
Comes up at work Oak back to the

647
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,791
Conceptions that Mormons can't drink caffeine

648
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:20,191
Answer the phone like hypocritical

649
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
Pepsi

650
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:27,359
What piece of it is like that apocracy argument and then the other pieces that the Church of Latter-day Saints does has like a 4

651
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:33,759
Prophet side of it they do have a lot of

652
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,295
Came out and actually had a list

653
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:41,695
Right of the firm the things that were invested in Google alphabet

654
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,279
Call Dad JPMorgan ton of like really big

655
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:48,095
Joseph Smith

656
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,423
Taken quite a bit off the top the Mormon church just has to

657
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,447
To keep that going

658
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,495
Absolutely I do think

659
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,287
Existing

660
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:02,687
Is a part of why those conspiracy is bubbled up these various companies

661
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,223
There was something

662
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,527
Untoward

663
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,599
Then and because of that and because of the like sort of

664
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:16,255
The intrinsic other nests of Mormon people in Patriots

665
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
Regular

666
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,071
Very staunch

667
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,655
Christian absolutist

668
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,703
Yeah

669
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,263
4

670
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
Conspiracies

671
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,591
Linger forever

672
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,151
Even to like fairly recent days

673
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,967
Do you get bored with all the s*** the Vatican

674
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,527
You know you got to find some other Church

675
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,575
To do some hypocritical bulshit

676
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
You know

677
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,415
Sometimes you just need a new flavor

678
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,695
Like a Coke or Pepsi

679
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,511
Jericho that is all

680
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,559
Yes so this next clip

681
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
The next caller

682
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:56,959
Is kind of a bummer is a little bit of a sad story this guy has he got attacked

683
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,775
Mm2 now no longer read

684
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,151
Can I do now that I can't read

685
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,943
Really interesting

686
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,991
Question and Bill

687
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,807
I think the bill respond as well as you can

688
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,135
I don't know I have a lot of feelings about this called

689
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,975
Okay

690
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,623
Gurdwara

691
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,487
What what is it that you want to do

692
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
I don't know

693
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
You know

694
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
Find somebody that can read for you

695
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,463
What is it that you want to do

696
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
Two other people

697
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
Wake them up

698
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,215
Okay

699
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,287
Stop playing around

700
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,615
Conversation

701
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
What's that

702
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
Panera menu

703
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
I remember

704
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,927
But make sure you know what you're talkin about

705
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,791
Don't spread rumors

706
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
Don't

707
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:03,935
I really don't think I would say don't spread rumors to a guy who can't read

708
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,983
Because of a

709
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,263
Yeah I mean it did

710
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,823
The situation is presenting is really sad

711
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,127
That's the most terrifying thing I can

712
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:18,527
Are you mad

713
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,343
Fine advice imagine it might be difficult

714
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,975
To find someone to read as much as you might want to read on your own

715
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:33,375
List of the bills to find out the truth and tell people doesn't that require reading it's what I was thinking while he

716
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,959
High-end audio books

717
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,239
Like nobody is

718
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,055
Doing an audiobook of

719
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,615
These lunatic Conspiracy Theory Book

720
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:50,271
Somebody I think he might be able to find some in some weird catalogs

721
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,599
Newsletters might have

722
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:59,999
Can do that you can listen to Bell whatever Bill tells him

723
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,023
Face value

724
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,863
Assume that's as good as reading

725
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,143
Right

726
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:12,543
That's a difficult thing and it's much longer

727
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
Skype for quite a while and

728
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,639
He gets around to being

729
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:20,991
Barely trying to be really encouraging about you can teach yourself things again

730
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,551
Yeah like you you can

731
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:30,207
I don't like because the guy does is not specific about what his injury was or anything I have no idea

732
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,511
The bill was just giving him a lot of like you

733
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,535
You can

734
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,351
Put your mind to it and work really hard

735
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,375
And you

736
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,935
Can read together

737
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
I don't know you even yourself

738
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:44,287
Inspirational and also

739
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,103
No

740
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,127
Just not

741
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,455
The inspirational Parts good but the actual advice that he's giving

742
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,991
It kind of is just

743
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,063
Repeat things you heard on my show

744
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:02,719
It is get a living reader or something

745
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:06,047
Is within the reach of most people

746
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,911
I guess if you're married maybe you could have your spouse review

747
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
Yeah latian Shipoopi

748
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,031
You take it too far and visit particularly interested

749
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,847
Yeah there better be a True Believer

750
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,687
Bitesquad Bill talks about his show from the night before

751
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:26,271
And I tried to find this but it's not on the website

752
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,855
So I don't I can't find what the actual show is

753
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,183
But you talked about it a little bit and apparently what he did

754
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,999
Is he played the same song over and over again

755
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,559
Like he was doing the music show

756
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:44,191
If I understand correctly the point you was trying to make is about how

757
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:50,591
We keep talking about the same thing with this election and no one's tired of talking about the same

758
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Same thing

759
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,919
Play the same song

760
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:57,759
Artistically make that point or whatever

761
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,831
And he describes it in a way

762
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,391
That is maybe accurate

763
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,463
Directly about

764
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:33,087
Subway what would Bill me without hearing that I can't really accurately say

765
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:40,255
Closer to what might be described as satire just don't want to understand the show

766
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,535
Alex

767
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,583
I could easily see

768
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
Pinky

769
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
Albany liquor

770
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,031
What this colors describing is Bill lost his mind

771
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,591
Alex

772
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,151
Play that was a calculated

773
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:04,319
You didn't lose your mind you were specifically making a point through something that you think is absurd

774
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:09,951
And I'm not saying that I think that Alex a listen to that it misunderstood with that tire is it's just interest

775
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
That

776
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,047
One guy does understand satire

777
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:17,119
This is so wild because the the right

778
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,959
Criminally incapable of understanding what satire

779
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,263
It is simply not within their bow

780
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
And that

781
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,079
Bill Cooper is

782
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
Both

783
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,919
This this wacky

784
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:37,343
It's it's a complicated man I think Bill would be exiled from a lot of the right-wing to me

785
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,695
If you were still alive today

786
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,511
Cuz I was listening to a number of episodes from like

787
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,559
After 9/11

788
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:50,143
And like he was talking to Tom about how

789
00:51:53,983 --> 00:52:00,127
Not doing it for no reason right they are there is a geopolitical reason why someone would commit a terrorist attack against

790
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,943
The United States

791
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,015
I just think he would have

792
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,063
President declared himself King

793
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,599
I think Bill Cooper hope

794
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,903
Would maintain some

795
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,463
Based on the way that I that we've seen him

796
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,511
It seems like he is a

797
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,071
Staunchly committed to his principles

798
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,887
And capable of accepting information

799
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,679
Which is

800
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,471
A rare thing

801
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,007
Also thought he was going to buy good now

802
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,287
That is true

803
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,567
He's a complicated man

804
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:35,199
Beat the thing that I always I always can't decipher and I probably never will be able to is that like

805
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,503
If Alex had died

806
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:40,319
Years ago you never would have thought you would join Trump eat

807
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,855
Yeah

808
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,879
It's not

809
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:47,487
It's not inconceivable that bill would change with the time someone

810
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:51,071
But he doesn't ever get any of the episodes that I've listened to

811
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,631
From his show he never seems to be

812
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,655
As

813
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,471
Chasing of anything as Alex is

814
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,543
Alex through almost all of this seems very desperate

815
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,079
He seems very much

816
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,871
Needing of

817
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,151
Something sure

818
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,967
The way he

819
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:13,087
Goes around with a bullhorn is early career trying to make spectacles of things like

820
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,135
That is desperate Behavior

821
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,439
I feel like there was more like

822
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,463
Things,

823
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:23,327
And even if they're just asking for text

824
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Yeah

825
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
He's just

826
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,935
Annoyed is just annoyed

827
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:32,287
The issue with like

828
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:36,383
For the president electors are voting for the president of bills

829
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,663
Satire piece

830
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,199
Answer the colors like

831
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:43,295
Why you were talking about that you talked about that a lot

832
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,319
You talk about that

833
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,367
The issue number of times

834
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,159
Why why'd you talk about it

835
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,047
Adidas

836
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,991
How many times have I told people to get a copy of the Constitution

837
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:19,391
Very short written Motors anybody can understand

838
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,207
Got a copy of the Constitution

839
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,799
Tell me the bill has a keen awareness it is audiences not like they don't listen

840
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:43,455
That's fascinating I guess I guess if you suppose if you're dealing with any kind

841
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
Like

842
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,247
Ideals

843
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,783
Education

844
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,063
It has to be a

845
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,599
Near Lake Constance

846
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,903
Stream of people disappointing you

847
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:56,511
You know yeah yeah but you have to get over there pretty early your ass probably world

848
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,815
And you also have to have a lot of patience

849
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,887
Probably he does remind me of a like a social

850
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,191
Two studies teacher I had in junior high of just

851
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
Just like that

852
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:09,567
I've been doing this for thirty years you're not the first kid to ask me this

853
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,103
I am sick of

854
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:16,223
People telling me that the constitution says some s*** it doesn't f****** do your homework a******

855
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,015
You ready

856
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,295
You ready.

857
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:22,623
Yes

858
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,415
Guitar parts

859
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,439
Bullshiter

860
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,511
Yeah that's it

861
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,327
And get it does just keep coming back to More Humans

862
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:34,399
To understand

863
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,471
Listening to you without getting mad at

864
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,615
An individuals periodically based on the way they're interacting with you

865
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,919
But would like Alex hates his audio

866
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,967
Oh yeah to the point where he fears

867
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,039
Interacting with them is receiving multiple times

868
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:54,623
Then in his career

869
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,695
And I don't think Bill hates his audience

870
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,487
But you definitely hates

871
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,303
Some of these callers yeah oh yeah 100

872
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,911
You only hates or is mad at anybody because they're disappointed

873
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,215
Yeah they are not they're not

874
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:14,591
They're not living up to what he wants them to be

875
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,127
You're calling into my show

876
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,407
Don't b*******

877
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,479
That seems like a really simple thing to do

878
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,295
And Alex can't do it because he's entirely bulshit

879
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,319
Where is

880
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,599
Bill thinks that

881
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,903
He's the one who's telling the truth

882
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,927
Yeah that's it

883
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:36,351
Had a little bit of time on the show

884
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:41,215
The end of the show but are his called by saying that

885
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,311
You are the greatest

886
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,487
Be that as it may

887
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
Jezebel

888
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,007
Largest Revere that young our side

889
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,287
I hope I can meeting

890
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,567
Before I die

891
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,847
I think

892
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:24,479
Bill died like a year after this

893
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
It's kind of sad

894
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,783
That's a little bit of

895
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,319
I almost think that

896
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:32,159
It is like I'm imagining this and I think Bill Cooper would have

897
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,743
Listen to Greta thunberg speech at the UN adjust been like

898
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,071
God dammit I disagree with everything she said but

899
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,863
Way to take it to those assholes

900
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:46,495
Maybe a climate change

901
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,775
But

902
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,079
I don't know if you caught the

903
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,455
Very specific expression

904
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,991
That I use all the time

905
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,527
Be that as it may

906
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,623
Now we have as isn't there once and be that as it may

907
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,695
Episode

908
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,999
I worry I worry

909
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,375
Incarnation work

910
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:17,727
How old would they be right about

911
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:22,335
And were you secretly adopted favorably

912
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:25,919
Could you

913
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,527
I got to go talk to my dad

914
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,087
No I don't think I don't think

915
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,671
Texas

916
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,439
Lovin everybody

917
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,999
So it was like Skype

00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,303
It's weird cuz you hear stuff about Hillary

919
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,351
On this episode

920
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,375
Wii U S

921
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,703
Bill is just leaving office in 2000

922
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,751
I forgot

923
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:57,151
Did Hillary ran for Senator in New York wow bill was still ending completely

924
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
I forgot that was the overlap

925
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:02,271
And so of course Hillary the subject at the comes up

926
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:05,599
Intuit building leaves

Hillary Clinton

929
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,231
Nobody told you about

930
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,535
Introduce

931
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,071
Remember

932
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,655
To do away with the Electoral College

933
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,239
Armoire

934
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,311
Heard

935
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,127
Elected president

936
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:31,199
Bill does not like democracy

937
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:39,903
That's pretty consistent with a lot of the right-wing

938
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,975
The tyranny of the majority

939
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,791
She didn't do that

940
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,071
And the irony

941
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,631
He could never have guessed is that

942
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,471
1816 years later

943
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,007
Had she have done that

944
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,079
That is very fun

945
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,407
Is that is that is a sad thought

946
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:07,807
It's very sad thought in all Hillary in 2000

947
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,855
2016

948
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,927
Hillary loses the presidency because of the Electoral College

949
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,231
It is kind of ironic that it's

950
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:18,303
Doubly her fault that she lost

951
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,327
Alexa

952
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:24,703
The election in 2000 election for President

953
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,799
Another caller here who says

954
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:33,663
You want to talk about Al Gore

955
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,431
His daughter

956
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:37,247
Is married to someone from the shift family

957
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:43,391
And so he eat you speculate about how the shifts

958
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,463
The Rothschilds

959
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,255
And Bell has an interesting response

960
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,023
The best

961
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,463
Fortune

962
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,615
Where are 12 women

963
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,151
Lot of rumors

964
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,687
Wagner Alabama

965
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,271
I could find no verification

966
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,391
I'm talking about

967
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,927
The part where he grew up with The Rock

968
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,975
Directions pineapple no verification

969
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,559
So you never hear

970
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,351
Noah's Alex absolute

971
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:02,751
Rothschild

972
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,567
Right

973
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:10,431
There's a lot of rumors

974
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:16,831
I'm so interested I almost have no interest in what he does believe and I'm so much more interested in what he

975
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:26,559
Because Alex doesn't seem to reject anything other than Q which he's secretly loves and probably believes in or whatever it is most

976
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,119
But what he reject

977
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:33,471
Create this kind of series of boundaries that he'll act within as far as what

978
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,495
Conspiracy theories

979
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,775
Chooses to believer

980
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,335
And the boundaries are

981
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,615
A really fascinating

982
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:45,247
In comparison to Alex who doesn't seem to have any does Alex does have anything

983
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,271
Prolessa

984
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,367
It's Pro multiculturalism pro-feminist

985
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,135
Pro

986
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:54,207
Lgbtq

987
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,511
Is

988
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,327
Conceivably right wing

989
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,447
Cuz he's a he's a leader of the

990
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,751
Exactly he's absolutely the leader

991
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:13,151
I do I do agree with you cuz I don't agree necessarily that has no boundaries

992
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,943
Much weirder

993
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,503
You don't

994
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,807
Put up with you Doug leave does

995
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,575
Give

996
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,343
Like

997
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:28,767
Framework have to find out what you're not before you can really find out what you are and in Subway's

998
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:32,607
That's a sign of somebody who actually thinks they believe song

999
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,935
Yeah because Bill is willing to like no

1000
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:41,055
You can't prove that I've looked at

1001
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,335
He can't prove that right

1002
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,151
That introduces a barrier

1003
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
For like

1004
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:50,271
His ability to go down fast

1005
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
Wouldn't do that

1006
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:51,807
That's another thing

1007
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:55,135
I could find absolutely no evidence

1008
01:03:56,671 --> 01:04:00,255
Yeah it's not it's not his trademark a phrase

1009
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,535
So

1010
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,815
You know it's great

1011
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,839
To hear things like

1012
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:07,423
Best where Bill is saying like that the rumor you can't prove it

1013
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,239
But at the same time

1014
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,031
He also says stuff like that

1015
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:16,383
Ain't no mistake about it I'll Gore is a dedicated

1016
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,151
Marcos

1017
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,431
His goal

1018
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,199
WorldCom

1019
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,415
God bless you too thank you for calling

1020
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,743
So Al Gore's a dedicated Marxist

1021
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:34,559
I'm trying to bring World communism

1022
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,655
That rumor I can find no verification

1023
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,191
That I've I've looked into

1024
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:44,031
So it's a double-edged sword of like

1025
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:50,431
He'll push back on some things that are brought to him it doesn't apply the same level of criticism towards the

1026
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:53,759
Things that maybe he's already accepted

1027
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,551
Improving

1028
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,111
And like that creates a little bit of a problem

1029
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,951
Last eclipse

1030
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,487
Trying to

1031
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:11,935
It's unclear exactly what he's trying to do but it seems like he's trying to say is that women should be allowed to

1032
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,751
Cateechee bill

1033
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,543
For the third time

1034
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,311
Episode

1035
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,591
Shut that s*** down

1036
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,015
Serving other guard

1037
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,903
Harvard

1038
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,695
Call Greg

1039
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,079
You will have

1040
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:57,759
Broadcast message

1041
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,551
Know that you are

1042
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,319
Goodnight

1043
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,367
God bless

1044
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,927
Everything

1045
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:05,951
Arlo

1046
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,727
But I mean

1047
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:19,775
Really good

1048
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,055
That's a great answer

1049
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,127
We don't allow preaching on the show although

1050
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:26,687
You does

1051
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:29,759
Absolutely

1052
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:33,087
Not not the same way that Alex is still some

1053
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,183
Some definite religious inclinations

1054
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,487
Yeah I would be interested know if he

1055
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:44,607
Crap

1056
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,215
Bubbaques his belief in God seems to be sincere

1057
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,311
Also seems kind of

1058
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,079
Functional

1059
01:06:54,335 --> 01:07:00,479
Like there's a third sometimes expressing things are kind of go along the lines of like Pascal's wager

1060
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:05,599
If you believe in God and he doesn't exist there's no

1061
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,623
Eagleheart

1062
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,439
Yeah and if you don't believe in God and He does exist

1063
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:14,559
So why not just believe in him it no matter what it works out better

1064
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,839
You have some

1065
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:16,863
Mike

1066
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,399
Things that I've heard him say that

1067
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,167
Kind of going

1068
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:19,935
Direction

1069
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,471
And then the other thing

1070
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,263
Is that he believes

1071
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
That with

1072
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,079
Audi existence of a deity

1073
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:28,383
Creator endowed rights don't

1074
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,151
Exist

1075
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,687
And because of that

1076
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:38,367
You know states can come in and Rule your life and that's why Communists want to get rid of religion

1077
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:42,719
Because if they get rid of religion they get rid of the concept of Creator and outright

1078
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:46,559
I think that he just has some sort of a belief

1079
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,399
B fundamental rights can't exist outside of

1080
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:52,959
Them being bestowed by a deity

1081
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:58,847
At least in the episodes I've listened to it seems like a lot of his

1082
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:02,943
Primerica primary interest in religion comes from

1083
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,711
Those

1084
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:07,039
Places

1085
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:12,415
And I also don't hate that much I don't agree with them but I don't hate it that much

1086
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:18,815
I mean that's the part about like being against communism

1087
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:23,679
Directions home

1088
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
Seems like an odd

1089
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:30,079
It's not as bad as Alex's then

1090
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,359
No it is

1091
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:32,895
Like

1092
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:37,247
And in a way it is a kind of functional thought process

1093
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,527
In the sense that

1094
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,063
If you believe that

1095
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,623
There is a creator that gives you rights

1096
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:46,719
That reinforces your superiority to the natural world

1097
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,255
Otherwise we're all

1098
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,023
You know

1099
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,839
Like Tennyson you know where nature red in tooth and Claw

1100
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,863
You know that kind of thing

1101
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:53,887
So

1102
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,215
Without that idea of Creator endowed rights

1103
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:00,287
Or punishment for negative moral action

1104
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,823
He probably believes

1105
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,407
That people would just go insane and start killing each other all over

1106
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,199
It's probably something along those

1107
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:07,967
Maybe

1108
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,527
Witches because there's no

1109
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,807
Godsoe

1110
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,623
You know in the same Pascal's wager

1111
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,159
Why not

1112
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,487
I mean I guess that would be the flip side

1113
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:22,559
I don't know he's a he's a fascinating weirdo

1114
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:26,399
Similar to Alex in a lot of ways and also

1115
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,935
Similar

1116
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:32,031
I think it's really interesting that at least three instances on this episode

1117
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:37,663
Only an hour-long times within an hour of taking calls

1118
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:44,063
I mean the first 15-20 minutes of the episode

1119
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:48,159
He was able to have a caller who said something is sucks

1120
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:48,927
Yeah

1121
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,207
F*** that

1122
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,487
That's good stuff

1123
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,255
Yeah

1124
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,559
And no

1125
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,351
Indicates to

1126
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,447
Complete lack of concern with

1127
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,495
Turning this person off

1128
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:07,615
They're not resources to him people who he wants

1129
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,639
Get a message

1130
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,407
Trite

1131
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,687
And that's pretty

1132
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,759
He's fundamentally different

1133
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,063
Alex

1134
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,879
Pretty clear that they're just people to Market

1135
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,671
Yeah

1136
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:22,463
Dollar signs in his eyes if he

1137
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,743
Here's that its audience

1138
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,791
Not like I've

1139
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,095
I have greater reach to spread my message

1140
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,375
None of that

1141
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,935
And who knows if it might have been

1142
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,751
Different earlier but certainly

1143
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,543
None last year's I'm sure

1144
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,335
The pursuit of money will kill

1145
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,615
Whatever that

1146
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
TJ

1147
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,735
Thomas Jefferson paraphrase

1148
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,271
Dave

1149
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:51,391
Hit me up man I don't know this is this is an interesting little trip

1150
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:57,791
I am glad to be able to know that I've made reference to bills call in shows

1151
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,631
And then also how he

1152
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,911
Cheetahs audience

1153
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,959
Much differently than Alex does

1154
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,239
I think it's

1155
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,287
It's nice to take a little glimpse

1156
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:13,407
At this ya

1157
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,943
So there's this

1158
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:20,575
I think the next time we dip it into Bell

1159
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:26,463
We got it we got to be undertaken these bigger project

1160
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,767
And I think

1161
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,559
I want to do it

1162
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,095
As much as I enjoy text

1163
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:37,727
The court calls there's nothing really to research other than Ham radios

1164
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:44,895
What did you need to look into that

1165
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,943
Do

1166
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:50,271
We'll see about that

1167
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:53,599
I think I probably get to work on some of that stuff and so you can

1168
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,647
Crank something out of the near future

1169
01:11:55,903 --> 01:12:01,023
Back on Friday maybe Alex will be back a platform dry Friday

1170
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,863
It really honestly depends on if he's in studio tomorrow

1171
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631
I don't know

1172
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:12,031
By will see

1173
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:15,359
5 - 8 Jordan yes we are also on Facebook

1174
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:21,759
We are always looking for that downloads

1175
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,551
Local charity

1176
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:29,951
I Love You Mio I am Bill Cooper's darkroom
