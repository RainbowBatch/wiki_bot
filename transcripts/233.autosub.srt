1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,168
Alex

2
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:13,824
Little bit

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,432
Shut up

4
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
What's up

5
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,512
I was going to launch into like a Interruption of the world is going crazy

6
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,912
Right

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,272
It's because he's

8
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,832
What I told you to shut up but

9
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:03,232
So I got really self-conscious and forgot to launch into talk about Laura Loomer

10
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:10,144
Which by the way ever recording this she has already

11
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
Laura Loomer

12
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,848
But she got kicked off Twitter

13
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,128
And so she changed herself

14
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,176
To the door of Twitter's headquarters

15
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,808
And the police came at Twitter talking to press charges if you need a golf

16
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,416
It was revealed that she had thrown away her key

17
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
Twitter

18
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Look

19
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
I don't

20
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
I don't

21
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
Enjoy

22
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
Schadenfreude

23
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,432
And I loved it was great because she had a second star of David on her way

24
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,576
Which is not

25
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,512
Laura Laura

26
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,352
Farrakhan

27
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
Also because I'm not going to argue with you there

28
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,432
That's not going to get you

29
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,672
Get away if I can't get away with it that neither should he

30
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
Anybody else you got

31
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Long time thanks

32
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
For helping us out

33
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
Everything's crazy right now I have no idea where any of this is going

34
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
You're going to leave nowhere

35
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
But I mean in terms of

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Corsi's nonsense

37
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,944
Michael Cohen

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,576
Of course he's going to press criminal charges

39
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,136
Blow up so crazy

40
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
State of Florida

41
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,048
I don't know what's going on with the world

42
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,424
Outlook

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Tough times

44
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Because

45
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,456
Sort of self-conscious about our Wednesday episode

46
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,576
Some of the clips would have been dyed for people

47
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
And II

48
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:46,560
WhatsApp

49
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
Pretty little later in the episode little later in the episode

50
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,360
The response has been mostly positive and I put a pole in our Facebook

51
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:05,760
Go home and tell your mother about would like us to talk about

52
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:13,184
Do that I don't know we'll see

53
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:19,839
The people is suspect Marcus he's dead

54
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,447
In the darkness of our Nyan of The Obama Deception

55
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,591
I don't know I am I'm going to sit with those thoughts and see where we go in

56
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,455
People didn't think like

57
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
Anyway we were

58
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
Platform

59
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,415
Homophobia

60
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
I was concerned about like what are our response

61
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Possibilities here

62
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,839
I realize that I didn't think enough about that before we recorded the episode

63
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
And I'm glad that people didn't

64
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,775
Didn't seem to think that we were on the wrong side

65
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,359
Hypochondriac

66
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,455
Difficult time with this week is I've been listening to Alex in the present

67
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,807
Do a better job of covering guys bulshit

68
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,623
Present his show sucks

69
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:20,511
Still on that tip hop on Thursday for a Friday release

70
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
I listen to Sunday

71
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,703
All all I got all I could hear was him talking about these immigrant

72
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,007
Is coming over the Border

73
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,151
He implied that he straight-up said that that picture of the woman for children away for

74
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:42,527
A gas canisters

75
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
Jerome corsi

76
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Has the Baton

77
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
Monday

78
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
Bulshit

79
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
Tuesday

80
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
Sting bulshit

81
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
Am I going to do what we got to do a current-day episode on Friday we got to let people know what Alex's up to

82
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,751
So thankfully Wednesday

83
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
Pharrell

84
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
And at this point

85
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,895
It's clear the course is going off all script

86
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Talk about this

87
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
There's so much going on

88
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
Why Wednesday

89
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,367
That I'm like Alex's got to get off his

90
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,927
Dumb immigrants at the border risk

91
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,743
He's got he's got to bring something to the table

92
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,535
And he did on Wednesday

93
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
One of

94
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
The weirder shows I've ever heard

95
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,703
We'll be going over Wednesday November 28th

96
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
2018 today

97
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
I don't say this

98
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567
Coordinates on Thursday

99
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Thursday's episode

100
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,711
So is Courtney still on the payroll

101
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
If he is they would never say that

102
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,599
Alex

103
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,927
It's really weird of this episode so for that

104
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:58,559
Monday is that we may have to do another present

105
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
On Thursday and Friday Alex

106
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
Be losing his goddamn bike

107
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
Based on the news

108
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:09,311
It's broken here on Thursday evening about the situation

109
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
How's it going to be

110
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Supercuts

Historic

141
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,463
Haha you might want to keep an eye on

142
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:09,375
I'm saying is that there are many situations

143
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,775
Dan and

144
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543

00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,615

November 28th

151
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
To the doldrums

152
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,351
Sunday Monday Tuesday and I wasn't

153
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
To come with much of anything

154
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,215
And I knew I was

155
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
In for it

156
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,455
The most important broadcast we've ever done

157
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Ever

158
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:14,399
And then the last five or six years and every six months or so in the last ice age

159
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Amazing

160
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,431
There are human clones inside mothers

161
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:33,343
I know what story is basing his bulshit are you

162
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,351
Which Wich

163
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
The world's scientific Community has come out

164
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
7 people don't know

165
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
This is about this talk about is about

166
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:07,903
Early this week claimed

167
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
DC with Alex

168
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
There is no independent confirmation

169
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,263
At this point there's no proof that this dude what he claimed to have done but even if he had

170
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,079
His actions have been roundly denounced by majority of the scientific

171
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,479
Community nearly Universal in the reaction that is as irresponsible and premature based on web science

172
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,903
You bet that still.

173
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Right right

174
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,231
And the day after the story broke China order the

175
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,303
They were doing and they're launching investigation

176
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
This dude

177
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
Would you likely won't

178
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
Dwell

179
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,983
Frankly recent Chinese investigations have not ended well for a lot of

180
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
Movie

181
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Beastars

182
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,407
Anyone

183
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,735
Bring a story backup

184
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
Rummikub

185
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
Well this is going to be a good show

186
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,791
If he's leaving with that this is the most important show I have

187
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Ever done

188
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
This

189
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
I'm listening buddy

190
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
Maybe that story isn't what he's talking

191
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
The gene-editing

192
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,823
Any stories about cloning

193
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,663
And what the story that came out of China recently about cloning

194
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
And

195
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
It came out the day that Alex is doing this show so I'm thinking maybe maybe later these two stories

196
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
World's first

197
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
Cloned bunk

198
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
Mark's first birthday

199
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:53,375
They're closed because it would make sense that people don't freak out to

200
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Too much about life

201
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
The Clone dogs someone's dog dies

202
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,263
It gets hit by car though sometimes clone them

203
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,615
Google it they do that a lot

204
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
Really

205
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:11,551
Clone dog

206
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
You know what

207
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,839
They're not the same they're very similar very similar but they're not the same I went the same.

208
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
That happens

209
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,543
Pepsi

210
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
But a monkey

211
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,407
Close to human in there it's right there

212
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,759
That very article about this loan monkeys first birthday

213
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
Ends with this quote

214
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:49,439
Authorities in China has no plans to allow human cloning following the success

215
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,327
I think this is a weird place for me to

216
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Come out again

217
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
I think I'm kind of fine with it

218
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,751
I don't know

219
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,567
Like unless this scientist was like

220
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,127
Secretly doing

221
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:12,735
I mean if she was almost there are some indication

222
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
Somebody didn't give full disclosure

223
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:24,767
Do too much looking into

224
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
He was working with

225
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,703
We're just told that it was like an HIV vaccine

226
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Possible

227
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
He wasn't giving

228
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,735
Although

229
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,319

August

234
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
This story is a complicated

235
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
Confusing Place rally

236
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,159
Text to start the show

237
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439

His gut gets it

239
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,215
Cuz it got you the entire subconscious

240
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
No no

241
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
Don't do that

242
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,431
Intuition

243
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,295
Understanding

244
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
I got

245
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Never wrong

246
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Wow

247
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
Call Binky

248
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:13,567
I have the Second Sight

249
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,639
Alexei that you psychic in the past

250
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:23,039
Usually when he's drunk night recording

251
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:27,135
This is minutes into his show

252
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,975
Directions to the gut and also Alex is late

253
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
It doesn't stop there

254
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,607
Just to give our listeners Kant

255
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,191
When old white men

256
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,311
Okay well then I retract

257
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
The time of people say they're psychic

258
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
They're up to something

259
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
About to take a

260
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Behavior

261
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
What about Miss Cleo

262
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
She was up to something

263
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,327
Real psychics read powerful countries

264
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,527
This is what we're dealing with here

265
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,367
That's what we're dealing with a bunch of

266
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,695
The biggest problem

267
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
Trump's the psychic also

268
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
All psychic

269
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
World leaders origin

270
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:46,495
Define psychic

271
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
Like true

272
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,991
If you were actually psychic

273
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:02,879
It follows you would probably try and use that to accumulate power

274
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
The initial premise

275
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,119
I believe that people would

276
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
Gravitate towards positions of power

277
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
But

278
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
First

279
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
Definition of psychic powers

280
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
Total rehab

281
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:30,527
Clairvoyance is low-tier psychic

282
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
You talking about like putting socks

283
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:39,231
Are we talk about by koe Wetzel

284
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
Level of psychic are we dealing with

285
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
That's different

286
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
That's a different classification

287
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,399
I want to know what are we are we at

288
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
Psionic powers in

289
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:54,591
What level of fortune tellers

290
00:18:54,847 --> 00:19:00,991
Are actually generals on the battlefield

291
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:07,391
That other generals are Altos

292
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,207
Your psychic powers

293
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,279
Sitting at like the World Chess championships two dudes

294
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,863
Having a psychic battle

295
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
Real the real question comes out do it for me

296
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Stuff like that

297
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:31,967
Parkman season 1 of Heroes

298
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,039
Psychic

299
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,599
I'm so in the next clip Alex gets to something

300
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
Is going on in the world

301
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,023
And now the Chinese Tchaikovsky

302
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:50,655
They posted the rest check

303
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,191
Yep

304
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
Russia is a distraction

305
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,543
Just trying to stop for been overthrown

306
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
Oh yeah

307
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,295
And a Christian again

308
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,415
That doesn't sound right because in the seed of that

309
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
Is the seed of the future

310
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,279
Future of Christendom on a planetary scale

311
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,351
Cuz we don't do that

312
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,911
Michonne that first

313
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,727
Flash

314
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
Surprise

315
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Yuck

316
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Yuck

317
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,431
Chris

318
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:40,575
Now that's great

319
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,415
But were they defensive whenever they took those three Ukrainian ship

320
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,487
I think he's saying now is a like

321
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:52,351
In this immediate moment

322
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:58,495
These Ukrainian ships just went into Russian Port until they were coming

323
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
Aboard these ships and kidnapping sailors

324
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,223
Quite right

325
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,551
So while I definitely try

326
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
Ha

327
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Interesting

328
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
I don't want to unpack this too much

329
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
Just because if it doesn't

330
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,512
Tractor too heavily into the narrative

331
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
The show but it's just

332
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
Another example of Alex

333
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
Creating this sort of

334
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,448
Russian propaganda eccentric

335
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Broadcast

336
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
In the present

337
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,568
Just kind of very blunt

338
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
We say that

339
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,408
Christianity is equal to

340
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,808
Is Russian

341
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Christianity

342
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,184
If you're Christian just give it up your fashion

343
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Where at where at

344
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Call

345
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,352
Beginning of the show that

346
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Is the most

347
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Important

348
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
He's at work.

349
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,752
It's not because he comes out of the psychic and out

350
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
As well as all these generals

351
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Money

352
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
Front-loaded

353
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Absolutely

354
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
It's not that

355
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
There's clowns in

356
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
Here is

357
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
The big news of

358
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
The day

359
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
It's this big news

360
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Nope

361
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,536
I tried

362
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
This is the big news

363
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
Here's the deal

364
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,496
Giveaway the structure of this episode before we even get to it because

365
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
Alex is so bad at his job

366
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,848
Play is the big

367
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,176
After this Alex is going to start

368
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,712
Teasing the big news

369
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
Without

370
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
Sort of recognizing that he said at the beginning

371
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,856
So here is Alex talking about

372
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
That it is

373
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,440
Is Varsity story of the day

374
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
I wish you well then

375
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488

Russian collusion

380
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,664
When did the trial for treason begin warning to opponents

381
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,968
I got the hell out

382
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:24,160
She's a dictator in Chile

383

That means jury of your peers

384
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,840
Here's the thing

385
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,656
What Alex is responding to is that V

386
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,960
Trump train Trump

387
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
Meme Twitter account

388
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
Is exactly what Alex

389
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,640
Decide now that Russian collusion is a proven lie when

390
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
When do the trials for

391
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,992
Starts as a picture of all of Alex's big bad guys

392
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
Behind Bars

393
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,576
Ratcliff bars

394
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
That's what Alex results

395
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,256
Tamim and Alex is like this is the biggest news in the world

396
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,328
All my all my enemies are going to prison

397
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
So

398
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
The

399
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
Sitting president

400
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,448
The United States

401
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Oh boy

402
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Is it not like

403
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
Before

404
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,176
Is the actual president of the United States

405
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:24,576
I had to go to Trump's Twitter to confirm myself

406
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,856
But that actually happen

407
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
I want

408
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:35,328
To call an end to America I say to you all of my fellow American

409
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,632
Let's just dissolve it

410
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,936
Everybody has their own country now

411
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,752
We're all Sovereign

412
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:47,360
Shake this s*** like an Etch-a-Sketch Hellyeah

413
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,456
Makes clear that what he's talking about is just a retweeted me

414
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,528
He's saying the Trump is saying that

415
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,808
You going to do these things

416
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,904
Generous interpretation of

417
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,976
Cuz Trump doesn't have that thing the journalist

418
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
Stone equal endorsement

419
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:15,776
Different coming out

420
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:22,176
Except for the fact that he's been yelling lock her up at all of his rallies

421
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,224
Came out that he had to be convinced

422
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,272
Heavily not to try and lock

423
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,576
Her up right right

424
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Can you

425
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,184
I hate that we live in this world

426
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
I do

427
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,000
I hate that we live in this world but damn

428
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
Dad just for one second

429
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
Just for one second

430
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Imagine

431
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,400
Imagine

432
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,752
If Obama had retweeted a meme that had like

433
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,032
Michaela

434
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,248
It would be the number one story across the world

435
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,696
And I couldn't avoid it

436
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
Selena Gomez was a mustard

437
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
This is visible story

438
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
The bread-and-butter for the day

439
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,408
Because as Bisquick goes I just paused

440
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,944
If you going to keep talking

441
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Any brings up

442
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
Very familiar

443
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
Dodge

444
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
To reinforce

445
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,160
Because these individual

446
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,976
Congress

447
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:47,168
Uranium one

448
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
4

449
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,920
Still not true they legally sure about his every movement when he was

450
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,272
You really don't understand what the legal means

451
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,704
The CIA

452
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,264
She was being surveilled

453
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
Right after Obama got in office

454
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
Donald John Trump

455
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,688
His personal phone line

456
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,784
His personal apartment at Mar-A-Lago at I have that number

457
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
Changed it

458
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:43,744
I'm sitting there looking at the database that's that's Trump

459
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,560
If anybody out there haven't listened

460
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:52,960
M2r episode called the two hours talking about

461
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,496
Exactly where this

462
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,800
Information came from it's one of the biggest Crocs

463
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Some s*** ever

464
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,128
Dennis Montgomery is a huge con man

465
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,152
Who is trying

466
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
Toufayan

467
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,760
We could generously call opposition research on a

468
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:12,416
His narrative in order to smear him because the judge was pretty

469
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,768
Covert investigation of Joe Arpaio in Maricopa County

470
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
The database of

471
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,888
People thought is at something that came out of that investigation

472
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,168
Has been repackaged

473
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
Add some sort of database

474
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
The people who work

475
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
Being spied on

476
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
Yes absolutely

477
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,104
Spoiler for that

478
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,432
Is Alex's

479
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
Is the crock of s***

480
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Awesome

481
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,040
It's so awesome to know things

482
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
Running for

483
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
I would have one

484
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
Policy

485
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672
And that would be

486
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,232
Maricopa County is officially kicked out of the United

487
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:53,888
Build a wall

488
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:06,688
You can remain Maricopa County itself is dissolved

489
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Are you again

490
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,064
Where assume I will be allowed to

491
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
Keeps coming up Maricopa County

492
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:19,488
Keeps coming up in terms of like everything with a lot of stuff

493
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,304
Seems to trace back to malfeasance

494
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,120
Maricopa County

495
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
Alex

496
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Not talk

497
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
About how lot of his friends

498
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,104
Increasingly hot water

499
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,664
For themselves

500
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,944
Seems to be

501
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:43,552
Percy had no reason to go on television the other night

502
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,600
So Alex

503
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,648
Do not talk about it

504
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,184
But this is one of the more

505
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
Choosing things I've ever heard

506
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,608
She is a heavy hitter

507
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,680
State Department by Dragon season

508
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
Sure

509
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,200
Okay

510
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:18,368
I'm not going to lie about anything but these emails to each other

511
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:30,656
With both of these guys they're both lying to me

512
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,472
Alex I have a very simple explanation for this

513
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:37,056
Rodger Stone

514
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:42,944
That is what was going on there buddy I haven't even simpler!

515
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,992
You are

516
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,552
You're lying to yourself

517
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
According to

518
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,672
You don't talk about it all I have to do is like go from there

519
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,488
Would you seems to be expressing is the idea that

520
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
Jerome corsi told him

521
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,864
Rodger and Jerome corsi

522
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:06,240
Come up with those emails to each other about talking to

523
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,616
To go talk to us on

524
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,432
The cover story

525
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,504
I don't fucken understand I have no idea

526
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
This is nonsense

527
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,368
As we can see from their actions

528
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
After this

529
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
This kind of

530
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
Behaviors come to light

531
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
There

532
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:33,888
Tactical Geniuses dance

533
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:40,288
These people are brilliant realizing

534
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:46,688
Already captured and there's no realize I couldn't

535
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:53,088
If you know anything about Maricopa County you know that they were under surveillance illegally Dan

536
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,136
Alexander said that

537
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,000
Narrative

538
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,560
Mandrill course he was the go-between

539
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:07,936
Between Alex Jones and Mike zullo and

540
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,080
So he was orchestrated Larry klayman

541
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:20,480
Who's bringing Ebola into the country

542
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
Attack on white people

543
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:29,952
I don't I think if they know that they are the only people they can trust cuz they're all dirty as hell

544
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:35,840
How is it that Alex can pretend

545
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,912
I can't believe course he would lie to me like what

546
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,960
Courtney's entire career is it

547
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:46,336
Coronavirus

548
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
Taco.

549
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,088
Feels persecuted

550
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
He gets into

551
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,744
And because we're telling the truth

552
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Wow

553
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,608
Common sense

554
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:15,008
You're banned everywhere

555
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Okay

556
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,504
Don't coming after your family that's there that's a dispute with your ex-wife I think you should probably have enough tax not to blame the glow

557
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
Globalist

558
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
Your own relationship

559
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Issues

560
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,368
And beyond that

561
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,208
I don't know if Martin Luther King ever gave it features

562
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,584
Man

563
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,632
There should be some sort of

564
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,936
There should be some sort of live like

565
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:50,336
The GOP get my name out your mouth lock

566
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,152
Moratorium

567
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,272
My feelings on the matter is like I have zero interest in

568
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,088
By position

569
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:01,856
Is very clear

570
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:05,952
My position

571
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,560
Care care about whether or not they actually believe that

572
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,840
It's a troll movie

573
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
Alex is engaging in so

574
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Some sort of weird

575
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
Trolling

576
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,496
While evoking the name of Martin Luther King and saying that he tells the truth all the time

577
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,776
Just about

578
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,848
F*** it is these assholes do any

579
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
Exactly

580
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
The reason

581
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,968
In addition to this

582
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:32,576
This weird Donald Trump

583
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
I'm sitting here in a minute

584
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
The other

585
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,160
Secondary narratives italics

586
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,464
Really it's stuck in his craw

587
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
Is the idea that

588
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,304
She does a really bad job

589
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
Differentiating

590
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,400
Between people who are trans and people who crossed

591
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,728
You could have just put a. After he does a really bad job

592
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
But

593
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
Conflates the two

594
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
Very

595
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Confusing

596
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,688
Not confusing I'm not super confused but to the point where when you listen to

597
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,224
He's blurring that line intentional

598
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,600
People with crossdressers

599
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,904
Distinction at all so it makes it a little

600
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
Difficult

601
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Unpack

602
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
I'll try and do my best

603
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
There's a story that he's trying to

604
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,072
To cover and it's

605
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,608
About how

606
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,960
His version of it is trans people are just trying to prove your children

607
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:30,688
The story is that he found a clip of a crossdresser

608
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,736
Who I was engaging in this

609
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
Gramps

610
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,296
Where they go to libraries

611
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
Crossdresser storytime

612
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Where kids

613
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
Joanday

614
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
Crossdressers aren't weird people

615
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
That's

616
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,536
Exposed to a larger

617
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,120
So Alex Alex

618
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,912
Pearl the story

619
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,496
Into trans people are grooming your kids for sexual assault

620
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
And that sort of thing

621
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
Where the quote

622
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:18,048
We are ruining your kids were taking your kids from you and we've got to do this

623
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,400
Hear weird

624
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,408
Them

625
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,016
Ugly

626
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,784
In question

627
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,808
Is someone

628
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
I can't remember the first

629
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,672
They like city council meeting

630
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
And Derek

631
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,512
How much abuse they've gotten

632
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
After it was announced

633
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
They would be performing

634
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
Oregon

635
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,144
The kids at Vista

636
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,472
The word grooming

637
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,544
What is very clear about the idea of

638
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,104
You're a front of you

639
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,896
People behind me staring daggers

640
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
Write that all hate

641
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
We're trying to

642
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,784
To do is groom the Next Generation

643
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
To not be so Impala

644
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136
Very clearly the message

645
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:21,536
It isn't those guys and if you watch the video

646
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Which I did

647
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,608
You see when the person says

648
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,912
These people all hate me

649
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,704
You see a couple people not

650
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,728
Behind

651
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,944
It is very clear that this audience

652
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,736
It's a very brave Act

653
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
City council meeting and say

654
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,856
We are people

655
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,648
Where get out this is this

656
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
There's nothing about

657
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,464
The idea that maybe I do

658
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,280
Or something like that

659
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Can't talk to kids

660
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
I'm an adult

661
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,352
I know how to

662
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
Do you have filter

663
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,448
I believe exactly how to filter what

664
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
Protective

665
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,776
It's just it's mad

666
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,592
It's exactly what you'd expect

667
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
But just

668
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Because the word

669
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Grooming

670
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,480
Used he latched onto it and turned it into it they all wanted

671
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
Fuckyour kit

672
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,344
You know what this whole thing has

673
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,440
Spiraled out of the real complaint that most of these people have which

674
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
She's just like

675
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,768
I don't want to have to think about

676
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
Being a sensitive

677
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
The real issues like

678
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:34,752
I don't want to have to think about calling them do whatever I like

679
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,800
Like that is a five-minute delay

680
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:40,384
Like this is people angry about the train being late and then being like

681
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,968
I don't want

682
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,992
Did like

683
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,016
The discomfort of

684
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
Of someone pops

685
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,368
Correcting a politeness mistakes that I've made

686
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,024
Yeah it's very sad snowflakey on the level of Laura Loomer Trucking handcuffing her

687
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,072
Herself to a door

688
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,704
Pedophiles

689
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
The last one

690
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
The next one

691
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,032
Real

692
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:20,576
Trash

693
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,168
Cops work to put that scene in prison prosecutors work

694
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,216
Dakota brake

695
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,384
Gave serial sex abuser deal of a lifetime which is true

696
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,856
Bill Clinton on the airplane

697
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,744
So

698
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,864
One of those

699
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,264
The Miami Herald story about heroin

700
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,360
Underage girls

701
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,688
Star on it and end up getting basically Scott

702
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,552
Yeah what are the major takeaways from the story however is it Alexander Acosta

703
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
Was instrumental in negotiating a lenient sentence

704
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,232
When the police and detectives are put together a case that

705
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
The reason that's important

706
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:40,192
Is there a casa is Trump's Secretary of Labor which gives an oversight over International child labor laws

707
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,216
Human trafficking

708
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,288
The Herald article points out that he's even been floated

709
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
Is a possible replacement

710
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
Processions

711
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,104
As Attorney General

712
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,712
Although who knows how realistic that is someone's name being floated doesn't mean they're going to be

713
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,016
This is an element

714
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,552
Perhaps under-reported in the past

715
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:59,392
Epstein's connection to both Bill Clinton and Donald Trump has not been a secret

716
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,464
Both men Associated Epstein regularly in the past

717
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
Palm Beach

718
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,280
Is Rio closed

719
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,048
Tomorrow login

720
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,864
Now that's for Mueller he has no connection

721
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:13,216
Past the fact that he was ahead of the FBI at the time when Epstein was being investigated

722
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,568
This could indicate some involvement on Mueller Park not pursuing the case in a manner that

723
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,592
The fact Meriden

724
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,384
That's definitely a possibility

725
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
But that hasn't been

726
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
Proven

727
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
As is always the case in the term

728
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
In terms of things like that

729
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
Alex is just making

730
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
King s*** up

731
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,576
The most I could find

732
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,648
Was a heavily redacted FBI memo

733
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:36,512
They came out that said that he had provided some information

734
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
To the FBI

735
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
And that that

736
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,864
That he was cooperating in

737
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,936
In Florida that doesn't mean that he's a longtime informal

738
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,728
That doesn't mean that he was even in it

739
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:50,336
Informants go so far as to say that Mueller was videotaping

740
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,384
People with underage girls

741
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,223
In order to Blackmail them stuff like that

742
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,295
It seems like Jacob Wohl style libel

743
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,343
That's very unfair

744
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,159
CIA

745
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,207
To take comment

746
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,231
About trying to make a

747
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,767
The Next Generation War

748
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
People who are different than them

749
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
It turned that into

750
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,607
Drooping of children

751
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,887
And then here to be

752
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
Biso

753
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,471
Serta wishy-washy about the real facts

754
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,031
Story about a guy who was

755
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
Oakmont

756
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:27,711
Yeah this is a story about billionaires having a completely different legal system it's not a story about

757
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:35,135
Jori business and everybody should accept that this is wrong in every possible absolute

758
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,671
Start furiously plucking

759
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:43,071
If you could

760
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,375
Straight to Bill Clinton was involved in

761
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,191
This further than just being associated with him

762
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:54,591
Google Earth

763
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:59,455
8 years in prison for voting

764
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,015
But she didn't even know she could

765
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
Wild

766
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,599
Real thing

767
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
It's not a trivial matter

768
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,463
But this guy

769
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,767
Acosta Alexander Acosta

770
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,095
Is now the labor secretary

771
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,143
That's almost

772
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:25,823
You know like a wonder One Kinect because of this truck

773
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,847
Along the lines of life

774
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,175
Doing this favor for a billionaire

775
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,455
You get s***

776
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,623
For us to say that would be conspiratorial that boy does it feel that way

777
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,327
Don't worry about anybody else who was on Epstein's plane

778
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,399
Little rule quotes

779
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:55,519
He likes them young and he's a fun guy to hang out with you sure likes his women

780
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,055
Like

781
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,335
It would be one thing

782
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,895
If you just sort of tried to do the deflection

783
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:04,223
Of the story like that but he always does

784
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
You know whatever

785
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:09,343
But to then also have like a third of your show be about heaven

786
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,903
This drag queen wants to groom your kids and stuff like that

787
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,951
It's just distasteful like

788
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,231
It it real

789
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
I know I know

790
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,303
Alex Jones entire show is this

791
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
So

792
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
Emotionally manipulative

793
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,495
Because that is such a

794
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,287
People are

795
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,359
Trigger device and rightfully so it's

796
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,687
Spotify

797
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
Children absolute

798
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,503
And that sort of thing so

799
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
I just

800
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:41,087
I can get your lizard brain

801
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,743
From using any override pedophilia is almost always

802
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:51,071
Is in some way in like just like

803
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,143
They're always coming for your women or your kids

804
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:59,263
We'll get to that in a little bit

805
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:05,407
I don't want to I don't want to eat my

806
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,503
Is so

807
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
F****** Valero

808
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:15,135
By the way

Other variants of now that Russia collusion is a proven lie when do the trial for treason begin

815
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:53,279
So now you just want to go for free to make new versions of the minivan

816
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
This is

817
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,935

Tighter shot

831
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:53,951
Going for sure whether or not the picture has been

832
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:58,303
Neither confirmed nor denied generally turn it off

833
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:04,191
Amen

834
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:08,287
In this picture and its story

835
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:18,015
But there's even more news stories

Which is in direct

839
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,439
So here is Alex

840
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,975
Deflecting on that

841
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,559
Moving to China with Five Points

00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,215
Public

844
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:45,151
Hate this country

845
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:52,319
There's one thing I know about Corporation

846
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:59,743

00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
And Alex

852
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:26,111
Constantly saying we need to get everything out of the warehouse

853
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,975
Successful business Warehouse

854
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,535
You are going to refill that warehouse

855
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:38,911
You know car dealership it's got a fire sale

856
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:48,383
Have you ever been by mattress store damn everything's got to go but that's because they're so successful

857
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,759
It's a sandwich shop

858
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
Exactly

859
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,719
Yogurt shops

860
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,535
Kind of giving away a little bit of what's going on

861
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,559
Revealing

862
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,607
So

863
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
Like I said

864
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,679
The big news is

865
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:19,359
I really don't like that.

866
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:24,735
But as the second hour of the show start Alec doesn't realize he's already told the whole story

867
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,343
Oh no

868
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,975
Ultra Maxima 2 weeks before it comes out

869
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,279

00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583

00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
Great

878
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,687
Sure

879
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,991
Moving on

880
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,551
Weird that he be like

881
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:03,903

882
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,231

885
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,751
I'm saying it's go time on these people

886
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,287
As opposed to just being a kid

887
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
Continuation of his

888
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
Hey guys

You get the cut

891
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:37,183
Yeah it's like

892
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,255

He does this like I'm going to do this big reveal

894
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,119

The Clock Works in certain way where

896
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,519
The first six minutes of each hour goes to the local station

897
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,567
So it's not even broadcast

898
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:59,967
He's just burying John Downs reports here doesn't even play online po the local stations get to do like news and

00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:05,087
Weather at the top of the hour and then get back to his employees

Love it

901
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,791
Also I don't think you can say

902
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,607
That's something titled all I want

903
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,167
For Christmas... Is a report

904
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:24,287
No it's Hillary

905
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
Hard-hitting report

906
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:31,967
Hard-hitting and I really don't think so I bet it's not written well either

907
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:38,367
Air Force One or whatever they were like

908
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:46,047
Have you have you read this recent report all I want for Christmas is you know what

910
00:51:54,495 --> 00:52:00,639
Waffle crisp earned on the knee of Woodward

911
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:06,271
8-bit all good reporting begins with

912
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:10,623
Claire Road

913
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:15,999
Muckraking book about the things that John bounty

914
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,583

This for you to have a good day

919
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,847
For an hour but Alex

920
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,383
Taquizas big news more

921
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:43,135
Sources information a few weeks ago

922
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,439
Statements made

923
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,535
And then the president's tweet this morning

924
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,327
Crystallize it all

925
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,167
And I was thinking about

926
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,215
Breaking down

927
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:02,335
What's about to happen and then I got another message from Individual whatever has amazing forces

928
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,111
Paraphernalia

929
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,927
Gunrunner

930
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:21,535
That there were other scooters

931
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,607
Over here later they still won't give out an official

932
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:28,191
Okay

933
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:35,103
It is important to note that Alex not knowing that the police put out a report on the Las Vegas shooting is not the same thing

934
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,895
Is them not putting out

935
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:43,295
A report on the shooting

936
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:49,695
Las Vegas Police Department put out a 187 page final report someone up their investigation

937
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:56,095
Bravo

938
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,935
Investigation

939
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,031
First attack the report specifically says quote

940
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,895
Emergency only Radio Calls

941
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,943
Coming out in reference to active shooters

942
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,247
8 different properties along the Las Vegas Strip

943
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:19,135
Fires breaking out at certain properties actual shooters that were inside the Las Vegas Village at the time of the shooting

944
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:22,207
Early reporting for national news outlets reported that ice

945
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,999
Who claimed responsibility for the shooting

946
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,791
The investigation revealed

947
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,327
None of this information was accurate

948
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:32,447
Alex is operating off of rumor and hearsay that got misreported in the chaos that unfolded after

949
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,983
First attack began

950
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,311
It's one of the difficulties of our more connected world that bad actors

951
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:41,151
Or well-intentioned people with erroneous information accurate

952
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
Messages out

953
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,223
And then the meteor can be called Liars

954
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:45,759
Just because they don't

955
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,319
Keep reporting those messages after they've been shown

956
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
Would be false

957
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,879
The report goes on to say quote

958
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
Patrick acted alone

959
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,231
Despite earlier reports of multiple Shooters in different locations

960
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,303
Exist to substantiate any of those reports

961
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,863
Thousands of hours of digital media

962
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,631
Review

963
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,191
And after all the interviews were conducted no evidence

964
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,471
Exist that indicate Patek

965
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,751
Conspired with or acted in

966
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,775
Inclusion with anyone else

967
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:12,127
This includes video surveillance recovered DNA analysis of cell phones

968
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,151
The computers belonging

969
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,295
There's no evidence of radicalization

970
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,855
Exported followed group or any domestic or

971
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
Foreign terrorist

972
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,439
Everything Alex is saying is based on

973
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,511
Conspiracy bulshit that came out in the immediate aftermath of the shooting

974
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,815
I think that were Amplified by his own

975
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
Steve pieczenik

976
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,143
Infowars contributor Shepard ambellas

977
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,167
And Alex

978
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:35,935
Bacone College

979
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
Exorcism

980
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,751
None of this is real Alex

981
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:45,151
I told you all this s*** about Las Vegas that I probably still on for today and then

982
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,223
Unreported Medford

983
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,063
It's really crazy that that's what he's using is his

984
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:58,207
Barometer of credibility

985
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
Outlet

986
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,999
That's don't use the

987
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,559
The term amazing sources

988
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,351
Do they just call them sources

989
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,959
Have an amazing

990
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,775
Use other than if it was like Miss Marvel

991
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,847
Using the same sort of strategy that he does about his sales

992
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,991
Talking about amazing sources

993
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
You just got

994
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,295
A guy if that

995
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,343
Free shipping on credibility

996
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
Also

997
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:29,183
Shepherd came in was talking about how they were shooting

998
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:29,951
Helicopters

999
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,535
He also

1000
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,327
You made a documentary about

1001
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,119
Trails that I really

1002
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:41,727
I've been meaning to watch

1003
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,079
UE made it along with

1004
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,895
He made it along with Alex Jones employee

1005
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,527
Alex Jones employees

1006
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,807
Anthony Gucci

1007
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,575
Who's no longer in

1008
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:01,695
Images wear name tags

1009
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
Just give me

1010
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,287
Give me some sort of DnD range

1011
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,847
Geology

1012
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,871
I saw like

1013
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,711
Look nice I'm also I'm sorry I got off track I need a

1014
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
Think about the GM

1015
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,503
Plants closing

1016
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,575
Because they hated him

1017
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,343
America

1018
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,391
But it's kind of hard to

1019
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,415
Explain why some of the

1020
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,439
Plants are closing

1021
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,975
Canada in South Korea

1022
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,023
No track

1023
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
America thing

1024
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,631
South Korea but America light

1025
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:46,751
According to GM the move is essentially about trying to make the business more flexible

1026
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,799
A traditional automobile

1027
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
Appealing

1028
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,639
It really sucks that they're laying off for 1000

1029
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,967
Employees but it's not rooted in hatred of America it's rooted in a

1030
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,015
Fear that other Auto another Auto

1031
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,295
Might be coming

1032
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,831
And a desire to get ahead of

1033
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,671
Sales of sedans have been flipping pretty seriously for a long time

1034
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:09,279
Ford announcement April they would end production on all sedan by the end of 2018

1035
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,839
Apple Uber in Tesla

1036
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,863
Working on the Next Generation

1037
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,167
Transportation with self-driving cars

1038
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:15,935
Have you

1039
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:20,287
History is coming to the realization that they're not the normal Market forces

1040
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,127
Silicon Valley is poised to all but make their product

1041
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
It's all bulshit

1042
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,199
Like it's all terrible

1043
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:27,967
This is awful

1044
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,247
People should be

1045
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,527
Not being treated like this

1046
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,343
But because the show we do it

1047
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,879
It's the most important thing

1048
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,951
The nothing to do with Trump or Punisher

1049
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,487
Sing America or anything like that

1050
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,255
It's

1051
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,911
GM was opening

1052
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
Coal mines

1053
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,271
So full of s***

1054
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,063
What is it going to take

1055
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:08,159
For Trump voters to realize that everything he told them was a

1056
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:11,487
Probably nothing

1057
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,767
If your argument against

1058
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,047
If your argument against

1059
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,839
GM closing

1060
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,167
Is is just like

1061
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,263
They did it cuz they hate America then that argument never fail

1062
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,919
Well that doesn't

1063
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,199
I doubt it

1064
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,479
I doubt that day is

1065
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,271
Jesus

1066
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,599
UCare

1067
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,135
Dump

1068
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,231
You can't fool all the people all the time about

1069
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:47,071
You can fool all the time

1070
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,655
Already know what Alex is BigNik

1071
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:57,055
It is already solved

1072
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:00,895
Narrative is the ramifications of

1073
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,687
That he's pretending come from source

1074
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,807
You already know that

1075
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,599
But if you didn't know that this would be

1076
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
Incredibly frustrating

1077
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:17,279
He comes in and says I'm going to tell you two weeks news ahead of time he's like

1078
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,303
John lb report

1079
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,399
He comes back starts talking about how big the news is and then starts talking about how he was right about Vega

1080
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,703
It's the same game he always plays

1081
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Event tickets

1082
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,543
You know you just don't appreciate

1083
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,823
The way a lot of people.

1084
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,663
Alright

1085
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:34,943
Used more

1086
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,951
Just want to get it out there

1087
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,767
Butt so big

1088
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,351
That I really should like wait till tomorrow to tell you

1089
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,519
Saint hey here it is and then I guess people incredible information

1090
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,847
And then it comes true

1091
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,383
In a week

1092
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:17,439
You are wrong all the time.

1093
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,791
Gildedguy

1094
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,583
He Rambles a bunch more

1095
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,631
You're right it is just sort of

1096
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,655
Fake news edging

1097
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,495
I think he's realizing as

1098
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,519
This is not

1099
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
Not good

1100
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,711
But you know but I think a lot of people

1101
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,735
Just don't believe it

1102
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:46,111
Warcraft

1103
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:52,511
Bring this big news

1104
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:57,119
If I if I really commit today

1105
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:01,215
Jonah realized

1106
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
I'm sure that's not his

1107
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:07,871
The news is

1108
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,199
This is very important because

1109
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,759
I'm not just going to tell you

1110
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,319
What's going to come out in the next two weeks

1111
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
Where does Trump

1112
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,183
Go ahead

1113
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,471
Present

1114
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,591
The dogs are often

1115
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,615
Alex

1116
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,639
Suicidal

1117
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,175
Time so far

1118
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,807
Also the idea

1119
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:56,255
Kennel from Hell match I believe was the name of it

1120
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:04,447
What did Michael Vick run years ago

1121
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:08,799
Before that back when it was the WWE app

1122
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:12,895
There is a match between the big circles run by the world

1123
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:20,063
It was a match between the big boss man and this guy named Al Snow

1124
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,111
He

1125
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,671
Career talks to a phone call head

1126
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:28,511
Joke about oral sex

1127
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
Game called Head

1128
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,631
Musically like

1129
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,935
Mannequin doll head

1130
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,823
I believe

1131
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,847
Mannequin head

1132
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,871
Was because

1133
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
Used to have a dog

1134
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,175
A little dog

1135
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,199
That he would bring along with

1136
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,319
The big boss man

1137
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:57,695
At a hotel room

1138
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:04,095
So you understand

1139
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:19,455
Make cells note

1140
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,319
Cattle from helmet

1141
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,343
Which

1142
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,623
Is the ring

1143
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:33,023
There is a steel cage around it outside of the cage

1144
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:33,791
The dogs

1145
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:40,191
So the idea thrown out of

1146
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:47,615
It's the old idea of a lumberjack match we have a bunch of wrestlers outside the ring you up

1147
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:51,199
They were kind of hoping that what would happen if people buy dogs

1148
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,223
Pikachu

1149
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:57,855
The dog

1150
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:01,951
Embarrassing

1151
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:04,511
Things that the WWE

1152
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,279
Which is saying something

1153
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:09,631
The reason I bring this up

1154
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,423
Is that those are the sort of dogs

1155
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,215
Better

1156
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,751
Donald Trump

1157
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,799
I got you

1158
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,615
So are you saying is the news is

1159
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,687
Hillary's going to prison lock her up

1160
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,455
Taurus

1161
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,807
What to respond

1162
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,599
You just said that there's going to be false Flags

1163
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,623
Which is again

1164
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,647
He says all the f***

1165
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,695
Sometime none of this is new at all

1166
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,743
Here's the other

1167
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,511
Frustrate

1168
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
Okay

1169
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,143
So we do lock her up

1170
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:51,103
Vicky's gone that far

1171
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,175
They just do this thing where they want this thing

1172
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,223
But after after

1173
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
Dumb

1174
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
Dumb

1175
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,807
Dumb f*** s*** that you said

1176
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,135
Get out of this

1177
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:06,207
Extremist thing is we Deport more people or whatever it is

1178
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:12,607
Too f****** stupid nationalism by

1179
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:17,215
Weather

1180
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:23,615
I'm throwing you to the locker up-dog that'll give a s*** get locked up but it wasn't

1181
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:26,943
What what good does it do if he does them bad

1182
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:32,063
They need to maintain the edge basically of

1183
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,855
You you have a lot of

1184
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,623
The

1185
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,927
You can get a lot of mileage out of wanting

1186
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,607
Ruined orgasm

1187
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,887
As they say

1188
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,423
Alluding to

1189
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,287
It's not a pornographic thing

1190
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
Spend all day

1191
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,431
You build up

1192
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,503
I have no idea what I'm doing

1193
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,599
All this news is

1194
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,623
Just nothing

1195
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:11,999
It's just either rehashing of things that have been a theme of Trumps campaign

1196
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,327
Just alyx

1197
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,095
Projecting thing

1198
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,399
Are the cakes

1199
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
He says this

1200
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,239
As he's going up to break

1201
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:32,479
5000

1202
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:36,575
Yeah it's about Robert Mueller

1203
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:40,159
Calling all you criminals get ready scumbags

1204
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
Alex

1205
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:45,023
The reason all of your friends are in trouble right now

1206
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:49,887
Is because they publicly indicated that they knew about things that were coming out

1207
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,167
Before anyone

1208
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,959
Should have known

1209
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,007
You just did something

1210
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
You better f****** hoe

1211
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,079
If those emails do come out

1212
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,359
You better f******

1213
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,407
Hope that you know that the Providence

1214
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,711
Is clean because

1215
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,759
Eclipse Court

1216
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,807
I don't know what's going to happen in the future

1217
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:11,903
I don't know if all of her erased emails are going to come out I imagine a lot of them

1218
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,463
Or exactly what she says they were like

1219
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,999
Planning

1220
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:20,863
Whatever a couple things that are

1221
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:24,447
Suspicious in there too but I do know

1222
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,751
That Alex you f***** up

1223
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,287
No matter what the case is

1224
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,567
You f***** up

1225
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,591
Right there

1226
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,639
You f***** up

1227
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:33,919
Should not accept

1228
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,247
Never understand what the

1229
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,271
These guys don't cry

1230
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:43,391
Show me ways that clip right there isn't

1231
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
Is it nothing

1232
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:50,047
Like if these emails never come out which most likely nothing will happen

1233
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:52,351
Or I guess there is

1234
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,655
Dunno I guess there's a world where

1235
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:58,751
The emails do come out and they were

1236
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,359
Gmail

1237
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,407
OSHA

1238
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,175
Alex

1239
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,199
That's not good

1240
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:07,967
You're in trouble

1241
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
No man's sky

1242
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,207
I took a shower

1243
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,767
Speaking of which years does nexplanon

1244
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:24,863
Election fraud

1245
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:31,263
T-Mobile

1246
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,823
We really want

1247
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,783
Brazil Germany

1248
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:48,671
International nationalism

1249
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:53,023
So did you get into it

1250
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,583
On the show

1251
01:09:55,839 --> 01:10:01,983
Alex has a number of times. About how Brazil a nationalist

1252
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,311
The guy he's even said

1253
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:11,455
Bolsonaro

1254
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:14,271
Number of

1255
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,831
He is so hideous I wouldn't even

1256
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:23,743
Well said referee reference to something he

1257
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:33,983
The first issue that I have italics being into bolsonaro is that you came to power

1258
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:39,871
Where is predecessor Lula was jailed on trumped-up corruption charges

1259
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:44,991
Name Sergio Moro Minister of Justice as soon as bolsonaro be

1260
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,295
There's no way that that would

1261
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:53,695
Corruption is enough for anyone to be suspicious but the reality of Fujairah bolsonaro

1262
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,975
People who care about you Monroe

1263
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,559
Him a real chateau

1264
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:05,471
In 2017 he said of black settlement in Brazil nothing for procreation

1265
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:09,823
You refer to black activists as animals who should quote go back to the zoo

1266
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:13,919
2014 BC because you don't deserve it

1267
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,455
The congresswoman Murray

1268
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,503
The Del Rosario on the floor of Congress

1269
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,807
He later clarified saying he's not a rapist

1270
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:23,135
But wouldn't rape Rosario because she's ugly

1271
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:23,903
His type

1272
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
Clarify

1273
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,695
Clarify

1274
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,231
Is it's very nice of him to

1275
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,279
To clarify that he's a month

1276
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:35,679
And activism in Brazil

1277
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,703
These are they go to jail

1278
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,263
These red Outlaws will be banished from our homeland

1279
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:43,615
It will either be it will be a clean up the likes of which has never been seen in Brazilian

1280
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,455
Considering Brazilian picture

1281
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:51,039
He said with Playboy that he would quote

1282
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:53,855
Beyond capable of loving the homosexual son

1283
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:57,695
I would prefer my son to die in an accident that show up with a mustachioed man

1284
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,743
Your criticism

1285
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,071
T.i.

1286
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:07,167
This criticism of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 19

1287
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:12,543
64 to 1985 was to torture but not kill

1288
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:17,151
He later made it very blunt saying I'm pro-torture in the people are too

1289
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:21,247
You won't change

1290
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,783
Nothing absolutely nothing

1291
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:28,159
Unfortunately you'll only change things by having a civil war during the military regime

1292
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,695
Killing 30000

1293
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,255
Starting with former president Fernando henrique

1294
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,279
Cardoso

1295
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
Killing

1296
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:37,119
If a few innocent people died that's alright

1297
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,679
Bolsonaro

1298
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,959
Crackdown on his political

1299
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,007
The guys of purging left

1300
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,031
From the country

1301
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:47,359
There were numerous reports of government officials showing up at universities

1302
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,639
Confiscated

1303
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,919
Deem to be left

1304
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,735
Call according to Leah's donator

1305
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,271
PhD student to teacher

1306
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
Linguistics

1307
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,063
Professor

1308
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:59,903
There's among the taboo subject is anything related to any quality of the factors

1309
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,671
The closet

1310
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,695
Because that could be sooner

1311
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:02,975
To capitalism

1312
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:06,303
And misrepresented as supporting so-called Marxist ideology

1313
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,607
We live in an era of a Witch Hunt

1314
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,423
So

1315
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,751
Anybody

1316
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,031
Brazilian politics

1317
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,055
It's in the past 5 years

1318
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,895
One of the more like

1319
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
I guess

1320
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:25,759
Tragic

1321
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,063
Pinkberry

1322
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,903
If you're if you're watching the end of a democracy

1323
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,487
That's what you ate like if we're in the end of a democracy right now

1324
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,791
We saw the end of a democracy happen

1325
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,815
In five years

1326
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:42,143
Brazil

1327
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,959
Come on

1328
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,751
Of course we're going to support the

1329
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:52,895
What about

1330
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:53,919
Come on

1331
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,759
Come on billionaire slightly more money

1332
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:01,343
Yeah I mean it's such a mess

1333
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,135
It's so on it

1334
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:10,559
Sure I understand the idea of misogynist homophobe race it

1335
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,863
I understand that Alex's

1336
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,655
Position because he is a misogynist

1337
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,567
I understand that from him but I can't understand the idea of

1338
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,591
Alex

1339
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,383
If you knew the sort of things

1340
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:26,175
He's doing

1341
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,199
Sergio Moro them

1342
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,223
Minister of Justice

1343
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,783
The idea of cracking down on these universities

1344
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,343
Hey take they can't teach a

1345
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,159
Like I don't understand why Alex would be okay with that

1346
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:38,207
It indicates a lack of

1347
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:38,975
Any

1348
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,279
Or

1349
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,071
He is totally fine

1350
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,863
Fascism is longer

1351
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,191
Yeah I would go with the second one

1352
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:55,103
I think that we're seeing we actually have him legally

1353
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,127
Legal fashion

1354
01:14:56,383 --> 01:15:02,015
Hey we're getting a little bit too sweetheart

1355
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:05,343
And this is one of the other reasons why I thought it would be

1356
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,903
Sitting for us to cover this episode because

1357
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:08,927
Disgusting

1358
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:22,495
Of course she's worth one other great folks like

1359
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,543
More Southern and others at the rebel

1360
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,103
Lansing right now

1361
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,663
Thanks for such got fired

1362
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,783
I didn't listen to it

1363
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,807
Realized

1364
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,831
You'll hear it

1365
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,111
She talked a little bit more

1366
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:40,927
Sickly sounds like

1367
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,695
She's doing the name Cole

1368
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,511
With crazy how much the verbal pattern

1369
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,303
Yeah are very similar

1370
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:49,375
Who's running for

1371
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,959
It's really interesting there was an article in the

1372
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,239
Cut that came out recently

1373
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,263
Play that was written

1374
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,543
By someone that she went

1375
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:03,199
Figure out how the person that she knew in high school could

1376
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:03,967
Be the person

1377
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,991
Exist

1378
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,527
It was actually really

1379
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,575
Article I recommend

1380
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,599
Cuz it talks about hell

1381
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,879
She went from being the

1382
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,671
Was really friendly outgoing

1383
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,207
Magnanimous

1384
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,743
Weed smoking

1385
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,279
Helping younger

1386
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,303
People

1387
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,095
People over in dance

1388
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,887
Answer questions about relationships

1389
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,935
Alcohol and things like that

1390
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:28,287
In her senior year she was in a production of The Laramie Project

1391
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,847
At a candlelight vigil for Matthew Shepard

1392
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:35,711
This white nationalist

1393
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,991
Neo-Nazi

1394
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,271
See who shows up on shows like

1395
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,295
Like Red Ice

1396
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:41,855
Recites

1397
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,391
The 14 words that's

1398
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,415
Not good

1399
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,463
How how does

1400
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
Bridge that

1401
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,839
It's really interesting

1402
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,887
It's more than that I can really get into

1403
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,679
In the next flip

1404
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:59,263
And Alex have a little bit of talk about

1405
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,079
Weather position

1406
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:13,087
Graphics

1407
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:19,999
That's a problem demographically there's going to be around

1408
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,279
Boy

1409
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,631
Send a text clip they talk about that

1410
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,399
Feathers

1411
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,447
Shadowboxer islamophobic nonsense

1412
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,983
But at the end of this Cliff Alex

1413
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,775
About Muslims

1414
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055
Surprise

1415
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,359
I wouldn't have thought that this would be something

1416
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,383
Concerned with

1417
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,735
I am I am

1418
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:45,087
Islamic sexual mutilation by having a genitals cut off

1419
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,391
Tobit of building

1420
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,927
I am phobic

1421
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:01,471
Doesn't sound right

1422
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,567
What

1423
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,615
Weird

1424
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,943
That was a barrage of things

1425
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:17,343
No but at the end of people's he's like a real strange thing to put on my

1426
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:23,743
He's like that inhaler weight today they don't smell

1427
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,535
And they mutilate generals

1428
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,815
That genitals

1429
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,983
It's the way they make fun

1430
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,799
That's what I really despise

1431
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,079
I couldn't make heads

1432
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,127
But I think

1433
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,663
It goes Alex is like

1434
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,551
For against in this

1435
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,623
I mean I guess he's against people who are Islamic

1436
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,951
Like he's against them because

1437
01:18:54,207 --> 01:19:00,095
Because they push gay people off buildings or is he Muslim

1438
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,119
Because he

1439
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,399
Thinks that they're all that

1440
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,679
Okay

1441
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,471
Recognizing that there is a

1442
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,495
Acrostic

1443
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:11,103
Muslims as there is of all people that are

1444
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,639
Dick

1445
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,455
There isn't there is just a percentage

1446
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,735
Duvall group

1447
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:17,759
That are

1448
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:19,807
Send

1449
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,855
He just decides in this case because

1450
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,927
It's the group that he and his boys

1451
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:25,951
Do the other

1452
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,255
Marginalize the most

1453
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,535
That they are all

1454
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,303
Complete

1455
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,703
God I hate him but he's mad.

1456
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,495
Text Claire

1457
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:42,079
I mean this is literally the invasion of

1458
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,455
Third world

1459
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,647
Let the horse

1460
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:06,911
We were doing great and then we just

1461
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:13,311
The flat

1462
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,592
The plaque

1463
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,640
It's on

1464
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,456
G3 Lansing

1465
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,480
She got fired

1466
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:23,808
Because you went

1467
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,928
Bitlife

1468
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,464
Statue of Liberty

1469
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,744
Bring me your rich

1470
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,768
You're really a flute

1471
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,304
To do

1472
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:39,168
People who have jobs

1473
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:42,752
Adjust

1474
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,848
Can Alex they're just going to sit around and talk about

1475
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:47,872
Islam

1476
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,896
And how much they don't want

1477
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
Those people

1478
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:53,248
That's not all they talk about Alex brings

1479
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:55,296
Back up that clip he has a

1480
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,320
The crossdresser

1481
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,344
Addressing

1482
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,624
City council meeting

1483
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,696
Incredibly Horeb

1484
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:08,096
I hate you I hate to interrupt this time

1485
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:11,168
Very conscious that I am doing that there is

1486
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,960
Just one thing that I want to say

1487
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:13,984
About how stupid

1488
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,776
Which is

1489
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,800
How is it

1490
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,824
That you don't

1491
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,592
Realize

1492
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:21,920
That if you ate even in their perfect world of like

1493
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,456
We never bring in third world people

1494
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,296
You're only bringing in the well

1495
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,832
They're only getting wealthy

1496
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,136
All that's going to

1497
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,440
Is your removing the serfs

1498
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,744
And you're going to become the sir

1499
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:40,864
Like even in their own world of like if you brought

1500
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,656
Like Upper Crust

1501
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:45,472
Of all other countries than the middle-class Yearwood

1502
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:46,496
Exceedingly poor

1503
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:52,640
If you really want to wait National

1504
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:57,504
You should be as many people as possible to work

1505
01:21:59,296 --> 01:21:59,808
Idiot

1506
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:08,512
No apologize for scaring you off

1507
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:11,840
Emotional sense to the people that they're targeting

1508
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,608
Is the issue

1509
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:16,192
Stupid like I said they get back to

1510
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,472
2BR the crossdresser

1511
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,776
Narrative that Alex has turned into

1512
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,544
Ultram

1513
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,312
People are really

1514
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,592
How to groom your children

1515
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,992
Sexual deviant

1516
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:34,368
I'm sorry to say

1517
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,048
Stephen Colbert

1518
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:44,096
Is body Abuelita

1519
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,888
So that's the way they reproduce

1520
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:49,472
Keep on going

1521
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,496

That was right there

1524
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,152
That this is the night

1525
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,432
Before

1526
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,200

1527
01:22:59,456 --> 01:22:59,968
He's getting married

1528
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,992
Congratulations

1529
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:02,784
Alex

1530
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,064
Sing about her too

1531
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:04,832
To be husband

1532
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:05,856
Beyonce

1533
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,720
Goldie is in Fuego

1534
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:13,024
Is about to get married to her

1535
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,840
A grown great Patriot

1536
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,680
She's a great picture

1537
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,264
Where

1538
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,032
To whom

1539
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:27,360
Fiance

1540
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,896
Not a whole lot is known about

1541
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:31,456
Other than

1542
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,248
Before we go any further

1543
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,272
She's a Nazi

1544
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,040
Beyonder

1545
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:38,368
European National

1546
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,928
Any association with fashion

1547
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,720
From what I can tell

1548
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,280
Really hard to nail down he doesn't have a ton of

1549
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
Stuff about

1550
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,096
Publicly available

1551
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,888
The only other thing that I can

1552
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,424
Can stay for sure about Joseph

1553
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,984
Is that he was thrown out of Royal Saint George private

1554
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:57,568
It's cool for what principle how Hannaford called quote

1555
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,592
Anti-Semitic

1556
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,408
The incident question was an internet mess

1557
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,456
Message board that was started it became a hotbed for

1558
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
For bigotry

1559
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,248
Specifically

1560
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:10,368
Disapproval with the messages

1561
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,392
Someone replied

1562
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:14,976
I quote

1563
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,768
You you little f*****

1564
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,048
Faget who are you

1565
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,072
Nobody knows you

1566
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:22,144
You're probably some f****** Jew doesn't deserve to exist

1567
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,936
He thrown into an oven with the rest of

1568
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,216
F****** k***

1569
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,008
Get off this site nobody wants you here

1570
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,032

1571
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,056
Peace a motherfuking

1572
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:33,920
Next time you decide to send something put some thought into it alright your little f******

1573
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,968
Don't go off about

1574
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,992
Brand of b*******

1575
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:39,040
Okay you f****** hook-nosed parasite

1576
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,832
That's all I have to say for the moment

1577
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:44,160
It turns out that the person who disapproved of the hatred

1578
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,208
Female students

1579
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:46,976
Printed off the mess

1580
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,768
Messages from the board report

1581
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:49,792
Mr Hannaford

1582
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:52,608
Joseph with 13 students kicked out of school for this

1583
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,656
Which doesn't necessarily mean that you wrote

1584
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,424
The above message

1585
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:58,240
But definitely means that he was writing similar things

1586
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,520
Given that for additional

1587
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,312
Students were suspended for shorter-term

1588
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,592
For being bystander

1589
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,616
Numbers on the message board

1590
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,176
He was definitely deeply involved in

1591
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:07,968
Like the one

1592
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,504
That was reported

1593
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,832
What are the chief concern to Educators had with the fact

1594
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,368
The language that was being used

1595
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,392
Very inaccurate

1596
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,672
Like holdovers

1597
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,696
1930s

1598
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,464
Anti-semitism

1599
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,024
15 year olds

1600
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:25,376
The conclusion they came to was that there was very likely some kind of radicalization happen

1601
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,424
50 students have been the target of

1602
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,472
Which they then became the distributor

1603
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:33,056
People who do face in high school as well as classmates

1604
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:35,616
The Joseph said that they believed that his influence

1605
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:39,968
And how he came into her life around the time that her mother was suffering with stage 4 breast

1606
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:43,040
Lifespace down the hateful path

1607
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:43,808
Betsy's on today

1608
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:44,576
Call Chip

1609
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,880
There seems almost

1610
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:50,464
Clear sound at your weakest moments

1611
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:55,072
Most suggestible and

1612
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:58,912
People who knew her have indicated that they believe that what happened

1613
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,192
Was

1614
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,216
She went from being

1615
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,752
Really outgoing

1616
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,520
Nice

1617
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,800
Very sociable

1618
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,568
Person

1619
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,104
High School to achieve

1620
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:09,408
Is it around this time track

1621
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,200
Distracted her life where her mom was

1622
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,504
Yep for that she was very weak

1623
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,272
Vulnerable

1624
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:16,320
If you happen to meet this guy who got thrown

1625
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,344
Supposed

1626
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,624
Systematic s*** on a mess

1627
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,392
Sports

1628
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,928
And she started to be able

1629
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:21,952
Take advantage of her

1630
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,232
That goes on to

1631
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:27,840
So it's very unfortunate story just because it's unfortunate doesn't

1632
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:28,864
She's not

1633
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,632
Complicit

1634
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,168
Certainly

1635
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:31,936
The monster

1636
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:35,520
If you want to

1637
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,872
Deal for her now because

1638
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,408
If there's anything I know about

1639
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,688
These exact

1640
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:45,504
Sooner or later she's going to be a

1641
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,600
That's the end of this

1642
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,624
But

1643
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,392
It's true

1644
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,184
It's wild fish Wild

1645
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:55,488
He talks to and doesn't recognize the

1646
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,536
They're really about

1647
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,352
Faith if you're listening to this get out

1648
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,376
Get out

1649
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:04,448
Get out of my

1650
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:15,968
And they open up open up a bike Sell Shop nationalist

1651
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,272
In the Trump vanhoose

1652
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,552
Successful

1653
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,112
Someone who is very

1654
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,904
Clearly indicated neo-Nazi

1655
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,672
Reposition

1656
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,952
An affiliation

1657
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:29,536
I have her on and says that her husband is a great Patriot

1658
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,072
Who's not even American

1659
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,656
Only as a patriot

1660
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,448
Is your version of patriotism is

1661
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,728
Protecting whiteness

1662
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,264
The only

1663
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:45,664
It's like answers how much more can you make there's no other way you can have an

1664
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,456
Nationalist movement

1665
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,760
The globalist

1666
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,040
Calling people

1667
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:51,808
Patriots

1668
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:56,928
If it's not uniting in some sense of white Nation

1669
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:01,792
He's a patriot or Germany or Austria

1670
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:06,400
Going to be.

1671
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,168
The nation of white

1672
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
Exactly

1673
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,240
Awful

1674
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:22,784
LA and San Francisco in London

1675
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:28,672
All the mentally ill

1676
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:37,376
Anderson Cooper at statue

1677
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,448
These are literally brainwash program

1678
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,752
Homebase mind-control individual

1679
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:46,336
I was waiting for him to get to the world of MK Ultra

1680
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:47,360
Conspiracy theory

1681
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,896
Didn't realize he was that beat

1682
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:49,920
Do that

1683
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:50,944
That's fun

1684
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,504
Detox about how Anderson Cooper is

1685
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:57,344
It's just a little weird homophobia that he has

1686
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,136
This Intuit Center

1687
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,184
You think about macron

1688
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,464
Like mainstream news

1689
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,768
I say what you want about macron

1690
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,584
Who is politics

1691
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:12,704
But it's pretty f****** stupid to say that its mainstream news that he was a Rothschild sex life

1692
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:18,592
I feel like if I feel like I would have Italy

1693
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,384
L.

1694
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:25,760
Once what else is trying to do the conflate misrepresent two aspects of macrons life

1695
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:28,320
Most likely because he's a pro

1696
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,344
You kind of guy

1697
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,416
Eddie beat Alex's precious fascist Marine Le Pen

1698
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,560
Now admittedly their relationship

1699
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,352
Definitely raises eyebrows

1700
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:43,168
And I'm not necessarily

1701
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:47,776
Student goes on to become an adult then they get married

1702
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:50,592
My personal take on it doesn't really matter though

1703
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:53,920
According to all sources their relationship could not have started before he was sick

1704
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:54,688
16 + 8

1705
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,456
You can set in France

1706
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,992
So there's no law

1707
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,064
I'm not going to I'm not going to defend it but

1708
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,856
The use over the age of

1709
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:06,208
Consent in French whatever you're trying to do here isn't going to work

1710
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,744
Macron wasn't a sex

1711
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,536
What is unconventional relationship

1712
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,608
Conspiracy World speculate that his wife was

1713
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,376
Some kind of a hand

1714
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:15,168
That's

1715
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:17,728
So those those rumors fly around

1716
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,752
Strength

1717
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:24,640
A complete mess misrepresentation of macrons pre-presidential career

1718
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:27,456
From 2008-2012 macron worth

1719
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,248
Does an investment banker at the Rothschild

1720
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,832
Question whether or not they wanted a president

1721
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:33,856
It had that close

1722
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,880
The connection

1723
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,672
Understandable

1724
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:39,232
Noemi Weston that deserves to be brought up

1725
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,256
In retrospect

1726
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,560
It also led to

1727
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:48,960
Not so sensible people like Republican candidate Francois character

1728
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:51,520
Stylized with a hook nose

1729
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,128
Particularly

1730
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:02,016
Are you saying that they're fine with

1731
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,808
F******

1732
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:07,904
The Russians

1733
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:12,256
I can't imagine any sort of founding

1734
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,792
Suggest that they would be fine with that

1735
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:17,632
Any of these accusations

1736
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,448
Rothschild Bank

1737
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,728
Because

1738
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:26,592
The Rothschild Bank was nationalized by Francois M on government 1981

1739
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,128
So the Rothschilds

1740
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,664
Basin National

1741
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:36,064
Have day-to-day control over it

1742
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,792
To Guida Rothschild wondering if his 40

1743
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:48,352
Years of Relentless labor had been all for nothing

1744
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,632
Then he left the country

1745
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,728
I kind of thought

1746
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:58,848
I kind of thought now it's his conception all these Global is the Rothschild

1747
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:01,664
But he was Francois

1748
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,944
High-level globalist

1749
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,968
Working Direct

1750
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:04,992
Play against the rich

1751
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,808
It is not something you would do to your boss

1752
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:11,136
It's in the best interest of the Rothschilds

1753
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,160
To not have a bag

1754
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,464
That's how they make money

1755
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,000
Right now

1756
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:23,680
This is all nonsense I just like the idea that acts like the mainstream news that he was a child

1757
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,448
Sex slave

1758
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,240
Like what the f*** are you even talking

1759
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,800
A bit of a

1760
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,176
I think that would be

1761
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:38,528
No isn't it inspirational for this guy

1762
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,320
Who was

1763
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:42,112
Even even though

1764
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,720
Metaphorically

1765
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,000
What's important

1766
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:51,072
Feels right

1767
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,608
It's a rag

1768
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,632
To riches story

1769
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,168
So Jordan

1770
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,704
9 whenever we hear country

1771
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,496
Play music we know that it's

1772
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,776
Going to be some fun

1773
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,568
In 2018

1774
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:06,432
Unfortunately

1775
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,968
Country music

1776
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,040
This song is a song

1777
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,368
If you leave me

1778
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,160
I will miss you

1779
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,720
I won't try to get you back

1780
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,000
Let It Go

1781
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:27,680
I got ocean front property

1782
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:31,264
Posturing his strength

1783
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,336
Explain that because we start

1784
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,872
In the middle of

1785
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,576
4024

1786
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:18,624
You know

1787
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:22,720
Energy 4406

1788
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,608
This news is so huge

1789
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:33,216
Oceanfront of Maine

1790
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:39,872
And if you believe that property

1791
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:40,640
Real quick

1792
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,968
Multiple times

1793
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:44,992
You said what the news

1794
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:45,760
Alright

1795
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:47,552
He still thinks he's teasing

1796
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,320
Justice

1797
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,088
It's fascinating

1798
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,392
President-trump

1799
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,160
Did the day

1800
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:59,584
Once again retweet and then

1801
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:03,680
What to get

1802
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,960
Here you are

1803
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,008
What's something is so big

1804
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,800
I don't feel Worthy

1805
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,528
Perfectly as I can

1806
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:26,976
But I've got

1807
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,000
Just

1808
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,328
New show important

1809
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,632
Show Danger

1810
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:47,200
What

1811
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:48,480
Just like don't know what to do

1812
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:55,648
You going to a field

1813
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,928
Normal situation

1814
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:59,232
He said nothing

1815
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:04,864
Infinite amount of time

1816
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,216
That was like

1817
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:12,032
He's talking about what he's experiencing in the moment you like

1818
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:14,336
I meant very unprepared

1819
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:20,736
All the sudden

1820
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:24,064
Alright now

1821
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:30,720
I think we should have played that Queen song instead of this b*******

1822
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:33,024
2009 episodes

1823
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,328
He says the quick

1824
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:41,472
Stop it

1825
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,128
Cut it out

1826
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,344
In this next clip

1827
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,928
Something else

1828
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:04,000
Well

1829
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,024
He's not

1830
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:05,792
But

1831
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,352
We see him in one way

1832
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,632
And that is a liar

1833
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:11,936
Some people see him

1834
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:15,008
I don't think that's healthy sources to know you can

1835
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,568
Chambray

1836
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,848
Then I have the force

1837
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,712
Just like you are

1838
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:26,272
Panopticon

1839
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,808
Pantheon sources

1840
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:30,112
Infowars is dreaded

1841
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,464
Possibility

1842
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,024
Councils of government

1843
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,352
And Congress in foreign governments

1844
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:43,936
I'm seen as like an oracle

1845
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:45,728
Really

1846
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:49,056
I basically don't lie

1847
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,640
Record

1848
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:54,688
Knowing things other people don't know

1849
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:57,504
Really

1850
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,344
It was just a minute come up with a just stalled of the roadmap

1851
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,648
Typography or coming in honest

1852
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:07,232
You just saying words there at the end

1853
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,816
That's just with Russia

1854
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:14,144
He was on his show

1855
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,240
It's not foreign governments believe that someone is f****** with you Alex

1856
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:22,848
Wow all the time

1857
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:28,736
Blunt object

1858
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,272
Oracle

1859
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:32,576
I'm at work already.

1860
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:39,232
Who's probably thinks he's sad that I'm like right whatever

1861
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:44,096
Delfi Jones

1862
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:49,984
You're a f****** Oracle alyx reveal

1863
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,776
Something about Trump that

1864
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,104
It worries me

1865
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,640
Thought about that

1866
01:38:57,152 --> 01:39:00,224
Those few times

1867
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:04,064
It's rare that I feel a little bit concerned about

1868
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:08,416
But if

1869
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:09,440
I'm a little worried

1870
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,488
Trump

1871
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:16,096
7 years of age

1872
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:20,960
Titan

1873
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,728
Text Audra

1874
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,800
And people are bugging him he doesn't sleep some nights

1875
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,592
He is a

1876
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,616
Maniac

1877
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,248
You should

1878
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,784
Appreciate something

1879
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,320
No

1880
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,112
There's no way he doesn't

1881
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:47,072
So we should be president

1882
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:50,656
Because

1883
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:57,056
Our champion

1884
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:04,736
I would recommend everybody out there if you're interested Google studies about sleep deprivation in the elderly

1885
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,528
This is very serious

1886
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:08,320
Like if Trump isn't sleeping too

1887
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,368
Date to week like that could lead to

1888
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,160
Two very serious problems

1889
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:15,232
Pictures of cognition memory loss

1890
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:20,096
There's so many like that would explain a lot if he's not sleeping two nights a week

1891
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:23,168
Q70 f****** years old he needs to sleep

1892
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:26,496
No I do need sleep more as you get older

1893
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:31,872
I don't work even though president who does the things I agree with to do that

1894
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:36,224
I don't want any president

1895
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,504
Sleep deprived

1896
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,576
Who made me drinks too much.

1897
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:46,208
This is true and I know you listen

1898
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,000
Baby

1899
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:48,768
Go to bed

1900
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,048
Just go to bed

1901
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:56,448
Not sleep two nights a week you're not doing anything

1902
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:59,520
Garbage the thing that your garbage at

1903
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,360
What is the Trump retweeted this

1904
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,808
Please that it's an indication

1905
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:16,928
But he's not a dictator because the meme includes the word trial

1906
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:20,000
So that means that everybody says that he's a dictator

1907
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,536
Stupid because their trials

1908
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:22,560
So if

1909
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,192
Actually nevermind

1910
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:33,824
I'm sorry I interrupted you again like the other part of his big news is

1911
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,360
In order to

1912
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,640
Make sure that Trump

1913
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:37,920
Not able to do this

1914
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,944
There will be false

1915
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:43,296
That's the only thing I needed to clarify because that's also part of his news and we can play

1916
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:46,368
Volkswagen coming because the globalist

1917
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:48,928
Afraid

1918
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,720
Not new

1919
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,000
Alex says

1920
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,048
Everyday

1921
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,864
The only thing that's different is that Trump retweeted to me

1922
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,912
That's the only thing

1923
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:06,336
Trump's going to lock up all of my enemies and in order to make sure that he's not able to do

1924
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:07,872
Nothing is different

1925
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:09,408
Man after you told me that

1926
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,688
All I can think of is

1927
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:12,736
How much I want to walk around

1928
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:14,528
And deal with

1929
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,880
Your field

1930
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,416
So we can go find a fee

1931
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,976
Field in Chicago Lakefront

1932
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:28,352
Some creeps hanging out there this afternoon

1933
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:31,936
100

1934
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:35,776
Centra

1935
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:40,896
So

1936
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,992
I just wish they would think

1937
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:47,040
One Step Beyond what it is

1938
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:47,808
Today

1939
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:51,392
So then what's going to happen

1940
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,208
A simultaneous

1941
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,256
Mueller investigation

1942
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:58,816
Into Trump and all of his associates

1943
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:00,096
That his letter

1944
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,888
Directly to

1945
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:15,456
Play Trump is going to launch an investigation into all of his political opponents

1946
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:18,784
So there's going to be a two-pronged like

1947
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:24,672
You investigate me I investigate you what are you got going on here and that's going to make sense of a matinee answer this question

1948
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:29,792
Because Alex Jones has this term that you like to throw around parallel Construction

1949
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,840
Okay so what

1950
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:32,864
Mueller is doing

1951
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,704
The parallel construction of what he's already guilty

1952
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:43,104
All of the globalists are guilty of all these crimes they're creating this entire perception that Trump is guilty of all these Prime

1953
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,968
Do it

1954
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:52,064
Someone identical to Mueller's investigation

1955
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,088
Justin reverse

1956
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:56,160
Because mothers wanted the parallel

1957
01:43:56,416 --> 01:44:02,560
Construction worker

1958
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:05,632
Makes it okay for him to do it

1959
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:17,152
How you trying

1960
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,688
Look at this

1961
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:20,480
It's just there's no Escape

1962
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,784
It's like a

1963
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,600
It's quicksand

1964
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:29,952
It's

1965
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:32,256
That's the

1966
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:37,120
Teasing it but also saying

1967
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,872
I don't understand how

1968
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,432
How does he not realize

1969
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:52,992
Teasing

1970
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:55,552
I don't I don't understand it but it does

1971
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,600
To equip towards the end of the episode

1972
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:59,648
That I think is one of the weird

1973
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,184
Morgan saying

1974
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,976
Slightly esoteric clips

1975
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,048
And for that reason

1976
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:07,840
It's worth our time

1977
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:10,912
Election fraud

1978
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:17,568
Okay

1979
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,640
And they're going to release

1980
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:21,920
Congress

1981
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,968
Attractive females have been discovered

1982
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,088
Who founded Malik

1983
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:33,696
But it's going to get a lot worse than that

1984
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:40,352
Valley of Fire

1985
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:42,656
It's on

1986
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:45,472
But they're led by psychic so they don't

1987
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:48,288
I just being stagnant being Yes Man

1988
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:50,592
Alicia vitarelli

1989
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,152
Valley of Death

1990
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,968
I'm going to be a

1991
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:56,736
Death

1992
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,064
What

1993
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,880
I'm extremely goes out to the ocean

1994
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:06,720
What

1995
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:07,744
Tree of Liberty

1996
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:10,304
In the ocean

1997
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:12,096
A big giant

1998
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,960
Patriots and tyrants at the sea

1999
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,032
System

2000
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:25,664
And weird and I don't understand that

2001
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:29,248
Is hell cuz I think he started going with a metaphor like

2002
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,320
Battlefield

2003
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,624
Stream go to the ocean

2004
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,416
And then he remembered that

2005
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,184
Expression

2006
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,464
Tree of Liberty at

2007
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,768
To be watered with the blood of tyrants asked

2008
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:41,536
And Patriots

2009
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:45,888
Kind of works what

2010
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:46,656
What is that oceanway

2011
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,984
Alex

2012
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,288
Just stop

2013
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:56,128
Because you could just say we're going down to the death Battlefield mystery there

2014
01:46:56,384 --> 01:47:02,016
Stream goes to the ocean it's

2015
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:05,344
Tributary in a whole lot of streams are oceans

2016
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,624
This is where I'm Psych

2017
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,416
That's good

2018
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:14,816
You know what I realized I think I think my favorite thing about Alex's when he loses it halfway through thought you can suck

2019
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:17,376
Compel

2020
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:21,216
You plan to say what if an ocean is a tree

2021
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:27,872
Alex's Improv

2022
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:31,712
In speech is actually what was it

2023
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:37,856
Me to know why Alex

2024
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,672
Is going one way it takes

2025
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:42,208
Absolute other direction

2026
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:43,488
It's just

2027
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,256
I just a real tree

2028
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:48,096
We come to the end of our Clips here

2029
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:58,592
And Alex.

2030
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:00,640
Like a cross-dressing

2031
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,688
Reading

2032
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:06,272
Which is a different

2033
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,552
It's a mess

2034
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,320
It's a mess

2035
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:10,368
It's just bigotry and then Trump retweeted

2036
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,904
That's all we got its

2037
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,464
Really weird to look at this in the present day

2038
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,232
Because like

2039
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:17,024
In order to make their beer

2040
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,560
Things to talk about

2041
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,352
Alex

2042
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:22,656
We brought up

2043
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,960
2nd clones in womb

2044
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:27,776
That's not true but I can look through that and check

2045
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:32,128
He said that macron was as Rothschild sex slave I can look into that

2046
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:36,224
Resume stuff it's like Alex you're misrepresenting this crossdresser

2047
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,760
Speech

2048
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,040
And

2049
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,576
Trump just retweeted a meme

2050
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:49,280
I feel like the Clone is big news because it's not a clone

2051
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:52,608
Gino Gino

2052
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:58,752
To do half an hour on that

2053
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:06,432
Boring clothes

2054
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,712
Genetically identical

2055
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:12,832
Beer that he didn't want

2056
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:16,928
But imagine if we could just edit

2057
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:17,952
Jeans

2058
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:21,792
Make people into chimeras even though they're not primaries

2059
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:24,864
Come on man

2060
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:26,912
Screw up the

2061
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:27,680
The reporting

2062
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:31,264
The feed like

2063
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,544
Respond

2064
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,568
Do you like Colin

2065
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:35,616
No clipping

2066
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:38,432
We'll see on that I think

2067
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,992
The fuckout

2068
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,016
New show sucks

2069
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:46,624

To know that

2085
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:20,416
The wisdom of the psychic is to know that I would never have

2086
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:21,440
Kid unless

2087
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:22,720
