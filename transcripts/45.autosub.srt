Alexandra Thurston color

00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,824
Like to sit around and drink and beverages

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,616
And talk about Alex Jones

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:20,736

00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,624
Great

7
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:31,232
While you're doing that Dan you know a lot about Alex Jones

8
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,048
Andrew and I don't know why

9
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
Reality

10
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
That's good summation

11
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:42,496
I don't even makes me want to get drunk

12
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:48,896
It's not it's not a bad whatever it is

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
Crystal Light

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
Oh yeah I can see that

15
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,528
Deteriorate into a Bazaar

16
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:59,392
Beverage we're here on a mission

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,696
We got some exciting enough

18
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:08,864
Been non-stop telling me about them but unfortunately due to the constraints of this podcast

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,680
I don't know what any of them goddamn r

20
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,728
Like oh my God I know

21
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,312
You're it's like it's like

22
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
A lot of it is not going to be released right now

23
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,552
We're about to embark on and it

24
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:32,160
Behind the scenes for the last month or so

25
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,488
INR first episode will drop

26
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
Tomorrow

27
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
However

28
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,816
We recorded it last weekend

29
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,400
So we're still drinking wine on that episode

30
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
I forgot about that

31
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,848
But I want I want to hold off until the investigation got a little bit deeper

32
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
And it has

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
Time is of the essence

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,224
Because I think disaster is a

35
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
Right around the corner

36
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,808
Didn't like life forever Alex Jones

37
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Alex Jones

38
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
I mean

39
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,696
But I'm assuming in-depth as we discussed

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,256
Today's episode which is May 25th

41
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,072

43
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Alex Jones

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
He's lost it

45
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,240
Okay this is f******

46
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
Over-the-top you'll see

47
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
Out of context

48
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Drop

49
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,992

Here's an out-of-town

54
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
Here's an out-of-context drop something Larry

55
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,352
Nichols said on a 2015 appearance of his

56
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,920
Play where they went to a church

57
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
4

58
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,584
Place where they did

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,912

00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,712
Even take that away I had to listen to that clip like 10 times cuz I'm like

66
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,344
See thing Hillary Clinton hung out with people from Designing Women

67
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,768
The women from Designing Women will not like Meshach Taylor

68
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
Delta Burke

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,888
What is a witch

70
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
Hillary went to church

71
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,800
Right I believe is

72
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
Nicholson

00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,456

What is the lady's last name is Bloodworth

75
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
I think that's

76
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
That's what he's going off of

77
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392

How seriously talk to off this episode is

91
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,799
I'm not going to do any context

92
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591

96
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,935
Breath information I've got

97
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,079
Important and I'm also going to be very very careful how I put this out because of sources

98
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
Civil War

99
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,807

110
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:24,767
It's three minutes of report

111
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
Is it because they're Taylor Swift fans is that what it is unfortunately a shark

112
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,519
Chester bombing

113
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
She went on a radio show and said

Borders

117
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:52,415
Unfortunate phrasing but

118
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:58,815
The rest of it's real strong stuff

119
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:05,215
Seems to be acting like a little bit of a cares about Katy Perry

120
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,055
Especially when you start your showed but I've got

121
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:15,711
Now let my London friend

122
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,271

123
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
The show every dude we got to get this information ready for you

124
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:30,559
Sleeping

00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,167
You claims to wake up at like 5 in the morning he goes on air at 11

126
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,263
6 hours of information

127
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
I have no f****** idea

128
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
We're going to get to it

129
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,503
We're not going to get to that I've no idea

130
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
He does have an elliptical

131
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
He talked about that a lot

132
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,207
We should bring up

133
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,767
Everybody is clowning hard on Alex Jones

134
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Because there was a

135
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
Before and after picture

136
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:09,215
Of him the came out of a super male vitality

137
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
It made him turn red

138
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
Is little bit more Define

139
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
Everyone has been

140
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,759
Everyone has been Tweeting or texting that picture to me and I'll f****** sick of it

141
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,807
So here's what I'm going to do

142
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Starting today

143
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,439
Memorial Day

144
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
Sorry I'm going to take

145
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
None of ours Jones's supplement

146
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,887
And I'm going to create before and after pictures of myself

147
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
If I can get better results

148
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
Then Alex Jones without his supplements

149
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,151
Well that's the least into Victory I've ever heard on July 13th

150
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,967
Least get a shirtless picture of me

151
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:57,343
Alright

152
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
Anyway let's

153
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
We're kind of getting off track

154
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,999
Because

155
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:09,631
Katy Perry

156
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,935
There's another real

157
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,775
Two more special reports later one of them is from John bowne

158
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,359
It's all about how she is a Satanist

159
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
Right

160
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,479
Into Special Report

161
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,063
Part of the Illuminati worship the devil

162
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,391
And then they implicate doesn't worship

163
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,951
Hillary

164
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231

Obviously though

168
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Warlock

169
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
Leader of

170
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:50,335
Kevin on Saturday Night Live sketches instead

171
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,431
Are you into Satan

172
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,391
He was on

173
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
Because the Demonic elbow

174
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,999
Night Live

175
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
This last week and one of the sketches

176
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
He said hail Satan

177
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,167
And that they use as their evidence

178
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Yep

179
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
Anyway

180
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,591
Like I said

181
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,407
Get off on Katy Perry because that's

182
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Has been doing

183
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
This entire week of just like

184
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:33,087
Kushner is clearly committed treason on every other network and they're like

185
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:39,743
What is it with Katy Perry and Ariana Grande Ariana Grande

186
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,351
Alex at this point

187
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
Came out

188
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,495
Pacific news about Kushner trying to get the back Channel shift going

189
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Did not exist

190
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
Not happen so she doesn't know that

191
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Okay

192
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,503
Cuz there is a in this episode of

193
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,319
The sky is falling

194
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,879
We got to get out in front of

195
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:11,743
And it has to do it on the horizon and the only man that can save them

196
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
Is our propaganda

197
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
Jerome corsi

198
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
14 years

199
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:27,871
You got three number one New York Times best selling political books has changed the course of at least one election

200
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
The guy stuff up

201
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
He does

202
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
Of the White House

203
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
Last year

204
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,935
It was last week

205
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,079
Connect to last question

206
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,551
They will be shown up as the frauds they are

207
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
It's because they're the fake news

208
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
Document

209
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,911
Fadeout

210
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,751
You should not be in the Press course your personal friends with

211
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Receive the

212
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,919
Adversarial Prescott

Success in holding

214
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,087
Institutional

215
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
Trump's Buddies

216
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
How do you feel about dogs

217
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,007
Do you like dogs remember that time we hung out to 22 years ago when I was

218
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
Wolf Trap

219
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:10,527
This is on the record would you like to come to my lake house again

220
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
Yeah that's crazy

221
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,671
You do want an adversarial press

222
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
But I think

223
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
Maybe the ideals

224
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Situation

225
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
Is a like

226
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
Respectful friendly

227
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Jocular enemies

228
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,447
You know what I don't think it's good for people to be yelling at each other

229
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,007
Things like that

230
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,823
You can have like

231
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
You know like that

232
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
You got me again

233
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,271
Anger is a Dudley Do-Right cartoon

234
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,111
Roadrunner Wile E coyote

235
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
I don't know

236
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
I have an iPhone

237
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Large question

238
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
So

239
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
We're all

240
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Unhappy about

241
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Course eBay

242
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Big time

243
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,215
Against

244
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
And that is

245
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
What is

246
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
Could happen

247
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,735
Yeah my question is

248
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
So

249
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
Well here's one of the problems

250
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
Yes you going to

251
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,439
Use the credibility that comes along with being in the White House Press Corps

252
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
In order to boost

253
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Bulshit

254
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,303
But he would have just made up with earlier credibility

255
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,935
Suddenly received by being in the White House

256
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
I think it's

257
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:38,591
I think it's a disappointment you're looking at this wrong

258
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,151
You're looking at this wrong cuz you're using the real world

259
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:45,247
You need to look at the prism of people who are

260
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,319
Lying to or already believe Infowars

261
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
Okay

262
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,439
Those people it's going to it's going to really reinforce

263
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
A lot of the lies

264
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
Fictitious

265
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,327
Proximity to power

266
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,607
The event proximity

267
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,399
To the official ship

268
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,215
That is going to give him a lot of

269
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,127
Now we wait not the right word

270
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
I don't know

271
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
I don't see

272
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
What one

273
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
CA

274
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,599
Positive or negative out of the

275
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
Press briefings other than sometimes

276
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
Get to laugh at house

277
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,255
Wildly in Copper

278
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
10 + 1/10

279
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
Sean Spicer

280
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,655
And how close to attractive Sarah Huckabee Sanders

281
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,959
So close if she were attractive

282
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:43,359
Superman the fact

283
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
Alex's

284
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Brick

285
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,831
Really that bad except for the possibility of disruption

286
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
But I mean who cares

287
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:02,815
Be kind of fun you know how when someone walks around with like fake metals and stuff

288
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
It's called main like

289
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,215
The Department of Homeland Security

290
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
It's a really really undignified

291
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
Insulting thing to do

292
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,127
Because you're basically taking away from a minimizing

293
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
What soldiers do

294
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,271
I think there is a journalistic version of that there's a stolen

295
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Journalism

296
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
Or whatever

297
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,367
That could be applied

298
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
To coerce

299
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Because of his

300
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
Proximity to the

301
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
The actual Pro

302
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,279
Okay so your theory is that

303
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,607
This is going to give him legitimacy in the eyes of the

304
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
The people who

305
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Believes

306
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
3 million immigrants

307
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
It's voted in the last election

308
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,543
But don't necessarily believe all of Infowars

309
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,895
Now they're kind of cuz they're already out in that b******* of

310
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
What

311
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
3 million immigrants who voted

312
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
So if they if

313
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Even that little bit

314
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
More of a Monica

315
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
Democrat ability

316
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
They're much more like

317
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:05,279
Infowars seriously

318
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,327
Even safe there are people who just

319
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
Really engaged

320
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,447
With what Infowars is they aren't really aware of it

321
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,543
Yeah it's the normalization

322
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,639
Two pickups from it

323
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
Real journalist

324
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:27,295
People's never looked into things that all it gives automatic credibility

325
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
Absolutely doesn't deserve it

326
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Look

327
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,951
That conversation is is good

328
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
I don't

329
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
I don't know I think

330
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,303
But you're right there

331
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
Not going to be there forever

332
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
But

333
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Shih Tzus get

334
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,311
You need to know that I do need to know

335
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
This is the

336
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
This is the sort of thing

337
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
The Jerome corsi

338
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
You can pull when he has White House credentials

339
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
Locked up

340
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
I just understand this

341
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
Is very credible

342
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,807
That it was x y and z

343
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:47,935
Until Tuesday

344
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
He told me

345
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
4 bombshells

346
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,479
He's never been dramatic like this

347
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,527
He said if they kill me

348
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,391
Listen Alex is very dangerous you need to be very careful as well

349
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,351
There is a war in the country this is not just an information War

350
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
It's already hot

351
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,079
That sort of thing would not fly

352
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,639
Nearly as well from a blogger

353
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
Let's play

354
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
Someone who doesn't have

355
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
Supposed official access

356
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,367
Right government inner workings and stuff like that

357
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
Bicycle

358
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
I will

359
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Have a g

360
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,735
For sure but I think it is absolutely

361
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
Part of his

362
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,063
We need to create a propaganda campaign

363
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
Corsi

364
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:18,815
Okay I bet I bet I bet him and Alex collaborated on an alias

365
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
Actually say any of that

366
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:31,615
Very malleable very good at manipulating Alex

367
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:37,247
Is there an entirely possible he just realized

368
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,343
I'm a freak Alex out exactly what I wanted to do

369
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,391
Possible

370
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,231
He's a better world

371
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Just like

372
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
Once a month

373
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
I'm just going to make

374
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
Alex feel like

375
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
You know what

376
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,703
Jerome corsi

377
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
Buckeye boring

378
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
I am so boring

379
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,567
Alex clearly Like Mike cernovich

380
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
So much more than me

381
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,663
You talk about loving Rappaport I have to

382
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
Create

383
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,831
What am I going to do okay I'll pretend that I'm deep throat or some s***

384
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:17,696
Over the weekend again why would he be killed over the weekend

385
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,000
Well because he has clearance

386
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,072
To release this information on Tuesday

387
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,888
Well if you're afraid of dying over the weekend

388
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,984
Your move is to release it early

389
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,432
Not really what you really said what would they kill you

390
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,504
None of this is real information

391
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
None of this is real

392
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,952
Tuesday

393
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,536
Back for you and it's Rapaport hiding in the bushes

394
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
Oblak

395
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
We're going to release our own version of

396
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,424
Clue that's just the Infowars

397
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
Rapoport in the bushes

398
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
With the Batarang

399
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,848
Nobody is a psychotropic drug

400
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Casinos are a weapon

401
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
He actually convinces you to

402
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,504
Yeah Paul Joseph snark

403
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,856
Maybe kill myself

404
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Hooey

405
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:26,304
The information is as the episode goes on

406
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,888
But I think this is this is a straight

407
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,936
On the part of Jerome corsi

408
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
Predict

409
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
Delete

410
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
That

411
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
Come Tuesday

412
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
There will be nothing big

413
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
And I think

414
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
That this is a

415
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,784
Probably a PR stunt

416
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
Exactly

417
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,880
People said about December 12th

418
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
That's exactly what they said

419
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,256
Sold a lot of calendars

420
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,536
And you know

421
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
World ended

422
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,288
That's all I got was just the beginning of the rise of fascism in Ark

423
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:15,456
We're certainly living in a much worse place five years later

424
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
When did gamergate

425
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
Start cuz I don't remember 12

426
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Anyway

427
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
December 21st

428
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
This next clip

429
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Alex

430
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
First

431
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:30,560
Very long string goes almost the entire episode

432
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Steven

433
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
What he's about to tell you

434
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
Yes he's not want to get to

435
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
You and Alex are

436
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,008
In common broadcast wise

437
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,824
It's still frustrating for you to be like

438
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,944
All he does is talk about what's coming in the future I'm sitting here staring at

439
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:53,600
Tell me what's going on it's just the structure of how these episodes have to be laid out

440
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
OK Google

441
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
Samurai

442
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,328
Anyway here's Alex playing the game that he and I love

443
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:07,680
Play

444
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,800
I had about 20 minute conversation with him this morning driving into work

445
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,640
Trouble focusing all the other news

446
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
Important

447
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,992
Extremely Illustrated

448
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,064
Alarm

449
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:30,464
Owen Shroyer had some similar info

450
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,632
Confirm

451
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,704
That this whole thing stinks to high heaven

452
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:47,616
Let's just say they got their ducks in a row before they kill Seth rich

453
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
F*** you

454
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,552
Where are you get to all that about amor

455
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:01,952
Part of what the news with Jerome corsi is going to break his that's one of the big things

456
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
What it's about

457
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
God dammit

458
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
And

459
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
Towels

460
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,864
What the big news is

461
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
I know originated on 4chan

462
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
Really

463
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:25,248
Discredited already it's really undignified

464
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,808
I think this is a desperation move

465
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,112
Which we'll get to in a little bit

466
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
You so desperate

467
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
Text was fairly interesting

468
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:39,840
What you have to do with Alex Jones is ranked

469
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:46,752
Now listen here's the thing whatever you're listening to Alex Jones you kind of have to read between the lines a little bit

470
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,568
The tone of this episode is

471
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,616
This weekend

472
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,432
We have big news I'm going to get to some of it

473
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,736
But the rest of it I'm not cleared to give

474
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
Intel

475
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
You know Tuesday

476
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
Of course he dies

477
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
I know who did it

478
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,392
We all know if

479
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,464
It's very desperate

480
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,744
It's very immediate

481
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,536
It's very

482
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,608
Okay and when you hear stuff like that

483
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
It's not because

484
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,424
That's the truth

485
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,728
It's because something else is going on

486
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
Behind the scenes

487
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
That is making Alex

488
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
Freak

489
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
F*** out

490
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,360
Okay I think I know what it is

491
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,896
So if

492
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,224
They're doing it for like this surprise reveal on

493
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
On Tuesday

494
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
He's building up this

495
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
1D

496
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Alex

497
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
He's going to kill

498
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,536
That's why I said it might be in the bush

499
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,608
We need

500
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,168
If corsi dies over the weekend

501
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
We know Alex.

502
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,008
That's the first thing we know

503
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,360
And also that just that just means he's setting it up for the counter-narrative

504
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
Something that

505
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Going to go down onto

506
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
Right now

507
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
No

508
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:04,576
Why are we why are we playing this this b******* game of he

509
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
He's going to die over the weekend

510
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
Because it's

511
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
It's severe

512
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
That's why

513
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
It's shocking

514
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,792
It's expensive going to get a lot of

515
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,816
Drive traffic

516
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,632
And there's a reason he needs to do that

517
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,680
But I'm going to get to

518
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,728
Part of it

519
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
I think I know what

520
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,568
I think I might have sucked out

521
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
What we're talking about

522
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:31,456
You know you probably don't have it brings everything into Focus

523
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
YouTube

524
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,576
Get into the information that he has

525
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
To give out at this point

526
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,440
Seth rich

527
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,232
But before he gets to the information

528
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
He has to get on

529
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
Ridiculously long

530
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,144
Tangent of a bunch of nonsense

531
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:55,520
Are you pretty

532
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,824
Really trying to take the piss out of Katy Perry

533
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,968
He really just wants to complain about

534
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
Stars

535
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
Taylor's oldest

536
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
He wants to complain about

537
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,928
Some Muslims that were demonstrating in London there have been some Muslims for peace marches

538
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,488
There have been some anti islamophobia

539
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
Gatherings

540
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
Demonstration

541
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,608
All coming together

542
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,144
Filled with hope and

543
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
Horrifying

544
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,128
Decided to go

545
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:36,224
There's a video and there's a picture of the lady who's wearing a shirt that says love

546
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,064
The letters of Love are made up of weapon

547
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
So like the

548
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
Always a grenade

549
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,720
It's a little bit ambiguous

550
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
It's very strange

551
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,352
There should be like an explanation for them for what that shirt is

552
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,264
Guns are love is a I'm looking at it

553
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
My artistic

554
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,848
Explanation

555
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,712
It would be it's a juxtaposition of

556
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
These tools of killing

557
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
Making up the word love

558
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,320
I think

559
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,648
My interpretation would be exposed to shock you into realizing

560
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,816
That's why I don't know I can't say

561
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,840
T-shirt is

562
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,656
Faces of everybody at Infowars

563
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
Is organized

564
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,008
No spelling truth

565
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:37,408
But I don't want to defend this ladies shirt I have no idea with the intention of it

566
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
Places you can make

567
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
Is really mad about it

568
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,392
But we have the video of Muslim women wearing shirts

569
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
Cuz I didn't do it

570
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
Extremely arrogant

571
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,776
When the left get some crazy white guy

572
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:27,072
Halloween costumes with hoods

573
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,776
Muslims relf

574
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,896
It is

575
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:47,296
Just just regular like Muslim Garba is Halloween costumes

576
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,344
Is insulting other cultures yet

577
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,208
Absolute

578
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,352
Tomorrow's episode of our show is going to go

579
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
The exact day

580
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,960
The Charleston shooting which was actually an accident

581
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,496
That we ended up covering that

582
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:15,456
Tomorrow I would recommend bring up dylann roof

583
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,480
Listen to his words

584
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:24,928
Is that all white people for the attack

585
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
Blaming gone owner

586
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Hours for it

587
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,768
The arguments that people were having fun

588
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
Blaming guns

589
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
And white

590
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:35,168
They were saying that this is part of

591
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,448
Our culture.

592
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:41,056
Part of the racism that underlies a lot of people

593
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
It is systemic

594
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,408
It's not all white people's fault

595
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,736
But white people are behooved to look at these things and these beliefs

596
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,296
It's sometimes were unaware that we carry

597
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,832
That was a conversation that happened

598
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,136
And we've listed Lisa

599
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
What's Italy say

600
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,304
But if you're still part of the

601
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
System that

602
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
Props this

603
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,168
Anything up still maintains an environment that

604
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,728
. only like allows it but in fact

605
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
Nurture

606
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,568
Write Community which Alex Jones

607
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,640
Is absolutely a part of the storm front the Nazi gold

608
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,480
Two people were f****** murdered their throat

609
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,040
By this alright bulshit f*****

610
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,576
This white supremacist

611
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
Who is just

612
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
Like it's stuffed

613
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
They are making happy

614
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,768
They are absolutely

615
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,584
Part of the system that nurtures this idea

616
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,448
And a big part of that is the mentality that he expressed in that last

617
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
What are you saying like

618
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,080
These Muslim men won't apologize for

619
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,456
You realize in the next Wednesday exact next sentence you're saying that you're mad

620
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,808
Expect expect

621
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:01,184
Patrol Muslim culture

622
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,256
You were so offended

623
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,864
By the idea of having to a beat like

624
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
White

625
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,192
What do they have to be made to feel bad

626
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,080
Adjusting are capable of doing the 121 map

627
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,384
It literally 1 / 1

628
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
It's 1 * 1

629
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,456
Is 1 + 1

630
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,784
Is the easiest map to do and because they're brown

631
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,576
He is f****** unwilling to do it

632
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
And it's insanity

633
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,904
We call it Fox News geometry

634
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:38,560
One sometimes does not equal one with feeding hello how you doing

635
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,120
This next clip

636
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,448
Anyway this next clip

637
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,216
Alright have

638
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,264
More to do with Ariana Grande

639
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,104
MN

640
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
Relationship

641
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
Islam

642
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
The globalist

643
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
Muslim

644
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
Working with

645
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Despite all of that

646
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:15,936
She still won't criticize Orthodox Islam or suicide bombers because that's not the in thing to do

647
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Left

648
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
Prop up Islam and must say it's loving and peaceful and helpful incompatible because it's the shadow

649
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:29,760
Army of the West

650
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:36,928
Open free Society

651
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,744
Facebook

652
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352
A friend

653
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:01,760
Alphys the alpha cancer

654
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:08,160
You just screamed over the most scary part he said at the end

655
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
We won't do anything about exam

656
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:16,096
Specifically

657
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,168
What are you doing are you going to Outlaws there free speech

658
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
The thing that

659
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,752
You say people are trying to do to you which

660
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
I don't think anyone is

661
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
What are you

662
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,920
The whole thing is just b*******

663
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:33,760
You don't believe spending suicide

664
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
Snowing

665
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,856
Not the last

666
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
You can empathize with a suicide bomb

667
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,976
Very much

668
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
Something good

669
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,792
We should do if you want to know why

670
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:49,376
Suicide bombing

671
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
Oh wait

672
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,216
Your suicide bombing because you have no f****** hoe

673
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:59,616
Because everybody's brought you into this dangerous and destructive

674
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,456
F****** help

675
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,040
Send you feel like you're marginalized don't feel like nobody

676
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
Cares about

677
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
Extremist groups

678
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,464
Your family isn't there for you

679
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
So

680
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
Projective family ideology

681
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
Auntie B's

682
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,840
People and they

683
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,376
State utilize that

684
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
The force

685
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
Is that maybe otherwise you wouldn't do

686
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
I don't think

687
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,776
Everybody

688
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,592
Relate that to

689
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
Any kind of

690
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
White

691
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,480
Crystal River

692
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,272
Movement even if it was male

693
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,808
I think

694
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,344
I had a flash

695
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Like

696
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,928
There's a decent chance that Alex can't wrestle

697
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
With that a

698
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,488
Puppy for people situations

699
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
Forget them into extremism

700
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,304
Psychopath

701
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Because no

702
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,120
Because strategically would be against

703
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,472
Cuz you would have to vent recognized but he does some of that himself

704
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,288
Like a lot of the people that follow him

705
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
AR

706
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,616
The same sort of marginalized Folk

707
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,176
And all he does

708
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
Is filled our heads

709
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
With lies

710
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
Narrative

711
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
That if they repeat other people

712
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,856
Disconnect them even

713
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
In further

714
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,416
Cuz like if you and I were just

715
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
Casual friend

716
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,976
And I came up

717
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,536
And I started spouting

718
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,072
We wouldn't be friends

719
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,120
No that would make a

720
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,656
Very hard to connect with

721
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
Quote-unquote normal people

722
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,240
Write as normal as you and I are

723
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:36,384
It would just not totally isolated people you only bring them more into the full days

724
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
You're the only person

725
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:45,856
Sweeping pronouncements on your show about how we're the smart people everyone else is dumb

726
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,160
Maybe he doesn't use family so much

727
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
Family

728
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,048
Still reinforces a lot of that

729
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,168
It's not quite as much but yes

730
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:06,080
Yeah I think he I think he would have to wrestle with the fact that he does that to

731
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,616
It is absolutely perfect

732
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,640
Text for him to set him

733
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
Goodguys verse

734
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
Yeah

735
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,784
To inspire those kind of

736
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
Us vs

737
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,368
Does that mentalities and Berry parfait

738
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,416
Boogeyman because they are your

739
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
You know Black Mirror

740
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,536
Basically what I want to know is do you think that

741
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
Muslims are the shadow Army

742
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
For the globalist

743
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,264
I don't know are they

744
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,152
Go with a big no on that one

745
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:45,504
Yeah we're going to learn that Muslims are killing millions of Muslims every year

746
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:50,624
Is that a shadow Army for the globalist

747
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
Alex is going to get to this big

748
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,304
Continue

749
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,144
Response by the Muslims everywhere

750
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,824
Just another tease

751
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:15,200
Tens of people are celebrating with a lot of times they were peaceful demonstrations

752
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
Nutella

753
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,528
That you can see pictures up of like

754
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Muslims

755
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,136
Four-piece most Muslims love Manchester March

756
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,160
Stuff like that

757
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,464
Basically the exact opposite of what he is

758
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
What do you think

759
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
Just the entire idea is

760
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,096
Once again

761
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:36,192
Reaction to apologize for

762
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
Basically their religion

763
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,544
Yeah what else what else

764
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,080
Could you possibly be responding

765
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
If you have to

766
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
You have a piece

767
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,432
You don't seem after this

768
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
Portland

769
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,808
Yeah you don't see white people marching in Portland going like

770
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,344
Hey by the way we're sorry

771
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,160
By the way we still believe in love

772
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,184
We still believe in

773
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
Not your enemy

774
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
You don't have to

775
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,072
That that white privilege that is

776
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,376
Is part of the Vista

777
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
Fake news

778
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,216
Fair enough

779
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:15,616
I didn't commit that crime so I'm not on the hook for it

780
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:22,016
Every Muslim is on the hook for it

781
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,296
2/2 people's throats

782
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
He's just

783
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,856
You must be compatible

784
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,928
Little bit

785
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
Wild

786
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
Stop

787
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:36,864
People that posted a bunch of his like Facebook posts and like Message Board stuff

788
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:41,216
You just have no coherent philosophy other than like being really

789
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,312
He's a lunatic who got a chance

790
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
To be a f******

791
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
Yeah

792
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:51,712
Pictures of him like Ezekiel speech rally

793
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Boy

794
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
We're in.

795
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:58,880
Ireland part of the IRA

796
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
That is a guy who is a f***

797
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
Insane purse

798
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,232
Person just begun

799
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:08,608
He's a gun waiting to be fire crazy really to fit in with any of the militias

800
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Stop.

801
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
Anyways

802
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
Alex's had a revelation

803
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,312
He said he's a big breakthrough

804
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:23,968
Before he gets to the real news that may or may not be responsible for Jerome corsi

805
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,760
To the real news that may or may not be

806
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:31,136
Jerome corsi

807
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,928
He's going to lay it out for you

808
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,104
Attorney general he was a senator in pull out and didn't fill out all the

809
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Forum

810
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,687
About

811
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,551
The article it says u.s. senators are exempt from

812
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
Because they

813
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:05,951
Meet with foreign dignitaries as part of their jobs

814
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:16,447
No

815
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:25,151
So you're getting the premise there is that they're just re-releasing old stories

816
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:29,503
Don't know how to read

817
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,783
Because

818
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:34,111
This story about sessions that came out recently is different

819
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
Then the last time

820
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,719
Because he lied

821
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
And open

822
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
Session

823
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,023
In Congress

824
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,327
Add with kids

825
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,119
Russian ambassador

826
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,911
This time

827
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,727
It's because you lied on his background check for

828
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,519
About the meeting

829
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
Woody hat

830
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,103
Cuz Alex brings up

831
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
That

832
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,919
At the bottom of the article

833
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,455
Doesn't have to fill this out

834
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,991
Because he's a senator and Bob

835
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,623
Transition team

836
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,927
It's not

837
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,207
Right it's that

838
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,511
Exactly the thing the Attorney General

839
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:17,631
I consulted with those familiar with the process

840
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,471
And was instructed not to list meetings with foreign dignitaries and their staff

841
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,031
Connected with his Senate activities

842
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,847
That's the piece of it that Alex is not taking it

843
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
Consideration

844
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
Exactly what you said

845
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,943
Zenit activities

846
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
Cool

847
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,759
You don't have to disclose those meat

848
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,063
They should be on your itinerary

849
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Should be

850
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
That sort of thing

851
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
These meetings

852
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
In question

853
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,975
Art related to Senator activities

854
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,583
They are related to Trump transition team stuff Trump campaign stop

855
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
And the fact

856
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,679
A really big deal

857
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,983
So then you get to like all the others

858
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
Looks like there has been like

859
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,823
Three or four cycles of Mike Flynn news

860
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
But they're all different

861
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,431
They're all new development in the same

862
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
Building crisis

863
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,247
In the same way with Kushner

864
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,319
New Revelations about Kushner

865
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,367
But they're very different stories

866
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,671
And Alex just

867
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Is there

868
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
Please take something

869
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,767
Again

870
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,095
It's like a murder investigation

871
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
They're like

872
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:26,239
We found another

873
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,775
Or

874
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:34,175
Before this it's over come on we got one I'm investigating you for

875
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,479
Crime write a murder

876
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,319
It's like a week later I found another body that you killed

877
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,391
Jordans

878
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,695
Old news

879
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
Yeah

880
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,815
I think it's

881
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:55,167
Visit was indicative of Alex's inability to understand what's going on in the world

882
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,983
I can clip about his

883
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,263
Like understanding of

884
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
The Civil War

885
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:05,407
Legitimately think that should be an entire episode

886
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:11,807
I can't believe that his understanding of the Civil War is even related to either size understand

887
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,111
Everyday was a war over

888
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:20,255
I don't understand what I've posted it up on knowledge fight.com

889
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,351
But I'll give you the brief version

890
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,399
It was about to Harris

891
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:34,335
What is this music ever us war was about tariffs probably

892
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,807
The recurring cycle of Lies the media does

893
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,111
I think you have no memory

894
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,207
Illegal

895
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,543
Listen to us

896
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,359
That's all it means

897
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,111
Like a Transformer you should go by night

898
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,135
North Korea

899
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,719
Conversation with the president of the Philippines

900
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:30,911
Conversation truck was on the news about the Armada and the submarines

901
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,639
Extra supplement

902
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:55,999
6 months before

903
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
And as soon as I see it

904
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:24,159
If you go back and look actually what was in the news on April 25th

905
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,463
About

906
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,743
The aircraft carrier

907
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,559
Where's that we're going

908
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
Actually it's

909
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:38,751
Also also right around the same time as Michigan

910
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,775
Talked in South Korea

911
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,615
BBC article from around that time

912
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,663
Right

913
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
.

914
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,247
4 days later on April 29th

915
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,783
President-trump

916
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
Phone call

917
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,391
With president duterte

918
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
From

919
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,743
My version better

920
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,535
Sounds good

921
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
Present

922
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,871
How to phone call

923
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:21,503
Yes I am the only reason we know everything that happened in that phone call is because just the other day

924
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,087
A Philippine confidential copy got leaked

925
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:29,183
Course and if you look at the script from the Filipino side

926
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
Where you at

927
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,743
Is the Trump

928
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,047
Very strongly congratulate

929
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,607
President

930
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,911
With the drug crisis in the Philippines

931
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,447
Which if you don't know

932
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:43,007
Since last year's of June of last year

933
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,055
Close at 7,000 people

934
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,103
Have been extra judicially killed

935
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,663
America because of drug offenses

936
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,223
The police claim or not

937
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,015
Or not

938
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,575
There's a lot of people who were killed

939
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,855
Adidas

940
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
Nothing to do with drugs

941
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,927
You don't kill 7,000 people and get them all

942
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,255
Especially if your vigilante crew in which case

943
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,583
I would say they've murdered more people for nothing than they have her

944
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,911
Also recently president

945
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,471
A state of emergency

946
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
I can't remember the name of the region of the Philippines

947
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:22,175
But he enacted indefinite martial law

948
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:28,063
That's been graduated

949
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,599
But he

950
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,463
Trump is congratulating him on how he's dealing with drugs

951
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,743
Which is very bad

952
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
Very bad

953
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,351
And then in the same conversation

954
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:43,167
The aircraft carriers

955
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
We're just cost in the news

956
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
And

957
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,239
1

958
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,263
Submarine

959
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,567
Very ceremoniously

960
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,847
Part of like

961
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,871
Yearly

962
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
Exercises

963
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:57,247
Just for formulaic every year routine exercises

964
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:01,343
Dockton South Korea nuclear submarine

965
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,367
Off the coast

966
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
North Korea

967
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,415
That is a big deal

968
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:09,023
It's not that like

969
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,583
4 days after

970
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,119
All this stuff with public

971
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,399
Some of the stuff

972
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,935
Winstead in publication

973
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Publicly

974
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,727
He's telling a

975
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,263
Murderous dictator

976
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,799
Norwegian

977
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:25,151
There are more publicly known

978
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,223
Roundabout where they are

979
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
That's not

980
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,295
A small deal

981
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
He doesn't know

982
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,879
That people on the other

983
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,415
Cider recording him too

984
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,951
Right

985
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,279
Like like the Russians

986
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,071
That is

987
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,607
Hopefully

988
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,375
Kushner

989
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,399
What

990
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
Executed

991
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,215
Voorhees

992
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,263
I don't literally

993
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:56,383
Exist other than

994
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,663
To give confidential in

995
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
Exactly

996
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:04,575
Solutely committed absolutely broke

997
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,623
No quite

998
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,647
But no question

999
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,023
So he just had no idea that

1000
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,303
The Russian Czar be like

1001
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,375
Yeah we better we better keep these record

1002
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:21,983
Yeah I mean it's the same conversation that Sally Yates had

1003
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,847
It's the same thing that she said the house intelligence committee about Flynn

1004
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
He's like

1005
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
If you

1006
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,455
Have conversations like that with the Russian

1007
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,247
They are going to record it

1008
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,599
Are there no they know that you've lied about them and now they have leverage over you

1009
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:42,463
Brennan said in his testimony

1010
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,487
That the road to

1011
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,279
Treason is often

1012
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,815
Undertaken unwitting

1013
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,375
The treason

1014
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,679
And they don't realize that's where they're going

1015
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,983
And by the time they wise

1016
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,007
It's either too late

1017
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,311
Or there's mail or they're being threatened

1018
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,335
Brett

1019
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,871
He looks like

1020
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,919
I mean Christmas probably guilty of

1021
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,455
Absolutely

1022
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,991
The best we can say is

1023
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
It started off naive

1024
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,063
That's the best possibility

1025
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,415
Turn it off

1026
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:18,047
The best-case

1027
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,839
But I fucken do believe that

1028
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,143
Bridgeway

1029
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,215
You should be

1030
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,543
JAIL View

1031
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,639
Access stricken

1032
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,175
Unbelievable

1033
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,711
If you could still access documents

1034
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:39,551
Right now when you start to put it into perspective to like all the stuff

1035
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,575
What's been going on

1036
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,599
The leaking

1037
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,879
The fact that those two

1038
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:46,719
Secure document rooms

1039
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,511
I'm not saying that they're related

1040
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,071
But when you look at all of these things that are going on

1041
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,863
If any of them are related

1042
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,143
We have one of the big

1043
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
Issues

1044
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:55,935
In our government

1045
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,703
Sister ever

1046
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,263
It could be a situation where

1047
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,311
Completely confidential information

1048
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
And taken

1049
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,639
And given to Russian

1050
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,431
And what would

1051
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
The reason

1052
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,271
Could only be undermined

1053
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,831
F****** country

1054
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,903
Norberto

1055
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,535
For the Russians let's fuk up NATO

1056
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Money

1057
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,839
Everybody wants money

1058
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:28,703
If you can blackmail the United States government God you can make so much money

1059
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,799
Are you kidding me how much money can you make if you can blackmail.

1060
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:37,151
President when you add into that Trump speech to Nato

1061
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,943
Adding that he refused

1062
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,295
Necessarily support Article 5 commitment

1063
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,367
Do everyone defend

1064
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,159
You add into that him

1065
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,975
Saying that he's not sure about Russian sanctions

1066
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,511
So you thinking about them

1067
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,791
The fact that

1068
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:57,375
He goes and he lectures these foreign leaders they need to give more

1069
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:01,727
Tomato for defense

1070
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,495
Not how

1071
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,055
Get all of our money back

1072
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,895
What are you talkin about to the point where foreign leaders were laughing at

1073
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,503
He's giving the speech

1074
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,551
People like whispering to each other like

1075
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,623
Embarrassing

1076
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,159
Yeah that Parts embarrassing

1077
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
All the other stuff

1078
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,231
Really

1079
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,047
I'm sick and tired of

1080
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,119
Like extremism in the Russian front

1081
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,655
You mean like

1082
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,959
Who are out there and they're like

1083
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,751
I've been guilty of this

1084
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,543
I've been guilty of falling into

1085
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,567
This being fooled by

1086
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,871
A little bit

1087
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
But

1088
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,687
Where everyone's

1089
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:47,551
He's a Russian agent

1090
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,319
Right Foot the

1091
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,855
Facts on the ground

1092
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,439
How much

1093
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,463
Too much

1094
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,703
Our President should be put in jail

1095
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:08,799
So the only the only option the only move for him then

1096
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
Is

1097
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,687
If I was if I was strategizing how he's going to

1098
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,735
Throughout the Republican Party

1099
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,527
Albuquerque

1100
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,855
And then Pence

1101
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
Spartans drum

1102
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,951
That's the way that they have to go

1103
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,071
You know it's got to be like

1104
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,863
Ump you get impeached

1105
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,399
Next person in line

1106
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
Pardons you

1107
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,007
Until you get to I don't know the secretary

1108
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:43,615
I don't fucken know I don't nothing's good

1109
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,735
Right so that gives you

1110
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,807
We gave you we gave you Trump hazard

1111
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,367
We pardon Trump which keeps

1112
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,903
The people on the alt right

1113
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,951
Hopefully from

1114
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,231
Burning

1115
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,815
If what should happen

1116
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,583
Open happens

1117
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Which is

1118
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
Trump

1119
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,935
Kushner possessions

1120
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,335
All of these guys wind up in

1121
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,103
Prison

1122
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,895
4life metaphor

1123
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,223
Yeah like that's what should happen

1124
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,503
If that happens

1125
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:25,343
There will be an actual armed insurrection

1126
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,927
From the alt-right most likely because the alt-right places like

1127
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,231
Infowars Like Mike cernovich

1128
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,023
These people have already built up a

1129
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:38,399
Defense for that they already have a narrative in place

1130
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,423
The globalist

1131
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,727
Or trying to get Trump out

1132
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,311
And when they do get Trump out hold the special election

1133
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:50,175
It's going to be overseen by National Security and it's just going to be

1134
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,199
Facade

1135
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:55,295
And then they're going to start destroying everything like they plan to do when Hillary got in

1136
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831
Even the first

1137
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,647
Step of their made-up plan the globalist

1138
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,415
Happens

1139
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,207
I'm in Tempe

1140
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:05,023
They're going to see that as evidence of the third step is

1141
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,351
4th step is coming

1142
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,655
Among

1143
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
Launch

1144
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
AR

1145
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,007
Part of that

1146
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,871
Who in the National Guard

1147
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:23,455
Is part of that these guys actually get

1148
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,503
And all of this s***

1149
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,271
Together like

1150
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,343
There's a real chance that if what should happen

1151
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:36,511
It's almost like the best possible outcome

1152
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
Is

1153
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,303
Let Trump

1154
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,839
Coast out

1155
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,887
Term which is an awful out

1156
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,703
The s*** out of

1157
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,007
Hope the Congress flips

1158
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,031
In 28

1159
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,103
Not let anything go through

1160
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,639
Just let it turn into a

1161
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
Contentious

1162
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,431
Political battle

1163
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,223
Between the two

1164
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
Contain

1165
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:01,855
A lot of aggression cuz I don't want to be arguing about the issues that are going on

1166
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,415
The fight between the house and the president

1167
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,719
I'm at like that necessarily have to

1168
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,511
Into the streets

1169
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,047
Yeah that's a Sara Lee

1170
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:12,351
In the meantime in the background

1171
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,631
How far until June

Stupid f****** outcome

1176
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,383
Al Stewart

1177
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,199
If you start having them communicate about housing

1178
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:27,967
The intelligence service

1179
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,735
This is our wedding

1191
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:52,543
I want you to know that Alex Alex is about to get to that big nose

Somebody's at the door

1194
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:09,951
Disgusted by the moon

1195
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,959

1201
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,839

Are pedophiles Merc durka durka.

1203
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:53,215
Ariana Grande saying that she hates

1204
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,055
She had like a mental breakdown a while.

1205
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:07,295
I don't I don't particularly I don't particularly care to litigate

1206
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,319
Personal lives

1207
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
Social

1208
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,415
Disgraces info paused

1209
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,719
Pop stars who have been famous events

1210
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,791
Before they were really adults

1211
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,327
Nobody

1212
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:24,191
Say thank note individually on a grander scale like

1213
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,727
I can't imagine how much

1214
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,287
F***** up stuff I would have said if I was famous it

1215
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
Or whatever

1216
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,871
I said really f***** up

1217
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,783
Right right

1218
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,575
Popstar

1219
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:44,927
Sing all the s*** that I imagined before your brain

1220
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,743
If you were in the public eye and people were

1221
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:51,839
You do demanding things of you and you had a rigorous schedule of performance

1222
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,399
Stuff like that it would be incredibly

1223
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,471
And ask for everything they say

1224
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,751
Celebrities

1225
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,775
When they

1226
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,591
It's not really a fair system for anybody

1227
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,639
Attention to what they say

1228
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
Celebrities

1229
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,455
Yeah

1230
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,015
If you are Alex

1231
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
Text Jones

1232
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
And you're like

1233
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
Batman

1234
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:15,391
I'm going to get to this huge important information

1235
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,415
But first

1236
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,767
Yeah

1237
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,327
It really takes away from your legitimate

1238
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,983
Teen Vogue spends less time on what Katy Perry says

1239
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,799
Add more time on the downfall of America

1240
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:40,223
Maybe you're behind Alex maybe you're the one who's not

1241
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,063
Because it's

1242
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,463
Very

1243
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,511
Absurd

1244
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,095
Yes you did

1245
01:01:56,351 --> 01:02:00,959
Did he bring back the new information with him

1246
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:08,383
I'm so angry right now

1247
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:13,503
Tomorrow

1248
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:22,719
I just can't believe

1249
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:29,119
Because I have a memory

1250
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,623
These people are evil and Evil

1251
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:58,303
He's been with over the weekend on the globalists for 20 years

1252
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,351
Still surprised

1253
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:03,423
You know what I just came to a revelation about the globalist

1254
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,215
I've been doing this 20 years

1255
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:11,615
You can go back through my entire catalog never said this before

1256
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,919
Revelation

1257
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,479
Never said this before in 20 years

1258
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,271
They know they're evil

1259
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:30,303
This eugenicist group technocrats you want to destroy the world and it

1260
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,911
Godzilla

1261
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,727
The Hideout in their armored redoubt

1262
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,263
They have no idea

1263
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,543
Yeah

1264
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,103
That's a perfect revelation

1265
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,407
Yes

1266
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,199
Revelation

1267
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:53,855
The Google thing is I've started to realize when he talks about how people have no memories what he's really

1268
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,671
Is people don't see the world in this

1269
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,463
Flawed prism the way I do

1270
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,511
That's really what he saying

1271
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,815
He's not saying that he remembers

1272
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,095
Because obviously.

1273
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:09,471
He remembers his cues and his fake stories

1274
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:13,823
And stuff like that that we describe and stuff like that

1275
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,103
He don't really

1276
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,639
He's not talking about memory

1277
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,919
He's talking about

1278
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,711
His flawed Conti

1279
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,759
Rudy's.

1280
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:24,831
Because

1281
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,623
Memory memes

1282
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,463
Why is he thinking

1283
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,999
His his his

1284
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,023
I remember in 20

1285
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:39,167
15 what I said and I forgot to take that recording down and so that I remember in 2017

1286
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:44,543
Complete opposite of that or even just go back to that side

1287
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,103
Do you know the nuclear sub that was in the news

1288
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:50,943
I remember that no you remember your bizarre

1289
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,711
Rotation of

1290
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,271
You don't

1291
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,831
You have

1292
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,367
A flawed narrative

1293
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,159
And you're pissed

1294
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,695
But other people are in on

1295
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,231
Okay

1296
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:06,303
He's mad that other people have memories of reality

1297
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,583
Not his universe

1298
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
That's very fast

1299
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,167
Very fast

1300
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,215
Big well because his

1301
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,007
I mean I guess

1302
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,287
I think I

1303
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,103
I think what I would

1304
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,127
See it as is

1305
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,199
When you say memory

1306
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,759
I think you talking about

1307
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,039
I think that's really what he

1308
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:31,135
It's like a computer on a higher

1309
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,463
He's got more

1310
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,767
Got more of that he's talking about memory loss

1311
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:41,119
Power interesting that's possible way that my brain process

1312
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,655
People don't have that many

1313
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,191
People don't have that ability

1314
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,751
Do I think he knows what Ram is

1315
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:51,871
No I think that's an interesting Theory I disagree

1316
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:56,479
I think you should know the definition of the word before I can give him

1317
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,503
Credit for

1318
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,319
Call I was calling

1319
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,623
Yeah ask him what he thinks memory is

1320
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,647
Anyway

1321
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:06,719
Do you realize that the globalist evil

1322
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,487
He just got

1323
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,911
These people are evil and Evil

1324
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,495
Controller psyop

1325
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,079
But the actual newspaper reporters

1326
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:27,711
Liberals are liars

1327
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,783
And they consciously

1328
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:52,031
So I've looked into this I looked into the David Gruber stuff

1329
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,079
Also

1330
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,615
If you were using that voice

1331
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,895
I would

1332
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,431
I probably think

1333
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,367
Yeah

1334
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,647
Night of analysis maca

1335
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,463
Uber is apparently

1336
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,023
Who helped work on Obamacare

1337
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,583
Okay

1338
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,655
I have made a couple of very unfortunate public statements

1339
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,447
That are easy to misinterpret

1340
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,311
The problem is people are stupid

1341
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:32,735
He should not have said that that is exactly what Alex says

1342
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
All day ever

1343
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:42,463
But the thing is the context of what he's talking about is that Obamacare would not be able to

1344
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,255
If they framed things

1345
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,071
I don't know it's not what Alex says though

1346
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:51,423
It's it's it's not like hey we fooled everyone it's more like

1347
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,471
Thankfully people

1348
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,007
Just look for buzzwords

1349
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:59,359
Right because we were able to get tax out of there

1350
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,919
As a legitimate part with the bill was

1351
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,223
We were able to move forward.

1352
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,783
Right cuz if they have

1353
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,063
Obamacare

1354
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,087
Tax

1355
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,623
Everybody

1356
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:14,975
Would have been like America no more taxes

1357
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:21,119
Videos about how sometimes government can't work with full transparency

1358
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,679
And it was again another unfortunate

1359
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,007
He was talking about again

1360
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:27,775
The same thing

1361
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,335
It's just sort of

1362
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,615
I mean

1363
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,151
Don't say that

1364
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:37,503
Yeah don't don't say it like that

1365
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,111
Say it's an unspoken thing that I think everybody in America kind of believes or it's like

1366
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,415
Or just from the pool

1367
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:47,743
Right if you look at polls and how they do that research

1368
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,511
The way you

1369
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,535
Rephrase the question

1370
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,351
Greatly influences the way people

1371
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:55,167
Totally

1372
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,447
Trying to say there is

1373
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,983
If we operate

1374
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
With full trance

1375
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,519
Parisienne

1376
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,799
Answer every question

1377
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,359
People are going to wind up seeing what

1378
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,127
They want to see

1379
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,151
And react

1380
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,967
Accordingly that's a big part of what is playing

1381
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
Is

1382
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,527
Put what in

1383
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:13,855
We think is important and what we think is the narrative out there

1384
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,391
That will allow us

1385
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,671
To operate

1386
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,439
People's best

1387
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,463
Yeah

1388
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,743
Like Obamacare

1389
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,047
All of its faults

1390
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,839
Is in people's best

1391
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,887
Totally

1392
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,703
Compare it to what the GOP is doing right now

1393
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,983
Exactly

1394
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,823
Of course that's what he's trying to say

1395
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,103
Yeah

1396
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,895
You however

1397
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:37,919
I have a memory

1398
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,943
Then

1399
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,223
You will look at that

1400
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,039
I like the Deep state

1401
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,903
Muslim

1402
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,183
Steps

1403
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,951
What's the weather

1404
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:54,559
And I got all the faculty

1405
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,167
Listen to Christ

1406
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,727
Olive

1407
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,943
They're so

1408
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:30,655
Attacks a guy with a cell phone

1409
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,543
What

1410
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:42,943
Bulshit

1411
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,295
Security folks try to assault

1412
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,215
Baskets that memo

1413
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,495
But

1414
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,823
So the thing with Corey Lewandowski just because this will be quick

1415
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
There's a video that you can watch

1416
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,127
Of the

1417
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,663
Assault that happened

1418
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:19,039
The lady who got assaulted was walking next to Trump

1419
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,879
And they were having a conversation

1420
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,671
I've been from behind Trump

1421
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,463
You can see Corey Lewandowski

1422
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,255
Grab her and pull her

1423
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:32,607
Not that she put her arm on him he pulled away

1424
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,631
Absolute

1425
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:38,751
Horseshit there's video of video evidence coming from behind and

1426
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,031
Obviously grabbing

1427
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,847
Or anything like that

1428
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,383
He pulled her

1429
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,407
L mean

1430
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,175
Like

1431
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,991
It's not insulting the same way that like

1432
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,783
Chickenshit out of somebody isn't assault

1433
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,063
But it's still real

1434
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:57,695
No so now onto the issue of the amount a situation

1435
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,975
Which is

1436
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:05,631
It's a Fox news reporter says that I'm going to run

1437
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,679
Trucking news

1438
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,959
Foxnews.com

1439
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:15,359
Keith and I arrived early to set up for the energy

1440
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,127
Rustic play

1441
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,735
Gen4 came into the room

1442
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,807
We exchanged pleasantries and made small talk about restaurants

1443
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,575
Bozeman

1444
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:28,671
During that conversation has been Jacobs of the Guardian

1445
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,207
Walked into the room with a voice

1446
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:34,047
Recorder

1447
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:38,399
Response to the newly released Congressional budget office report on the American Healthcare Act

1448
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,679
Gianforte

1449
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,215
You would get to him later

1450
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,751
Jacob's persisted with his quest

1451
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,823
Jennifer told him to talk to his press kaishain scam

1452
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:50,175
At that point gianforte

1453
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
With both hands

1454
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,735
And slammed him into the ground behind

1455
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:57,599
Faith Keith and I watched in disbelief as being Fort then began punching the reporter

1456
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,903
Sgtreport moved on top of Jacob

1457
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,975
He began yelling something to the effect of I'm sick and tired of it

1458
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:07,327
Jacob scramble to his knees and said something about his glasses being broken

1459
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,631
Deactivate Keith in myself for our name

1460
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,167
In shock we did not answer

1461
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,727
Jacob said that he wanted the police called

1462
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,751
And what to leave

1463
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:17,567
Gianforte looked at the three of us and repeatedly Apollo

1464
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:21,407
At that point I told him in Scanlon who is now present

1465
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,431
That we needed a Moana

1466
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,711
Samantha

1467
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:29,855
To be clear at no point did any of us who witness this assault see Jacob show any form

1468
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,879
A physical aggression

1469
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,903
Towards gianforte

1470
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,719
Who left the area after giving statements the local sheriff

1471
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:36,767
So

1472
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,535
That's what happened

1473
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,815
Based on

1474
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,607
Fox News

1475
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,655
Who witnessed the attack

1476
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,447
And they're still not going to believe it

1477
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:48,287
Audio

1478
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,055
Self-defense

1479
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,943
Propaganda Outlet

1480
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,479
Is not going to put up

1481
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,783
There's audio matches that

1482
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,807
Description of the events

1483
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,623
But these people are scums

1484
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,647
Their cattle

1485
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:06,975
You up

1486
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,279
Whenever they're like now

1487
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,047
What is the time

1488
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,095
F******.

1489
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,191
I can't

1490
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,727
People haven't

1491
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,287
Just depressed

1492
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
How do you not f***

1493
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,591
King pick that up

1494
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:26,431
If you're part of the press and it doesn't matter if you're the conservative alt right

1495
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,711
Press or whatever

1496
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:32,831
You don't want this president

1497
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,623
You don't want to be in Muslim

1498
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,415
Because eventually

1499
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,463
You're not going to be in power

1500
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:43,071
Empower maybe people will want to ban you

1501
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,375
Well it's how do you not f****** get the

1502
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:48,191
People don't understand like the idea of supervenience

1503
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:51,775
Supervenes on

1504
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,055
These attacks

1505
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,847
Against journalists

1506
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:57,663
Inspect their journalist

1507
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,967
Yeah that's that's what's behind it

1508
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:05,343
Reporters that are being attacked

1509
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,391
It is now okay to beat up journalist

1510
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,927
Journalist

1511
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,487
Yeah

1512
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:14,047
It's not about the money part of it although it is

1513
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,327
It's been a religion is

1514
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,887
Example of being targeted

1515
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:21,215
Is a really really dangerous president

1516
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,263
Because it doesn't just apply to once

1517
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,567
Situation we would have the same

1518
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:28,383
If it was all Buddhist

1519
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,151
Or speak

1520
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:33,503
Or even or even super Conservative Christian

1521
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:38,367
That wouldn't be okay no we would be against that in the same way that we met

1522
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,671
Clear on like the third episode

1523
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,951
First episode of the show

1524
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:46,047
But if Alex Jones ever really was being victimized

1525
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,839
For free speech issues

1526
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,631
We would be forced to defend him

1527
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,167
I would

1528
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,959
Hundred percent wood

1529
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,751
If he was being oppressed

1530
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,799
Based on Free Speech.

1531
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,823
Enemies

1532
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,895
Ever B

1533
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,687
Baytown free speech.

1534
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,223
Which to this day

1535
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,015
He has not yet no

1536
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,831
He has been depressed because he's a f******

1537
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,415
Wow

1538
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:18,815
Depression at that point so we've never called for him to be taken off the air

1539
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,351
There was never called for him to be

1540
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,143
Punished

1541
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,543
F****** idiot

1542
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,759
In stable condition in order of me

1543
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:40,831
I'm going to

1544
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,855
To just say f*** it

1545
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,903
Let's let Alex get to the picnic

1546
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:59,263
Easy listening

1547
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:09,247
He did this exact same thing like a

1548
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,807
Week ago when he was like

1549
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:14,367
He just kept using it throughout the entire show

1550
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,695
Never said what the news was but did the exact same Gamers like

1551
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:23,839
This is Dolphus clear any waited until Mike cernovich came on

1552
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,887
Mike cernovich gave some piece of

1553
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:29,471
Both big news

1554
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:32,543
Put the f****** stupid game episode

1555
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,567
I'm not just saying this

1556
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,335
To keep you here

1557
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,431
What you doing why would you say it

1558
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,271
It works it works

1559
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,319
So

1560
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,879
Well

1561
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:49,183
I don't know

1562
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,231
You just jostled it

1563
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,887
He doesn't

1564
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:08,383
I'm hungry I have to do that

1565
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:16,831
When I come back.

1566
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:23,231
Thank you all for your support with the Memorial Day special

1567
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,815
David personal Danger

1568
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:34,239
That ice I still didn't expect it to turn into a sales pitch I know that's what it all

1569
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:42,943
So I actually next life is titled Alex's endangered

1570
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,247
Doing

1571
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:49,343
But like I love now at this point in the show

1572
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,623
We're spinning plates

1573
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,159
Cuz now we got the memo

1574
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:52,927
Yeah,

1575
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:58,815
If it was just a big

1576
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,119
But now he's got two things you got to not do

1577
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:07,519
I don't remember.

1578
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:13,151
Break

1579
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,175
Before we do that

1580
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,503
Guys I just want to let you know that

1581
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,295
Only way I can thank you

1582
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,319
Is why

1583
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,087
You buying

1584
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,159
Iodine

1585
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:28,255
I don't know what I don't know Bertha's next clip

1586
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,279
Got to be good

1587
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:37,215
Titled Alex's freaked out in all caps

1588
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:43,615
Alex Jones

1589
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:48,735
Nick has been there like 5 years for years you never come in at Savannah you alright

1590
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,975
Devil worshippers

1591
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,959
They're going Muslims

1592
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,775
Somebody else

1593
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,456
Watch out

1594
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,064
Because

1595
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,624
Muslims kill millions of their own each year

1596
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
That's what he saying

1597
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Alright

1598
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,352
But you're just going to accept that

1599
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:41,472
What are you going to say just like

1600
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:44,544
Hey can we get can we get a number on that

1601
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:49,152
Just a number just Millions every year

1602
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,504
I mean you're not a journalist or anyting makes no sense

1603
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,624
3 million illegal in

1604
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,672
It's just not

1605
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,952
It's just not possible

1606
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,000
No but if you're if you're talking about like

1607
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:07,072
Collateral damages of wars and stuff

1608
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,096
You know where

1609
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:12,192
Facilitating and stuff like that

1610
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,472
4 year

1611
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,520
Five natural causes

1612
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,800
Oh

1613
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,104
To include that in there too

1614
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,944
All the people who died.

1615
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,480
Yeah then you got it

1616
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:30,880
And then throwing some more people who died they were probably secret Muslim so that counts to do know that

1617
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,696
I don't know

1618
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,488
I don't want

1619
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:37,792
Of

1620
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:40,352
Is s***

1621
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,888
Here's the deal

1622
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,168
Aliquot

1623
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:43,936
2

1624
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,496
Sick break

1625
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,520
From a lot of this stuff

1626
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,568
Doesn't want to get to the big news yet

1627
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,616
How many hours are we in

1628
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:56,224
Most of the ships

1629
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,040
You just have some thoughts about gender

1630
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:03,648
Thoughts about how toxic masculinity

1631
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,488
I really think Alex thanks but this isn't Ellen

1632
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,768
I think he thinks it's

1633
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:09,792
It borders on

1634
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
Scholarly

1635
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,584
It's matinee

1636
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:28,992
Against corrupt man

1637
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:35,648
And the reason we're in this position

1638
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:42,048
Call Davon

1639
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:48,960
Will roll over in a second

1640
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:58,432
I couldn't tell and I'm still not sure if or cock

1641
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:06,112
Yeah I think so too the first.

1642
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,648
What

1643
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,488
Who doesn't roll over when they got a cock in their face

1644
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:17,632
Turn the other cheek

1645
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:20,448
You take him outside telling the cash that check their p****

1646
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,264
That's something

1647
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,288
It's feel your hands

1648
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:30,944
Mouth writing checks your body can't cash

1649
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,480
You've already established that is a great

1650
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,368
He sounded more like he was being robbed

1651
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:49,632
Also because they're not real man and I'm sick of man not being man I'm tired of it

1652
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:55,008
Of course it when men don't act like men women

1653
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,288
And then

1654
01:23:57,056 --> 01:24:01,408
Play Kate and lower the drawbridge for the threatening group they see across the river

1655
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:07,040
Women don't have men around they will roll over to outside invading Force

1656
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:10,880
As a Stockholm syndrome survival mechanism

1657
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,744
So there are no men

1658
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:23,680
That's why I'm telling me to stop being shown

1659
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:27,520
And I'm going to be showing it that that

1660
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:31,872
Women roll over when they know you already

1661
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:37,760
Stop right there stop being men

1662
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,784
Right that's at 1

1663
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,928
End

1664
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:47,232
But they're Faking It

1665
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,816
Outside forces come in

1666
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,096
Who are real man

1667
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,888
Women will revert to their

1668
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,168
Feminine weakness

1669
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,240
And I roll over

1670
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:01,056
Because Western men are too busy being

1671
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,592
Or whatever

1672
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,384
It's this narrative is

1673
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:10,016
First of all it doesn't take into account all the matrilineal societies that it exists overtime

1674
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,552
Doesn't take into account like

1675
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,696
Anything other than his idea of what

1676
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:18,976
Should be

1677
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:21,536
That no no no no

1678
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:26,144
It's not even that

1679
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,704
There's but I think the driving forces

1680
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,728
He does not want to

1681
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,568
I think even

1682
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,592
Like I loved

1683
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,640
Determine you dropped on recent episode week

1684
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:41,248
I think he knows that this news is weak to

1685
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,696
Rescue people

1686
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,000
And to sort of solidify his base

1687
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,536
Because

1688
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,560
Of what I'm going to

1689
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
Explain in a minute

1690
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,120
But before we get to bed

1691
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:58,656
Gendered

1692
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,192
Definition of Whatta Man

1693
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,752
So damaged

1694
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,032
To just

1695
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:09,408
That is such a huge part of why Humanities a pile of garbage

1696
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:14,272
Is the fact that

1697
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,296
Communities online

1698
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:18,880
Especially men but you don't like that in real mayonnaise

1699
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:25,280
Between the age of 14 and 21 are the most dangerous and destructive force

1700
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,048
Humanity is

1701
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,840
Undoubtedly

1702
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,376
They are the cause of

1703
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:34,752
And Alex is there

1704
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,056
He's still that age but

1705
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,360
43

1706
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:43,712
What would I even call it like he's this he's this

1707
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:44,992
Town drunk

1708
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,552
That's that's to me what he is he

1709
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,576
He's the town drunk

1710
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,904
You go to at a bar and you're underage

1711
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:58,304
Can you go there in the town drunk starts dropping wisdom it's all wrong

1712
01:26:58,816 --> 01:26:59,328
He knows what

1713
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,448
I don't like you

1714
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,616
But then here's the twist

1715
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:16,224
Like maybe 5 minutes

1716
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,016
He pulled up in his coat and he's got pills

1717
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:21,344
That weird face kills the most

1718
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,928
Look up the show afloat

1719
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,208
Yeah

1720
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:32,096
Gypsies

1721
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:34,656
Look Alex is going to get too big

1722
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,936
Let's just do it

1723
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:46,176
That was a short clip

1724
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:51,552
Haven't gotten into those yet still not getting it back

1725
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:55,648
You can go to the big nose right

1726
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,928
We can't keep them both

1727
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:21,760
Every Christian every conservative is responsible

1728
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:28,672
Six months of bitching and moaning and screaming

1729
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,512
Blah blah blah

1730
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:38,912
Is very rare in this country

1731
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:42,752
Islam

1732
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,056
Dylann roof

1733
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,640
So just for fun

1734
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,920
I went to Stormfront

1735
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,224
Today

1736
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:57,088
Bored and it noon there were 1871 active users online

1737
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:57,856
At noon

1738
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:00,928
There are 324000

1739
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:04,256
314 registered members of the storm front

1740
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,792
Racist

1741
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:09,632
White nationalist soror

1742
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:16,800
A lot of people a lot of people who buy into that ideology wouldn't register because they know like now

1743
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:20,640
Hang on the list is probably at least double that who frequent the

1744
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,688
So I mean

1745
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,712
Sure

1746
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:26,016
A billion and a half dylann roof

1747
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:29,600
But there aren't a billion and a half radical Muslims either

1748
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,880
Dumbass

1749
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,648
Like

1750
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:38,048
600,000 is a very conservative estimate for people who buy into basically what is neo-Nazi

1751
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:38,816
Geology today

1752
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,352
Yep

1753
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:42,912
Way too many

1754
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,448
That's a huge

1755
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:47,520
Literally

1756
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,312
An army of Nazis

1757
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:51,616
In the United States

1758
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,480
Believable

1759
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,784
Jesus Christ ignore that

1760
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:02,368
Let's also ignore that multiple stabbing

1761
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,648
In Portland

1762
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,928
That was

1763
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,488
Because a guy defended

1764
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,792
Some women against racist

1765
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,584
Yelling

1766
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,376
Yeah

1767
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:16,704
And you know what if it was a right-winger who did it it would be a big story

1768
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,496
But it's still a big story

1769
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,288
You know what I mean like

1770
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:22,336
He's trying to say that like no one

1771
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:24,896
Covering are they aren't staying it was

1772
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,944
Like a Muslim who did it

1773
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,712
That's not

1774
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,480
True

1775
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:29,504
Not even close

1776
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:33,088
His version of reality is that no one talking about that

1777
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,368
People are talking

1778
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,672
Everybody

1779
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:37,696
Brought that up

1780
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,280
They're just not focusing on it and the way he wants them

1781
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:44,096
Yeah he wants them to focus in on like

1782
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:47,168
The fact it's the religion

1783
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,216
He wants them to

1784
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:49,984
She say

1785
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
It is not

1786
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,032
The guy

1787
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,312
It is the religion

1788
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,080
That killed all these

1789
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,896
He wants everything like this to be the last

1790
01:30:57,152 --> 01:31:00,224
Straw everyone wakes up

1791
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,272
It was Muslims all along

1792
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:03,808
Not

1793
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,600
That's not real

1794
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,368
But not

1795
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,904
True to reality

1796
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,440
I know we're not going to do that

1797
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,744
No one's going to do that

1798
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:15,072
Except for those 300,000 registered users

1799
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:19,168
Yep they're definitely going to do that also when I went to Stormfront accidentally

1800
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,192
I started looking around

1801
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:22,752
Yeah there's a horse

1802
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,080
Really funny

1803
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:27,872
Oh my God

1804
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:32,480
It's like what is a white nationalist lady wanting to man

1805
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:36,832
Wait is it like a dating advice

1806
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:41,440
It's not like a dating website like oh no

1807
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:45,024
Digiboard post whatever

1808
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,304
Discussion topics they want

1809
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,608
And the only one I read was what is a white National

1810
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,632
Lady w

1811
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:53,216
Hilarious

1812
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:01,408
And he has all this like you know what I'm trying build up my morale to

1813
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:03,456
The point where I think that I am far more

1814
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,992
Moral and upright

1815
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:07,040
Anybody in this even in the south

1816
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:12,160
Even in my in my conservative Community I'm still above them but

1817
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:12,928
But I realize

1818
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,952
That women want

1819
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,232
The guy whose heart

1820
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,280
It's always

1821
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:22,400
Get back to work on building up my hardness

1822
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,448
Whatever

1823
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:26,496
Supposed to do

1824
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:29,312
Looking for

1825
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,616
And then bunch of dudes pylons like

1826
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:38,016
Hey sounds like you're trying to mold yourself into what women want and no woman like that

1827
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:43,136
It's it was hilarious

1828
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,160
What

1829
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:48,000
So many of them seem to have that

1830
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:48,768
That

1831
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,816
That idea of like

1832
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,352
There's a secret

1833
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,912
If if I am in a situation

1834
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:58,240
All the men around me are reinforcing my

1835
01:32:59,264 --> 01:32:59,776
Shared belief

1836
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,824
Yeah then of course you would say

1837
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,872
All the women out there

1838
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,152
Are doing exactly the

1839
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:08,480
So you think in your small Stormfront

1840
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,016
Almond

1841
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:13,344
Everyone else is dumb

1842
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,624
Everybody else's

1843
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:20,512
No better man

1844
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:23,840
Through the race mixing allies

1845
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:26,912
Society gives up

1846
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:31,520
So then you have to assume that there is that equal and opposite

1847
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:34,080
To your little group there and you're trying to

1848
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,104
You figure out that

1849
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,384
And you can't

1850
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,152
4-H

1851
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:37,920
Second

1852
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,736
Imagine that women have AJ

1853
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,832
It seems like like what

1854
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,368
Here whenever I hear that is

1855
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,904
Women are

1856
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,672
Puzzle box

1857
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,952
Litter robot

1858
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,232
Right

1859
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:55,072
For every single woman and it works

1860
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:55,840
Every

1861
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,120
Singleton there's a magic

1862
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,424
No there's no

1863
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:03,008
Women have their own agency in our their own

1864
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,544
Individual

1865
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,360
Likes and dislikes

1866
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,920
There are white nationalist women

1867
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,456
And they will f*** you

1868
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:14,016
Yeah just got to be white nationalist

1869
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:18,880
Here's how you find

1870
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,416
Probably you

1871
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:27,840
Let me change that

1872
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,888
You know what white nationalist women want

1873
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,448
Black dudes

1874
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:36,032
Buying into the whole narrative now

1875
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:40,384
It's always talks about

1876
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,944
Get a trump Pence 2020 shirt

1877
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,504
Get a Maga hat

1878
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,296
And you'll meet like-minded people

1879
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,832
He's not wrong

1880
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:49,600
No he's not

1881
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,880
That is how you mean

1882
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:52,160
If you're a weirdo

1883
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,952
Get Infowars shirts

1884
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:57,024
And you wear it out in public a lot of people are going to ignore you

1885
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,328
A lot of people are going to laugh at you

1886
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,864
But then there's a small group

1887
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:05,216
Who are going to respond

1888
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,776
You will find like-minded people

1889
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,800
You just found Alex

1890
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:11,104
Way better selfish for that

1891
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,920
Trump

1892
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:16,480
And you'll get laid get laid from a weirdo

1893
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:19,808
Will get laid by someone just as weird as you

1894
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:32,352
It's caused this to happen

1895
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,960
What does the fox say

1896
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:39,520
I will cherish

1897
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,944
2uz Terror attacks to take our liberties

1898
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:52,320
Is not under

1899
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:55,648
Do I just love that going out to break

1900
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:57,184
I'm Alex Jones

1901
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:01,792
What big

1902
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,096
Good

1903
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,656
Stomach ulcer

1904
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:09,216
This memo he's been teasing and playing with on the mic

1905
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,520
For this entire episode was on it

1906
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,800
One of them was

1907
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:19,200
Hey babe

1908
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:29,952
Assistance

1909
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:36,352
Weird very weird

1910
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:38,656
Hey

1911
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,704
You been preparing all weekend

1912
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:50,176
Not because

1913
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:50,944
Pretty distant

1914
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:54,016
Isaac Neko

1915
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:57,344
Also could be Nico from The Velvet Underground

1916
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,136
Koneko

1917
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,464
Bright

1918
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:04,256
Misquoting

1919
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,536
The thing that I

1920
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,304
The things that

1921
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,840
I think he really does believe

1922
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,912
That so

1923
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:13,728
So the argument for it is the right wing spot

1924
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,752
Terrorism

1925
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,776
Is the right one

1926
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,824
That's the way it is

1927
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:21,920
Because of the way that they are inflamed

1928
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:24,736
The boy

1929
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,016
Murder

1930
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:30,112
The murder large groups

1931
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,904
The more likely you are to

1932
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,672
Create

1933
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:39,072
Terrorist I'm at Democrats when they say that it's just

1934
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:42,912
Totally

1935
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,984
Fanning those flames of Muslim hating of

1936
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,264
Doing all of this stuff

1937
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:51,104
Is only going to create equal and opposite reaction on the other side

1938
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
Connect to him when he hears

1939
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,200
It's the right

1940
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:56,736
He thinks

1941
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:57,760
That they're saying

1942
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,296
The right

1943
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:01,344
Right

1944
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,136
They're saying is he thinks

1945
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:03,904
That attacks

1946
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,184
Actually right wing

1947
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,976
People

1948
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:09,792
Committing

1949
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,864
Right-wing people are committing terrorist

1950
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,144
Pensacola

1951
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,192
Possible that you saying that

1952
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:20,032
Say it possible I don't know

1953
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,080
Weird

1954
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:22,848
What do you say false

1955
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:23,616
Flags

1956
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:28,480
False flag

1957
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,248
He believes that

1958
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,552
Because he can't imagine

1959
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:34,112
The idea of something being a

1960
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,392
Structural

1961
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:43,328
To being a literal understand complex systems

1962
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,376
Leasing false-flag he means

1963
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,912
Not that

1964
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:47,936
The right

1965
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:50,496
Is involved necessarily but it's the globalist

1966
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,544
Who have done this

1967
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:55,360
They goaded this person into doing it

1968
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:57,408
Or the Patsy or something like that

1969
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,944
In order to try

1970
01:38:59,200 --> 01:38:59,712
And Spark

1971
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,272
Race War I don't know

1972
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,392
Dude

1973
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:11,232
Have a goddamn big news

1974
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:19,936
He does but first you have to explain that Jerome corsi has set up a Deadman

1975
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:28,640
Like if you're out there and you're listening to Infowars on Thursday and you think that you're going to stop this information getting out by killing corsi

1976
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,664
F****** wrong

1977
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:32,224
Pax West

1978
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,504
Or less

1979
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:39,136
Okay

1980
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:41,440
Contacted me this morning

1981
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:46,560
To say that if he gets killed

1982
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:49,120
Anytime before next Tuesday

1983
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,192
Authorized

1984
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:54,496
Broadcast

1985
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:57,056
Contact a certain

1986
01:39:57,568 --> 01:40:01,152
US representative in the capital and I'll leave it there

1987
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:02,688

1988
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,480
Is Italy that there

1989
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:05,760
I do like

1990
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:07,808
He's finally swinging his dick around on course

1991
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:14,720
Like we told him to finally like

1992
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:21,120
White House press credentials

1993
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:25,984
Alex knows

1994
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,008
The senator

1995
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:29,056
Congressperson whatever

1996
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:33,408
We'll leave it at that

1997
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,456
I was going to leave with that

1998
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,040
Chase course he dies

1999
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:43,392
Why wouldn't you have contacted

2000
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:44,160
Him already

2001
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,256
For just a sec

2002
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,024
Okay

2003
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:49,792
What could

2004
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,072
Possibly Saturday

2005
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:53,120
All of the needs of this

2006
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:53,888
Story

2007
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,680
A lot

2008
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:57,216
Propaganda

2009
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:00,288
It's got to be like if this is

2010
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,080
Entertain this

2011
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:04,128
Okay OK Google if it's not

2012
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:07,200
All of this

2013
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:13,600
All the requirements

2014
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:18,208
What satisfies all the requirements of this story

2015
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,024
You can't wait for this information to drop till 2

2016
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:25,120
Figure out anything that could actually be

2017
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:26,912
That would make sense

2018
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,312
Okay person in the house

2019
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,872
Is going to flee the country on Monday

2020
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:42,272
Oh there we go tickets plane tickets are nonrefundable

2021
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:46,112
But he can't move them up and get out of the country before then

2022
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:49,440
But once he's out of the country course he is free to speak

2023
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:52,000
He's gone Underground

2024
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,024
So then if

2025
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:57,120
If course he gets murdered

2026
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:57,888
NE moves

2027
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:58,656
Light up

2028
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,960
No. Of course he gets killed

2029
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:04,800
You don't call that guy at all that guy's not answering your phone

2030
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:07,616
That's going to give you a

2031
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,152
That's going to

2032
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:15,552
The congressperson

2033
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:24,768
So I can take a look at that

2034
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,304
If all this is

2035
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,072
Is true

2036
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,864
Course he has given up his sword

2037
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,680
Which I don't know if

2038
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:35,264
That's a bad idea Trump Sons know

2039
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:41,408
He's going to have to apologize about it later

2040
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:49,088
I don't know it's really hard to get myself in this headspace cuz I know it's all full of s***

2041
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,880
You don't

2042
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,160
Is

2043
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:53,952
What information

2044
01:42:55,488 --> 01:43:01,632
I know I know what the narrative is going to be so I don't

2045
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:03,424
I don't want to speculate but I'd love

2046
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,960
See what you think

2047
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:08,544
What do you think was worth killing Kursi over

2048
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:09,568
Okay

2049
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,360
Corsi

2050
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:13,664
Has information from the

2051
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,200
Member of the House

2052
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:15,968
Yes

2053
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,760
High levels high levels

2054
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:18,784
Okay

2055
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,320
Who's killing him

2056
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:22,880
The people who the information is about

2057
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,256
Call it Hillary you are a witch

2058
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:30,816
Doesn't matter I don't want to put this to succinct

2059
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:36,192
Duh

2060
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:38,240
Like

2061
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:40,032
Boots world

2062
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:44,128
Well we should find a reasonable

2063
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,784
Take the global

2064
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:52,064
Totally

2065
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,856
Write a little exposed

2066
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:56,928
To get rid of course

2067
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:57,696
Destroy them all

2068
01:43:59,232 --> 01:43:59,744
What is

2069
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:01,792
And why wait till Tuesday

2070
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:02,816
Again

2071
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,584
The flight

2072
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:05,120
Move your flight up

2073
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:07,424
It was good pricing for Memorial Day

2074
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:17,920
You got a Groupon right that's really what happened

2075
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:25,600
Real spy movie

2076
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:32,256
Can people with

2077
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:35,840
Understand how serious this is

2078
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:36,864
Very serious

2079
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,144
That is why we laugh

2080
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:40,960
I know

2081
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:45,056
For confronting you a little bit more about to get to the big news and then Alex

2082
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:50,176
You're just as bad as Alex on this

2083
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:54,016
Here here

2084
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,808
The first pizza

2085
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,856
Big news is this next clip

2086
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,416
What's the spoiler

2087
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:02,208
The next clip after this

2088
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,512
Is what I've been to

2089
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:05,792
Episode

2090
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:06,816
Which is what I think

2091
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:09,120
This is all about okay

2092
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:12,192
This isn't the end of the episode

2093
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:16,288
But I think we can figure out what's real and what's not in the next 2 clips

2094
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,568
Here's the first one

2095
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,336
This is Alex

2096
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,872
Doesn't have any

2097
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:20,640
Things to do at the big

2098
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:27,808
You're going to be working here a long time my friend cuz this is a real name

2099
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:30,112
Other Democrats and others to know

2100
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,672
Seth Rich had been executed

2101
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:37,024
The news wanted to come out but none of the stuff was stolen

2102
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:40,352
Was appointed by Obama

2103
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:48,544
Artistic people including children

2104
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:59,552
He's got major confirmed

2105
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:02,624
He doesn't

2106
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:05,696
Course he has

2107
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:11,840
Seth rich

2108
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:17,472
Of course I have a bunch of people who weird connections and none of it

2109
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:19,520
None of it's really based on anything real

2110
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:21,824
A bunch of post on my computer

2111
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,848
He blogs and stuff

2112
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:27,712
This is

2113
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:30,528
Pacifica convoluted and I don't fully understand

2114
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,344
Yeah all of their understand is hopefully hand

2115
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:38,464
Just to be clear

2116
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,744
Like

2117
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,536
There's a bunch of new stuff

2118
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:42,816
From flying around

2119
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:44,096
About the Seth rich

2120
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,376
Situation

2121
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,936
I would like to everyone

2122
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,704
2

2123
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:51,520
Like

2124
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,824
Really look at what people are saying

2125
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,872
I'm not I'm not saying that if you believe that

2126
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:57,408
Conspiracy you belong in hell

2127
01:46:57,664 --> 01:47:00,224
Like some folks I'm not going to go that far

2128
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,528
But when you hear something like

2129
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:04,320
Evil angel with Jason

2130
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,624
You block an apartment on the outskirts

2131
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:10,464
I think that it's really important

2132
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,000
Whenever you're

2133
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,792
Looking at a piece of news or some

2134
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,608
Conspiracy theory propaganda nonsense

2135
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:17,888
Becomes flying in your face

2136
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:19,168
Really take a look at the men

2137
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:22,240
What shirt literally take a look at what's being said

2138
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:28,640
The things that keep popping up now the new version of it and I think Alex is going to get to it eventually

2139
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:31,456
I'm sure this is part of what course is going to go over

2140
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,992
Is that Donna brazile

2141
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:35,040
Member of the DNC

2142
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:36,576
Architect

2143
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:37,856
I recall her

2144
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:40,928
For like delivering

2145
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:42,976
Got questions

2146
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:45,792
After just after

2147
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,168
Do that

2148
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:54,240
I don't defend

2149
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:55,520
I'm not here to back that up

2150
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:58,848
So apparently I'm a little bit after Seth rich

2151
01:47:59,104 --> 01:47:59,872
Was killed

2152
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:01,664
She

2153
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,992
Asked the private investigator why he was snooping

2154
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:05,760
Around

2155
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:08,576
That's the phrase that use on like WorldNetDaily

2156
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:09,600
At least Titan

2157
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:12,928
Real-life spy movie there's something going on

2158
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:14,976
The reality is at the time

2159
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:19,072
There was an investigation going on by the police by the actual official folks

2160
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:22,912
Investigator in question is the guy who has

2161
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:24,192
Impeached himself

2162
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:28,544
On National Television. The last episode

2163
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,360
Evidence

2164
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:34,432
That's that rich wasn't communication with WikiLeaks

2165
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:38,272
Redman when he was interviewed about it later said that he got that information from Fox News

2166
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,808
Reporters exactly

2167
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:41,344
I fed him his own

2168
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:48,000
He is not a guy with any real credibility and the Brazil would have been

2169
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:50,560
There's an actual investigation going on

2170
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:53,376
Isn't really any evidence of a cover-up

2171
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,400
It is nothing

2172
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:56,192
People are spinning it as it is

2173
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:59,008
Now it could the question could literally have been like

2174
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,288
Hey what are you doing

2175
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:04,128
Right-wing like what are you doing

2176
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:04,896
I'm

2177
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:07,968
I'm certain that some of that will be incorporated into

2178
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,272
Jerome corsi reporting

2179
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,600
The other thing that Hamby has been pushing

2180
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:16,928
I've gotten some traction online is

2181
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:18,208
Kim.com

2182
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:24,352
The guy who created Megaupload

2183
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,424
Years been trying to destroy Hillary Clinton

2184
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,960
Because he believes that

2185
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:34,080
She is responsible for a lot of his falls from Grace which are not accurate that's not an accurate depiction

2186
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:36,896
But you have to find

2187
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,664
Escape goat

2188
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,432
Hillary is hell

2189
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,480
A a lot of people

2190
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:41,504
Totally

2191
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,040
Larry Nichols

2192
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,832
Walmart.com

2193
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:47,392
So Tom has been saying

2194
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,928
He has definitive proof

2195
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:50,464
That there was emails

2196
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,232
Between

2197
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:52,000
Seth rich

2198
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:55,584
And I'm sure when he was pressed

2199
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:56,864
Bye Hannity

2200
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:58,912
He freely gave all that information

2201
01:49:59,168 --> 01:49:59,680
Proved it to

2202
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:08,640
Later he gave the date is Tuesday as the day that he was going to do that

2203
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:13,760
Happen is the evil and Alex parents

2204
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,296
I'm out

2205
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:17,600
They put out a statement

2206
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:20,160
Kim.com tried to hack

2207
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,440
Seth riches email

2208
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:25,536
They got it in

2209
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:27,072
Seth Rich Dad

2210
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:29,120
Still has access to his email account

2211
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:31,680
Any monitors at 4

2212
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:34,240
He

2213
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,008
Last week

2214
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:36,032
Email

2215
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:42,432
From Megaupload. Envy or whatever Megalo. Enzi

2216
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:43,200
Problem

2217
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:44,736
It was an invitation

2218
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,784
To join it was clearly a fishing at

2219
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,320
So

2220
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:53,696
Well I mean that did work for the DNC

2221
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,512
It also

2222
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:58,560
Wow also there

2223
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:02,144
So basically he was trying to hack the email so he could plan emails

2224
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,192
That's obviously what was going on

2225
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:06,496
If that would have been his bombshell proof

2226
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:08,288
30

2227
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,592
Yeah he has

2228
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:13,152
Fabricated emails and evidence in the past

2229
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:16,992
He has a real bad and is

2230
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:18,016
Notorious hacker

2231
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,040
So

2232
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:20,320
This stuff

2233
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:21,856
Not that great

2234
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:26,208
One apparently uploaded pretty cool

2235
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:32,096
That stuff is coming out

2236
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:33,632
Are all bulshit

2237
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:34,656
And attempt

2238
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:35,936
By people who are pushing

2239
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,728
In the story to fabricate stuff

2240
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:39,520
To back up the story

2241
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,568
Right which one you're doing that

2242
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:43,360
You're not interested in the truth

2243
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,896
You're interested in pushing this

2244
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,688
To deflect from something else

2245
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:48,736
Exact I bet something else

2246
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:50,272
In the case of people

2247
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,808
Like kim.com

2248
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,112
People like Hannity is that

2249
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:55,904
The walls are closing in on the Trump

2250
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:56,928
Theme

2251
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,000
Sticky pickle

2252
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:01,024
Sticky Wicket

2253
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,048
Whatever

2254
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:04,352
They keep getting out of these really tight situation

2255
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:06,400
Going to run out

2256
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:08,704
Hopefully one of these things is going to stick

2257
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:11,008
Might be this f****** Kushner

2258
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,288
With the back Chan

2259
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,824
Hopefully hopefully

2260
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:17,408
But they know that and that's why they're pushing the Seth Rich s*** so hard

2261
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,968
It's undignified

2262
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,992
It's disgraceful

2263
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:22,784
Putting his family through a lot of s***

2264
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,600
Yeah it's very bad to sacrifice their willing

2265
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:30,976
Somebody else's family who they don't care about Rodger Stone

2266
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:33,024
Give you what you think is a fake

2267
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:33,792
Conspiracy theory

2268
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:37,632
Why wouldn't you give them their own medicine back

2269
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:39,168
Corsi style exactly

2270
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:42,752
The thing is like Rodger Stone even tweeted that like

2271
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,664
The family of Seth Rich deserve privacy but the American people deserve truth more

2272
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:56,064
Oh yeah Rodger Stone

2273
01:52:56,320 --> 01:53:02,208
Regret that,

2274
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:07,584
Situation

2275
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,888
I just imagined that all of the

2276
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:10,912
These guys wind up in

2277
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,448
Ecuadorian a

2278
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:21,664
One of these things

2279
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,688
So

2280
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:26,528
And why not the goat about Saddam Hussein

2281
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:34,464
He keeps trying to be nice to them but they take it as an attack

2282
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:39,328
Alex Alex I just can't wait for the

2283
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:41,120
The episode where they put tape

2284
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,656
On the floor

2285
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:49,056
Suicide but there's eight of them so they all get like a Foursquare

2286
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:50,848
He's going to try and go to the room

2287
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:56,480
The best geometric way to maximize their state

2288
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:59,296
Here we go

2289
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:02,880
We can talk about Hannity and I believe over the course

2290
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:03,648
So this clip

2291
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,416
Alex

2292
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,952
Shows his cards

2293
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:08,000
We get a glimpse at

2294
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:09,792
He's pushing this

2295
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:11,072
Stream narrative

2296
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:13,888
Giving you the Tuesday to look forward to

2297
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:15,680
Really trying to wrap things up

2298
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:16,960
In here

2299
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:20,544
Shawn Kemp

2300
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,200
Snl43

2301
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:41,536
The Civil War

2302
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,616
What are pulling Sean Hannity off the

2303
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,664
Send a message

2304
01:54:58,688 --> 01:55:04,320
That's not why they all well

2305
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:09,184
Limbaugh's not hit the country

2306
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:15,584
Religious freedom

2307
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:21,472
Other religions

2308
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,408
Everything's going through

2309
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:36,832
That's why I asked our Affiliates to stay with us and support us

2310
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:39,392
Continental Deli

2311
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:45,792
Corporate sponsors

2312
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:52,192
Advertiser

2313
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:01,920
That's on you

2314
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,944
That's on you

2315
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:06,016
These Bakery things you've got to defend us from this attack

2316
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,552
So

2317
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:08,320
Alex

2318
01:56:08,576 --> 01:56:10,880
Drops a little bit later in the episode

2319
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:12,672
Cut it out because

2320
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:14,720
I lost track of where was the episode

2321
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:17,536
But he says that they've lost like in the last week something likes

2322
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:18,560
Teen affiliate

2323
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:21,632
This is about

2324
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,400
Exactly what this

2325
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:24,192
This is the best 100% what this is about

2326
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,520
A bunch of other stuff that I cut out from this episode cuz I don't

2327
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:33,920
Is Alex bragging about how great Infowars coverage is

2328
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:36,992
All the time he's trying to shore up his credibility

2329
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:38,784
Epi same time as he's creating this

2330
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:40,064
Fantastical narrative

2331
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:44,160
Edward Burns

2332
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:47,488
Break the story that's bigger than water

2333
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:48,768
At the same time

2334
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:55,168
Let's spend about 10 minutes on this episode interviewing Billy Weaver about how she unmasked a member of antifa

2335
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:58,752
They didn't do this interview at throughout the course of it

2336
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:00,288
What you learn

2337
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,824
Is that Millie Weaver

2338
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,640
Was just repeating things she read on Fortune

2339
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:06,176
No

2340
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:09,504
So they're like we got this right

2341
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:16,928
When they actually play the report

2342
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:23,328
Illegal Tender

2343
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:26,912
Stand for Chad at all

2344
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:28,704
Do not answer I mean like

2345
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,472
Sure

2346
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:32,800
Great think I want Rainbow Brite

2347
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:35,360
Rainbow snatch

2348
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:41,760
Rainbow sash for the insult

2349
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:45,088
Alex Alex the end of the road

2350
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:47,648
The the thing that he said

2351
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:48,928
Which

2352
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,720
Like for the longest time

2353
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:53,024
Continuing

2354
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,304
To make it a fight

2355
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:55,328
You know like

2356
01:57:55,840 --> 01:58:00,192
Even though we won theirs done with Hillary

2357
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:01,216
They have to do that

2358
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:03,520
But the fact that he said right then

2359
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:04,544
We didn't

2360
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:10,176
Yeah that's what they look like before the ground

2361
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:10,944
For that disc

2362
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:17,344
Before

2363
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:22,208
Totally new rhetorically

2364
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:24,000
But it does sound good

2365
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,280
It sounds great

2366
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:27,584
In space

2367
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:30,656
When we got Trump elected

2368
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:32,192
Is turning into

2369
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:37,056
This is created way more issues

2370
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:43,456
That I think is important to bring into this conversation because it's absolutely

2371
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:46,016
Nuclear base on Alex's own words that they're losing

2372
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:47,296
Affiliates

2373
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:51,904
And he doesn't make money from affiliating the shower for syndication

2374
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,440
But at the same time

2375
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:59,584
Thousands of years to all these long commercials on his phone so that's going to cut

2376
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,864
Deep into

2377
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,632
His

2378
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:02,656
His profits

2379
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:04,704
He says like 15 or 20

2380
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,728
I have left

2381
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,008
And it's not

2382
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:08,800
It's not the small town

2383
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:12,640
Probably.

2384
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:14,432
Arkansas

2385
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:20,320
We went over all the tiny markets on our lifetime

2386
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:23,136
Dropping are the only ones who have

2387
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:24,416
Any like advertised

2388
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:29,792
And any liberal audiences that are like the radio

2389
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:33,376
Probably true and then also

2390
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:37,984
He's replaced super fast and loose about the number of

2391
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:41,312
Estimated is like 9

2392
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:42,592
95 or something

2393
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:48,992
The only concrete numbers we can get from Genesis Communications Network which indicates a show was it

2394
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:51,296
They had like 85 2015

2395
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:53,856
He claims that we keep

2396
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:57,952
But now some people can't be caught up

2397
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:03,328
He claims he had to listen to the radio are not being kept

2398
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,096
In the dark about

2399
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:05,376
He claimed he had like

2400
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,400
200

2401
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:08,704
20 or something like that before this

2402
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,472
False

2403
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:11,520
But I don't believe that number

2404
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:14,592
Doesn't have 48

2405
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,128
You know

2406
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:19,456
And that brings us to the other part of what I think this is really about

2407
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:21,504
Story broke

2408
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,528
Vanity Fair

2409
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:24,320
At the end of last week

2410
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:26,112
That was about Breitbart

2411
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,904
Yeah

2412
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:30,464
Overnight

2413
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:35,840
Breitbart's traffic shot up precipitously to the point where they were like

2414
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:38,656
The 26th most visited website in the world

2415
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:39,680
Around

2416
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:41,984
Jr around December of last

2417
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:43,520
2060

2418
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:46,848
It stayed up around there and then drop

2419
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:47,616
Hard

2420
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:50,432
Drop

2421
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,712
50% down

2422
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:52,992
Which

2423
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:53,760
Costume

2424
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:56,576
And if you could

2425
02:00:56,832 --> 02:01:02,976
Other

2426
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:09,376
But going down also not the same like

2427
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:15,008
Of course there's going to be that slow slide as they reality further

2428
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:18,848
Like if you are at all interested in the

2429
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:19,616
Trump store

2430
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:21,408
Even if you support Trump

2431
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,944
You can't go to Fox

2432
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:24,480
Snow

2433
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,248
About it

2434
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:27,552
. so the only way for you to keep

2435
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:29,856
Keep abreast of what's going on

2436
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:31,904
There is by watching those

2437
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,720
I think it's not even of course traffic

2438
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:36,768
Conservative b******* is going to go down

2439
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:37,536
If there's a

2440
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:39,584
That is

2441
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:40,608
An algorithm

2442
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:45,728
Totally

2443
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:47,264
Which we've explored in the past

2444
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,104
Traffic

2445
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:54,944
Just excites make leaves for like advertising and ship

2446
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:57,248
And they

2447
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:59,296
Very fair reached out to

2448
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:01,088
The Alexa people

2449
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:03,136
You're asking for

2450
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,696
And the person that they talked to it quote

2451
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:10,048
Now but it's

2452
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:11,328
That there is

2453
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:14,144
There's certified

2454
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:14,912
Statistics

2455
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:19,776
I went to run a website you can turn off that certified

2456
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:21,568
That point

2457
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:22,592
They don't know if it

2458
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:23,360
It's real

2459
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:24,640
Website or not

2460
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:26,432
Apparently

2461
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:27,456
That stretch

2462
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:31,296
Was a. Of time but we're Breitbart had opted out of the certified

2463
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:32,832
And then they are

2464
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:34,624
Probably

2465
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:38,720
The article mentions

2466
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:41,536
The time. Where they were opted out

2467
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:42,560
Choose up

2468
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:43,840
Perfectly with

2469
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:44,608
The op

2470
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:46,144
Right

2471
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:49,472
Which

2472
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:51,264
Foremost website

2473
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:59,456
If you opt out of certified

2474
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:02,272
You're probably going to see an uptick of

2475
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:06,624
What you thought was what you think is traffic

2476
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:09,184
Crawlers and come

2477
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:12,768
Go through there and trolls around like that kind of

2478
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:16,096
What are used to run a Blog

2479
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:17,632
And there would be comment

2480
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:18,400
That would cut

2481
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:20,704
Italy come from advertising

2482
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:24,032
Things that'll artificially inflate

2483
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:24,800
Course

2484
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:26,336
So I think Alex

2485
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:27,360
Nose

2486
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:28,128
About that

2487
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:29,664
And has known about that

2488
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:30,688
And the fact

2489
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,528
They knew that breitbart's traffic a drop

2490
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:35,552
Before that

2491
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:37,856
Yeah

2492
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:39,648
And there's a decent chance that Alex

2493
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:42,720
There's these people knew that

2494
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:46,560
There isn't there is a triangulation of right-wing media

2495
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:49,120
That is garage up top Alex Jones

2496
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:51,936
And Breitbart

2497
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:52,704
Pyramid scheme

2498
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:54,496
Yeah

2499
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:57,056
Like they all feed into each other to stomach

2500
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:59,872
Like cross pollination

2501
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:02,944
Directly between Breitbart

2502
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,736
Westerly promote each other's s***

2503
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:07,296
But they still play in the same Kitty pool

2504
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:09,344
That involves sucking up to drive

2505
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:11,392
So if there's something there

2506
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:13,952
Half of the traffic has dropped

2507
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:15,488
Breitbart

2508
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:16,512
Overnight

2509
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:18,560
There's no f****** way out its doesn't know about

2510
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:20,352
Rat

2511
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,680
Cuz we don't know

2512
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:25,216
From the statistics

2513
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:26,240
Bets are on

2514
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:28,288
Alexa we don't know if

2515
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:29,312
His traffic

2516
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:30,592
Is

2517
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:31,360
Certified

2518
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:32,384
We don't know that

2519
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,664
We can probably assume

2520
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:35,712
But we don't

2521
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:36,480
To assume it's

2522
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,320
But Woodland

2523
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:41,088
HDMI

2524
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:41,856
A suspicion that

2525
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:44,160
You are the only person

2526
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:49,280
It's trending downward certainly traffic to traffic

2527
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:50,560
Sorry I mean

2528
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,608
I just I can't

2529
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:54,656
I can't believe a scenario wherein

2530
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:56,704
Like Alex doesn't see

2531
02:04:57,216 --> 02:05:00,032
This Vanity Fair article as a real warning

2532
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:02,592
Like a real dangerous sign

2533
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:03,616
He could either

2534
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:05,152
Be the Keno's

2535
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:07,712
Because bulshit

2536
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:09,248
That's about to come out and do the Oppa

2537
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,784
That's one possibility

2538
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:12,832
The other possibility is

2539
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:14,112
Oh s***

2540
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:16,160
This ideology that

2541
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,184
Weave

2542
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:18,208
Albany

2543
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:19,232
Backing isn't

2544
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:23,072
The popular as I thought it was could just be like

2545
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:26,400
S***

2546
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:28,192
They were Faking It All Along

2547
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:30,240
Call

2548
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:31,776
God

2549
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:33,568
So much of my

2550
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:39,968
So much of my believing in Trump

2551
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:41,504
He could ever

2552
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:42,784
He could

2553
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:43,552
Never

2554
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:44,832
Ever admit that

2555
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,648
But that doesn't mean you can't feel it

2556
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:52,256
Even if he doesn't admit it it doesn't mean that it's not somewhere buried deep down

2557
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:53,792
That combine

2558
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:54,560
With

2559
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:55,584
Very

2560
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:56,352
Real

2561
02:05:56,864 --> 02:05:59,424
Self-admitted losing a ton of affiliate

2562
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:03,264
It's not like that's going to stop bleeding is not going to stop right

2563
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,288
He knows

2564
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:05,312
I am

2565
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,336
Fuct

2566
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:08,128
I am so f*****

2567
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,920
At at the same time

2568
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:11,712
Is Russia is going down

2569
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:12,736
It's just

2570
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:13,504
So bad

2571
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:15,040
Everything is falling apart

2572
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:16,064
The chips

2573
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:17,344
Fart

2574
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:19,392
There's a table

2575
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:20,672
He's at the poker table

2576
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:22,208
Got like one chip left

2577
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,256
Are the guys going to force them all in

2578
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:25,792
That is where he's at

2579
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:27,840
Yeah he's got a chip in a chair

2580
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:28,608
He's got a hole

2581
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:30,912
But he is not looking good

2582
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:32,448
How does this

2583
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:33,472
Batman what

2584
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:36,800
What is

2585
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:37,824
What does

2586
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:40,896
Like murdering Jerome corsi

2587
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:46,016
To the god of traffic

2588
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:48,320
I just

2589
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:52,672
It's the same thing for it's the same thing for all of these guys right

2590
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,208
It seems like what

2591
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:56,512
What's really being revealed is that

2592
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,048
The

2593
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:59,584
Conservative consciousness

2594
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:00,864
Is

2595
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:02,656
Payless popular

2596
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:03,424
Then it

2597
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,192
It's given

2598
02:07:04,704 --> 02:07:05,728
Attention

2599
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:07,776
Big time

2600
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:14,176
So a lot of emails fundraising with a 48% approval rating where he's like

2601
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:18,528
Yeah

2602
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:21,856
No just like we talked about with the Twitter bot

2603
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:23,136
Where

2604
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:24,672
What their job is

2605
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,720
Amplify this stuff

2606
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:29,536
Midget

2607
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:32,864
Popularity

2608
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:35,936
Push it

2609
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:36,704
High up is it

2610
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:39,264
And that makes you and I think

2611
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:42,848
This is a far more popular far larger movement

2612
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,384
Then what we would

2613
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:46,176
Expect

2614
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:48,224
Like if everybody actually knew that

2615
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:50,272
All of these guys were really just

2616
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:51,552
Marginalized

2617
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:53,088
Had a very small group of P

2618
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:53,856
People

2619
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:55,392
We would be paying a bunch of

2620
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,464
I would still pay attention to Alex's class

2621
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:01,280
I don't mean the culture at Large

2622
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:04,608
Yeah why would you be reporting on what Breitbart

2623
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:05,632
If it's

2624
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,472
300000 bucks from store

2625
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:11,008
Stormfront isn't on

2626
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:13,056
Isn't being reported isn't being

2627
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:16,640
Manipulated and and put into the larger

2628
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:21,248
No not really is just

2629
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,272
Stormfront

2630
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:23,552
Like just

2631
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:25,088
Leave it alone ignore it

2632
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:28,160
Yeah now it's probably going to Fester the same way that

2633
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:29,440
Stormfront and all that s***

2634
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:33,792
And marginalizing them will probably only make them more violent

2635
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:36,608
Who cares

2636
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:37,888
There's not a lot of

2637
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:41,216
So if there's not a lot of them

2638
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:46,336
Then those conservatives in Congress and all of those people you see that

2639
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:49,152
As transparent as the voter suppression

2640
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:51,712
It's their only

2641
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,528
There's no chance for them if

2642
02:08:55,808 --> 02:08:56,576
Real people

2643
02:08:56,832 --> 02:08:57,344
Get involved

2644
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:58,624
Like there's zero chance

2645
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:00,928
Like there is no ideology

2646
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:03,232
More unpopular right now

2647
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:04,256
Then

2648
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:05,536
Bishop conservative

2649
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:07,328
It seems that way

2650
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:10,144
Over the recess

2651
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,168
People going back

2652
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:11,936
Severe

2653
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:12,704
Fair

2654
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:16,032
Places where their constituents are

2655
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:19,360
I think that you're going to see a lot of people like

2656
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:21,408
Doing sit in

2657
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:23,968
I'd like politician

2658
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:24,992
Headquarters and stuff

2659
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:26,784
Isaac

2660
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,320
Everything that comes out is

2661
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:30,112
Like everyday you're like

2662
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:31,648
The one where people are finally going

2663
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:32,928
Start burning

2664
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:36,256
And then the next day it's something worth me like well we

2665
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:38,304
We can't just keep putting this off guys

2666
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:41,376
That's why we have all the news stories about the clashes

2667
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:44,704
Between antifa and

2668
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:54,688
Bright red one like you and I sitting around like I look at these people out there fighting

2669
02:09:54,944 --> 02:09:58,528
There are people and we don't feel like we have to go out and sit in

2670
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:04,160
I can still have that fantasy in my head

2671
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:05,184
Active

2672
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,464
Pumpkin fashion

2673
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:10,048
God I would punch

2674
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:13,632
Haven't got

2675
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:16,448
Fully support and truly believe in myself

2676
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:18,240
Benefit proud boy

2677
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:19,520
Came up to

2678
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:22,848
Hey Jordan I'm a proud boy

2679
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:27,200
What's redneck kisser

2680
02:10:30,528 --> 02:10:33,088
I mean I am using a little bit of speculation

2681
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:35,136
In terms of what I think is really going on

2682
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:36,416
But I think it has

2683
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:38,720
Much more of a factual basis then

2684
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:43,584
Jerome corsi get stumbled into information that will get him killed

2685
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,120
Because this

2686
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:46,656
Hypothetical congressperson

2687
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:51,520
I'm just going to leave the country on Monday I can't talk about it till Tuesday

2688
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:57,664
Why you can't talk about it till Tuesday but who cares first narrative

2689
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:01,760
If you recall there were two pieces of information

2690
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:02,528
And the big news

2691
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:05,344
No they were two pieces of information within the big news

2692
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:07,904
But Alex has the green light to talk about

2693
02:11:10,976 --> 02:11:13,280
Democrats to know as a mess

2694
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:14,304
SMS

2695
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:17,632
And then it was

2696
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:21,472
Kim.com and Hannity and those are just

2697
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:26,080
That's his background

2698
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:27,104
No that's

2699
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:30,944
Just what I think is going on behind the scenes

2700
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:33,760
Is there still a second piece of big news to get you

2701
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:34,784
Okay

2702
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:38,368
Just a second I thought we'd already gotten that way

2703
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:53,984
Information

2704
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:56,032
He has total proof

2705
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:04,480
And multiple large companies complete access

2706
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:05,760
Chess pie

2707
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:09,088
On hundreds of thousands of Americans

2708
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:14,208
Access

2709
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:20,352
Control Hub p******

2710
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:28,800
And then transferring out of the country

2711
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:30,592
So how's that grab you

2712
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:34,432
So he's saying that the Democrats

2713
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:35,456
Gave

2714
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:41,600
DNS error no gave a bunch of people access to the NSA database

2715
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:43,136
To monitor

2716
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:44,416
Hundreds of thousands

2717
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:45,952
The people during the election

2718
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,488
For political reasons

2719
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,024
Okay

2720
02:12:51,584 --> 02:12:53,376
So

2721
02:12:54,656 --> 02:13:00,032
More believable than anything else he said so far today

2722
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:04,384
Because frankly at this point vnsa seems to have given everybody that f******

2723
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:07,712
The f******

2724
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:09,760
Destroyed

2725
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:12,064
British hospitals in the NHS

2726
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:13,856
Like all of them

2727
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:16,928
They're like we built this

2728
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:18,464
Victoria

2729
02:13:19,744 --> 02:13:20,256
That's

2730
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:23,072
So I think Jerome corsi's life is safe

2731
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:26,144
I understand because you got scooped

2732
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:30,496
There's a post that came out on Friday on circa.com

2733
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:31,776
I'll read you the headline

2734
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:37,408
Declassified memos show FBI illegally shared by data on Americans with private parties

2735
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:39,456
This news is already out

2736
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:41,504
Alex

2737
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:46,368
Nautical misrepresent

2738
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:47,392
The situation

2739
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:51,744
It looks to declassify report

2740
02:13:52,256 --> 02:13:53,024
I hear it

2741
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,816
99 pages long

2742
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:57,120
And it is basically

2743
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:00,448
It's about the certification of

2744
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:02,240
Article 702

2745
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:03,776
Of the fisa

2746
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:04,544
Court

2747
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,080
Regulation

2748
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:07,616
So we're about to

2749
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:09,408
Ladies and gentlemen

2750
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:11,200
Hang on to your

2751
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:13,760
I'm knocking

2752
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:14,784
702

2753
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:16,832
It has to do with

2754
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:19,648
Like I don't I don't fully understand because it's very

2755
02:14:19,904 --> 02:14:20,928
Specific

2756
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:22,976
Very detailed

2757
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,000
But

2758
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:28,096
702 has to do with collecting of information on foreign

2759
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:28,864
Individuals

2760
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:32,192
And there's a lot of rules about how it is done

2761
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:34,240
I am about

2762
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:36,800
You're not supposed to get

2763
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:38,848
American citizens wrapped up in it

2764
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:40,128
Cuz of laws

2765
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:44,224
It's the whole conversations going on about unmasking at all this stuff

2766
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:46,528
It all has to do largely with 702

2767
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:49,088
Section 702

2768
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:51,904
Yeah but a lot of

2769
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:58,816
A lot of it was incidental I will I will admit that but American data

2770
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:01,120
There's a reason that program was stopped

2771
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:02,400
Is because it was illegal

2772
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:04,704
This entire

2773
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:07,008
Declassified night-time page

2774
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:08,544
Pizza Pizza

2775
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:12,384
Pretty interesting cuz it has to do with

2776
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:13,152
Review

2777
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:13,920
Of

2778
02:15:14,176 --> 02:15:14,688
The

2779
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:17,760
The guidelines that are used

2780
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:20,320
To make sure that information doesn't get out

2781
02:15:20,576 --> 02:15:22,368
Basically

2782
02:15:22,624 --> 02:15:24,928
What's it called minimization procedures

2783
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:27,488
Basically how you keep things inside

2784
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:32,096
I in the findings that they had an email from Megaupload

2785
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:37,216
Don't click on the link kim.com try to plant something

2786
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:43,872
Maybe his new edmed brother junk mail I can dispute

2787
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:45,664
Music

2788
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:47,200
So the two things

2789
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:49,248
I think of the most

2790
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:50,528
That you can find

2791
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:51,296
If you read this

2792
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:52,576
Are there at

2793
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:55,648
As we all know we're not comfortable with necessarily

2794
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:59,488
Does collect Upstream internet traffic

2795
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:00,512
And stuff like that

2796
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:03,584
Can eventually be searched

2797
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:07,424
But those databases are purged after a certain amount of time

2798
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:09,216
Still f***** up

2799
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:12,032
It's perfectly legal according to

2800
02:16:12,288 --> 02:16:17,408
Reviews

2801
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:18,176
Internally

2802
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:19,456
Yeah but

2803
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:22,528
Can't litigate

2804
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:24,320
The program is

2805
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:26,880
All I can do is talk about the story that Alex

2806
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:27,904
Is presenting

2807
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:30,208
Because if we get into that then

2808
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:30,976
Coursework

2809
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:33,024
Yeah that's too big to unpack

2810
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:37,888
What they found is that some people

2811
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:45,824
Some people within the nsa's structure had

2812
02:16:47,104 --> 02:16:47,872
Googling

2813
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:49,408
Google

2814
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:51,968
Now they've been using a search engine for that

2815
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:55,040
Yes and they had been using us person

2816
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,576
Automate search

2817
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:58,112
They were supposed to

2818
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:59,904
Supposed to do that

2819
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:06,560
Somebody abused the system that was so therefore abusing

2820
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:10,912
Upon the review there they're not sure that they really even

2821
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:13,984
Sound anything that they use

2822
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:16,288
You know it's just

2823
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:19,104
That one guy looked up his ex-girlfriend for sure

2824
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:22,432
There's no doubt about that

2825
02:17:24,224 --> 02:17:24,736
It's wrong it's

2826
02:17:24,992 --> 02:17:26,528
But it's not

2827
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:27,808
It's not indicative

2828
02:17:28,064 --> 02:17:29,344
Of any of the stuff that Alex

2829
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:30,624
Is breaking in the story

2830
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:33,184
Nor is it indicative of the stuff that's in the circus

2831
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:34,464
The stories

2832
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:38,816
When the review that this is a report

2833
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:41,632
When they looked into it

2834
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:42,912
Deemed

2835
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:44,448
That most of this

2836
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:47,520
Due to people being unaware of rule

2837
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:50,080
Being unaware of the guideline

2838
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:52,640
And they just basically recommend review team

2839
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:55,200
And that the rules that are in place

2840
02:17:55,712 --> 02:17:56,736
Or satisfactory

2841
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:58,016
And they do

2842
02:17:58,272 --> 02:18:00,064
Meet the Fourth Amendment requirements

2843
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:04,672
Circle e but perhaps

2844
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:08,000
Talking about about giving information

2845
02:18:08,256 --> 02:18:08,768
Enterprise at

2846
02:18:09,024 --> 02:18:09,536
Folks

2847
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:10,816
And foreign governments

2848
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:12,096
Individual

2849
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:13,888
That's not in here that

2850
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:16,960
If he's talking about something else than whatever but

2851
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:18,240
Here is

2852
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:19,520
What you might be talking

2853
02:18:20,032 --> 02:18:21,056
On March 9th

2854
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:26,432
2016. Oversight Personnel conducting a minimization review at the FBI's

2855
02:18:26,688 --> 02:18:27,200
Black

2856
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:28,992
Learned that the FBI cuz it like this is

2857
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:33,344
Disclose Ross information

2858
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:37,696
Including but not limited to section 702 acquired information to a blank

2859
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:38,464
Blank

2860
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:39,232
Blank

2861
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:41,280
Blank is part of the black

2862
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:43,328
Black

2863
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:48,704
It is largely staffed by private contractors

2864
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:49,984
Blank blank

2865
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:51,776
Certainly black contractors

2866
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:55,104
Had access to information on the FBI's storage system

2867
02:18:55,872 --> 02:19:01,248
The apparent purpose for the FBI granting such as analytical assistant

2868
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:04,576
Nevertheless the contractors that access to Ross

2869
02:19:04,832 --> 02:19:08,416
Information that went well beyond was necessary to respond to the FBI's request

2870
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:10,208
Black

2871
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:15,072
Describe access to Ross ice information as of April 8th

2872
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:15,840
26th

2873
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:19,680
That's actually pretty fast for them to solve that

2874
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:26,336
Question receive training on the FBI minimization procedures

2875
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:27,872
Did not disseminated further

2876
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:30,176
Nonetheless the above-described practice

2877
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:32,224
Violated the government's minimization procedures

2878
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:34,784
So they did a review of it

2879
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:36,832
That is

2880
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:38,112
Incompetent

2881
02:19:38,624 --> 02:19:42,208
Yeah but that's all

2882
02:19:42,464 --> 02:19:45,792
But we don't know what that that private contractor company

2883
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:48,864
Could be some sort of non-governmental organization

2884
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,656
That they were Consulting

2885
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:52,448
And they just sorta f***** up

2886
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:55,008
In terms of handling the more like

2887
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:57,824
An oversight

2888
02:19:58,592 --> 02:19:59,872
That's more like

2889
02:20:00,128 --> 02:20:04,224
Yeah we we assumed that everybody was operating under

2890
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:07,552
The same rules that we did and some people didn't know what they were

2891
02:20:08,064 --> 02:20:10,368
Yeah just like anybody

2892
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:13,184
You know the guy your job is kind of an idiot

2893
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:14,720
Antojitos

2894
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:15,744
He's f*****

2895
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:19,328
Yeah

2896
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:22,656
There's another heavily retracted section or redacted section

2897
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:24,960
Where they talk about another instance

2898
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:29,056
Of the FBI giving Rod 8702 acquired information

2899
02:20:29,568 --> 02:20:30,336
To another contract

2900
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:32,640
Because

2901
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:34,944
It appears that that is a federal age

2902
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:37,504
That they had given information to

2903
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:39,808
But they just didn't do it

2904
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:45,184
They didn't meet the requirements of Section 5 D of the FBI minimization

2905
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:47,232
So it's more

2906
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:49,024
Technical snafus

2907
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:53,120
They were giving everybody access to the NSA grid

2908
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:56,192
Nothing is really

2909
02:20:57,728 --> 02:20:59,264
It seems like nothing there was really worried

2910
02:20:59,776 --> 02:21:02,848
Other than other than the fact that these people

2911
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:04,384
Have all of our information

2912
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:05,664
And when they suck

2913
02:21:06,432 --> 02:21:06,944
It means

2914
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:08,992
Canby

2915
02:21:09,248 --> 02:21:11,552
Released if you do give it to those private

2916
02:21:15,392 --> 02:21:18,208
Yeah so that's why you have those guidelines in place

2917
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:19,488
And it seems like

2918
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:20,768
When was they realize that

2919
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:21,792
They could have been

2920
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:23,072
And so they plugged

2921
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:25,632
Right

2922
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:28,704
It's bad it's not good

2923
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:32,032
You know it's not good but at the same time it's

2924
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:34,592
If it's not legal

2925
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:39,200
Know if it is not nefarious

2926
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:44,832
Is Illustrated in this Declassified document

2927
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:46,880
They did reviews

2928
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:53,280
And they stopped these things that were clearly like we haven't we have a f****** in our process let's fix that

2929
02:21:53,536 --> 02:21:55,072
MMS review itself

2930
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:56,096
Recommend

2931
02:21:57,632 --> 02:22:00,192
To make sure that everyone's in compliance

2932
02:22:00,448 --> 02:22:04,288
There's one other thing that people could get up in arms about in this

2933
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:05,824
Declassified documents

2934
02:22:06,336 --> 02:22:08,640
That is that the spying

2935
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:09,664
On people

2936
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:10,688
Accidentally

2937
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:14,016
Took him some stuff that was covered under attorney-client privilege

2938
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:18,368
Course

2939
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:19,392
But

2940
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:22,720
But in response to that they recommended steps

2941
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:24,512
But they could undertake to make sure that that doesn't

2942
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,816
I make sure that they're more sensitive

2943
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:27,584
Future

2944
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:28,352
Two things

2945
02:22:28,608 --> 02:22:29,888
That they should not be

2946
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:34,240
So this happened in 2016

2947
02:22:34,752 --> 02:22:36,288
This review is 2017

2948
02:22:37,056 --> 02:22:39,104
They all can't be classified reviews from this

2949
02:22:39,616 --> 02:22:41,152
Okay

2950
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:42,176
Okay

2951
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:49,088
Are supposed to have stopped the boat date

2952
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:50,880
Action Program

2953
02:22:51,904 --> 02:22:52,672
So

2954
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:54,720
This is from April 27th

2955
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:57,280
People trying very hard to

2956
02:22:57,536 --> 02:22:58,048
Comply with

2957
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,376
They're not doing great at it so far

2958
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:03,168
But they're trying to get better

2959
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:03,936
Yeah

2960
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:07,008
Also I mean it just at the end

2961
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:08,800
They specify that

2962
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:13,664
The practices and the guidelines that are in place for managing of data

2963
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:15,712
Comply with the Fourth Amendment

2964
02:23:15,968 --> 02:23:19,296
And then just a list out a number of recommendations

2965
02:23:19,808 --> 02:23:20,576
About what

2966
02:23:20,832 --> 02:23:23,136
To better handle things to make sure

2967
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:25,184
Little

2968
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:28,000
Systemic problems that happened in the past don't happen again

2969
02:23:28,256 --> 02:23:32,864
Basically the workplace review

2970
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:34,912
Nuclear reactor

2971
02:23:36,192 --> 02:23:36,704
Where

2972
02:23:37,216 --> 02:23:38,496
We are working with Eddie

2973
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:40,032
Insanely dangerous

2974
02:23:40,288 --> 02:23:43,872
Beyond Reason and a minor f****** here

2975
02:23:44,128 --> 02:23:46,176
Is not like a minor f****** at an office

2976
02:23:46,688 --> 02:23:48,992
It possible that a lot of

2977
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:50,016
Will die

2978
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:51,040
If you f******

2979
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:53,600
So this is. Kind of like

2980
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:55,136
We're constantly putting

2981
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:56,928
Testing to make sure that our reactor.

2982
02:23:58,208 --> 02:24:01,536
Yeah it's possible that he's talking about something else

2983
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:04,608
Declassified document that seems to have to do with very similar

2984
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:05,888
Came out on Friday

2985
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:08,704
It fits it fits all of the stuff saved

2986
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:11,776
Describe now if you and I were to go up to them and tell them

2987
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:14,592
This is what you were talking about they would have course

2988
02:24:14,848 --> 02:24:18,688
Completely different we'll talk Tuesday

2989
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:19,712
But I mean like

2990
02:24:19,968 --> 02:24:22,528
I accept the possibility

2991
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:24,064
All Appliance

2992
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:28,416
Narrative

2993
02:24:28,928 --> 02:24:29,696
Based on

2994
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:31,488
Read the entire document

2995
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:33,792
Who else but you was going to read the entire

2996
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:37,120
I don't think those people who wrote the article that the entire document

2997
02:24:38,912 --> 02:24:40,192
It did not sound like a summary

2998
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:41,472
Let's

2999
02:24:41,728 --> 02:24:42,496
It was rough

3000
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:45,824
And if it's the kind of thing like

3001
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:48,384
When you read court documents and stuff like that

3002
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:49,664
I found it this morning

3003
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,200
Before we started recording

3004
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:55,040
Today's I'd be able to read that

3005
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:56,320
And then succinctly

3006
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:58,624
Verbally described

3007
02:24:58,880 --> 02:24:59,392
Report on it

3008
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:00,416
But like

3009
02:25:01,696 --> 02:25:02,976
F****** legal shed

3010
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:07,840
It's all this like repeated terms and

3011
02:25:08,096 --> 02:25:12,192
I'm not doing the best job of describing it I'll put up a link to the document

3012
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:13,984
You can read it if you want

3013
02:25:14,496 --> 02:25:15,008
Who cares

3014
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:15,776
Read it

3015
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:16,800
Read if you want like

3016
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:18,336
Like if you're at the beach

3017
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:20,128
Pull up on your Kindle

3018
02:25:20,384 --> 02:25:21,408
Yep but like

3019
02:25:23,456 --> 02:25:24,480
Please trust me it's not what

3020
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:29,600
Anyway let's get let's get off this topic

3021
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:32,416
Let's jump into greener pastures of extract

3022
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:35,744
The future of our species

3023
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:38,816

Memorial Day specials

3030
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:12,608
All his specials of the biggest they've ever offered also we already talked about this he's losing affiliates

3031
02:26:12,864 --> 02:26:14,400
If you look at the Alexis schitt his

3032
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:15,168
Traffic is

3033
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:15,936
Lumping

3034
02:26:16,192 --> 02:26:18,496
I went to quadcast the other day and I was looking to

3035
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:19,776
To see if there wasn't

3036
02:26:21,824 --> 02:26:23,872
In the about to 300,000

3037
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:25,408
Visitor suicide a day

3038
02:26:25,664 --> 02:26:26,944
Has been nothing like

3039
02:26:27,456 --> 02:26:27,968
Other than

3040
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:30,272
You know he has those one day Pete

3041
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:31,040
Citgo

3042
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:33,344
But now there's nothing nothing trending upwards

3043
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:34,112
He's not

3044
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:39,232
Doesn't appear to be losing a ton but is trending downwards

3045
02:26:39,488 --> 02:26:41,536
You losing your f****** Affiliates you're not winning Alex

3046
02:26:48,448 --> 02:26:51,264
From zero Affiliates to hopefully one

3047
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:52,288
223

3048
02:26:52,544 --> 02:26:56,640
Are trending upwards

3049
02:26:57,152 --> 02:26:59,968
So yeah we just heard that Trump has the proof

3050
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:00,992
About this

3051
02:27:01,248 --> 02:27:01,760
Supposed

3052
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:03,040
You know

3053
02:27:03,552 --> 02:27:04,576
The ship that Obama

3054
02:27:05,088 --> 02:27:06,112
The Democrats have been doing

3055
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:07,904
Alex wants to talk a little bit more

3056
02:27:08,672 --> 02:27:10,208
POTUS

3057
02:27:11,232 --> 02:27:13,280
That they're on the Russian and Chinese payroll

3058
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:28,896
Into the second third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth

3059
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:31,968
Government

3060
02:27:32,224 --> 02:27:33,504
That's a fascinating clip

3061
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:34,528
Cuz like

3062
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:35,808
From heaven

3063
02:27:36,064 --> 02:27:36,832
Appointed people

3064
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:38,368
I could be approved or disapproved

3065
02:27:38,624 --> 02:27:44,512
That idea blocked his ability to people in the second third layers

3066
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:45,536
But he's not even trying

3067
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:50,912
Date because he knows

3068
02:27:51,424 --> 02:27:54,240
Whatever they want

3069
02:27:54,752 --> 02:27:59,872
So describe what's going on right now had a very accurate the right now

3070
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:03,968
That's that seemed like that's another one of those time

3071
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:04,736
Times Square

3072
02:28:05,504 --> 02:28:06,272
He has to

3073
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:08,832
Totally he has to know

3074
02:28:09,344 --> 02:28:10,112
That what

3075
02:28:10,368 --> 02:28:10,880
He sang

3076
02:28:11,136 --> 02:28:12,672
Is the inverse of what is half

3077
02:28:13,184 --> 02:28:18,048
Well yeah I think so and that's a big part of the investigation that we're going to be starting tomorrow is that I want

3078
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:20,608
I desperately want to know what happened

3079
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:23,424
Likewise

3080
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:27,264
I think that Alex is holding up a line the

3081
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:28,288
Moschino is b*******

3082
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:30,080
I think he knows that he have to

3083
02:28:34,432 --> 02:28:36,736
Because he can't he can't flip flop now

3084
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:42,112
Not at all

3085
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:44,160
Till till whatever ended

3086
02:28:45,952 --> 02:28:47,232
Is almost

3087
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:50,304
90% chance going to be some sort of

3088
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,840
Disaster for

3089
02:28:52,096 --> 02:28:52,864
Yeah

3090
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:54,656
Tubidy

3091
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:56,704
Stuff like that

3092
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:58,752
Him saying stuff like that

3093
02:28:59,008 --> 02:29:02,080
Obama's government was just Reckless and doing whatever they want

3094
02:29:02,336 --> 02:29:03,872
I'm never taking a look at

3095
02:29:04,128 --> 02:29:05,408
The s*** the Trump is doing

3096
02:29:05,664 --> 02:29:06,688
Order people around

3097
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:08,480
Timber doing for good

3098
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:11,808
Bright whatever

3099
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:14,880
Making vodka

3100
02:29:15,136 --> 02:29:17,184
Concession like willing to turn the

3101
02:29:18,976 --> 02:29:19,488
It's not like

3102
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:20,768
It's not

3103
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:22,560
It's not what he's about

3104
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:23,584
Based on

3105
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:25,120
His entire career

3106
02:29:25,632 --> 02:29:26,144
But

3107
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:27,168
At the same time

3108
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:28,448
You still

3109
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:30,240
A lot of himself

3110
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:31,520
Like those

3111
02:29:32,288 --> 02:29:34,080
Does masculinity ideas

3112
02:29:34,336 --> 02:29:35,616
Those racist ideas

3113
02:29:35,872 --> 02:29:36,896
Those are still him

3114
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:39,456
Yeah but that stuff like the political stuff

3115
02:29:39,968 --> 02:29:41,248
That's not Alex Jones

3116
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:45,344
Relieve like

3117
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,624
Gone Whole Hog info

3118
02:29:47,648 --> 02:29:53,792
Ron Paul

3119
02:29:54,048 --> 02:29:55,584
Liberal candidate who could win

3120
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,376
Right

3121
02:29:57,632 --> 02:29:58,656
Had to us

3122
02:29:58,912 --> 02:29:59,680
If possible

3123
02:30:00,192 --> 02:30:05,824
I've learned a whole bunch of stuff in it

3124
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:10,944
Appropriate time but for now let's enjoy it real Alec

3125
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:11,712
Succezz

3126
02:30:12,736 --> 02:30:13,248
This cliff

3127
02:30:14,016 --> 02:30:16,576
World

3128
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:20,416
Dangerous people out there

3129
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:23,488
Ben-Hur

3130
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:38,848
At some point we reached here with a bunch of my lines and they know that

3131
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:47,296
Cuz a bunch a child molesters a bunch a child

3132
02:30:47,552 --> 02:30:50,112
Muslims

3133
02:30:50,368 --> 02:30:52,160
Stop

3134
02:30:52,416 --> 02:30:58,560
What time does Charter in

3135
02:31:03,424 --> 02:31:04,448
That's wild

3136
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:07,008
Do you do understand what he's trying to get up there

3137
02:31:07,776 --> 02:31:08,544
I don't

3138
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:09,312
So all

3139
02:31:09,568 --> 02:31:12,128
It's too couched in so much of that like

3140
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,664
Like

3141
02:31:14,176 --> 02:31:20,320
Here's the same boring everybody

3142
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:25,696
Manor not real men

3143
02:31:25,952 --> 02:31:30,048
Translating how all of this like really inflammatory

3144
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:35,424
Should be interesting stuff has become very boring

3145
02:31:39,776 --> 02:31:40,800
It's super interesting that

3146
02:31:41,312 --> 02:31:46,944
Like he has this whole narrative like a fluoride in the water

3147
02:31:47,456 --> 02:31:50,272
But he has to incorporate everything into 1 grand

3148
02:31:50,528 --> 02:31:52,832
Conspiracy that the globalist doing

3149
02:31:53,088 --> 02:31:54,880
Unified field

3150
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:00,512
So they can get away with their crime

3151
02:32:01,536 --> 02:32:05,632
All these crimes are the things that

3152
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:08,960
Conceivably trampas never drink fluoride

3153
02:32:09,216 --> 02:32:10,752
He's a genius

3154
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:14,336
Who is been planning this for 30 years

3155
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:19,968
Sleeper Cell

3156
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:26,624
Is there in the past Alex's used a whole bunch of other reasons

3157
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:34,304
That's not what he said in the past

3158
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:39,168
Or things like that other other end goals of the dumbing people down

3159
02:32:39,424 --> 02:32:39,936
Something

3160
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:44,288
The point of all of this stuff and the thing that I

3161
02:32:44,544 --> 02:32:45,056
I think makes it

3162
02:32:45,312 --> 02:32:46,336
Boring for me

3163
02:32:46,848 --> 02:32:47,872
To hear that

3164
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:49,408
Long laundry list now

3165
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:51,968
He repeats

3166
02:32:52,224 --> 02:32:52,736
The same stuff

3167
02:32:53,248 --> 02:32:53,760
And then

3168
02:32:54,272 --> 02:32:56,064
Whatever and gold

3169
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:57,600
He thinks you're afraid up to

3170
02:32:57,856 --> 02:32:58,368
Today

3171
02:32:58,624 --> 02:32:59,648
Is white

3172
02:33:00,672 --> 02:33:02,976
So you're afraid today

3173
02:33:03,232 --> 02:33:04,768
The government getting away with

3174
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:09,376
You're afraid

3175
02:33:10,144 --> 02:33:11,168
But they're going to take your guns

3176
02:33:17,312 --> 02:33:19,616
So it's always it's always these these like

3177
02:33:19,872 --> 02:33:20,384
Tent poles

3178
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:24,480
It's almost service to whatever it like he's throwing darts at a wall

3179
02:33:24,736 --> 02:33:25,504
What is going to be the

3180
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:26,528
The cause of this

3181
02:33:26,784 --> 02:33:30,624
Today it's almost like he has a set of lies that he just repeats

3182
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:33,440
Much like he is Accused the mainstream media

3183
02:33:33,696 --> 02:33:36,000
Very similar

3184
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:40,096
Let's not let's wrap this up

3185
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:42,912
Full-time

3186
02:33:43,168 --> 02:33:44,192
It's kind of done

3187
02:33:44,704 --> 02:33:45,984
Because Larry nickel

3188
02:33:47,008 --> 02:33:48,800
Old friend

3189
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:52,128
He comes on

3190
02:33:54,688 --> 02:33:56,736
Of him basically

3191
02:33:56,992 --> 02:34:01,088
How is the Internet would say Larry Nichols is back on his b*******

3192
02:34:01,344 --> 02:34:01,856
Because

3193
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:05,440
Is just telling Alex we need to build an army

3194
02:34:05,696 --> 02:34:08,256
And that we are the only ones who can help Trump

3195
02:34:08,768 --> 02:34:09,280
All this stuff

3196
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:12,096
Very ignorable

3197
02:34:12,608 --> 02:34:15,936
You guys will learn more about just how much of a douche

3198
02:34:16,192 --> 02:34:16,960
Right after this

3199
02:34:17,216 --> 02:34:20,544
Tomorrow Larry Nichols you'll learn all about him

3200
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:25,152
But for now just need to really know is that he is a Clinton Insider

3201
02:34:25,664 --> 02:34:26,432
He's a guy with

3202
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:28,992
F****** amazing sources

3203
02:34:29,504 --> 02:34:31,552
At least that's the way they're presented on the show

3204
02:34:31,808 --> 02:34:33,344
Yeah I am so

3205
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:34,880
You know you got inside

3206
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:36,928
Here Comes Alex

3207
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:39,232
He's got this prediction to give

3208
02:34:43,072 --> 02:34:43,840
I guarantee

3209
02:34:44,352 --> 02:34:45,120
Okay

3210
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:47,168
Is some high-level stuff

3211
02:34:47,424 --> 02:34:48,960
Is it enough to get Corsica

3212
02:34:49,728 --> 02:34:54,336
Baidu measurement is not classified be classified

3213
02:34:54,592 --> 02:34:57,152
It what level of info gets course he killed

3214
02:34:57,408 --> 02:35:00,480
Biscuits corsi's family killed

3215
02:35:00,736 --> 02:35:02,016
Yes

3216
02:35:08,672 --> 02:35:11,232
Except

3217
02:35:13,024 --> 02:35:14,816
Donald Trump

3218
02:35:15,584 --> 02:35:16,352
6 months

3219
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:23,264
Insight

3220
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:24,544
6 months

3221
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:29,152
Almost

3222
02:35:30,944 --> 02:35:37,088
That's the only way you'll get that information

3223
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:38,624
The former Clinton Insider

3224
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:42,976
Level sources the talent things

3225
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:44,000
Glean from reading

3226
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:44,768
The front page

3227
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:50,912
At least

3228
02:35:51,424 --> 02:35:52,704
A few places

3229
02:35:53,216 --> 02:35:54,496
Confirmed that

3230
02:35:55,008 --> 02:35:56,288
The Republican Senators

3231
02:35:56,544 --> 02:36:00,640
We're going back to there was going to be there

3232
02:36:00,896 --> 02:36:01,664
Matt esper

3233
02:36:02,176 --> 02:36:04,224
Hey we're either on board or office

3234
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:05,504
And this is how we're going to die

3235
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:10,368
Larry in this interview you keep saying that we need to

3236
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:13,952
We need to tell people of Republican leaders

3237
02:36:14,464 --> 02:36:16,768
That if they support this impeachment

3238
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:17,792
They're done

3239
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:20,352
He's trying to sort of BV

3240
02:36:20,608 --> 02:36:21,376
The counterweight

3241
02:36:21,632 --> 02:36:23,424
I mean like

3242
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:28,288
The gop's in realshit spot right now

3243
02:36:28,544 --> 02:36:31,360
Especially

3244
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:33,664
Alex

3245
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:35,200
Are in a terrible spot

3246
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:42,368
Congress the only people who are doing right now

3247
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:43,904
Rebel media

3248
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:45,184
Mike cernovich

3249
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:46,720
Gavin McInnes

3250
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:49,280
F*** him

3251
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:50,304
They're doing great

3252
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:52,608
Because they are just sort of

3253
02:36:52,864 --> 02:36:54,144
What cuz they've been break

3254
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:55,680
The the white National

3255
02:36:56,192 --> 02:36:57,216
And the chaos

3256
02:36:57,472 --> 02:37:03,616
And they pretend they're doing me bedok Warfare and Alex is still not embracing Whole Hog

3257
02:37:04,384 --> 02:37:04,896
White National

3258
02:37:05,408 --> 02:37:06,944
Like Gavin McInnes

3259
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:07,712
Is

3260
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:08,992
Kevin McHale

3261
02:37:09,504 --> 02:37:11,552
Gavin has a dildo shaped

3262
02:37:11,808 --> 02:37:13,088
Like white nationalism

3263
02:37:13,344 --> 02:37:13,856
Right up his ass

3264
02:37:18,976 --> 02:37:21,536
Even though he screams bit like outright bigotry

3265
02:37:22,048 --> 02:37:24,096
Just not gone far enough in order

3266
02:37:24,352 --> 02:37:25,120
He's to Siri

3267
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:26,912
Like Gavin McGinnis

3268
02:37:27,168 --> 02:37:28,192
And Mike cernovich

3269
02:37:28,704 --> 02:37:30,752
At least have the appearance of a cent

3270
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:33,312
Yeah like they at least

3271
02:37:33,568 --> 02:37:34,336
Make a goof

3272
02:37:36,128 --> 02:37:38,176
Like I seen Mike cernovich

3273
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:40,480
That's not allowed

3274
02:37:40,736 --> 02:37:45,344
Cernovich good time

3275
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:47,648
But they're having a good time

3276
02:37:47,904 --> 02:37:49,184
Never seen Alex have a good time

3277
02:37:51,232 --> 02:37:54,048
Cuz young people don't want this stuffy old

3278
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:55,840
Asphalt

3279
02:37:56,096 --> 02:37:58,400
To being up there

3280
02:37:58,912 --> 02:37:59,424
Like he is

3281
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:00,192
Becoming

3282
02:38:00,448 --> 02:38:01,472
Less relevant

3283
02:38:01,728 --> 02:38:02,496
Eva it like

3284
02:38:02,752 --> 02:38:04,288
So he reached his pinnacle

3285
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:05,568
More like Trump

3286
02:38:05,824 --> 02:38:06,336
Was elected

3287
02:38:06,592 --> 02:38:09,920
Pinnacle of what his popularity could be

3288
02:38:10,176 --> 02:38:10,688
And he's

3289
02:38:10,944 --> 02:38:13,248
Just going to go down

3290
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:15,552
If I had to imagine

3291
02:38:15,808 --> 02:38:17,600
Even my investigation

3292
02:38:17,856 --> 02:38:19,648
Can't prove this at this point

3293
02:38:19,904 --> 02:38:21,952
But I believe

3294
02:38:22,208 --> 02:38:23,488
2 Direction

3295
02:38:26,304 --> 02:38:27,328
He took the wrong one

3296
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:28,352
Because

3297
02:38:28,864 --> 02:38:30,912
Once he decided to support Trump

3298
02:38:31,168 --> 02:38:33,984
The two outcomes of a possible there's Trump wins Trump loses

3299
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:35,520
Trouble

3300
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:37,824
He's the guy who cheered for a loser

3301
02:38:38,336 --> 02:38:38,848
But at least you could

3302
02:38:39,104 --> 02:38:40,384
Could still save a little face

3303
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:44,736
Right on we got to follow up

3304
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:46,016
Once they win

3305
02:38:46,272 --> 02:38:48,576
Once you go down that path and you win

3306
02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:50,368
You know how I live you're useful

3307
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:53,952
Don't really have a have a purpose to serve anymore

3308
02:38:54,208 --> 02:38:57,536
You were the propaganda that got us in and now

3309
02:38:57,792 --> 02:38:59,072
You can't do s*** to help us

3310
02:38:59,584 --> 02:39:02,656
Investigation

3311
02:39:02,912 --> 02:39:07,776
How how would you know that by helping to elect an authoritarian government

3312
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:14,176
Perhaps you would no longer be on the inner circle happened before in the

3313
02:39:14,432 --> 02:39:20,576
History of

3314
02:39:20,832 --> 02:39:22,624
Unless Trump

3315
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:28,000
Back and then you could have taken the path of not

3316
02:39:28,256 --> 02:39:28,768
Supporting Trump

3317
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:30,560
And you

3318
02:39:31,072 --> 02:39:32,352
Even if Trump wins

3319
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:34,400
But you don't saying

3320
02:39:34,656 --> 02:39:39,520
There's the initial Fork that is supporter don't support each of those has two branching paths office

3321
02:39:40,032 --> 02:39:42,848
The 4:02 don't support both win

3322
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:45,152
One of them

3323
02:39:45,408 --> 02:39:47,456
With win support Trump

3324
02:39:47,712 --> 02:39:48,736
Is a real negative

3325
02:39:50,272 --> 02:39:51,296
And he happened to get that

3326
02:39:52,064 --> 02:39:53,088
Is the one

3327
02:39:53,344 --> 02:39:59,488
That he ended up going number 3

3328
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:00,512
Celibate

3329
02:40:01,024 --> 02:40:03,584
But if you did not support drop any losses

3330
02:40:04,096 --> 02:40:04,864
No skin off

3331
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:05,632
Is back

3332
02:40:06,144 --> 02:40:09,728
Hazel globalist narrative can continue

3333
02:40:09,984 --> 02:40:16,128
He can be what it's like for him was for Hillary

3334
02:40:16,384 --> 02:40:17,920
Trump and Trump wins

3335
02:40:18,176 --> 02:40:22,016
Now he can say glad Hillary lost he can celebrate that

3336
02:40:23,808 --> 02:40:29,440
Horse Trump is going to fall into it exactly what series of gas

3337
02:40:29,696 --> 02:40:30,976
They're just going to be

3338
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,792
Sweet Manna From Heaven for Alex

3339
02:40:34,048 --> 02:40:36,096
Good then he can go against

3340
02:40:36,608 --> 02:40:38,144
This Republican candidate

3341
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:42,752
This Republican winner but he could have made hay out of leather

3342
02:40:43,264 --> 02:40:47,872
Think of how great his ship on Russia would be right now

3343
02:40:51,712 --> 02:40:54,784
The Russians are controlling the government I told you this

3344
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:55,808
This also gets

3345
02:40:56,064 --> 02:40:56,832
Since my investigation

3346
02:40:58,368 --> 02:40:59,136
Because

3347
02:41:00,416 --> 02:41:00,928
I don't

3348
02:41:01,184 --> 02:41:01,696
Think he ever had

3349
02:41:01,952 --> 02:41:02,464
The choice to take

3350
02:41:03,232 --> 02:41:03,744
OSHA

3351
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:09,120
I think the choice is made for

3352
02:41:10,912 --> 02:41:12,960
Doctor

3353
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:17,824
You beat me a beat to it

3354
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:19,360
I don't want to give away

3355
02:41:20,128 --> 02:41:22,432
So lyrical present himself as

3356
02:41:27,552 --> 02:41:29,088
Clinton Insider

3357
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:31,904
You said he knows all about their

3358
02:41:32,928 --> 02:41:34,464
He's responsible for the tournament Arc

3359
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:35,232
Inside

3360
02:41:35,488 --> 02:41:38,048
Which is an Arkansas beside which is the Clinton shooting

3361
02:41:38,304 --> 02:41:39,584
Vince Foster

3362
02:41:42,656 --> 02:41:45,984
Stanford believes

3363
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:50,336
Arkansas

3364
02:41:50,592 --> 02:41:52,384
So he believes

3365
02:41:54,176 --> 02:41:55,968
He has one of the worst pieces

3366
02:41:56,224 --> 02:41:56,736
Defense

3367
02:41:57,248 --> 02:41:57,760
For that

3368
02:41:58,528 --> 02:41:59,040
About to play

3369
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:17,472
Stanley

3370
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:31,296
Yep they are

3371
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:33,600
Well they told me the national

3372
02:42:33,856 --> 02:42:35,904
That that was

3373
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:37,952
True

3374
02:42:38,464 --> 02:42:39,744
Call Jesus

3375
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,560
The thing that the that the problem is they also at

3376
02:42:42,816 --> 02:42:43,328
Tim about a lie

3377
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:44,352
Whether or not witches

3378
02:42:45,376 --> 02:42:50,752
He left that out also record

3379
02:42:51,776 --> 02:42:55,104
2 and 10 I on him when he was murdered

3380
02:42:55,872 --> 02:42:58,176
Oh boy

3381
02:42:58,432 --> 02:42:59,712
We still do not have that proof

3382
02:42:59,968 --> 02:43:02,528
High-level sources debt listen

3383
02:43:03,808 --> 02:43:05,088
If I am murdered

3384
02:43:06,112 --> 02:43:07,904
Over the next 6 to 12 months

3385
02:43:08,416 --> 02:43:10,464
Yeah I have released a dead drop

3386
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,560
That is filled with alien parts

3387
02:43:17,888 --> 02:43:20,704
So the problem with Larry's sort of line

3388
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:21,472
Is

3389
02:43:21,984 --> 02:43:23,520
That one of the Hallmark

3390
02:43:25,312 --> 02:43:26,592
In Arkansas

3391
02:43:26,848 --> 02:43:28,640
Is people close to the victim

3392
02:43:29,152 --> 02:43:29,920
Telling you to shut up

3393
02:43:30,688 --> 02:43:34,016
Yes so also of a

3394
02:43:34,272 --> 02:43:35,040
Murder

3395
02:43:35,808 --> 02:43:41,184
That has been turned into a massive conspiracy theory is the family saying

3396
02:43:41,696 --> 02:43:42,464
Please shut up

3397
02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:45,024
But that's the thing is that he does not

3398
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:46,048
Be a difference

3399
02:43:46,304 --> 02:43:46,816
Between

3400
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:47,840
The police

3401
02:43:48,096 --> 02:43:48,864
And Sean Hannity

3402
02:43:49,888 --> 02:43:51,936
Because the family has been very clear

3403
02:43:52,192 --> 02:43:54,240
But they don't mind it being investigated

3404
02:43:54,752 --> 02:43:55,776
For what they don't want

3405
02:43:56,288 --> 02:43:57,312
Is kim.com

3406
02:43:57,568 --> 02:43:58,336
Hacking his email

3407
02:43:58,848 --> 02:44:01,664
They don't want Hannity turning this into a rating

3408
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:03,968
Grab they don't want Alex Jones

3409
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:07,040
Trying to compensate for losing all his affiliates

3410
02:44:07,552 --> 02:44:11,136
By making this into a big story that may or may not get drunk or C-Murder

3411
02:44:11,392 --> 02:44:14,720
Don't want that cuz that's not an investigation

3412
02:44:15,488 --> 02:44:16,000
Nope

3413
02:44:16,768 --> 02:44:17,280
Show Business

3414
02:44:17,792 --> 02:44:18,560
That's politics

3415
02:44:20,608 --> 02:44:21,888
Bulshit that's propaganda

3416
02:44:22,144 --> 02:44:24,192
They don't want their son's death to be a part of that

3417
02:44:24,448 --> 02:44:26,240
Stupid very clear the fine with an invest

3418
02:44:26,496 --> 02:44:27,008
Navigation

3419
02:44:29,824 --> 02:44:31,872
I know you're 80 years old or whatever in your

3420
02:44:32,384 --> 02:44:32,896
On your Deathbed

3421
02:44:33,408 --> 02:44:34,432
But you know that

3422
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:35,712
Stop pretend

3423
02:44:36,992 --> 02:44:37,760
Sucking bulshit

3424
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:42,112
Even if you believe the most

3425
02:44:43,904 --> 02:44:45,696
But even if you believe the Seth rich

3426
02:44:46,464 --> 02:44:46,976
Conspiracy

3427
02:44:48,256 --> 02:44:49,280
There is no

3428
02:44:51,072 --> 02:44:52,608
I think maybe the better way to put it is

3429
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:54,400
If you believe the Seth rich

3430
02:44:54,912 --> 02:44:55,936
Conspiracy theory

3431
02:44:56,192 --> 02:44:56,704
Everything

3432
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:57,728
Plays into how right

3433
02:45:00,288 --> 02:45:01,056
Leave it out for me

3434
02:45:01,312 --> 02:45:03,616
If you if you believe that Seth rich

3435
02:45:03,872 --> 02:45:05,152
With killed by the DM

3436
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:06,432
Or whatever

3437
02:45:06,688 --> 02:45:07,456
Conspiracy theory want to

3438
02:45:08,480 --> 02:45:08,992
The fact that the

3439
02:45:09,248 --> 02:45:10,272
The parents are saying

3440
02:45:10,784 --> 02:45:14,624
You know we wanted investigation but we don't want you to do it we don't want Hannity doing it

3441
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:15,392
That place

3442
02:45:15,648 --> 02:45:17,184
Course the DNC doesn't

3443
02:45:18,208 --> 02:45:21,536
Looking into it or they were

3444
02:45:21,792 --> 02:45:22,304
Of course not

3445
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:23,328
Of course

3446
02:45:23,584 --> 02:45:25,376
If if they did say hey

3447
02:45:25,632 --> 02:45:27,168
F****** we're open and honest

3448
02:45:27,424 --> 02:45:28,448
We're going to let you do that

3449
02:45:28,704 --> 02:45:33,824
Well that proves that Seth Rich was killed because the only reason that you would be so open and honest

3450
02:45:34,336 --> 02:45:36,640
Is if they've already covered it up so easily

3451
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:37,920
That you can't find any

3452
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:43,040
There's no win against this

3453
02:45:43,296 --> 02:45:46,112
Because all it really is

3454
02:45:46,368 --> 02:45:46,880
Is a man

3455
02:45:48,672 --> 02:45:49,440
Well I mean what the

3456
02:45:49,952 --> 02:45:50,464
Spirits Ethier

3457
02:45:51,488 --> 02:45:52,256
Is a

3458
02:45:52,512 --> 02:45:53,536
Manufac

3459
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:55,072
Look at me

3460
02:45:56,096 --> 02:45:57,632
It is everything

3461
02:45:57,888 --> 02:45:59,168
It's everything that you could want

3462
02:45:59,936 --> 02:46:00,704
To be happening right

3463
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:01,984
Now as

3464
02:46:02,496 --> 02:46:03,008
Trump

3465
02:46:04,799 --> 02:46:05,567
Committing treason

3466
02:46:06,591 --> 02:46:07,871
Like you have you have

3467
02:46:09,151 --> 02:46:09,663
Distraction

3468
02:46:09,919 --> 02:46:13,759
Good distraction

3469
02:46:14,015 --> 02:46:16,063
Because the way you think of it is

3470
02:46:17,087 --> 02:46:18,111
Oh well Trump

3471
02:46:18,367 --> 02:46:18,879
Bulshit is it

3472
02:46:19,135 --> 02:46:19,647
Conspiracy

3473
02:46:20,671 --> 02:46:21,183
So we have

3474
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:24,767
A bunch of people who are already looking to believe in

3475
02:46:26,303 --> 02:46:27,839
Why not give them our cans

3476
02:46:28,863 --> 02:46:30,143
Let's

3477
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:33,471
That's the whole idea if you were primed

3478
02:46:33,727 --> 02:46:34,239
To believe in

3479
02:46:35,775 --> 02:46:37,823
Frankly at this point god dammit if we are.

3480
02:46:38,335 --> 02:46:39,103
Yeah

3481
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:41,663
Listening listening to the news is like

3482
02:46:47,295 --> 02:46:48,063
The spider from

3483
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:49,087
Thrones

3484
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:59,071
Kislyak probably did 911 I'm not saying that for sure

3485
02:47:01,119 --> 02:47:02,143
Yeah

3486
02:47:02,655 --> 02:47:05,983
We're all praying for that so why not just make up your own

3487
02:47:06,495 --> 02:47:08,799
And try and co-opted as much of that as you can

3488
02:47:09,055 --> 02:47:13,151
It makes me think of like a Alex Jones rant about the Overton window

3489
02:47:13,407 --> 02:47:14,687
I like how this

3490
02:47:14,943 --> 02:47:16,223
Entire Earth

3491
02:47:16,479 --> 02:47:16,991
System

3492
02:47:17,247 --> 02:47:18,271
This entire life

3493
02:47:18,527 --> 02:47:19,551
Conspiratorial faucets

3494
02:47:19,807 --> 02:47:20,575
Emma's just overtaken

3495
02:47:21,343 --> 02:47:22,879
Rationality

3496
02:47:27,487 --> 02:47:30,815
Because as it becomes closer and closer

3497
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:32,095
Occam's razor

3498
02:47:32,351 --> 02:47:34,143
To be more and more on the side of

3499
02:47:34,655 --> 02:47:37,215
Treason unless unless on the side of

3500
02:47:37,983 --> 02:47:39,263
These guys are f****** stupid

3501
02:47:39,519 --> 02:47:41,055
And they just wanted to steal a s*** ton of money

3502
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:41,823
Yeah

3503
02:47:42,079 --> 02:47:44,127
Lightning

3504
02:47:44,383 --> 02:47:45,919
The Trump campaign

3505
02:47:46,687 --> 02:47:48,735
Would make a great Ocean's 14

3506
02:47:50,015 --> 02:47:54,879
Like that cuz that's what it seems like it was it was a bunch of assholes getting together

3507
02:47:55,135 --> 02:47:57,951
When people out of their money

3508
02:47:58,207 --> 02:48:01,535
The diversity of emotions movie

3509
02:48:02,303 --> 02:48:04,863
But instead of instead of them you know

3510
02:48:05,119 --> 02:48:05,887
Stealing all the

3511
02:48:06,143 --> 02:48:07,167
Casino's money at the end

3512
02:48:07,423 --> 02:48:08,959
I'm just sitting out there at the fountain going

3513
02:48:09,727 --> 02:48:10,495
Hey guys we did it

3514
02:48:11,007 --> 02:48:12,543
Instead they own the casino.

3515
02:48:13,311 --> 02:48:15,103
They had no idea they had to

3516
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:15,871
Run the casino

3517
02:48:17,151 --> 02:48:20,223
They have been working with a rival Casino

3518
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:24,063
And casino lose their job

3519
02:48:28,927 --> 02:48:29,951
Blunderbuss

3520
02:48:30,207 --> 02:48:32,255
But

3521
02:48:33,791 --> 02:48:36,351
Unlikely is everything

3522
02:48:37,375 --> 02:48:39,679
The only thing that you can point to

3523
02:48:40,703 --> 02:48:41,215
In all of this

3524
02:48:42,239 --> 02:48:43,007
Some sort of

3525
02:48:43,263 --> 02:48:43,775
Collapse about

3526
02:48:44,543 --> 02:48:45,823
Yeah like

3527
02:48:46,335 --> 02:48:48,127
It seems like it's just

3528
02:48:48,383 --> 02:48:48,895
.

3529
02:48:49,151 --> 02:48:50,943
Something is going to collapse

3530
02:48:52,223 --> 02:48:52,735
It's

3531
02:48:53,247 --> 02:48:54,527
Like right now you can

3532
02:48:54,783 --> 02:48:55,807
Steve that are into

3533
02:48:56,063 --> 02:48:56,575
Institutions

3534
02:48:57,087 --> 02:48:59,391
All of our belief in the rule of law

3535
02:48:59,647 --> 02:49:00,415
Like all that stuff

3536
02:49:00,927 --> 02:49:06,559
Is putting up a lot more of a fight that I may have easily expect but one branch of the government

3537
02:49:07,071 --> 02:49:07,839
8/8

3538
02:49:08,095 --> 02:49:09,119
It seems to be you

3539
02:49:09,375 --> 02:49:11,423
Holding a little bit stronger than I would have expected

3540
02:49:11,679 --> 02:49:12,191
Something

3541
02:49:12,447 --> 02:49:12,959
Break

3542
02:49:13,215 --> 02:49:13,983
Yeah

3543
02:49:14,239 --> 02:49:17,311
What's going to happen is

3544
02:49:18,335 --> 02:49:20,383
I mean the only thing I can see happening

3545
02:49:21,151 --> 02:49:22,431
A little bit

3546
02:49:22,943 --> 02:49:24,223
Conspiratorial here myself

3547
02:49:24,735 --> 02:49:25,247
But

3548
02:49:26,783 --> 02:49:29,343
The arm of the government that's holding up is the legislator

3549
02:49:30,367 --> 02:49:31,647
The executive branch is f*****

3550
02:49:32,159 --> 02:49:34,463
Cuz there are people in the staff position

3551
02:49:34,975 --> 02:49:35,487
Like

3552
02:49:35,999 --> 02:49:37,535
The state Department's basically empty

3553
02:49:37,791 --> 02:49:39,071
All the people

3554
02:49:43,423 --> 02:49:44,447
Functioning as a

3555
02:49:44,703 --> 02:49:49,311
Executive branch has the all the people who are in charge are basically incompetence

3556
02:49:49,567 --> 02:49:50,079
Who are flocking

3557
02:49:59,039 --> 02:50:01,599
Rick Perry

3558
02:50:01,855 --> 02:50:06,719
Got these people have no business being in the position they could not be happier that he's not in the

3559
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:11,583
Right-click Rick Perry is what most incompetent running

3560
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:18,239
An organization that he does not understand you could be all over the news once Broussard play

3561
02:50:18,495 --> 02:50:22,335
If he is not loving this right now just like

3562
02:50:22,591 --> 02:50:27,711
His branch of government does

3563
02:50:29,503 --> 02:50:30,015
To completely fuk

3564
02:50:30,271 --> 02:50:31,039
Swiss cheese

3565
02:50:31,295 --> 02:50:32,063
And apartments

3566
02:50:32,319 --> 02:50:34,367
And nothing's there

3567
02:50:34,623 --> 02:50:38,719
And a leader who seems to be actively hostile to the idea of a function

3568
02:50:41,279 --> 02:50:42,815
Somewhere along the line there's some mint

3569
02:50:43,071 --> 02:50:46,911
Degradation of weirdos around him advising him

3570
02:50:47,423 --> 02:50:48,191
Then you have

3571
02:50:48,447 --> 02:50:51,775
The new branch is a complete shitshow

3572
02:50:52,031 --> 02:50:54,079
You've got Republicans in power

3573
02:50:54,335 --> 02:50:55,359
In both houses

3574
02:50:56,639 --> 02:50:57,663
Seemed unwilling

3575
02:50:58,175 --> 02:50:58,687
2

3576
02:50:58,943 --> 02:51:01,503
Deal with the problem of the executive branch

3577
02:51:01,759 --> 02:51:03,807
Wield some control over and they won't

3578
02:51:04,063 --> 02:51:06,623
They're doing Everett there they are

3579
02:51:06,879 --> 02:51:07,391
At this point

3580
02:51:08,159 --> 02:51:09,951
Like f****** Trump was going to be

3581
02:51:10,463 --> 02:51:12,255
The legislative branch

3582
02:51:12,511 --> 02:51:13,535
The GOP

3583
02:51:14,303 --> 02:51:14,815
Congress

3584
02:51:15,071 --> 02:51:15,583
Open right now

3585
02:51:15,839 --> 02:51:16,351
Have shown

3586
02:51:16,607 --> 02:51:17,375
That they want

3587
02:51:17,887 --> 02:51:18,911
Gladly watched

3588
02:51:19,679 --> 02:51:20,447
Tire Republic

3589
02:51:21,471 --> 02:51:21,983
So they can

3590
02:51:22,239 --> 02:51:23,007
Can lower tax

3591
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:24,799
For rich people

3592
02:51:25,055 --> 02:51:26,591
Not understanding that

3593
02:51:26,847 --> 02:51:27,871
Once it falls

3594
02:51:28,383 --> 02:51:30,175
Text Cody.

3595
02:51:30,687 --> 02:51:35,295
But what I'm getting at is both of these branches are completely fuk did you just branch

3596
02:51:35,551 --> 02:51:36,831
Except for the Supreme Court which

3597
02:51:37,599 --> 02:51:38,111
Is

3598
02:51:38,367 --> 02:51:43,231
Wildcard we don't know exactly how the temperature the rest of it

3599
02:51:43,487 --> 02:51:45,023
The rest of it seems to be holding up

3600
02:51:45,279 --> 02:51:45,791
Pretty well

3601
02:51:46,559 --> 02:51:48,607
So far and what that means to me

3602
02:51:48,863 --> 02:51:50,911
Is it that is going to be the next thing the

3603
02:51:51,935 --> 02:51:52,959
By the incompetent

3604
02:51:53,727 --> 02:51:54,239
Sad

3605
02:51:54,495 --> 02:51:55,775
Trump is embodying

3606
02:51:56,799 --> 02:51:58,079
Spreading like a cancer

3607
02:51:58,335 --> 02:52:00,639
He is about to start a point

3608
02:52:01,151 --> 02:52:01,663
A s*** ton

3609
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:02,687
Exact

3610
02:52:06,783 --> 02:52:09,855
Really start to get f***** up cuz he's not going to get caught

3611
02:52:11,135 --> 02:52:14,207
He's going to get people who either ideologically

3612
02:52:14,719 --> 02:52:16,255
Support weird things he believes in

3613
02:52:16,511 --> 02:52:18,559
Or people who showed loyalty

3614
02:52:19,583 --> 02:52:20,095
Right

3615
02:52:23,167 --> 02:52:25,215
You might as well just put convicted murderers ever

3616
02:52:26,751 --> 02:52:28,543
You got that f***** in the

3617
02:52:28,799 --> 02:52:29,567
Department of Homeland

3618
02:52:30,335 --> 02:52:31,103
Who is a murderer

3619
02:52:31,359 --> 02:52:32,383
Clark

3620
02:52:32,639 --> 02:52:34,431
Literal murderer

3621
02:52:34,943 --> 02:52:36,735
He's a murderer murdered people

3622
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:39,807
He's he's Sheriff Joe Arpaio

3623
02:52:40,063 --> 02:52:41,599
Yeah he is a murderer

3624
02:52:44,671 --> 02:52:45,439
He's a murderer

3625
02:52:46,975 --> 02:52:52,607
Committed the crime of murder and was in Russia at the same time as Mike Flynn

3626
02:52:53,119 --> 02:52:53,631
He was

3627
02:52:53,887 --> 02:52:57,215
Yeah pictures of him

3628
02:52:57,471 --> 02:52:59,007
Why does a guy from work

3629
02:52:59,263 --> 02:53:03,871
From Wisconsin going to

3630
02:53:04,127 --> 02:53:08,223
Yeah that's real that's real turn the pictures over time

3631
02:53:09,759 --> 02:53:10,271
I'm done

3632
02:53:11,551 --> 02:53:12,063
I give up

3633
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:13,087
I think Russia

3634
02:53:13,855 --> 02:53:16,927
You're fine yeah

3635
02:53:17,695 --> 02:53:19,487
Is like a game of Go

3636
02:53:21,023 --> 02:53:21,791
And we got our ass

3637
02:53:22,559 --> 02:53:24,607
That brings us to the end of this episode

3638
02:53:24,863 --> 02:53:30,495
I think that what we can take away from this is Tuesday is not going to bring with it

3639
02:53:30,751 --> 02:53:32,031
Samantha

3640
02:53:32,287 --> 02:53:34,079
Hopefully we'll bring

3641
02:53:34,335 --> 02:53:36,127
I don't wish that upon him I wish

3642
02:53:36,383 --> 02:53:37,151
Did he was shot up

3643
02:53:37,407 --> 02:53:37,919
I don't want to

3644
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:39,455
I wish you would stop being such

3645
02:53:39,711 --> 02:53:40,223
A weasel

3646
02:53:40,735 --> 02:53:42,015
But I don't want him dead

3647
02:53:42,271 --> 02:53:44,831
If he did

3648
02:53:45,343 --> 02:53:47,903
That's what I'm afraid of

3649
02:53:48,159 --> 02:53:51,999
Know your old man more like

3650
02:53:52,255 --> 02:53:53,023
If he was right

3651
02:53:53,791 --> 02:53:54,815
Now

3652
02:53:55,071 --> 02:54:00,703
It would be hilarious because that's the world the world

3653
02:54:01,983 --> 02:54:05,055
Buy pure happenstance like this weird Collective heart attack

3654
02:54:05,567 --> 02:54:06,591
I mean

3655
02:54:06,847 --> 02:54:07,359
That

3656
02:54:07,615 --> 02:54:10,431
The information on Tuesday

3657
02:54:12,223 --> 02:54:12,991
But for

3658
02:54:13,247 --> 02:54:14,271
Very different reason

3659
02:54:14,783 --> 02:54:18,879
The older it looks like he is the most right he's ever been

3660
02:54:19,391 --> 02:54:20,671
And his last thoughts are

3661
02:54:21,183 --> 02:54:22,463
I was wrong

3662
02:54:22,719 --> 02:54:28,607
What I imagine is more like a board scenario where he hires a Hitman to kill him

3663
02:54:28,863 --> 02:54:31,167
Cuz he's like f*** I've lost

3664
02:54:31,423 --> 02:54:32,191
Viability

3665
02:54:32,703 --> 02:54:33,727
To do journalism

3666
02:54:34,239 --> 02:54:37,311
I am in bed with people who likes

3667
02:54:38,079 --> 02:54:38,591
I've just

3668
02:54:38,847 --> 02:54:42,175
I'm going to hire this Hitman to give me credibility on my way out

3669
02:54:42,687 --> 02:54:44,735
And over the course of this Memorial Day weekend

3670
02:54:45,247 --> 02:54:47,551
He's going to learn to love and live again

3671
02:54:47,807 --> 02:54:53,951
I'm trying to hit man would not be able to he'll be caught up in his own web of proper

3672
02:54:56,255 --> 02:54:57,791
Like the nation of Guatemala

3673
02:54:58,047 --> 02:54:58,559
Was

3674
02:54:59,071 --> 02:54:59,583
2

3675
02:55:00,351 --> 02:55:00,863
His mentor

3676
02:55:02,655 --> 02:55:05,983
I don't know if that's what it's a wonderful life situation

3677
02:55:07,519 --> 02:55:08,543
Instead it turns out

3678
02:55:08,799 --> 02:55:10,335
This is how great everybody's life

3679
02:55:10,591 --> 02:55:12,895
Would be of course he wasn't there and something angel

3680
02:55:13,151 --> 02:55:13,663
Pushes them off.

3681
02:55:13,919 --> 02:55:15,455
Ifucking bread

3682
02:55:16,991 --> 02:55:18,783
That would be my new Christmas movie

3683
02:55:19,039 --> 02:55:20,063
Every year

3684
02:55:20,575 --> 02:55:21,855
Korsakoff of breadsticks

3685
02:55:22,623 --> 02:55:25,695
I don't think that I don't believe in

3686
02:55:29,023 --> 02:55:33,119
Can you book can you imagine those living in a world where Alex isn't lying

3687
02:55:33,631 --> 02:55:35,935
Tuesday they break a story

3688
02:55:36,191 --> 02:55:37,215
Bigger than Watergate

3689
02:55:37,471 --> 02:55:40,287
And the world has to be like

3690
02:55:42,335 --> 02:55:45,407
Did you imagine

3691
02:55:45,663 --> 02:55:46,431
Could you imagine

3692
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:47,455
No I can't

3693
02:55:47,711 --> 02:55:48,735
I can't I can't

3694
02:55:54,367 --> 02:55:56,159
It was bigger than Watergate

3695
02:55:56,415 --> 02:55:57,439
The entire world

3696
02:56:00,511 --> 02:56:01,279
Evan Alex

3697
02:56:02,047 --> 02:56:02,559
Alex

3698
02:56:04,351 --> 02:56:05,631
Possible

3699
02:56:06,143 --> 02:56:06,655
Could deal with that

3700
02:56:07,167 --> 02:56:08,703
Is by getting on air

3701
02:56:09,215 --> 02:56:10,495
And just stripping down naked

3702
02:56:10,751 --> 02:56:13,055
Like a loincloth

3703
02:56:13,311 --> 02:56:16,383
Castaway Carling burning sticks up

3704
02:56:16,639 --> 02:56:21,247
Or he has just like a scroll

3705
02:56:21,503 --> 02:56:24,063
A 2-mile long Scroll of people who is like

3706
02:56:24,319 --> 02:56:26,367
I need to say f****** love people

3707
02:56:32,255 --> 02:56:38,399
You just got the closing credit slide it is just

3708
02:56:38,655 --> 02:56:42,239
People who sells

3709
02:56:42,495 --> 02:56:45,055
Thankfully that's not going to happen

3710
02:56:45,311 --> 02:56:47,103
And a Tuesday will bring nothing

3711
02:56:47,359 --> 02:56:49,151
Except affiliates

3712
02:56:49,407 --> 02:56:50,431
Dropping the Alex

3713
02:56:51,455 --> 02:56:56,319
F*** you Alex little good day I believe

3714
02:56:56,575 --> 02:56:57,087
Hopefully by next

3715
02:56:58,367 --> 02:57:00,671
We'll find out

3716
02:57:03,231 --> 02:57:03,999
What

3717
02:57:05,535 --> 02:57:07,071
I just really want course

3718
02:57:08,863 --> 02:57:09,375
I don't

3719
02:57:09,631 --> 02:57:13,727
I don't wish death

3720
02:57:13,983 --> 02:57:14,495
If I can

3721
02:57:14,751 --> 02:57:19,359
Chaos Whitaker, Google right now make sure you still alive

3722
02:57:20,639 --> 02:57:21,407
You're freaking me out

3723

God I want him dead

3724
02:57:25,503 --> 02:57:27,039

Happened Alex

What went wrong

3732
02:57:40,607 --> 02:57:41,119
Disengaging

3733
02:57:41,887 --> 02:57:42,399
Interesting

3734
02:57:43,679 --> 02:57:45,727
And it's not

3735
02:57:45,983 --> 02:57:46,495
When I started
