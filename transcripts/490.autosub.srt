1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge B I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,304
Text Julie

7
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,424
What's my bright spot today

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Do with worms

9
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,240
Worm farm

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
It's going strong

11
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:22,688
Touch and go there for a bit I did not know exactly what I was doing or if I was feeding them correctly and everything

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,784
But now there's a feeling that I have that is like

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Rebecca

14
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
The active

15
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
Composting is making

16
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,952
Food more exciting for me a little bit okay because

17
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
Like example

18
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
This morning

19
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
I made a couple eggs

20
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:42,144
Coffee and I realized

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
Speed of the worm to coffee grinds

22
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
Feed a bit of worms

23
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
You can just meet coffee grinds to work

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,688
Seems like you can feed and you're worried about whether that you can't feel anything

25
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,808
Spicy peppers

26
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,648
Like non spicy peppers are fine

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,744
No Citrus you want to avoid you don't want to give them too much

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
Capital Bank

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
They turn into Gremlins

30
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,632
Also like

31
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
Cheese

32
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,472
Haha you don't want to give worms are lactose intolerant

33
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,264
Take me to ism

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,312
Good cuz that'll us are like rot

35
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,152
That's not good

36
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:30,016
People in fruit cutting cardboard paper

37
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
You normally come

38
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:36,928
Post stuff cuz it's turning into like almost a feeling of like

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,744
Hey is there a way that I can make

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Almost everything neutral

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,168
I ate the inside of the egg and my worms ate the show

42
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,472
The coffee here at the coffee grinds

43
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,056
Will turn into more things

44
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,128
Fertilizer exactly there you go

45
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,968
It's frickin bats

46
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
How me and my my worms

47
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
And are you going to

48
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Pooping underwear

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
Stood erect just

50
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,904
Stand up

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,696
Just let it fly don't know if that's

52
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,048
As bad as cheese but I think you're not going to.

53
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
I think you're not supposed to do that

54
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Thunderbird

55
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,424
My bracelet is too full.

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
First

57
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,032
My most important bright spot is always annoying to you but

58
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
Rafa won

59
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:30,432
Is 13th French Open

60
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
I genuinely believe that

61
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
If he stops playing all the other tournaments

62
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,296
It's just like claycord

63
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
You could probably win another

64
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,184
But my second bright spot

65
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,536
Do you recall the the endless story about the strawberries

66
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,144
Alright so about the delivery date

67
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
Yes it was wrong

68
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
So we

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
We're done with it

70
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:58,592
And then on her birthday I didn't send any emails I didn't do anything her birthday everything came and went by nobigdyl

71
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
The day after her birthday

72
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
More chocolate strawberries

73
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
I can order them

74
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
That's not even the right day for when I would have ordered them any worse early

75
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:17,280
Also early very weird goddamn

76
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
And Quest

77
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,911
Yeah you can only eat so did you know that there's a limit on how many you can eat before your legs

78
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
I'm done

79
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,263
Chocolate covered strawberries

80
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,359
From reading an article I just know that I can make it through that two of them

81
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,175
Then I'm kind of like

82
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
Six months before I have one of the

83
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,111
Which is why I didn't spring for that that fondue set

84
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:47,743
Thought about it

85
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
That would be a good idea

86
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:58,239
Jordan today to go over going to be talking about October 9th 2020

87
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
That is it

88
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,103
Friday's Friday's episode from last week

89
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,967
I would like to start this episode off of a tiny bit of that apology

90
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
2

91
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,319
Mostly for the sort of radio silence

92
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Post anything online and part of the reason

93
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
I get into that but

94
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
We used to talk a bit

95
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
More openly about Mental Health

96
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Struggles

97
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
Podcast

98
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
And

99
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
One of the reasons

100
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,495
That I have

101
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Talked about it last

102
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
Is part of my

103
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Struggle

104
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,871
Is hurt

105
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Bye

106
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,479
The idea of everyone knowing

107
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,551
My struggle

108
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Deal with

109
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Gets worse

110
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,439
If I talked about it and I'm aware that there are 10,000

111
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
Black people that's Rancho

112
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
Where is it

113
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
I admire your ability

114
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
Need to be open about your bipolar struggle

115
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
Much more

116
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,263
I guess I would say bravely then I am in a certain sense

117
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
Also just

118
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:10,943
Side effect I guess that's fair

119
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
It's a different story

120
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
Yeah

121
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,623
Got on some meds for depression and anxiety a while back

122
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
Talking about

123
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
Because it's

124
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,743
I also don't really fine

125
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
It has interesting

126
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
B

127
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,191
You remind me that's another reason that you were talking about is cuz you were feeling better

128
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,751
Yeah yeah quite a bit they're upside down

129
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Somebody who's been

130
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Reluctant

131
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
Take meds

132
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
At least in my

133
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
More adult

134
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
The reason for it is

135
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Bob fears

136
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Uncertainties

137
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
Stop distrust of like they work

138
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
Of course I just always

139
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Thought like

140
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Rockwell

141
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
I'll be able to

142
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
The talk my way through this eventually

143
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,071
A short short short and then I gave

144
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
Starbucks

145
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
Explore this

146
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
Some positive results

147
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,031
And this last week I

148
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,103
I accidentally had stopped taking my meds

149
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,455
One of the things that's really tough about that is somebody who doesn't

150
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
You know isn't

151
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
A

152
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Habitual

153
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
Maybe take her short shorts

154
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
It is that

155
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,487
You don't really notice sometimes when you stop taking them

156
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,303
I think it's this really weird phenomenon

157
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,375
I don't fully understand think I've heard

158
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
Talked about all that much

159
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
There was a guy was a good

160
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
Week before

161
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:46,175
My mental state was changing to the point where thankfully I had enough awareness to

162
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
Recognize I got

163
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Yeah

164
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
But

165
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,879
It was really it was really strange

166
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
Stuvi of like

167
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,487
You know couple days in and not notice

168
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
That I had

169
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,071
Stop this behavior that I had gotten used to

170
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
Exactly what my point is

171
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,495
B of A little bit of trouble last week

172
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
I appreciate that

173
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,895
I made it Advanced I guess people being nice

174
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
I don't know

175
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,903
But I'm okay everything's alright

176
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Sorry

177
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Like I said to

178
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,487
Radio silence

179
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,303
But the reason for that was that part of

180
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,399
Like what I really needed to do to get back to normal was too

181
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
No consult

182
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
Guy with help

183
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
Take the meds

184
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
You get back to normal

185
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
Show me some healthy things

186
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
And avoid

187
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,687
Being on social media at all

188
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Now is the smartest move for

189
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,575
I die by really apologize for anybody who got confused or was worried

190
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
It's nice

191
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
Someone may be worried but I would hate to have

192
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
God Percy

193
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
The potato diet

194
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
You know onward and upward

195
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
I don't dwell too much on this

196
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,887
But like the only thing you can really do is

197
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
Keep moving forward

198
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
We shall

199
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,031
Play it was yeah it was difficult

200
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,615
It was a little scary but

201
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
Where will back on

202
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
I appreciate your help in

203
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
Particular beer grapefruit

204
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
And

205
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
Couple times

206
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,767
Get back

207
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,095
To normalcy

208
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,447
But today on this talking about October 9th

209
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
And there's not a lot going on

210
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
On this episode

211
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,287
And I thought there would be

212
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Because

213
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
That is after the Vice Presidential debates

214
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Sure and

215
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
Of course the fly landed on like

216
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,015
The only thing anyone will remember from those today

217
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Yeah

218
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
You know Alex made a big deal out of

219
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,695
The fly going around Obama and said that he smelled like sulfur

220
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,047
Here's a sign that he is demon-possessed seemed like it would be at least something.

221
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
Your address

222
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,119
It's it was a big part of Alex

223
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
Vacant I figured like

224
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
It's going to be like other good fly

225
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,871
And then you have the other issue that I know that this is one of your big

226
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Assertive

227
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Lanes

228
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
That was trumps

229
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
I don't want to say something about

230
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
That he was that he

231
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,903
He's fueled by abortions now what do you want what do you want me to say about him

232
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,255
It's treatment I didn't look into this Pacifica

233
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
Well I mean it's

234
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
Exaggerate

235
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
Eversource

236
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Exactly

237
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Hillary Clinton

238
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
Call Steph cell

239
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,223
Runs out of aborted fetuses

240
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Right

241
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
Trump is getting this

242
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,599
Treatment that Alex would deride as demonic

243
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,439
Cheyenne his enemies and a fly landed on Mike Pence's head

244
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
And so I was like well

245
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
Got to click

246
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,607
Got to see what's going on here what's up there and

247
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Yeah

248
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Islamic

249
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
And just surprised

250
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,823
I'm not surprised that that information isn't really being widely publicized in the far-right

251
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
Sweat fly

252
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,455
The fact that their president was

253
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
His life was saved by a boar

254
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
Should really be some

255
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
I think

256
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
Like a lot but they won't

257
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Which is a major

258
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,487
A lot of the beginning of the show is

259
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
About

260
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
The UN

261
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,583
Getting an award

262
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
For fighting

263
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
The use of hunger

264
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
In war

265
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,007
That sounds exactly like the top story everyone was talking to

266
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,127
I remember that one being you that um got an award

267
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:05,759
It's the kind of thing where there'll be like a war that's going on in

268
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,831
Star people as a means of carrying out the war

269
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,439
Grandview and has programs that they use to try and fight back against

270
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
Alex believes that this is

271
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,047
Is nonsensical because the UN cause

272
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,351
Covid MN

273
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
Has made everyone lockdown

274
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
Which is causing the collapse

275
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,007
The first world which will cause the collapse of the third world

276
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:31,103
Which will kill off everybody which is basically them using hunger as War

277
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Sure

278
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
It's believed the tip of critical he goes on free

279
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
Very long time about it and

280
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,575
Incredibly boring that doesn't surprise me

281
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:46,463
I was bored when it the moment you said he started talking about the UN I was like what are we even here for what are we here for

282
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
I'm not talking about the UN

283
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,607
So this is the first thing that I heard that I kind of was like

284
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
Interested in a little bit because

285
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
There's a long stretch

286
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
You just complaining about the US

287
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,103
Yeah they have learned helplessness drills they do and they also have

288
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
Situational ethics they called spaceship or lightbulb

289
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
Where

290
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Beautiful astronaut

291
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
Who's most essential and Division

292
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
And you decide who dies first

293
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,631
Then once you got them instead

294
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
Well now you just giving it a total eugenics

295
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,287
That's really where all this is going

296
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,871
I don't understand like what else

297
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,943
Would you do to prepare astronauts

298
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
Score a really bad

299
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:46,111
Situation they all died simultaneously that's the only way to not support eugenics in this situation to

300
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
Obviously

301
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
I would like astronauts to be well-trained

302
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
And I and I think

303
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
There are few

304
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Higher Stakes

305
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
Situations then something going wrong

306
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
In space

307
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:03,007
It's hard you don't like to think about it you don't like to realize that

308
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
It sometimes baby someone does have to die in order for the rest of the crew to make it home

309
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
Don't talk about it there's an end a fight

310
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,623
Drawing straws were astronauts really going to draw straws like we're in the lord of the f******

311
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,975
Can flies right then the one person who can like fly the ship

312
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,583
Kunal flyboard

313
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,655
Getting commission home

314
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
Ends up drawing the straw LOL sorry fair is fair

315
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,311
Why wouldn't have these exercises

316
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Over these thoughts

317
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
They're committed to not

318
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
Using eugenics

319
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
That's what

320
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Real Prince

321
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
Fallsmead

322
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,759
Everyone dies on that spaceship

323
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,111
And if you want to use Eugenics on Earth we all take cyanide pills the same way

324
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,183
It's stale it's very silly to me the way Alex

325
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
Bixby's these kinds of things

326
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Swear

327
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,559
You know it's a worst-case scenario planning

328
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
If you're in space

329
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
For example

330
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,447
And then forever

331
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:09,055
Space

332
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
They've even got a plan for if somebody goes space crazy

333
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:18,271
They've got a whole chain of command thing setup they got the whole thing also if you're not doing that

334
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,623
What's the alternative if you're not doing the like here's what we do with this disaster happen

335
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
Are you telling me that you want like mission

336
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
Control

337
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,999
Implant suicide chips in the back of their head be like

338
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Sorry

339
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,607
Louise got to go like boom and he's gone like that

340
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,191
Scary

341
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,543
Vicki just want some to wing it kind of does

342
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,615
I would have waited in that situation so why not you

343
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
I think it's a bad plan

344
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,991
So like I said the entire beginning of the show is just about this um

345
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
Getting an award

346
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,575
Except for How It Ends

347
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
Coronavirus the hunger will kill us a global food

348
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
April

349
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
Oh but don't worry wart

350
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
Providing food is Aleppo

351
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
As they use it as a weapon

352
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,471
I bought a puppy in here I got that sword hypothetically

353
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
What animal

354
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,431
Dog cat Association whatever it is

355
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
SPCA River Golf

356
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,319
It'd be like if I brought a puppy in here I would ever do that I love dogs

357
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,671
Young Ward from a local animal rights group

358
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:35,071
Talk about killing dogs a lot I know that he loves to throw in like

359
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,471
Berkeley political I love dogs

360
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:47,871
The train of thought their suggest that hypothetically involves all of it like my pathetic lie if I love

361
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Where I

362
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,991
I like dogs then I would never cut off

363
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,111
Cat and dog

364
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Alright

365
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:05,791
The other one of the other big stories that had broken by Friday that I was interested in seeing what Alex

366
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Say about was

367
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,887
The news about the militia folks

368
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Screwhead plant

369
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
To kidnap

370
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,751
Michigan Governor Whitmer

371
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,823
Now we could talk about that but the UN did something

372
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,663
Play more important than an attempted overthrow

373
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,271
I was just because I felt like a militia Alex hates Whitmer

374
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Connor Fielding

375
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Got to come up

376
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
Sure are you everything feels like

377
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Just got to come up

378
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
Fly on Pence's head

379
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,023
What if things gets really depressing about covering Alex in the

380
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,863
She is like I could Mad Libs his show for the most part like

381
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,191
I knew exactly what he was going to say about this

382
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
Plot already

383
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,567
I'm going to come back and it'll really important

384
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
Militia Commander Authority is a

385
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Antifa

386
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
Individual

387
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
Police in America and Republican Party

388
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Perrigo

389
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Queenie Whitmer

390
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,047
I would have covered the food stories

391
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,543
Election

392
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
I'm just I'm just shaking my head

393
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
Just like

394
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
You son of a

395
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,575
Yeah pretty impressive

396
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,159
The reason I'm covering this story is important but also I should tell you

397
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:43,583
Go to buy Patriot Supply affiliate link that I've got

398
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
I8

399
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
It's so

400
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
Every time

401
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,727
I am going to whip

402
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
All of my far right people into a frenzy

403
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,103
Knowing full well that many of them are in militias

404
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
I know

405
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
Many of them have violent fantasies

406
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:04,319
And I have told them that it's a good idea to choose Targets in the higher-ups and take them out

407
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
And then when something happened

408
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:11,231
It was 84 damn I don't know

409
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,839
The guy who was the leader this group was necessarily

410
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
That Alex was

411
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
But you're right I mean that is the strategy

412
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Yeah it is

413
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,495
Antagonize

414
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,775
People to do things

415
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
And then blame antifa

416
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:31,455
For Less the name of the game

417
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Adentro

418
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,575
I got to say he plays some clips

419
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,623
Of the militia leader talking

420
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
And

421
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Honest

422
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,511
Glee it sounds like Alex in the past

423
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Do you know Trump is in

424
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:53,215
He's a he's a tyrant man show another call this stuff that he's that we do know that you need to be free dude

425
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,055
Do the police they're just there to follow orders

426
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Alex's

427
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
Most of his career

428
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,431
I mean yeah that's because it's what you believe

429
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,087
Is he believes there is high-quality storable food with your name on it

430
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,743
Alex is playing essentially this like no true Scotsman type game

431
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,791
Right-wing militia weirdo

432
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,119
Would say bad things about Trump there for this guy isn't

433
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,983
Part of my world associated with him

434
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:32,383
What is he saying anything that I'm saying know I love Trump so much that I will lick his boot all day everyday I would

435
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Like that

436
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Boats

437
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,783
The first hour

438
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
Pretty unexpected

439
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
The final segment with our lawyers coming in I've got a emergency

440
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,095
Family Matters I have to attend to for the ongoing harassed

441
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
And the third

442
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Fourth

443
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Today

444
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Time's left

445
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
To go to Family Court

446
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:06,175
Like you did the previous Friday

447
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,783
I don't know man that's a bummer

448
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
It's very

449
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,855
Huge bummer

450
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
Watching this

451
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
Episode

452
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Just him being like

453
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,328
Militia that's 94 guy whatever

454
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
Spoiler alert

455
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,888
The trumps

456
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
Treatment

457
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
The fly

458
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:33,824
Surprise

459
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,408
For about an hour actually only about 35 minutes

460
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:43,040
I can't imagine he drove to the courthouse and back in the time that he was off air

461
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
Tom Brady comes back

462
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,904
And we get another follow-up on something that to Alex has been

463
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,952
Zigzagging all over the

464
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
Owen Shroyer still in studio

465
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
Weekend update on

466
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
The wheels

467
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,376
About the attorney general

468
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,216
We don't do bar with high-level CIA Will Bill Barr was brought in my

469
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
H.w. bush

470
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
1990s

471
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
We know who these people are

472
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,016
The older establishment that doesn't want to completely destroy America

473
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,088
Monte carryout globalism that we kind of control

474
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,672
The ballista run by communist China

475
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,744
PL phase-out for the takedown of America

476
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
You don't want to

477
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
And then you got the

478
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,640
Represent those that want to slowly

479
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,712
Salami slices America the little pieces

480
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,016
Nnnn digested with enjoyment

481
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,344
Instead of a Big Mac

482
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,136
He understands that he'll probably

483
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,952
It put the catalog during that process sissies as well

484
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
So

485
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:01,632
Ionizes bar in body that

486
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,216
So he's mad at Bill Barr now

487
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,544
Okay magically aware of the fact that

488
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,944
Pre-K Meandering h.w. Bush's high-level CIA

489
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,064
Totally fine with him being exactly like the person that he describes as a demon

490
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Just like

491
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
Gradual

492
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,136
Yeah slow demon

493
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,952
So you're just what you just fine

494
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
Well the problem is

495
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Speed

496
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
I know I didn't miss pace

497
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,144
I understand that like in some cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend

498
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
I understand that.

499
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,496
But she still wants to kill everyone

500
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
Salami slice

501
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,848
I feel like that's a deal-breaker for

502
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
It should be

503
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Yeah

504
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
Okay

505
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Ridiculous

506
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
Here's what here's the thing

507
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
Okay I like

508
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
Eco

509
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
I don't like fascism

510
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
I don't like

511
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
Them together

512
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,592
And that's a deal-breaker for me I'm not going to be like well we got to work with the eco-fashion

513
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,616
Just for a while they like the

514
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,480
Slowly

515
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:26,112
Climate change aware surrounding the issues that I like

516
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
To bring in the later part

517
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Bad

518
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Yep

519
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,816
Should be at this point

520
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Like

521
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
Completely against

522
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Spell bar

523
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
But he's not really

524
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
I'll be over

525
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
Easy

526
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,872
But it does have to do with the fact that bill Barr came out and said there aren't going to be indictments of like people like Obama

527
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:52,480
Did all that before the election

528
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,760
Surprise or whatever

529
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
This is really

530
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Turned off

531
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,624
A lot of people in Alex's movie good

532
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
Pressure

533
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:03,232
It's getting into like this weird giving a rant

534
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,536
And

535
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,072
20in about how like hey

536
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
Hey

537
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
Right now

538
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,400
Big wave

539
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,704
Nationalism

540
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984
Huge lava

541
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
Great

542
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
Logitech G

543
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
Nazis next

544
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,080
One will be big

545
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
Even bigger

546
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,408
You think people

547
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,968
Big Brother

548
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Sitting back

549
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,448
Probably

550
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
I'm just really upset that

551
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,224
Bill Barr isn't he a patriot

552
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
We are hope

553
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,040
Oh my God

554
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
Oh my gosh how are they

555
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
You know he's not

556
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
You already do it

557
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Not just like

558
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
Yeah of course not Bill course he was

559
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
Everyone knew that

560
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,424
Nevermind everybody knew that you acting surprised

561
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,848
I think it was yelling about Bill Gates there from contacts

562
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,384
Text clues that was a hoot

563
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,432
He's going to eat that's what I was thinking

564
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Yeah

565
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,552
I just found it to be so interesting lead

566
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
False

567
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,488
Yeah it the yelling

568
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,816
You never cease to

569
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,632
The guys playing ping pong with

570
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
Incredibly different racket

571
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
It's kind of sad

572
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,288
It's kind of sad

573
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
Because that's a that's like a a

574
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,408
Quick encapsulation of Wyoming

575
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
Never going

576
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
Is because Alex at least

577
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,064
He comes with the

578
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,416
But at least he's trying

579
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
And Owen follows that up with

580
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
You know I'm just disappoint

581
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Like what

582
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,888
You got to get some electricity

583
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Yeah it's strange

584
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Yeah I don't know

585
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
Almost feels like

586
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,872
Owen would like to work somewhere else eventually

587
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,688
Like you don't want a yellow but eating people

588
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,248
Until you find wherever you're going to be

589
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Right you know

590
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,040
And is going to be nowhere

591
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,112
That's why you should start yelling about eating people now

592
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:44,512
Yeah go ahead that's your lady

593
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,048
Play buddy Alex

594
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,864
Just trying to equivocate a little bit about bar staff

595
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Spell bars not making a move

596
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,896
Cuz Alex needling I'm a little bit like

597
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
He thinks

598
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
Because Owen actually believed it

599
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,784
Maybe because I can

600
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
Maybe off-air Owens

601
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
Complaining about that

602
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
Alex's

603
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
Bringing

604
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,440
Zacks on air

605
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,720
Owens compose

606
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
Sure and what have you but

607
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,096
I think of you might be more bad about this then I think that's on

608
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,472
Who's involved in special corrupt

609
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
Mission teens are actually

610
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,056
George Herbert Walker Bush

611
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,360
More affection to us

612
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,224
Now that's a bright spot

613
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Leopards don't change their spots

614
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
Bubba

615
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,624
Lexi treasonous tyrant

616
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
If you want

617
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,048
I don't want I want Obama to be arrested.

618
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
I want more than that

619
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
I mean

620
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,848
Never going to happen

621
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,176
Of course not

622
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,992
Better better

623
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,208
We need your financial support

624
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,256
Wow flying

625
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Wow

626
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,816
Anyting

627
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,584
Anything

628
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
Can turn into an adventure if you believe in you

629
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
Yourself

630
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,704
Have you just talk over Owen enough

631
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,104
If it'll get there wow it just sounds like Owen actually bought his own b******* and Alex is sitting there like he bought bars

632
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,432
Alex is just going like on air I have to

633
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,832
To tell you that there's good things about him off are all explained to you that we all knew this the whole time oh and how old are you

634
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:50,208
24 stupid there is a Vibe of like

635
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
Get over it

636
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,536
We've been here before

637
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:59,168
We have to shine this up and the best way we can do that is a little polish

638
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
Polish the jar says

639
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,800
He's 80% defected to us in Polish

640
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,616
It's labeled meaningless isms

641
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,920
Then we just Shine the boot

642
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,272
It is it is like that old like when you take

643
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,552
High-paying

644
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,088
High powerful job it's like

645
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,136
The first thing that you do is you

646
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,928
Somebody comes it like a marriage

647
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
And it's like

648
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,024
If you come in and you just eat a bowl of s*** I think it's from The Wire

649
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,632
And then the next person comes in and you need a bigger bolshit and the next person

650
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,704
Like this is feeling like Owens first big bowl of s***

651
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,496
Where is Eli doubt it

652
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,544
My God I have to do even

653
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,336
This is going to get bigger

654
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
I don't know

655
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
It's strange

656
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
So

657
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,784
This next clip is just

658
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
The mask

659
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Alex's

660
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
Complaining about

661
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,672
Immigrant populations

662
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,720
Coming to the United States course

663
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,768
Particularly somali-american

664
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,352
Is that because their abortions are powering his president

665
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
No it

666
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
It's because

667
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,704
He believes that they all act as one

668
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
Which is why the globalist

669
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
So bring them in

670
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,336
To use them against him

671
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Sound like

672
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,408
Anti-semitic propaganda from the past

673
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,320
Somali people are slave

674
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
And the

675
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
Bring them in and then

676
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Seattle

677
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Portlander

678
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,536
All Somali

679
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
Clarks

680
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,632
They only hire one group

681
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,448
Because the local cheats

682
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
Isn't Union

683
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
Yep they'll kill you

684
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,616
That's why

685
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
Horsham Ollie's

686
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,968
It's a slave class I brought into America feel sorry for him

687
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,528
I should tell you that they're arguing

688
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
Airfare

689
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
Port work

690
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,440
What nothing

691
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
This guy so excited

692
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,792
85% plus of like unitedamerican

693
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,096
The major airlines they're all unionized

694
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
I don't know what Alex is talking

695
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
About other than just

696
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,240
Explicit xenophobia and racism

697
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
Nonsensical

698
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
First of all

699
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,896
It's not all Somali people who are working at the airport

700
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:21,248
And if you screw up on the job they don't take you out and kill you

701
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,576
Furthermore

702
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:29,440
You know if someone was Somali or not if you didn't talk to them Alex did you ask them

703
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,024
Did you hear an accent snow you just saw what

704
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
That I got to go

705
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,656
Calls and they're not

706
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Good

707
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
Nothing really all that in

708
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,288
Interesting people want to talk about the bill bar thing

709
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
Alex's

710
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,664
Treading Water bet on that but not in an inch

711
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944

713
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,576
How did you guys not know that this was going to happen

714
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:02,208

Help him as an Advertiser

741
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
Strategy

742
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,400
This dude is creating a YouTube channel where he's getting like

743
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:19,008
50000 views on a video of one of Alex's shows

744
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:22,848
That's 50,000 people were watching it there instead of banned. Video

745
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,664
That's that is people who are like

746
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,528
You have now given a new place outside of your direct Revenue stream

747
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
It seems like Alex

748
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,112
Should be mad about that but I guess it's just all eyes

749
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:40,768
Yeah and these videos

750
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,048
Alex's doing add pitches

751
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
It's still

752
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
Alex it's not like

753
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,680
Cuz you can't even monetize it they or their coverage

754
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,704
Achoo

755
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Get paid for it

756
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,544
Lights out

757
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,384
And whatever could trickle-down will eventually like

758
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,688
If anybody watches those videos and is like

759
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,736
Hey this guy sounds really cool

760
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
There's a decent chance they'll end up on Alex

761
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
Decide eventually

762
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
I guess there's some sort of

763
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
Spider web

764
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
Strategy to it

765
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
He's going to be a

766
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
Truncated episode

767
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
Because

768
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
I mean for one I'm

769
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Find

770
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
I'm not like

771
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
A hundred percent

772
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
Emma

773
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,008
This is just not a show that is all that interesting

774
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
Alex leaves in the middle of it

775
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
Time

776
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
That is Owen

777
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,408
In studio and they just

778
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
It's like

779
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
Bro out

780
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,528
I bet Alex yells at eating Bill Gates sure then

781
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:38,112
Who doesn't want to that then Alex interviews a guy who did a prank

782
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:42,720
Remember what it was about I don't I was listening to

783
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
Incredibly stupid yeah

784
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
Alright

785
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,632
It was waste it was a waste

786
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
Just talking about like

787
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
The UN

788
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
Bill Burr

789
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,288
That was for the topics that were covered soap

790
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
In a meaningful way

791
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,872
Wanted to hear about the fly

792
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,456
Wanted to hear about a rationalization for

793
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
Here's why

794
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,504
That would be interested

795
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,600
Yeah cuz it would take some creativity you take some bending

796
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,904
Some sort of Matrix bullet time

797
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,536
Bradley why the fly landing on pants doesn't mean he's a demon but it did for Obama

798
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
It's just like to have fun

799
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,632
Yeah yeah I know they're going to disappoint at the b*******

800
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
It is indeed

801
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,704
Like cuz here's the other

802
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
End of the larger problem

803
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,776
With that

804
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,336
Kind of b******* and it's it it example

805
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
Which is that

806
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,688
If they ban abortion in the United

807
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Midstates

808
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:41,344
You think the rich aren't going to be able to get treatments based on abortion elsewhere

809
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,648
They're going to be able to go and get whatever treat

810
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
Commence a f****** what

811
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,000
And here in the United States they're going to cut off all federal funding

812
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,816
Make it as impossible as it can be

813
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
To even research

814
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
All of that s***

815
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
And that's it

816
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,216
Only going to hurt her poor people and they know that

817
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,264
And they're just exploiting the insane stuff

818
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,544
Did they fit into those

819
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
Idiot you were going to

820
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,640
To be heard vote for them to them destroy and they don't

821
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,688
Because I don't have to deal with the consequence

822
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:13,088
Except for weird calls about how build bars disappointed

823
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,928
We have one last callers actually on that topic

824
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,232
About Bell bars

825
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,304
Just like this

826
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,864
Three-card Monte game that Alex is playing

827
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
Such a bummer

828
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
How you doing Alex

829
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
I want to talk about

830
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,728
Bar real quick

831
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
I even do anything

832
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,152
Iran-Contra holdover

833
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:41,760
I never expected much remember he's on a Ron Contra holdover exact

834
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,528
Flashlight

835
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,112
Alex has been shining his ship

836
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,416
For so long even though he knew

837
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,696
Yeah like everybody

838
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:56,096
Just learned about filbar's involvement in the Iran-Contra

839
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,376
Dislike

840
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
He was

841
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
Hired

842
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,472
Because he has experience

843
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
Covering up crimes

844
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,408
What are the things that I find most interesting about the present-day that's so full of like

845
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,712
It's not interesting things that Alex does

846
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,808
Is this back-and-forth on William Barr yeah that is kind of in

847
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,344
Sing To Me the Way

848
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
The Alex

849
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:22,976
Lashes out whenever there's bad news about

850
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,256
Instantly aware

851
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:30,400
Like this time it's around Contra involvement last time it was bars father being involved with Epstein

852
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
Yep

853
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,264
These things because he magically becomes aware of them and then

854
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,640
Forgets whenever bar does not benefit is good it's almost as if

855
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,920
He's trying to

856
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
The Punisher

857
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
Bar

858
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,272
For doing so as if he had some sort of

859
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:50,112
Control over bars action

860
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:54,976
Seems ludicrous to me first of all that it would be a real thing

861
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:01,376
You think you could sway the Attorney General with f****** s*** on his radio show

862
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Swayed by

863
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
Aaj

864
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Hard to imagine

865
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
But the way I think of

866
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
Is

867
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,544
I think this is his like

868
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,336
Trump is a shity press

869
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
He knows that

870
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
Nobody.

871
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,176
Doesn't know that who isn't insane

872
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
So

873
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,736
He is lashing out

874
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
At Bill's Bar

875
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
The way that he wishes

876
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
Is he could too

877
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,904
Sublimating all of this s*** that he really wants

878
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
To say to Trump into

879
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:29,024
Like finally criticizing somebody and Bill Barr he's always

880
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
There you go

881
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,608
Yeah that could be

882
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:39,008
Yeah probably I might be

883
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,824
Psychoanalysis kind of going on right here but

884
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,848
On the other hand

885
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,384
I've listened to so much

886
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:51,296
Yeah I just wonder if there will be more clues in terms of the game going back and forth on

887
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
Dartboard

888
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,136
I'm interested but also like

889
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,672
It just seems like

890
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,208
Said something good

891
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,744
I'm aware of this

892
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,560
Love I said something that I don't like

893
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,328
Now you

894
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,264
I can just throw up

895
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,544
He's not going any

896
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
Now

897
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,968
Here's what it is here's what it is here's what it really is

898
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,576
Here's how you know Alex nude none of this with none of these indictments were going

899
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
Going to come down

900
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,880
Whatsoever

901
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
Is

902
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,232
He's not at all trying to convince Barta

903
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
To do it

904
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,280
You don't like

905
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,096
If he thought that it was actually a possibility

906
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
He would go on the show to be like

907
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
I'm talking to Bill Barr right now

908
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:44,032
If you don't do this before the election we're going to do the whole thing you know but on this one he's just like

909
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
Yeah man

910
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:50,432
Yeah yeah you would probably like have one of his weirdo friends

911
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:56,832
Come on and talk about how they have inside information about the indictments or something

912
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Would come on and

913
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:01,696
Say some s***

914
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,232

915
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,304
