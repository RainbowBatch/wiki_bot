1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,296
I have great respect for tonight

2
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,344
B b

3
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,880
I love you

4
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,608
Indeed we are.

5
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:16,288
Well actually the other night

6
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
Meetings or anything

7
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488
He's from the comedy days got together places names

8
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:40,096
A bit more of that in the future it's a bunch of

9
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
Just making fun of each other

10
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,456
It's like this that there's a grid of tiles on a board has a word on on that right

11
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
And so you play a one person is the spymaster the other person is B player okay

12
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:07,232
And the spymaster gets to see which are his teams

13
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,632
Get the other person to gas

14
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
But you want to

15
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,776
To try and get more than one of them in a turn

16
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:25,152
And bird that will trigger that in the other person

17
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,456
Try and get them to gas boat

18
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
Really ambitious out.

19
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
What are you thinking

20
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
It introduces so many like arguments

21
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,656
Taboo

22
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:54,592
And his first clue was

23
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,920
And he was trying to get me to gas

24
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Hawk

25
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Okay

26
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
Alright

27
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
Little bit

28
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,864
My

29
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
Kings of convenience

30
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:23,008
Yeah there is Scandinavian Simon and Garfunkel

31
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:28,896
And we listen to music

32
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:35,296
My friends and I all drove to Detroit because the only place where we could see them was a

33
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
Rundown

34
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
Pool hall

35
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
That that didn't card on the way there

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
We had. We had 65 very old pickup truck

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,752
First you drink then you smoke no no no first we smoke and then we drink in the car

38
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
Designated driver

39
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:06,272
Come on

40
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Yeah

41
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,464
Well yeah that was because

42
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,512
Simon and Garfunkel

43
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,583
Play with acoustic guitars and then at the end of the show

44
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,887
One of the numbers is that

45
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
Who's actually a producer in DJ in his own right and they have and they brought somebody up from the crowd there

46
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
There was like 40 people there

47
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
I took play one note on the base over and over and over again and then we just all had a giant dance party on the stage is fun

48
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,023
For sure

49
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
Transition

50
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,727
Explain

51
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,895
And the reason is because on Sunday

52
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,295
Message okay

53
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Totally fine

54
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,135
The situation was on Sunday

55
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
My Sunday

56
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
Is this Sunday

57
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
I don't know if I can help you and I were recording a q-and-a episode

58
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,887
We noticed there was water coming in the window

59
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,471
Coming in apartment

60
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,799
We found that to be troubling

61
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,199
And it turns out it's also not the first time is it a couple months ago and the landlord

62
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,503
Building manager

63
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
Tuckpointing work or whatever outside

64
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,183
And so there was water coming in

65
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,071
Call Dad emailed by

66
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,887
To take a look at it and if you look up

67
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
To take off like

68
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
The bar that's over my windows

69
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
And it's

70
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:08,639
Dealing with the situation they had to put in these industrial dehumidifier

71
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:15,039
In my room

72
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:20,159
Taking care of this problem in the way that the building insisted we do it

73
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,999
And still record and get the episode

74
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:29,119
Impossible we were unable to do that it's resolved now

75
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:34,239
And after some real real drama

76
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
Stamp Apartments

77
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,575
I don't I don't know maybe I have some really bizarre expectations but I expect

78
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
Communication from

79
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Expect

80
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
Third floor apartment

81
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Not the flood

82
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,767
Yeah yeah those earlier

83
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:02,655
That is

84
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
For me in terms of like

85
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,543
Frustration feeling out of the loop about my own living space

86
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,895
Just awful but there's actually a hidden bright spot in it

87
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
And that is that last night

88
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
As the machines were blaring

89
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:26,207
I have been told that they were coming to take out the machines yesterday and they didn't

90
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,791
The afternoon the no one was coming

91
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Last night

92
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,143
It's so loud in my apartment it's awful

93
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,543
I think they're coming today the next day to take out the machine but now I don't know I don't know

94
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,615
I just got out I got to work

95
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,455
Working in case were able to record I got to get this all together

96
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,783
Miserable as I love

97
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Doing the show

98
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Like in that awkward moment

99
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,415
I had a Moment of clarity

100
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:02,815
This is so caught up repairing the stuff like there was a stripping away of some of the like

101
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
I felt really grateful

102
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
To be doing this and thankful for

103
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:13,567
People who will make it possible if you know and people who listen to

104
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,407
It's just that it was it was great in that dark moment

105
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,295
Preparing to do a show I really enjoy doing some really funny stuff that we're going to be

106
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343
Able to talk about it people enjoy it

107
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,391
Like it's a it's a

108
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,255
Pierced through the misery

109
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
The only way to get clarity

110
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:41,215
There's no atheists in foxholes and there's no

111
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:48,127
So in that Spirit let's take a moment to say thank you

Jordan the 18th through 21st episodes of The Alex Jones Show

143
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119

144
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,935
Kind of disappeared

145
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,519

Ric

156
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
To be honest

157
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,823
This is a preoccupation for most of the episode it goes on

158
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
Seems to be one of these

159
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
Biggest concern

160
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,967

00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:06,175
Episode

00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,271

194
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
What who cares

195
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:58,911
Why does anyone need

196
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:05,055
I don't care

197
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,151
They're very but they're very mean towards me

198
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:14,527
Generally not a good indication of consent

199
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Great all right

200
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,207

201
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
So across the Milky Way

00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
Man

203
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
This upside-down cross

204
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,191
Is it actually crossed it's just

205
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,919
The symbol of entropy I don't know

206
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:48,319
Talking secretly going backwards

207
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,343
You touches on this

208
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,695
Too much it is

209
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
In addition to complaining

210
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
Something-or-other about the Coronavirus

211
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727

Flinders University scientist

Coronavirus

221
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,903
First of all Alex from Austria or Australia

222
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
About this study

223
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,863
Study observed a coincidence or a sign of human intervention in the creation of the virus

224
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:10,751
The right there

225
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:16,127
Global pandemic

226
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
Here's another

227
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,759
Study led by Nikolai

228
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Uncle

229
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,927
Professor of medicine at Flinders university has not reviewed and remained inconclusive

230
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
It's another one of these

231
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,863
I look forward to the some of these conclusions be challenged and looked at interview process

232
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:43,007
Alex ignore that pretend of the globalist refreshing after retracted or something

233
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:47,615
Stop pretending

234
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
Some of the stuff you saying is just completely made up like a stuff about the study involving to his HIV narratives that is nowhere in this

235
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
Also just because it's fun

236
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,743
The researcher who

237
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:09,375
These are generally easily recognizable and hands clear signatures of human intervention in the creation of the virus

238
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:16,031
These artificial inserts are not present has been interpreted by some to mean this virus is not the result of human manipulation

239
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:22,943
The guy who authored the study said because certain things are not present

240
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:30,367
That would be that would Point directly towards it not being human human intervention lack of presence

241
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:35,743
Of these artificial inserts to believe that it's not the result

242
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:42,143
Episode Alex's rambling about inserts

243
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:47,775
Everybody can see ours on the DNA

244
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,223
So you have this guy does Nikolai Petrosky put out this

245
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Where is not

246
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:03,391
Signs of artificial

247
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,719
Can I have to choose one or the other their contradictory

248
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
Keanu Reeves said that chicks dig

249
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:16,191
So this study is going to probably become a big piece of Alex's stuff

250
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,591
And you still pushing that Indian study that got retracted from way back

251
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,175
A story about Bill Gates being responsible

252
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
Germany

253
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,871
That you better withdraw that paper so they withdrew that paper

254
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Better withdraw that paper

255
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
Wall

256
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,391
We challenged those challenging it to show us any proof no one challenges

257
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:13,279
Wow wow wow okay alright

258
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:18,143
Throw awesome

259
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,959
It's fascinating how much like

260
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
His mind just

261
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,175
That's a good thought I had

262
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
Weirdo

263
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:38,111
So Alex gets to talking about some put out by the the Health and Human Services

264
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
Department

265
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
It's interesting how

266
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Situation he's sort of like

267
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Yeah

268
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
Covers half of

269
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Half of the news

270
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,175
Headlines from Reuters

271
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,759
The first paragraph of the article

272
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:14,463
Us authorities are not yet seen spikes in coronavirus cases in places that are reopening but it was still too early to determine

273
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Such trends

274
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,815
Secretary Azar said on Sunday

275
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:24,703
Give me the progression of how the virus has seemed to spread and given the fact that we're still not in a good place with on-demand testing

276
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
You insist like this quickly

277
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
We will have to wait and see what happens

278
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,431
First part of the story while ignoring the part where

279
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,783
Journalistic malpractice Appliance

280
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:54,399
Hydraulics

281
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,775
Abused that clipart

282
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:06,943
Now I can't win any every single time

283
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
Yep

284
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:35,104
So this is Coronavirus

285
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,152
So this is an interesting story

286
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:42,528
Because it's one of those bun instances where Alex's be reporting this story in the complete opposite

287
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,320
Based on everything he stands for

288
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:50,464
There's no indication of his lab in Seattle was putting at sites to give 100% 12 positive than any higher

289
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,512
False positive

290
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
It was heavily funded by Gates those pat on the head for not making that part up

291
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,520
University of Washington which is running a program called the Seattle coronavirus assessment Network

292
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,824
Basically what they did was send out test

293
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Whoever wanted them

294
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,664
People swab themselves and sent the sample back to be process

295
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,480
The reasoning was that many people who are sick

296
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,320
Likely not sick enough to go to the doctor

297
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
Other situation

298
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:25,024
What I was told early on that they needed an emergency use authorization from the state in order to run a program like this

299
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,584
Where they would give test results people who submit protest

300
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:33,728
Hey March the state of Washington gave them a purple but now the FDA is saying they need Federal approval as well

301
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,640
I'm not sure where I land on this I assume there's probably some benefits a nationally coordinated responses which make the meeting Federal

302
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Google make sense

303
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:45,248
I'm not sure I understand all the details I'm going to stop short of having a solid position

304
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
However

305
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,832
Does mr. states rights

306
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:54,720
He absolutely should not be into this lab being shut down by the federal government with the state government already approved what they're doing

307
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
He believes

308
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,792
And pretend principles are

309
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:05,216
Anyway Alex's by Emma Smith Society this is just a temporary hold this lab has until they can get some details ironed out about the author is

310
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,264
Station to release results to people

311
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,616
How to completely making up details of the story to make it sound more to fairies because

312
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
He's a liar

313
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
Yeah

314
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,992
Really just about the clearance

315
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
People results

316
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:24,928
Oh everything is positive

317
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
The situation

318
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,744
When the federal government

319
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,584
Doing whatever they want and saying okay well then f****** sue me about it

320
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,168
Now is not the time to pretend that you have to follow anybody's rules

321
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
Tell him to f****** tsuyu

322
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
It's wild the situation

323
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,896
That's what I'm advocating everyone commit

324
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,944
Every crime they can think of

325
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,760
Potato corner

326
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:55,392
Is that a bad idea

327
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:59,744
That last clip was Alex trying desperately demonized

328
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,792
Because that's what he does

329
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,400
Animes like sloppy does that kind of embarrassing Lee and it's also pretty fun

330
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,128
Devil ritual

331
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:23,552
I'd like to flashback to the months and months of coverage Alex movie Yelling about MS-13

332
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,904
24-hour notice

333
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,720
They're the hardest

334
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,560
But Bill Gates

335
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,088
Reportedly

336
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:04,768
I'd like to see the reporter Got Back 9 year old demon

337
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:11,168
What are we going to do I don't know already a demonic hopping around mad

338
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,752
Which is your favorite gremlin from Gremlins 2

339
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:19,872
I don't remember exactly

340
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
This is so ridiculous

341
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,224
It's amazing

342
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,624
Yeah makes it hilarious by 10

343
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,672
Reportedly

344
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:39,328
Way to you could look at it as a way to not get

345
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:45,216
I think it's Alex Pretender some credible backing

346
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Okay

347
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,080
Alright who's doing nine-year-old

348
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,664
Surveys of whether or not people are demons yet that's a good

349
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,968
That's a good job for a ridiculous

350
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,760
So you know

351
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,552
If you were a demon at 9

352
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,648
You would obviously grow up to marry someone

353
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:09,792
Cross on TV

354
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,840
Skip the talking more about this cross

355
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
Upside-down cross

356
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,552
Even more power

357
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
When you actually carry out the app

358
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:40,512
So Alex spends a lot of time in this episode complaining about Melinda Gates wearing this upside down cross necklace

359
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,560
Satanic

360
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:47,424
Alex asked why someone wearing upside-down cross

361
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
Maybe they're Catholic

362
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:53,568
The upside down cross is the symbol of St Peter before father of the Pope

363
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,456
As The Story Goes Peter was crucified upside down because he was too humble to be killed in the same manner is Jesus

364
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:04,832
Upside-down cross became as simple and important one for the Catholic Church

365
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,160
To the upside down cross in real life

366
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:12,256
That's just something from movies and imagery that used metal and punk bands

367
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:19,168
The fact that goes on and on about never once mentioned lacrosse St Peter really leads me to believe that he

368
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
Very little familiarity with Christianity

369
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,800
And I know that stuff

370
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,872
Legitimately everything else you talk about comes from movie

371
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:32,736
So why should we be surprised to learn that

372
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:37,344
Is very public about her Catholic faith

373
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,632
This is John.

374
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:56,032
The best we're one step away from morning Zoo

375
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:02,432
You got a sound not quite not quite I still need to find I need

376
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:06,528
Jewel soundboard

377
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:11,904
Symbol of the Catholic Church

378
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,976
So this leads into Alex talkin about other SIM

379
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Cuz he knows a lot

380
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,608
Are we really doing really dude

381
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,496
A 10000 year old Norse symbol for death

382
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
With a circle around it

383
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,904
Gentleman

384
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Why would

385
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
Why would they

386
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
Total

387
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
Complete

388
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Okay

389
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:03,872
Did he symbol was created by Christian pacifist artist named Gerald Holton back in 1958

390
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,944
Years ago

391
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:12,576
Is disgusting a profile inspiration was the naval semaphore Flags

392
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:18,720
4 M & D combine to form the peace sign which was meant to stand for nuclear disarmament

393
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
The other part was

394
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
I was in despair

395
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
Deep despair

396
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:27,424
I drew myself the representative of an individual in despair with

397
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Palms

398
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:32,032
Stretched out words and downwards in a manner of goya's peasant

399
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,312
Before the firing squad

400
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:38,176
I fertilize the drawing into a line and put a circle around it it was ridiculous at first

401
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,456
And such a puny thing

402
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,320
The symbol was adopted by the anti-war protesters and hippies and we all know where want from there

403
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,392
The most popular Norse symbol for death is the falcon

404
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:51,488
Which is three triangles intersecting and it literally looks nothing like a peace sign

405
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:56,096
Alex is probably thinking of hedra cell which is the north symbol that involves

406
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
The tree in a circle

407
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:01,216
This does not symbolize death however it symbolizes the connection of all things

408
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,264
And sometimes called the Tree of Life

409
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,568
Also it doesn't really look like a p symbol

410
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
Honestly this is just kind of sad

411
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,896
I was just making s*** up

412
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,432
Which is nothing new

413
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,016
You being a stupid blowhard about symbology it's the most

414
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Pathetic Direct

415
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,320
Can you take your fake expertise in

416
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:22,720
Even if you're right you've not proving anything do you know the word that is not right now and the worst one

417
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:27,328
The most demonic one is when Kellogg

418
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,912
Co-opted a 10000 year old symbol

419
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,448
Of Captain Crunch

420
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:36,032
And that obviously symbolizes

421
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:41,920
Disruption of copper

422
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,224
Set the main issue that I have with cap

423
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:50,624
Ancient Phoenician text cotton candy version of Captain Crunch

424
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
Stop by the crunch berries

425
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,352
May I used to get to

426
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,656
I want to get

427
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
Are we

428
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,360
Are we

429
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
Buddy

430
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
Buddy

431
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272

432
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
Jo-Ann's

433
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,768
This weekend I'm going to be up here

434
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,048
Working on

435
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:43,104
Super excited

436
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,480
I got those looking for you about that next

437
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:54,368
Alex releases release

438
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
Very excited

439
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:02,048
I'm going to spend the time on my show right now that I could be using to get the news out to you

440
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:07,168
That there will be a documentary that I am thinking about doing but have not done and probably won't ever

441
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,568
And I

442
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,152

Great products

444
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:21,504
Instaff going this conversation so regularly on air

445
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,856
D.c. Mall of his producers

446
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,928

00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,744
Just need to get to the snooze.

448
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
About the upside-down cross

449
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,120
Piece of news

450
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,704
Like about himself because of course of course

451
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
Articles

452
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
Friday

453
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
Navigation

454
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
It's just that

455
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,344
My name is

456
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
I just how it is

457
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,840
Pretentious

458
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
What

459
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,544
I might get to a couple of important things here

460
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:35,488
I'm just not going to I'm not going to do it which is selling this

461
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:43,680
Take some time off

462
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,728
This is so

463
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
Because

464
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
Cuz what

465
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,672
Amazon I got to go hide I got to put down my shoulder

466
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
Just not do any work

467
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,072
In and out

468
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,120
Because you

469
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,728
Spoiler alert it is not follow through with any of that

470
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:23,104
Earlier stupid was I'm going to not fear to work on that

471
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:29,504
And now he's not even going to work on that I don't think any of this happened Alex does not do his show

472
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,832
Regularly for most of the week is there

473
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
So I don't know

474
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:40,256
I love it I love it you spell Yer so

475
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:44,608
Get out of here man I don't know I don't want to do this

476
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:53,056
Ends up yelling about

477
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:59,456
Is Alan dershowitz mandatory

478
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,504
I don't know how much

479
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,576
Pest Control

480
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
This baby

481
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Fire projectiles

482
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
Norman

483
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
Did you delay that out

484
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,880
Here is that unedited

485
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,440
I don't have to worry about guns

486
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
Are projectiles

487
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,912
It's you

488
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
Your

489
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
If you delay.

490
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,648
Fair right now

491
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
What a baby cow

492
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,256
Wow

493
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:26,752
Somehow

494
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:32,896
That's weird gray area

495
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:39,296
What it tells me to

496
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,112
Alex is not concerned about radio station

497
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
No not really at all

498
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,744
Because otherwise you'd be much more careful

499
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,608
On radio station

500
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
Kicked off the station

501
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
Too much

502
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,496
So Alex is really mad at

503
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,568
This just goes on a little bit longer

504
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,104
Breakdown

505
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,896
A lot about Alan dershowitz

506
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,432
Just can't help it

507
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Okay

508
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
It doesn't sound right

509
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:44,576
So Alex gets into finally talking about the Secret Service story

510
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,856
Funny

511
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:52,256
Probably believe everything Alex the same

512
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,096
Ono first part of the story

513
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
A service

514
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,400
They said well you didn't go to the meeting or whatever and I said okay man I was

515
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:45,248
Around the RNC

516
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,832
Because he was partying he was too drunk to meet with them

517
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:54,208
So basically dealing with his keynote speech

518
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,000
So early

519
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:00,608
Oh that's right now I remember you

520
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,168
Is that the deplorable

521
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,752
He was rambling around by peeing on a tree

522
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,080
How where Atlantis

523
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:16,736
Yeah he does end up eventually making contact with the Secret Service

524
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:21,088
They're concerned that he has information about a plot to assassinate Trump right

525
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:27,488
Answer you would think maybe Alex has some deep in town or somebody's told him something

526
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,560
What is information is it's so lame

527
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:42,848
Can you send us

528
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
Foggy Bottom

529
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,784
Really said that

530
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:03,328
So Alex just sent the link to the CNN or MSNBC interview yelled at all the time

531
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:09,728
This is apparently the Secret Service

532
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:15,360
Billy Riley

533
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,664
Wow

534
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,040
I can't believe that I absolutely believe

535
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:29,440
Do you guys have this widely publicly available information that everybody's already talked about for a while

536
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,976
If you don't guess what

537
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:37,120
Phil Mudd is coming to kill the president Alex the uncovered an actual plot

538
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
Man

539
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,216
This dude is I love it

540
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,544
Lost lost in his imagination

541
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,896
Alex hasn't

542
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,456
Which is you know just basically a

543
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,784
Seems like every time he's on all they want to talk about is like

544
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,488
Luna going on

545
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,792
Turns out I have made people love

546
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
Which is weird

547
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,632
Yhl directed lockdown

548
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,936
Hong Kong Taiwan

549
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,752
With macron that was super

550
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Popular

551
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,296
Subic narratives about the motives for the globalist

552
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,880
Releasing his bioweapon was but there was

553
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,696
There's momentum growing around like the yellow vests

554
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:38,816
Because the globalist you're scared of this stuff

555
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,376
According to Alex is very stupid

556
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:48,032
Fury and the reason so dumb is because Alex believes that everyone's convictions are just as flimsy as his own

557
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,824
All his political positions

558
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:56,223
Completely changeable consciously or subconsciously

559
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
One else has the same way

560
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
Well they're doing what we're doing

561
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,367
Because we're doing what they're doing

562
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:08,767
Any evil group worth their salt

563
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,559
Novolin would consider that plan

564
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:17,215
So now we have Alex reporting the numbers from Spain that the government is not popular come out

565
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,519
Counter to his Crush

566
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:25,407
Instead of considering a baby he just made that narrative up and it's based on nothing except his imagination

567
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,479
He reports it is proof that the globalist plan is backfiring

568
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,551
And this is a really good demonstration of why this

569
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,343
This pattern of thinking has no way out

570
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:38,463
Things that prove or disprove your arbitrary narrative used to support your narrative

571
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:45,119
It's basically the same thing as Alex predicting globalstar going to kill Trump in the next few weeks and then what it doesn't happen he can claim

572
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:49,983
We stopped at telling the Secret Service about a CNN interview

573
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:55,615
That's the way this other stuff works

574
00:42:55,871 --> 00:43:00,991
Right now there is a plot

575
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:08,159
Like I don't care about 8 and I've been doing this a immigrant

576
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,439
It's not

577
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:14,047
What are some fun things that end up getting

578
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,095
Policy on Commerce

579
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,143
Funny. We don't need them

580
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
Don't give

581
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,335
Globalist affiliation left

582
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
$1

583
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Make sure you

584
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:40,159
Mid-America and death

585
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
Any longer

586
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,823
Right now are still at

587
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,407
Oh

588
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,391
I think it might be interesting for him to go

589
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:17,279
Anti-immigrant bathing that he actually does what I would recommend which is shoplocal a Dino

590
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:23,679
Mass produced products

591
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:28,543
I don't know I think all that's made up a supposed leftist

592
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:34,943
Thrift shops

593
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:38,015
Is huge for the thrift industry or whatever

594
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,575
Headline

595
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,111
The backlash

596
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,135
Has begun

597
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,399
Decency and normality

598
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
So this story sounded really dumb

599
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
First let me say that

600
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:10,271
Even if you help fix someone's car and feel like having a loving gesture

601
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:13,855
All Things Considered

602
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,439
You may not know this Jordan but there's a rash of cheek

603
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,255
Kissing related crime going on

604
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:31,519
Fifteen-year-old girl and kissed her on the cheek

605
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:37,919
Yeah actually that story is really wild cuz he ended up writing his phone number on her hand parents

606
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:44,319
Her to call and set up a meeting

607
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:50,719
Citizens arrested him

608
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:57,119
The worst Predators schedule in September 2019

609
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,727
Rested after you kissed a local news reporter on the Cheap on live TV

610
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,823
Jesus in March 2019

611
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,871
Since you woke up to him kissing her on the cheek

612
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,199
Would you let the unlawful entry assault and battery charge

613
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,247
There were way more stories by

614
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,807
Cheek kissing related crime

615
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:20,159
In the past year that I would have imagined

616
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,975
I like face masks now I want a full like

617
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:27,583
Let's get those spit guards and everything to whatever the case our story right here

618
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,423
Well this is about a lorry driver who got stuck under a low bridge

619
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:36,799
70s help guide him out of being stuck and after he got out your approach her and kissed her on the cheek

620
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:41,919
A lot of people online or making fun of the Derbyshire police's tweet about it that said quote

621
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:48,575
We are appealing for help to identify a man who kissed a woman on the cheek to thank her for helping him when his Lorry became stuck under a low bridge

622
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:53,183
People were saying that the police state can a man not kissing lady on the cheek anymore

623
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,023
And of course the police released a statement that made the situation very clear

624
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
Quote

625
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:04,191
We issued an appeal for information this morning after a woman was kissed on the cheek and then unwanted gesture from a man she did not know

626
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,519
The incident left the woman who's in her 70s very distressed

627
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,847
Especially at a time when close contact with strangers is to be avoided

628
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,711
She reported it to us and in the sexual offences act of 2000

629
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,807
The police would straight up not give a single f*** about this if the woman

630
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
Had not reported

631
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:25,183
She felt violated by the gesture and the police were just taking her report seriously

632
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,719
I tried to handle the situation

633
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,511
Like think about

634
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,327
Who exactly is Alex making fun of here

635
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:35,679
That's important to remember because he thinks he's targeting the police gear

636
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:42,079
Like they're overreacting and offended by in effect

637
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,127
Mocking the 70-year old lady

638
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,735
To Alex she doesn't have the right to not thankfully it's after the kiss of a stranger

639
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,831
Alex was lying about what the story is in order to make people mad about

640
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,879
Get mad about it

641
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:59,999
The thing in the real world they're mad about is the 70-year old woman having boundaries

642
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,559
Yeah that's the real world

643
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,095
Part of this

644
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,935
Any anger directed towards the story is

645
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:11,263
Bubble tours in reality version of it doesn't exist

646
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,311
I just I just can't

647
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,383
I just can't handle people how do you not

648
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,711
Like the first thing I think of whenever I think of that story is

649
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,271
Why the f*** are you kissing her on the cheek

650
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,575
How are you do you not know

651
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,391
Like where is social distancing like she was then

652
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,927
Just like the best

653
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,207
Elmo

654
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
Elbow handshake

655
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
Something like that

656
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,863
Kiss a seventy-year-old high-risk woman

657
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,935
That's insane

658
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:46,591
Little glimpses little stories to remember

659
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
There's 100

660
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,151
There's just so many

661
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:54,271
They're just Fingerprints of how bad a job he does on everything

662
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,063
Like he's just really not good

663
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
Thank you

664
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
So

665
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:08,863
Hilarious

666
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:15,519
Alex discusses how he had appealed

667
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,543
Applied

668
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,103
4D small business money

669
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,223
Who's pretending they did it as a test

670
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
Do it

671
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,799
Alright

672
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,431
Whenever it's for ideological

673
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,455
Alex

674
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,319
Are the journalistic Endeavor

675
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,855
Absolute

676
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
Man

677
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:10,559
This is my oldest brother is a socialist

678
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,887
Conservatism in the I don't think he's into q but he's

679
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,911
Kiewit Jason

680
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:19,775
And he wouldn't he was telling me about how he's on unemployment right now and I just wanted to throw my

681
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
My phone into a

682
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,103
Lake like I just wanted to toss it into the lake

683
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,919
I can't handle that level of

684
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,223
Well I mean if I need it I'll take it

685
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,759
Lite-Brite

686
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,063
Idiots you should start

687
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,087
Forget it

688
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,207
So there's a video going around

689
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:44,351
That is frustrating I'm sorry

690
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,655
Right

691
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:54,079
Yeah there's a video going around that it was Alex with some water noodles on his head

692
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:58,175
I think that was from cuz it's not on this episode

693
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,455
But Alex

694
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:02,271
About inspired

695
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:06,623
Videos or pictures that you see if people at like cafes

696
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:11,487
With water noodles on their head

697
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
Foam

698
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,679
Noodles on their heads

699
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,775
Now this is what goes on

700
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,335
Europe

701
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,967
For social distancing

702
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:32,991
They're not

703
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,295
People on earth

704
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,087
Family Show

705
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,695
English Arabic

706
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,743
You seem to be a lot today

707
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,559
So how are people on earth

708
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,447
You should take a nap Snickers

709
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:56,799
Beretta earlier

710
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:01,151
So Alex is knock it off

711
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:06,271
18

712
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,927
Really but we got lots of videos I got a million views or more

713
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
Medical doctor

714
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,535
Virology

715
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:22,911
Rockefeller Hospital in heads of virology in Australia

716
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:27,775
Nobel Prize winners for ology coming out the same covid-19

717
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,359
Don't have a million 10 million 15 million views I get banned

718
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,503
Medical doctor

719
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,183
What are the stories permission

720
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:50,815
Yeah.

721
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:54,911
If they have it that's pretty shity but come with

722
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:01,311
Do they got half a million on YouTube that means that when I repost it I already have half a million

723
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:07,455
Video

724
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:13,855
Alex Remains the most popular thing on my website with around 100,000

725
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,623
70000

726
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:20,767
There's some anomalies that I saw like a little clip that he made that was Pro Tucker Carlson dab 290,000

727
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:25,119
But it gets really really sad really fast when you leave Alex's Channel

728
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:32,031
Owen Shroyer War Room episode from May 20th and sitting at 1500 views as I prepare this episode

729
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,103
The 19th is only at 7,500

730
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,407
David nights numbers are comparably depressing

731
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:43,807
A little better than Alex's May network shows pulling in between 2000

732
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:48,927
Videos of surprise

733
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,743
But that's just because he's still on YouTube

734
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:56,095
Alex recently gave David I could Channel

735
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:59,935
And that doesn't seem to have been taken off side taking off

736
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:03,263
Expected under 25 thousand

737
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:08,383
Is there's exactly one with more than a billion views

738
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,919
Is 1.4 million

739
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:13,759
This is not something Alex made it's just something that you took from someone else

740
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,039
It's a reposting

741
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:21,439
Plandemic

742
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,767
Indie creator

743
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:29,887
Steve has a multi-millionaire on 26 in the media industry

744
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,911
This is pathetic

745
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:36,543
I guess congratulations to Alex reposting someone else's documentary

746
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:42,943
Really a strong indication that things are working out in house

747
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,271
Not his

748
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:54,207
Mdcclxxvi is 1984 when Hillary for prison

749
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,399
That's great

750
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:08,543
It's very weird to buy on your own

751
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,591
Yeah

752
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:15,711
None of the Rockefellers measured up until his early night

753
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,415
I just passed

754
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,207
Turn on power to royalty

755
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:32,607
Well the decision was made to make Bill Gates

756
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,167
The New World Order

757
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,263
About 12 years ago

758
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:44,383
35 years

759
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,199
Asbestos

760
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:59,743
Imagination

761
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:06,143
That was Bill Gates has made

762
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,959
Believe in passing power down through like royalty

763
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:13,311
Let's cut back to anytime

764
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:16,383
The global is passed down wealth and power through

765
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:22,271
Rothschild Anderson Cooper

766
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,807
Doing they don't believe you

767
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:28,927
The power of undertale

768
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:33,023
Bloodlines

769
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,047
Which is a

770
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,327
Dumb dumb

771
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,607
Alex

772
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,399
Have to do the show I think

773
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,935
He probably would have taken off

774
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:46,079
Maybe I don't know maybe

775
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:54,015
F****** idiot As Trump got on TV and said you was taking hydroxy

776
00:56:54,271 --> 00:57:00,415
Chloroquine

777
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,399
Ammoman

778
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,935
Show complete

779
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,727
Crystal Clear fraud

780
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,271
Treason

781
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:28,831
Deception

782
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,231
Precision and fear of ideas

783
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
Patient

784
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,839
Inverted

785
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:46,239
Humanity I've been diverting nice

786
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
Tentacle

787
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,407
Chloroquine

788
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,199
One of the only known

789
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,015
That actually works

790
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,807
For Respiratory illnesses

791
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
Lupus

792
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,391
No no

793
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,183
Sure

794
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:11,071
It's also known as the only treatment of off drug that works in lupus

795
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,191
Hundreds and hundreds of studies that hydroxychloroquine

796
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:21,823
When taking the first stages of a coronavirus covid-19 infection

797
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,455
So Alex makes a few points there that I'd like to address

798
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:33,087
He says that he is the only known treatments that works for Respiratory illness

799
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,951
So I consulted Artie magazine about this client which does not stand for Russia Today

800
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,743
It's actually respiratory therapy

801
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,279
In their article

802
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:47,679
Pharmacological treatment of respiratory disorders

803
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,447
Comes up

804
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:53,567
There's so many medications that are used to treat respiratory illnesses and those two are not on the list

805
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,407
Just think about all the inhaler base things like albuterol then

806
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,175
You add some

807
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:02,783
Corticosteroid the different strategies

808
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,879
To deal with respiratory conditions

809
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:13,791
There are definitely uses for Respiratory conditions

810
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,815
Just making that up

811
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,119
He says he's from malaria which is true

812
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,655
Alex has earned a little pat on the head

813
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,423
For that

814
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:25,823
The event says that it's known as one of the only off drugs that works for lupus and I have no idea what it off drug is

815
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,919
What he's trying to say

816
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:34,271
Hydroxychloroquine is prescribed for Lupus under the name Plaquenil

817
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
Yeah that's

818
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:38,879
Really one of the big reasons why it's a bad idea to cause a run on this medication

819
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,951
Because it's only going to hurt people who

820
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:45,023
But I would still understand or care about that

821
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,863
Either way Angie Bolero drugs are only part of the approach

822
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,191
Treatment and management lupus

823
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,215
Complicated game

824
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,519
And if you go to Louis. Org

825
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:58,335
You can read up on the various medications that are used to help people

826
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,103
With the condition

827
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:02,943
Including steroids anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants

828
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:09,599
How to claim that hydroxychloroquine is one of the only treatments for Lupus is painfully reductive in a pretty strong indication that he has no idea what

829
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
He's talking about

830
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:16,255
Event goes on to assert there are hundreds and hundreds of studies that show that the medication is perfect in its effectiveness

831
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,559
Stages

832
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
After catching

833
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,351
The Coronavirus

834
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:24,447
There aren't hundreds of stories about type core Quinn and Coronavirus

835
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,495
. he's just making that s*** huh

836
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:30,847
Most of the recent studies show that it is not effective at all and possibly dangerous

837
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,663
A few days before Alex recorded this episode

838
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,223
Two new studies were published in bmj which

839
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:39,551
Compared with standard treatment

840
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:45,951
Do use of hydroxychloroquine did not increase the likelihood of virus elimination in Chinese patients with mild-to-moderate covid-19

841
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:51,583
Have any effect on reducing admissions to intensive care

842
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,863
With more severe illness

843
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:57,727
Both studies found a higher rate of Adverse Events in patients treated with the drug

844
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:04,639
I understand that it's Alex's job to run Trump defense whenever he says something stupid or dangerous need to pretend that there's some kind of

845
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:08,991
Hidden reality wearing Trump is actually right in the people criticizing by the stupid one

846
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,271
But this is too much

847
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:14,623
Jump straight up went on TV and said he was taking hydroxychloroquine which is just Madness

848
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:18,975
He's either Ryan which is absurd and very hard to guess why a person would do that

849
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,047
Who is telling the truth and either has covid-19 or thanks

850
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:22,815
Without any

851
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
Any evidence

852
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,887
Quit taking it will protect him from getting infected

853
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,935
There's nothing I can say

854
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,775
Trump claims people jump

855
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:35,103
Italy

856
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,639
Boots and coming up with

857
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:39,455
Completely nonsensical rationalizations why Trump

858
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,271
Said that stupid thing it's actually secretly smart

859
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,295
What a f****** loser

860
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,087
Take the day off

861
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:54,559
Isn't that a crime can you get that gave you isn't that making false medical claims I guess that he's not selling

862
01:01:55,583 --> 01:02:01,727
I still think you could probably get in trouble for making

863
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,519
God what

864
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,055
Well everybody stupid

865
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,407
Say that and I was just like

866
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,687
This is what

867
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,223
This is what

868
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:12,991
Feels like

869
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,063
Cuz I heard him say that and I was like

870
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,599
I guess

871
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,623
Fine

872
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:25,279
The end there's a sinking feeling of like that can't stop that

873
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:31,679
F*** it and don't give a s*** real Trump is saying because

874
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,031
Why not

875
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:39,615
The president is a fraud and a liar and

876
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,455
When he makes Acura

877
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,503
His own personal doctor

878
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,807
To take it preventatively with Zayn

879
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,599
My God

880
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,159
Knockout is bacterial Flora

881
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,255
Taking probiotics

882
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,559
He's with

883
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,959
What is the CIA

884
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,543
Please ignore

885
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,823
Trump Medical

886
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:21,855
Washington Post

887
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,135
Doctor

888
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,975
Coronavirus

889
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
This is the top

890
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,167
He's a fraud impeach him

891
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,959
Calling for hearings

892
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:43,615
So as I understand that there are some hearings that are happening right now about the government's response to the virus I've heard anyone say

893
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,151
Leading to impeachment

894
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:51,551
I think Alex is complaining this stuff in The house's ongoing investigation into the instances of possible obstruction of justice

895
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,575
Report

896
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,599
Is Noah

897
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,623
McAllen

898
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:58,463
We've reached the point now it's Jones's career is cheerleading for the present

899
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,863
Only federal government has followers that it's a good idea to take a medication that's

900
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:11,519
I really thought this guy hated the federal government it was intrinsically distrustful of his singular executive

901
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,079
So weird

902
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:17,151
Almost like he never really believed any of that should be yelled into a bullhorn

903
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:23,807
I will say that he's super lucky but his audience is too dumb to realize that that's which happened because to anyone who's paying attention

904
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,599
This is f****** ridiculous

905
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:31,999
Trump is going to wind up killing himself by his own stupidity and

906
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:41,727
And then we're all going to f****** die in a civil war

907
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,495
Stupid

908
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,567
He's going to die and kill us all

909
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:50,431
I do think I mean I don't know how likely that is but I will say that if

910
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,711
Buy some

911
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,247
Workhorse of weird

912
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:56,575
Awful coincidence he does end up dying

913
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,343
Thursday

914
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,391
Unhealthiness or some just

915
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,671
Natural causes

916
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,487
Absolutely it's going to be a conspiracy

917
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,279
How do I know that

918
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:09,375
This is how we're going to get the granddaughter of Martin Luther King jr.

919
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:15,263
In the White House

920
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,591
Coronavirus

921
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,895
Guess we might not think it's a virus

922
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,687
I don't know where he stands are now

923
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:28,063
You sing in this next clip babe it's a deficiency of vitamin D basically

924
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:32,415
SWAT team medical doctors

925
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,255
Want you to know

926
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,303
Disease

927
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,119
D3

928
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,471
Major Yahoo news last week

929
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,591
Covid-19

930
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,407
Deficient in D3

931
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:58,783
Ron I'm not sure what he thinks is AIU study I don't know that

932
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:04,927
Northwestern University

933
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:10,815
Patience from countries with high covid-19 mortality rates had lower levels of vitamin D

934
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:14,143
Compared to patients in countries that were not as severely affect

935
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,959
The head of research of backman

936
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:22,847
Well I think it's important for people to know that vitamin D deficiency may play a role in mortality

937
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,151
We don't need to put vitamin D on everybody

938
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:29,247
Is needs further study and I hope our work will stimulate interest in this area

939
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:35,903
Illuminate the mechanism of mortality which has proven could lead to new therapeutic targets

940
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:42,303
The theory the back man has is it hasn't higher levels of vitamin D produced the risk of complications

941
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,119
But that a lot of people would still be dying from the virus

942
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:50,495
Nothing in this study demonstrated that everyone who died at vitamin D deficiency just making that up

943
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:56,639
There was some other studies on the subject but they're even further from what Alex is talking about that's not what

944
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,175
Poem from I have no idea

945
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:01,247
This is an interesting area to be looked at

946
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:06,623
Yet so we will see what comes after further examination

947
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:10,719
Either way literally no one is saying a vitamin D could be an effective treatment

948
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,743
For this

949
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:19,423
There may be a correlation between vitamin D and higher complication probability

950
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,447
These are

951
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,727
Essential piece in it

952
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:28,127
Alex is Translating that into everyone who died at Vitamin D

953
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:35,039
Information there does not also coincide with

954
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,087
Less privileged population

955
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:41,439
Vitamins in in all of that

956
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:46,815
Probably more likely to die as well

957
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,631
Exact possibly feel like screaming all the

958
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,959
It's me

959
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:57,311
Got arrested

960
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:03,711
And here I am a Detroit Clinic and literally claim that high dose IV vitamin C infusions would protect people

961
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,991
From Catching the virus

962
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,271
He was committing fraud

963
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,575
Also committing Medicare fraud

964
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:11,135
According to a Daily Beast article about his arrest

965
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:17,535
Quotes

966
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
Continue to work

967
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
And treat patients

968
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:24,959
At least one of them was assigned by Bach to treat covid-19 patients because that employee quote

969
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,775
Had already Kanter are contracted the virus

970
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:34,687
This is not so much a problem but doctor giving people vitamin C it's more of these broad aspect that the courts are concerned

971
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:39,295
Heard about that's weirdly so often that he misses the forest for the trees

972
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,367
Don't care about doctor giving someone vitamin C

973
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:45,439
They care if they do it in a fraudulent way

974
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:48,255
In the same way no one cares if you kiss someone on the cheek

975
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:50,303
The longest to be kissed on the cheek

976
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,631
Alex seems incapable of understanding context which makes sense

977
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,679
Picking up whatever that's not new

978
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:02,335
You can also get him on an attempted murder is letting people who have covid-19

979
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:07,711
Attempted manslaughter

980
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,735
To be fair

981
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,879
Sure I'm not entirely sure that Witnesses correct but that's proof

982
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:20,511
I'm just saying that if I'm here and that I'm giving it a I'm putting it on the list Jesus

983
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:23,071
Here's where all this starts to get really

984
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:29,215
Troubling Alex makes a claim that I think I'm glad that this is where it all starts to get troubling everything

985
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:35,615
Alex makes a claim that I think is a little bit maybe past what he should be saying

986
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:44,063
Because it loads the South

987
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,135
You don't need to file

988
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,463
I looked into the doctor

989
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,047
Long-term.

990
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,655
If you got the B3 in the sea

991
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,079
When you have

992
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:16,319
Pretty bad

993
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,135
Pretty obvious

994
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:23,743
YouTube Alex's insane machine the same time as he's plugging the real red pill

995
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:27,327
Still reality that you sell zinc and has marketed these product as

996
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:32,447
And you literally said on the show right now but if you make

997
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,239
You get the Coronavirus

998
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:40,895
I really don't think that's legal yeah I'm pretty sure he should be arrested like a like a certain

999
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,199
Yeah I know this

1000
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:49,599
This should be immediately according to a 1990 study in the journal

1001
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,367
Nutrition

1002
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:56,767
Intakes

1003
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:00,095
102 300 mg of zinc per day

1004
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,143
Versus brda of 50

1005
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
2 mg

1006
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:07,007
Evidence of induced copper deficiency with attempted symptoms

1007
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,799
Anemia and neuro

1008
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,079
Neutropenia

1009
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:15,199
As well as impaired immune function and effect

1010
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,783
Do high-density lipoprotein cholesterol have been reported

1011
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,623
So there are issues with just the amount that Alex is describing

1012
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,927
I cannot necessarily

1013
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,207
Take a note

1014
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:30,047
There could be anemia you can pick copper deficiency

1015
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,607
Your immune function could be impaired

1016
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,167
Based on the 100 mg dose of zinc

1017
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,447
But he's recommending

1018
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:39,007
You have no business making these kind of recommendation

1019
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,311
Alex Cervantes would rather

1020
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,871
Kill themselves then listen to a real.

1021
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:50,527
Probably possibly

1022
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:54,623
In order to convince them that he has the answer is getting the Coronavirus

1023
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:58,719
It's really hard for me to imagine anyone acting very responsibly than this

1024
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,999
Given the circumstances

1025
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,791
This is very depressing

1026
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,583
It's pretty depressed really depressed

1027
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:06,399
That's really depressed

1028
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:11,263
There isn't one

1029
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:17,663
Alex might be it sounded like he's talking to his doctor

1030
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:20,735
Alex's doctor takes hydroxychloroquine

1031
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,527
Family doctor

1032
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,111
Medical checkup

1033
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,487
Hydroxychloroquine

1034
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:49,919
Is laughing because I think you realize is how obvious it is that his doctor is himself

1035
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,735
He laughed because he's like

1036
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:59,135
Believe people believe this is too fake even for me I have to laugh

1037
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:05,535
At the end of the shower myself

1038
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,607
Yeah I know

1039
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:16,287

I like it

1060
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:47,423
DC involved under daughter

1061
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:54,591
I don't look at it as well there's plenty of places to put it in here

1062
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:59,199
Halfway through the first hour the show Alex just starts playing the video

1063
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,527
Bill Gates being evil

1064
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:07,391
Great you does a YouTube thing

1065
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:14,047
Then it just plays like even out of commercials is it playing as video six minutes into the second

1066
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,327
That wraps up

1067
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,607
And now it's is gone

1068
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,423
He's just gone

1069
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
Football

1070
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
Which is a disaster

1071
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,079
But I thought like

1072
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,103
It's only

1073
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,639
Half an hour of this episode

1074
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:35,295
I got to listen to a little bit see if Alex comes back what happened what happened

1075
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:37,855
Oh man

1076
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,415
Navigate to the Superbowl

1077
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:44,511
This is my this is my

1078
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,047
Actually went through and started

1079
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,071
2

1080
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,375
The most famous super villain

1081
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,679
No

1082
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:54,239
They literally sounds like Bill Gates you have

1083
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,287
Marvel series UFO

1084
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
The people

1085
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,943
Many people overpopulation

1086
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,735
The population

1087
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,039
Literally sounds like

1088
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:15,999
This is going to be so amazing real is everything everything is got to be

1089
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,535
Fictional thing this

1090
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,303
Feels like

1091
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,327
Like to meet

1092
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:25,727
We can't just deal with reality reality this reminds me of this reminds me of the

1093
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,751
Truman Show

1094
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,287
I think people are all watch

1095
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:32,383
Make me lose my goddamn mind that's what's going on here that's my

1096
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,687
Conspiracy theory Bill Gates put together a show

1097
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,711
You're in on it

1098
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,247
You must

1099
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:44,415

1100
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:47,999
Tee-off on this f****** dork love it

1101
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:54,399
Treat his other employees

1102
01:16:54,655 --> 01:17:00,799
I usually give him a bench this is this bag

1103
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:03,615
Aces

1104
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,175
If you have this story here

1105
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,967
Scientist begin experiment to block

1106
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:08,735
The Sun

1107
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,551
Bill Gates

1108
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,575
Is involved with

1109
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:13,855
Video

1110
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:20,255
Bill Gates explaining his

1111
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,303
Save the world

1112
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
To Hannah

1113
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,471
My God

1114
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,519
Get that in just a sec

1115
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,055
The engineers are

1116
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:40,735
He's just a clip from The Simpsons

1117
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:49,695
Is very sad. I don't I don't know

1118
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:52,767
Play clip 2 and everyone's like

1119
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:59,167
It's got to be temps or something what is going on

1120
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:05,823
It's just nonsense Harrison being stupid because he forgets the name of Margaret Sanger

1121
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:11,199
Come on man just pretend you know what you're talkin about

1122
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,991
The gris-gris jumps in

1123
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,015
Right

1124
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,807
Are you want to talk about that idea

1125
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:22,207
Blocking out the sun humans try to beat them

1126
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:27,327
Machines with the upper hand and breathing people's batteries and stuff

1127
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:31,167
Solutions

1128
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:33,727
Just is troponin

1129
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,823
And again it's like you just

1130
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:43,199
Super villain

1131
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
Your plans are

1132
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,039
And they all sound exactly like

1133
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:53,439
This guy does not have it

1134
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,999
I hate to be a dick but this kid

1135
01:18:56,255 --> 01:19:02,143
Sucks on my political talk shows news shows

1136
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:08,799
I'm just going to go through some top 25 list of supervillain Cabana look like

1137
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:12,895
Lex Luthor plan number one

1138
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,943
Superman that sounds like Bill Gates

1139
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:21,087
Hospital

1140
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:27,487
Bill Gates

1141
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,791
He deserves us to actually look

1142
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,327
Get some of his ideas

1143
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:37,471
Otherwise we're just going to be

1144
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,495
Villain's lair

1145
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,847
Who is Mike Wallace

1146
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:47,967
Nickname is

1147
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,271
50s

1148
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,807
Population control

1149
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,855
Because of overpopulation are tariffs

1150
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,391
Overpopulation

1151
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,487
Global population

1152
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,655
And things are going great

1153
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,959
But starvation did we ever

1154
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,519
Followed

1155
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,080
Suggestions

1156
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,384
Maybe you know the person who invented

1157
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,224
Technique that allowed people to be set

1158
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,784
Allow the population

1159
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,552
You just can't

1160
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:33,792
Prediction for population growth is really complicated

1161
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:37,632
Patient resources and all these things

1162
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:46,848
Apparently Harrison didn't get the memo that Alex is really trying to play up caring about hunger in the developing world

1163
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:49,664
Idea for him to come on the show

1164
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:56,064
Undercuts that whole week are the World Health Organization is willing to put

1165
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,928
That's hilarious

1166
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:07,328
But the reason I remember because each me how weird this dork Harrison Smith

1167
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:13,472
I think will put me over the edge of the population control

1168
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:17,824
Might make it so the guy who invented some crop technique may never be born

1169
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,896
This is so weird on a bunch of levels

1170
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:25,248
41 it implies a belief in hard predeterminism

1171
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:31,392
What person was destined to make that crop technique and because their parents used a condom

1172
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:37,792
See there you go this is a super weird way to look at the world and it only makes it even more

1173
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,816
You think about it

1174
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:42,912
He was predestined to be the 8th Banana IT Infowars

1175
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:49,056
Everything in his life was meant to lead to him being the guy even I will forget about six months after Alex goes out of business

1176
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:56,224
His parents used a condom

1177
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,832
Miss out on any techniques

1178
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,856
What to do

1179
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:04,160
Should all contraceptives be outlawed

1180
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,696
What about masturbation

1181
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:09,792
What was Spurs might be the cop technique guide

1182
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:12,352
Well that's why the Bible out

1183
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:17,472
If you take Harrison's weird thoughts to their logical conclusion

1184
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,776
Procreate

1185
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,544
As possible

1186
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,104
Either that or he doesn't actually care about that project

1187
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,664
Guy getting born as much as he's pretending he does

1188
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:32,064
My guess is just standard anti-abortion thinking being delivered by a very very weird dork

1189
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:39,232
Let's chat that's the same that somehow that's like that Albert Einstein

1190
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,536
But it's for just some random

1191
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,840
The boogeyman look like

1192
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,632
The stuff was there

1193
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:52,032
Relativity existed without

1194
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,824
Great man theory of History

1195
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:04,832
Tomorrow mother over inventor

1196
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:11,232
Years either that or they were parallel thinking unrelated

1197
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:13,024
Elementary

1198
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,560
On different timeline

1199
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:21,216
Or with a woman who didn't the man saw the credit there's there's a lot of this. I mean

1200
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,752
One person wasn't born

1201
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:27,104
Things that they invent

1202
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,128
The only person

1203
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,408
And quite frankly

1204
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:36,064
Like okay Mississippi is the mother of invention right we all say that

1205
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,112
Is the deadbeat dad of it

1206
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:41,952
If someone isn't born the world exist

1207
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:48,608
Without their presence whatever they were responding to to develop an invention

1208
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:51,424
Exist in the absence of them being there you think

1209
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,728
Someone else would work on the problem of maybe

1210
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,008
This guy

1211
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,288
The f****** weird

1212
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,592
F****** Weird Al

1213
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,992
God I love outloud

1214
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:09,856
The old school classic

1215
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,768
Microchip everybody track everyone

1216
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,072
One World Government I mean this stuff is laid out

1217
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,608
In that

1218
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:24,448
Wonderful book known as the Bible known as the Bible

1219
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,496
Go home

1220
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,800
Call Harrison go home

1221
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:31,360
You and Alex

1222
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:35,456
Both need to be off

1223
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:42,880
Supervillains

1224
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,440
Godwin

1225
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:49,536
This is what my mind got blown

1226
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:56,960
We know from

1227
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:00,800
Podcast

1228
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:06,176
First of all doesn't know Ozymandias his name and at the same time thanks

1229
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,456
That the movie was

1230
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,736
Positive

1231
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:12,576
Ozymandias was the good guy

1232
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:17,184
It turns out this might be a very common interpretation

1233
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:21,280
Because you talking about these supervillains and it's making me think of the Watchmen

1234
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,400
And I can't think of the

1235
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,680
Villains name in that

1236
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:30,496
It was named himself after

1237
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,800
And Egyptian pharaoh with me like Abyss

1238
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:36,128
Shaq

1239
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,688
Was sort of painted as

1240
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
Like a lowlife

1241
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,992
Villain

1242
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:43,808
Is this

1243
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:46,880
The message that movie that I thought when I watched it was

1244
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:53,280
With keep your mouth shut and don't try to expose it because it's a necessary plan right you don't understand you're just a little

1245
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:57,632
Cretin down there that doesn't understand the big brain plans that we have

1246
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:04,288
You guys don't understand complex storytelling that is a good idea

1247
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,056
Message

1248
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,104
From the movie

1249
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:13,248
Yes that you were were Shack is correct

1250
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:16,320
From the perspective of Ozymandias

1251
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:22,976
So you're saying that you can reserve a different points of view and if you're analyzing a text you want

1252
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,768
Oh my God

1253
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:31,168
What what how is it that we are being defeated and are unable to outsmart people

1254
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:34,496
Read at a third-grade level

1255
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:38,592
This is bad believe that

1256
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,640
Scorpion the movie

1257
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:43,456
Turns out I don't know if Harrison knows any better either

1258
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,528
Everything Lord the Rings

1259
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,344
Major work of

1260
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,904
Fiction that captures the imagination of mankind

1261
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,208
Recognize

1262
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,792
In The Matrix the machines are the bad guys

1263
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,584
People don't wreck

1264
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,680
Who doesn't water

1265
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:32,608
Very weary very clear just by physical appearance the elves are the physical embodiment of

1266
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,656
Beauty and the

1267
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,936
Murder creatures

1268
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:42,336
I mean

1269
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:47,456
Complex cell

1270
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,016
Let's just talk about the Matrix in the machine

1271
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:50,784
Alright

1272
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:53,088
The machines are the good guys

1273
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,392
To agent Smith

1274
01:27:55,648 --> 01:28:00,000
Protect the Matrix itself

1275
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:02,816
But the story is that they're bad

1276
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:07,168
The movies POV

1277
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:12,800
Didn't he do that pose whenever you was

1278
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:16,896
Sacrificing himself for the survival of the

1279
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:23,552
Upside-down cross whenever he did that

1280
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,576
That's a different

1281
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,112
Interpretation

1282
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:32,768
Goddamn these people adopt I feel like

1283
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,792
Listening to that is like

1284
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,328
Who who makes you

1285
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:41,472
They get to talkin about the the virus and the transmission rate

1286
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,752
Of it

1287
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,336
Stupid

1288
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,616
It's based on our

1289
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,408
Which is the rate of

1290
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,456
Transmissibility or whatever they said

1291
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:52,736
Subway

1292
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:58,624
What exactly is he do you know what the value of

1293
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:06,304
Government based on this chart that's based off of

1294
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:11,680
What is going on it was I missing something Your Dragon did I hear that correctly

1295
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:14,240
If you watch the full video they get into

1296
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,288
To asking the question why are they calling it

1297
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,056
Because

1298
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,336
The actual

1299
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,128
Mathematic equation is are not

1300
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,944
And that internet saying

1301
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:25,760
Aegis

1302
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:29,600
Abbreviating it creating a new definition

1303
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:31,648
So to answer these questions

1304
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,696
I will start with Greg Reese's concern

1305
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:40,864
It could be that the people he's talking about word abbreviating or not to are for the sake of brevity and smoother conversation

1306
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,656
I wouldn't be too surprised if I was okay

1307
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:43,936
However

1308
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:46,240
It's also possible they just met our

1309
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:52,896
Or not is the basic reproduction number for an illness which is to say they represent the average number of infections you would

1310
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,944
Back to be the result of one infected person

1311
01:29:55,456 --> 01:30:01,088
If not for a condition is too nice person infected will likely infect two additional people on average

1312
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:08,000
The concrete number that is characteristic of an infectious disease and it is not affected by the development of treatments or prevent

1313
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:11,072
The condition

1314
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,376
On the other hand

1315
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:17,216
Is a variable that used to describe a diseases effective reproduction rate

1316
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:20,544
This number takes into account that some people are immune to condition

1317
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,824
Maybe because their racks

1318
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:25,408
Proportion of the population

1319
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,200
Even if they're exposed to a sick person

1320
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,992
You calculate this by taking

1321
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:33,344
Not multiplying it by the proportion of the population that is able to come down with it

1322
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,368
A particular condition

1323
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:40,768
Cancel coronavirus it doesn't seem like we have any good idea about large swathes of the population

1324
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:43,840
So kinda looks like

1325
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,120
I know everything

1326
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:47,936
Conspiracy to Infowars but this one's a f****** dud

1327
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,264
Ever hear some question about whether or not you miss something

1328
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:58,688
When someone says they can't definitively nail down the value of a pretty good sense of it

1329
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:05,856
With better data as provided by things I can Kris testing we could give you a better sense of the reproduction number of this new virus that

1330
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,392
We're really just playing catch-up with

1331
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:12,512
Also or not is not the most useful metric for understanding the evolving situation with the virus

1332
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:17,632
Harrison wants to put on this incredulos acts about not understanding statistical estimation

1333
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:24,288
Greg wants to accidentally reveal that he doesn't know what

1334
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,360
I hope you're having a good time

1335
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,384
What's really sad

1336
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,688
Where I'm sitting.

1337
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,736
It's a stunning lack of curiosity

1338
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:38,624
Yeah and a really good it's just like why why are you bring up

1339
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:45,024
I know I know this is it this is a situation where he is like on are you want to have someone to be like well let me goo

1340
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,584
Google it if you asked a question

1341
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:53,472
Look for the answer to don't just like be incredulous constant thing with Alex and Alex's better job

1342
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:55,520
Covering

1343
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,800
Like

1344
01:31:57,056 --> 01:32:00,896
Transparent with these Dum Dums that he hires

1345
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:01,664
Galax

1346
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:02,944
You should fire Aldi

1347
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,992
Yeah that's a great point.

1348
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,832
Fire them by Alex

1349
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:13,696
Yeah it's going to be abused

1350
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:20,608
Little bit longer

1351
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,192
News of the day

1352
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,984
Really important stuff

1353
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,688
Twitter India video

1354
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:38,272
Deleting this video

1355
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,832
Probably something that our audience would want to know

1356
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:45,184
That's the stupidest f****** mentality you can possibly have

1357
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:50,304
This is interpreted as a virtue

1358
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:53,632
Harrison Smith couldn't raise it more transparently of our pathetic

1359
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:57,984
If it got kicked out might be worth

1360
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:02,336
I think it's pretty easy to see how his line of reasoning goes astray pretty quickly

1361
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:05,664
Just because something was kicked out sooner that doesn't mean it has any value

1362
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,480
Copyright

1363
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:15,392
Does every video that gets dmca it suddenly become relevant to report looking into

1364
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:22,304
Globalist

1365
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,888
Anything gets kicked off anything it has increased Market valued Infowars

1366
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:31,264
I had no idea what this video is so I decided to check out Michelle Malkin Twitter and

1367
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,800
Nothing but red flag

1368
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,640
There's a video of a recent interview she did with Gavin McInnes

1369
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,552
Laura Loomer

1370
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:48,160
Thanks on that page

1371
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,464
All the words you just said made my eyes run

1372
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:56,608
Red with blood and I I just hear sirens just screeching pans in the back of my head like a

1373
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,656
Like I'm in Kill Bill like

1374
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:03,264
So I found this video and the video

1375
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:09,152
It's just a group of like 40 people in Ireland in the middle of a field of science against vaccines

1376
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:15,808
Honestly more there signs to be anti-media like things like quotes the media is the virus and quote

1377
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:18,112
Survivors of Ireland

1378
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:25,024
Dvideo is not been removed nor the account

1379
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,096
This is pathetic

1380
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:32,704
It really started this came on

1381
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:53,952
Mineral Fusion

1382
01:34:55,744 --> 01:35:01,888
These guys have been on Airport allow that video is playing on this episode

1383
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,960
And also hereby this s***

1384
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,520
Elizabeth place I realize

1385
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:11,104
H in Harrison

1386
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,640
Now can I can't do it

1387
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:19,296
Where he will not be on because he just announced that he would be taking some time off exactly

1388
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,088
Yes but the show starts

1389
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,488
Nwpreps

1390
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,072
4 hours

1391
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:43,616
This is the most important information and all the communication Alex you've got to be joking

1392
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:51,552
I don't know man I don't know you are having a great time

1393
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:01,280
Communication

1394
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,816
Alex

1395
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:09,216
Nothing for couple minutes

1396
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,008
That's not true

1397
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:17,408
Broadcast like that

1398
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:23,552
Wow

1399
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:29,952
I'm boring at Old assholes communication

1400
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:30,976
Quit I am

1401
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,536
I'm killing myself that day come out

1402
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,328
So Alec John Alec leave

1403
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:39,936
Bridal David

1404
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:43,520
Barely now Harrison will be in that list

1405
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,080
Automatic stirrer

1406
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:46,848
F*** out of here

1407
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:49,408
So we can do the 21st now it's is also supposed to

1408
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:51,712
Begone

1409
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:54,784
You there for about the first 45 minutes

1410
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,320
There is

1411
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,112
Oh okay

1412
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,696
Tell us about Hollywood

1413
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,680
In the normal course of bed

1414
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,784
I got

1415
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,552
Today we talk

1416
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:29,856
45

1417
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,208
Never spilt

1418
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:47,776
Sounds like Coke to me but

1419
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:54,432
When is The Joe Rogan signed an exclusivity deal with Spotify

1420
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:57,504
Dollars

1421
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,552
Yeah for 100 + million dollars

1422
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:05,952
Good on Rogan it's whatever

1423
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,256
YouTube is starting to become

1424
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,048
Abor Oviedo

1425
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:16,448
Advertiser

1426
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,216
Channel

1427
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:20,800
That they are having difficulty relying on YouTube

1428
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:26,688
To be like a rock for them

1429
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,480
Just not as lucrative as they were

1430
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,248
And that's

1431
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,016
Just a

1432
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:33,344
Like a piece of YouTube business

1433
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,368
From where it was

1434
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,392
In the past

1435
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:37,184
And I think if you're broken

1436
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:41,792
Is where most of your smart decision

1437
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:48,192
Too instead of having this vulnerability to the possibility of a driving is going down

1438
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,728
Payday out of

1439
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,056
And now you're set

1440
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:55,872
No problem with this is

1441
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:58,432
That don't like them

1442
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,968
This sort of thing

1443
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:04,320
There have been other podcast that have gone to exclusive

1444
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,880
Deals in the past

1445
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:11,744
Considerable amount of their fan base

1446
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,280
There was some backlash

1447
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:15,584
To them going Spotify

1448
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,632
Because people don't like

1449
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:23,520
The idea that you have to get an app in order to get this content to get gum acclimated to getting

1450
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,848
Broken has a big enough base

1451
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,640
That you can probably handle

1452
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:33,248
Some might end up seeing a pretty serious diminished

1453
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:37,088
Is

1454
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:40,416
From some of them

1455
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:44,256
Get your content

1456
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:47,328
Because at the end of the day honestly

1457
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:49,888
If you want to take a cynical View

1458
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,424
It happened

1459
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:54,752
Is it over the last decade

1460
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,544
He has built up an audience

1461
01:39:57,824 --> 01:40:02,688
Openly available platform to the point where he now sees he can sell them

1462
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:07,296
He sold it to Spotify

1463
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:13,952
Spotify

1464
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:15,232
Consumer

1465
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:21,888
If you want to listen to a show without Chicago.

1466
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:24,960
This

1467
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:29,312
I kind of do you created this company

1468
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:33,408
But I think a more generous version of 8

1469
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,432
Creator

1470
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,456
The

1471
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:40,064
Struggle The Joe Rogan would be in the uncertainty of

1472
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,624
You make millions of dollars on that podcast

1473
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,976
The idea of that going away because of changes in YouTube structure or whatever

1474
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,256
Is ridiculous

1475
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:52,608
He is in a position where million-dollar deal

1476
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:56,704
Probably doing what you need to do him

1477
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:01,056
It also could set a precedent where a lot of other podcast feel like they can do this

1478
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:05,152
Could actually having a corrosive effect on

1479
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:10,272
Podcasting in general

1480
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:13,088
Could be nothing but it could actually have some negative consequences

1481
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:13,856
Towards

1482
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,648
Other people who have

1483
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,952
Cottage industries

1484
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:23,328
As far as that business model is concerned it does seem like

1485
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,864
Podcasting is being

1486
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,656
Consolidated the same way that

1487
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:33,056
Other media has been Consolidated overtime

1488
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:38,688
Start a podcast Network

1489
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:43,808
Bigger company because it's a very lucrative

1490
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,600
Place to sell

1491
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:48,672
Consolidated

1492
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:54,304
Build up amount of

1493
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,376
Trust and rapport with audiences

1494
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,144
Do it

1495
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:01,984
Those are people who are fertile marketing ground for a couple

1496
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:05,824
So course there's going to be consolidation of it

1497
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:09,152
Relatively new form of media

1498
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:11,712
They took it's a process that happens in

1499
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:16,064
It's just weird that somebody who doesn't need it necessarily I could do things

1500
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,600
Completely independently

1501
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,624
Do it

1502
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:21,696
But also you understand

1503
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:25,536
A hundred billion dollars

1504
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:29,632
Southend

1505
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:35,520
I dunno hate Joe Rogan for an extra reason though which has a hundred million dollars

1506
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:40,896
Yourself Joe Rogan dare you pretend to have any positions when you have 100 million

1507
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,432
Right right

1508
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:48,832
Texas

1509
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,624
You never do that

1510
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:54,208
Like all of the assets are in California

1511
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:58,816
Who was the Texas he's got to convince Ari shaffir

1512
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:05,216
Like all of their family

1513
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,776
She's not going anywhere

1514
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:20,832
Still pretty close by that trailer in Arizona or Oklahoma makeup for all

1515
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:23,904
Celebrities

1516
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:30,560
In the world where everything is done on Skype calls or unzoom yeah maybe

1517
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:32,608
I think it is podcast

1518
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,912
Doesn't work nearly as well

1519
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:37,216
The ones like sitting around shooting

1520
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:43,616
To do that about

1521
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:50,016
Texas it would be at the detriment of his own show nose

1522
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:55,392
I'm going to do a podcast where I sit down and

1523
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,160
The bottom of

1524
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:58,976
Various people from Africa

1525
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:06,912
We got to Terry she's the church Deacon how you feeling today Terry

1526
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:17,664
My taxes and it turns out there's some other people were talking about moving to Texas

1527
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:20,480
Thought leaders

1528
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,600
About freaks fresheners

1529
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,624
Dominoes falling

1530
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,416
Affected

1531
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,000
Elon Musk

1532
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:36,096
Classical liberal

1533
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,216
L like that

1534
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,008
We could get

1535
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:56,320
Good stuff

1536
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:08,608
This Joe Rogan

1537
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,632
Is way bigger

1538
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:16,544
Have

1539
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,312
Knox

1540
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,592
Scheels in my

1541
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,360
My third eye

1542
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:20,896
Chills

1543
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,968
Starting to get cold

1544
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:29,600
Nailed it

1545
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:31,648
Salata

1546
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,464
You sure you want me to go

1547
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,376
Are you

1548
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,192
Discus throw much big news today

1549
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,240
You do not want to miss the train

1550
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:53,408
Thing is that like Joe Rogan getting picked on by the YouTube people are telling him he can't play

1551
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,224
EC Lee's doctors get censored

1552
01:45:56,480 --> 01:46:00,832
Spotify

1553
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:03,648
Good business

1554
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:10,048
So I told him he's his first asked whenever

1555
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:12,096
Get the f*** out

1556
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:16,960
Anyway

1557
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:19,776
Got any

1558
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:21,056
I hate it

1559
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:22,080
I hate about

1560
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:27,712
So it's inside baseball

1561
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:29,760
Plants and

1562
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,088
You really want me to

1563
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:35,136
I know I want you

1564
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,976
Doesn't sound right

1565
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,840
Joe's always try to stay politically

1566
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:47,680
Annie

1567
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:49,984
I'm acting like total monsters any done

1568
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,360
Zach Woods

1569
01:46:56,128 --> 01:47:00,224
You going after the last

1570
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:03,552
That's great I'm very excited

1571
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:08,160
Toothpaste

1572
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,000
Lefty belief whatever

1573
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,280
Whatever Alex

1574
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,168
How is she

1575
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:22,240
Weird

1576
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,288
Finding

1577
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,736
Talking about Jesus

1578
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:47,584
I'm guessing it's Rodger Stone

1579
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:53,728
There's nothing in Rajasthan

1580
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,800
Rodger is a major leaguer

1581
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:04,736
Could be

1582
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:06,016
Joe Rogan

1583
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:06,784
Isibaya

1584
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,552
Because

1585
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,832
East

1586
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:09,856
The pressure of

1587
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,184
Probably

1588
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,464
Look here's the thing

1589
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:18,048
Lot of people used to like Alex Shore

1590
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:19,584
DL cell.

1591
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:27,776
Oh my God

1592
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,568
Oh God

1593
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:31,616
Come on,

1594
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,272
Bill Gates

1595
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,040
On TV

1596
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:40,832
Did you know that

1597
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,416
Most people economy Center

1598
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:45,440
Paint the man

1599
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:54,144
Comedy Central

1600
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,984
Hey management Stephen Colbert

1601
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:02,080
Get that information

1602
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:08,992
Stephen Colbert's character that's the only explanation

1603
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:13,856
Straight lace

1604
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:20,512
I don't realize is that satire

1605
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:26,400
I don't know he might be

1606
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:29,216
Exactly

1607
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,008
Like that

1608
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:37,408
Alex gets inside baseball

1609
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:39,200
Before

1610
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:48,928
Breakdown because I want to see if you have the same feeling that I have about describing

1611
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,464
Deal

1612
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:07,104
If you block people speech you took the you out of YouTube

1613
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,944
You out of Facebook

1614
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,480
We will just

1615
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,392
Is the speed of scalability of Technology

1616
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:22,976
Remove

1617
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,328
No you

1618
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:29,376
What Alex's describe

1619
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,400
Collective bargaining

1620
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:32,448
Alex's describing a union

1621
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:36,288
Unions are very good

1622
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:43,712
Just like with my brother and I

1623
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:44,480
Are you

1624
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:50,880
We should all take our labor from

1625
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:53,440
They are not

1626
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:59,840
Leverage

1627
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:06,240
No that's what we power of fan

1628
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:12,640
Treated unfairly we all would hold our labor in order to pressure the price

1629
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:17,504
Brother being able

1630
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:23,904
Because if I don't have a

1631
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,952
We'll just kick him off with us

1632
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:30,048
Describing that's all we everybody want but they just here

1633
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:37,472
Thing is that Alex instead of any kind of organizing which someone could have done it any point

1634
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:41,312
Big creators together to stand up for people who were wrong

1635
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,848
Or something like that

1636
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,896
You could do that easily

1637
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,688
Instead they just yell about it

1638
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:49,248
Talk about Trump needing to take on big Tech

1639
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:53,088
Pickled Pig take your little me back on Spotify

1640
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,368
I mean

1641
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:55,392
It's nonsense

1642
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:59,744
Yeah I don't know I don't think you could ever do that

1643
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,072
Because there's so many creators

1644
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:06,400
Is obviously a hit

1645
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:10,240
There's other people get just as many

1646
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:14,080
Videos get millions of views

1647
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:16,896
Pretty much every single thing they put out

1648
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:19,200
YouTube isn't going to be heard

1649
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:21,504
But

1650
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,344
If there were a bunch of creators all together maybe

1651
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:26,368
But I still think

1652
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:29,696
Be tough tough to get the amount of Leverage

1653
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:31,488
There's too much content

1654
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,536
Yeah

1655
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:37,376
They can make a s*** ton of money it's kind of like comics

1656
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:38,912
Sure I'll go

1657
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:50,688
I bet I idealistically that's the kind of thing that Alex

1658
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:57,088
Would never want to put it in those terms you need

1659
01:52:57,344 --> 01:53:00,672
In order to effect any change

1660
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,464
That is

1661
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,280
F****** idiot

1662
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:06,048
Anyway

1663
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:11,680
Our stupid Spotify spell the end

1664
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,336
This was so seismic

1665
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:23,968
What I'm going to do

1666
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,248
Part of the story

1667
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:29,600
What makes

1668
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:32,672
Is the beginning

1669
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:36,000
One of the things I got to say is that like

1670
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:38,560
Albert's better not be lying about what Rogan

1671
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:43,936
Inside

1672
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:48,544
Because if I were Joe I would consider this to be

1673
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,312
Breach

1674
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:50,592
Of some kind of

1675
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,384
Trust or friendship

1676
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:57,504
The ideas hey I got this giant 100 million dollar deal and Alex immediately

1677
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:03,648
Like the night he went on Robert Barnes the show and talked about it basically

1678
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,416
And Joe like

1679
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:10,816
Standing up to the cruel sensors of YouTube

1680
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:11,584
YouTube

1681
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:16,960
Contact is still going to be on YouTube

1682
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:22,080
Until the migration happen

1683
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:28,480
You still going to have like 20 minutes chunks of his episodes on YouTube

1684
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:36,928
Alex is trying to make this all about himself

1685
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:39,744
I will be serious already like

1686
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,024
Unless unless

1687
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:45,120
Unless this entire conversation is fabric

1688
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:48,704
The idea that a private conversation

1689
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:55,104
Would just let me know

1690
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:57,664
It is next collab

1691
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:01,248
Because Alex starts to talk about

1692
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:03,040
Miami sounds a lot like Alex

1693
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:04,320
Everything you'd expect

1694
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:07,392
Drugged out

1695
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,696
Billionaire lunatic

1696
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,488
Are they want

1697
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:28,384
Get the f*** out of here

1698
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,736
Genealogist

1699
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,016
Your Sinai

1700
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,040
Video about

1701
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,424
Alex

1702
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:53,984
He really said

1703
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:56,032
What you said about what they say you say

1704
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:57,056
So

1705
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:59,872
Alex Nacho

1706
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:04,736
Find the clippers because of the house issues so I can really

1707
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:08,576
Getting in my way

1708
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:13,440
I specifically remember that there was a clip of Joe Rogan after Alex's last

1709
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:14,464
Appearance on the show

1710
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:20,864
Talking about how Alex lied to him about what he said

1711
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:22,656
Things I like

1712
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:28,800
And Alex had lied to him about his coverage

1713
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:35,200
Alex is presenting nearby

1714
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:41,600
Broken his about them lying about what he says

1715
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:42,368
Like

1716
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:44,416
Magazine cutout of Joe Rogan

1717
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,952
In space onto a mirror

1718
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:49,536
And that's what he's talking about like that conversation happened

1719
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:52,864
I think that there's an outside chance it's completely made

1720
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:56,704
Pleasant phone call

1721
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:03,104
About whatever

1722
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:09,248
She's insane. This is disrespectful and a really nice way

1723
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:12,064
The prank guy maybe he's like hey Alex

1724
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,880
Why don't you say these things

1725
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:20,768
Really trying to get attention

1726
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:24,096
And this is the way you by piggybacking on to Rogan stuff

1727
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:28,704
What is his normal standard

1728
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,776
It's kind of like I don't think he would try and

1729
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:33,056
Destroy the relationship

1730
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:38,944
Too much just in case but at the same time he would totally Seth Rogen out if he was desperate enough

1731
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:46,112
Just that maybe look at me back on Spotify

1732
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:51,232
So I mean what really gets down to is over

1733
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:53,536
I'm 21st and so I turned it off

1734
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,072
But Alex apps

1735
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:58,144
But I expect

1736
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:01,984
Spotify

1737
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:04,544
The people get

1738
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:11,200
Incredible job on a product

1739
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:13,248
It's not a sales gimmick

1740
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:15,040
Sunday

1741
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:24,512
So the bottom line is

1742
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:28,096
I need you so insecure he has to justify

1743
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:30,144
Something that nobody asked about

1744
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,424
Nobody

1745
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,448
Aired

1746
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:36,288
Nobody was like oh those sales are gone on longer than you said

1747
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:40,128
Maybe I don't trust Alex Jones

1748
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:48,064
Just trying to attach himself to the story because you know that it's getting a lot of

1749
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:51,392
He does know Joe Rogan

1750
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:52,928
Credibility to it

1751
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:56,000
I don't know I think it's a load of b******* and Alex's

1752
01:58:56,256 --> 01:59:00,864
Yeah just probably desperately trying to get attention then he can funnel into his revenue streams

1753
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:02,912
Stop it

1754
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:04,960
This is one of the saddest

1755
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:06,496
Stretches

1756
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,544
Incompetence in

1757
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,592
Call stupidity I can I can think

1758
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:13,664
Harrison Smith

1759
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,968
Is just a disaster he's boring

1760
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:16,992
Is a nerd

1761
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:18,272
He's not good at his job

1762
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:25,952
You are a you're a terrorist now you are a literal terrorist

1763
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,976
Attacking me with

1764
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:30,816
If you have damn life at all

1765
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:33,120
Blank

1766
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:34,400
I do I understand

1767
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:36,960
A revolution

1768
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:39,008
I'm really scared

1769
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,336
I really scared that I'm going to be fired and replaced with

1770
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:48,224
Series of clips of Alex agreed with you know what I just realized I forgot to do a report on the Earth

1771
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:50,016
I need to take I need to get to

1772
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:55,392
I've got to check in here on the or the seltzer

1773
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,976
I can't

1774
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:05,632
I can't I'm struggling here struggling

1775
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:06,912
Soundrop

1776
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:11,776
So we are currently sitting at 78 Seltzer's down

1777
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:14,848
Pretty pretty well

1778
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:19,968
There will eventually be

1779
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:24,576
Remember exactly where we live.

1780
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:28,928
Basic

1781
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:32,000
I decided to take a little dip

1782
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:33,536
Perrier world of course

1783
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:39,936
Quality products most ubiquitous seltzer

1784

Fellas

1785
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:43,520
Because they are like it's Chris

1786
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:46,336
It's just it's exactly what you want from

1787
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:47,616
A seltzer water

1788
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:50,176
And the flavors are pretty good they're not obtrusive

1789
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:52,736
I put it I put the lime variety at a 70

1790
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:59,392
And lemonade a73

1791
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:01,696
Not so good

1792
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:02,720
What's wrong with grapes

1793
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:05,024
I don't know a muskie

1794
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:08,352
I think I just don't like

1795
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:10,656
I think I think I might not be into it

1796
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:11,680
Passion fruit

1797
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:14,496
