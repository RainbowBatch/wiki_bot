00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
What's fight.com

4
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,536
For the altar of Selene and talk a little bit about to Alex

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,632
Text Jones

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,704
Jordan This is dangerous

7
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
What's the address

8
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,056
Its mustard

9
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,848
Well here's what's a interest okay

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,944
I'm thinking about doing a year of Mustang

11
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
That is dangerous I have for the last couple weeks I did with enjoying must

12
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,464
A couple different varieties that are like

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,304
One of them is to mustard and I love it I love it

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,144
You love the extra mustard but it's so much mustard delicious

15
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
And I'm thinking about that really trying to incorporate this into my personal brand

16
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
I think that is a kind of guy I mean I think Twitter it will eventually

17
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,320
New kind of guy just dropped mustard guy

18
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976
Yeah I don't know I feel like there's a lot to explore in terms of the world of Masters and I think I could get 69

19
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
9 mustards down

20
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,376
I don't want to bite off more than I can chew but

21
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,264
Look I'm going to put the world on notice a lot of mustard

22
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920
My brain works

23
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
Yes

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,504
A lot of mustard

25
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,064
I like it

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,856
How about you

27
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,208
By bright spot is we play Scattergories

28
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:43,840
We got together

29
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:50,240
Opened up the box play all night

30
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,848
What you have lost the pieces of your Taboo game

31
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:00,480
Subway with

32
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
End of the show sister podcast Marty and Sarah

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
And plates categories and it was I've not played Scattergories in a long time and it is a very fun

34
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
It is also the first time that I played

35
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
Way too high to play a word game

36
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
True and it made a guy I was not high cuz usually protect that too much into the weeds

37
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
I found some

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
It helps him sleep a little bit

39
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,408
I have I have enjoyed some gummies for Sleep purposes

40
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
But

41
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,992
Speaking as the non Stone person in the room

42
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
I did but also a little frustrating to try and argue whether or not words couch with

43
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,440
3 Stone people

44
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
Experience

45
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,936
It's rare in my life it is and it will stay

46
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,032
It will never happen to the bonds probably cuz you guys

47
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:01,920
Like the grass all day we like sagarika

48
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
You guys like that to that to that

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,880
I f*** I can't even come up with another Torquay way on the top of grass

50
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
It was fun time play some games

51
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,327
Also codenames

52
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,519
We're going to go back to the back in time out

53
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
So after our last episode

54
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
I felt really shity

55
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Because

56
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
I have given Alex

57
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
Too much of a benefit of a doubt

58
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:41,087
About his medical condition that he was out of his deposition

59
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,207
On Friday he got back on his show and announced that

60
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
Bright good work

61
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,631
So thanks buddy I don't know what to believe whether the that's Saving Face about an actual medical condition that he has to go

62
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
He doesn't want

63
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,031
People to look at him as weak right if it's a situation where the

64
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
Case the lawyers had already left

65
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,663
And now he knew he wasn't going to have this deposition

66
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,479
The facade can drop and what have you

67
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,039
But whatever the case I felt a little bit like a mark

68
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:17,695
And that I had to pay cared more than I should have fangs not the first time that this is occurred

69
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,511
No and it's kind of one of the downsides

70
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Do you know

71
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Engage with

72
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
The work of a liar

73
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
And sometimes you can never be

74
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,799
I resent it and I'm not happy about it so what I'm going to do

75
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,711
Alex isn't going to be back in the present on our Show and Tell episode 666

76
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
David Allan Coe in the present

77
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511
2022 will return

78
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,607
On 666 we are going to be doing other things

79
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,447
We have other type types it up so there's some fun stuff

80
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,799
Back in the past

81
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
July 24th 2000

82
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
M3

83
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Others

84
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,759
Nonsense and that a massive Revelation PA

85
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
Where is Taco Bell

86
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975

100
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,159
During sex you're now a technocrat

101
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,463
I'm a policy wonk I have

102
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
Risen above

00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
My enemies

104
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,679
A little breaking for me

105
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
And then we're going to

106
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Comeback

107
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
And I'm going to start the show over

108
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
F*** you

109
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
I got plenty work for you

110
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
At the end of the day

111
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,343
F*** you and your new world order

112
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
She rode in on

113
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
All your s***

114
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Maybe today

115
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,535
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

116
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

117
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
And you never see me again

118
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
That's really what I want to do

119
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
I never want to come back here again

120
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
I apologize to the

121
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,895
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

122
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
I'll be better tomorrow

123
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
He's not in nor was he in the past

124
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,319
But you know what is better than Alex

125
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:31,231
Listening to Archdale while having sex no that's stuck in my brain for the rest of my life it scares me yeah

126
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Terrified

127
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:38,655
No but something that is great it was weird we have a special birthday happy birthday to to send

128
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
Huxley

129
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,943
Your mother Stephanie reached out and I wanted us to wish you a happy birthday

130
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,271
And look I don't I don't know how else we can make this

131
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
Like a really special birthday

132
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,207
So I heard you're a big fan of John Oliver and so we actually got him

133
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,303
To come and wish you a happy birthday along with us

134
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Holy cow

135
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
I can't do a John Oliver

136
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
Oliver I can't do it, failure

137
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,295
Was it whenever I was like

138
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,743
Boy I wish this was a video

139
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:42,143
42 weirdest f****** movement trying to get into character

140
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,543
I got nothing I'm sorry happy birthday

141
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,615
Before starting to do an impression then

142
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
That's a gift profiles

143
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:59,551
We're back in 2003 from Today Show

144
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,743
How rude

145
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,655
Did not see that coming here is where the episode starts

146
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,751
Notice about this is that

147
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
I was really into talking about 9/11

148
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
This episode

149
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
Rtaa

150
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
Believe the government

151
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:14,303
What's the district is being reported there was a poll of people in Germany was the statistic

152
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,375
But you listened to him describe it what was it

153
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
People who believe that

154
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:25,311
The United States did 911 68% is something 30% is something maybe 18

155
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
19% I don't know

156
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
I was doing a bunch of times

157
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,455
And I don't think

158
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
You'd be able to tell what he's talkin to

159
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,903
Do you know the general top he's saying that 70% of Germans believe that the United States did nine

160
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,975
11 if I corrected that no you're not

161
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:48,607
68% is apparently the amount of the think that the media isn't telling them the truth

162
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:55,263
Unclear from listening to it what is which percent rice is 30% but that's actually people under 30

163
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,407
Percent of people under Thirty 11

164
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
How many people in France

165
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
We'll get to that in a minute

166
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,623
Like if you listened to enough of Alex's show you'll notice that often times concrete stories are reported in ways that leave you

167
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,183
Completely unaware of what actually being reported

168
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
And I think that's intention

169
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,559
But leaving that aside that clip include the really interesting little tidbit that if

170
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
I think those herbs attention

171
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
In 2003 Alex's

172
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,191
Perfectly comfortable saying definitively that it

173
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
It's proven fact

174
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
That the government did 9/11

175
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,663
In the present-day what he's asked about Alex Hedges this position and tries to pretend it questions about the official story

176
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
I was just joking

177
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
Independence still say that he knows the name of the perpetrator

178
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,575
Like everybody in the organization

179
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,903
Fast forward to today and you would never make that type of claim

180
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Or like

181
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,255
I will name names

182
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:55,167
I talked about this a little bit in the past the idea of wet concrete how the immediate aftermath of an event is essentially

183
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
We can make it impression it very easily

184
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
But if you wait for the concrete

185
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
The dry it's really hard to get your narrative to make it

186
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,871
You can't write your name another the sidewalk

187
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:09,759
Is a very large part of why people like Alex really try to spam their theories hard-and-fast

188
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:16,159
But there's a sign aspect of this Dynamic where in order to make your immediate theories seem more convincing to people in those Early Times

189
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
You have to be completely in

190
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
Static in your certain

191
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:26,143
People looking for answers and you seem like a bad source of answers if you present your theories as possibilities that you can't

192
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
True

193
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:32,799
You have to push them as if you have a rock-solid case or else you run into the risk of your audience searching for someone else

194
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,639
To give them the impression of that certainty that they need in order to comfort

195
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,967
As time goes on this position needs to soften

196
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,295
Because as always the case these kinds of conspiracy theories

197
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Fall Apart

198
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,695
It becomes too obvious that there was no basis for your certainty in the first place

199
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,791
Like it's no good to be certain 10 years after the fact that everything looks stupid

200
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
But the way

201
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
The way that this

202
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
This

203
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
Works is like

204
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
It's just different tones of voice of trust

205
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
Depending on where you are in the relationship

206
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
And then ten years later it's like

207
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,223
Yeah but you can trust me I know but you can trust me you help me

208
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,575
There's an unspoken agreement between the conspiracy theorist In Their audience

209
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,927
The emotional need for certainty that the audience

210
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Looking for

211
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Have you

212
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,071
Conveniently forgets later that the things that the theorist was certain about we're bulshit

213
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,399
Without the status quo show like Alex's could not

214
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,495
If Alex didn't provide that certainty is audience would find him

215
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,079
If his audience held him to his past positions and demanded he explained

216
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,127
How this certainty about things

217
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:46,527
Be able to do the show that he does not seem to be unable to provide the audience with their comfort and certainty that they need

218
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
Next time right

219
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,903
Definitive positions will be taken that are quietly disowned later

220
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,303
The audience will get ready to unquestioningly believe the next position Alex throws out in the cycle

221
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Goes on and on

222
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,983
Just thinking like in the covid times how many narratives Alex's announced has definitively proven that he just kind of forgotten about at

223
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
Clear

224
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:13,407
That is embarrassing to talk about how viruses themselves don't exist

225
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,807
Ohio liquor let the virus if you choose that the energy needs to stay outside

226
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Play Everybody Knows

227
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,879
That was more of a scary thing but

228
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:28,511
But yeah if it's sad that this Dynamic I think is really going to be something that you see pretty

229
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
I pretty

230
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,167
Clearly in this episode I think just like the definitive Miss of stuff that's like you don't believe that

231
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,495
I mean that is that is really great

232
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,847
As far as like showing you what it is that the that Infowars really cells

233
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:49,503
You know they sell the feeling of somebody who knows what's going on

234
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
Essentially you can take despite the world being horrible would you already knew it was

235
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,767
There's some comfort in knowing that this man has a grasp on

236
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,423
That's not only videos of spotted but like because of that grass that he has what he is describing is a world that is

237
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Is Ron by

238
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Bright sort of

239
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,031
Like A to B to C to D

240
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:17,919
I predictable events and everything there's no chaos or Randomness right there's no like

241
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,783
People who have different interests that sometimes a line and sometimes don't

242
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831
There's none of that

243
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
That that that chaos

244
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
The world that works

245
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,951
Nan a comforting

246
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
Conspiracy that runs everything

247
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
Cousin

248
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
Inexplicably

249
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
The more

250
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,447
Complicated and complex the conspiracy is

251
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,751
The more simple it makes people feel like life

252
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
Because book

253
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
You can just do it

254
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
The large part of the certainty in the comfort that Alex sells

255
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:56,831
But the price is looking like an idiot

256
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Yes

257
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
More more

258
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:29,855
At this point France's population was closer to 61 million people which

259
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:37,023
20 million people off 33% off

260
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
Now

261
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,631
Service book he's talking about is called Left real blood

262
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Posterior

263
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,543
Or the horrifying fraud English under the title 911 the big lie

264
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,359
Since its release the book has been robbed

265
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,943
Comically debunked and its author Terry Mason

266
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
Is not taken seriously by anybody Direct

267
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Mazza's name

268
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:01,087
I mean 2002 article in time Europe

269
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,903
Claims that the book had spent six weeks at the top of the French

270
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
Best seller list

271
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,255
Which is no small feat that's fairly impressive for a book

272
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,863
And I think that's the basis for Alex's outrageous claim that it sold 30 million copies

273
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,471
That number is f****** insane and a June 2002 article

274
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,311
Which is after the whittwood have spent 60 to the top of the charts

275
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,663
This article from June 2002 in CNN puts the sales figure at 200,000

276
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,759
C8 was either that or I believe

277
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
I remember this be

278
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:36,671
But being right there released next to harry-potter-and-the-sorcerer's-stone I think they like the same level of

279
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,511
30 million people like 30 million books sold in France

280
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,607
Like you got to consider like how many people are under the age of 18

281
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:53,055
They turned that book into their National currency I would be surprised

282
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
Price of it sold 30 million

283
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,919
Global

284
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:02,015
Alex could play the real number and it would be impressive if you know anything about like

285
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:07,135
Could book sales or the French book Market

286
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
Jumps off the page

287
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:13,279
In addition to that it's really important for Alex to make the image appear to be the people who believe

288
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
Libra things Infowars reports

289
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,631
Are the majority in the world

290
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
Yeah

291
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
See any of them on your daily basis

292
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:27,103
Doesn't mean that they're not every right but that's why it's harder to make that perception stick when you talk about the United States

293
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,663
Exotic like

294
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,063
911 truth

295
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,695
Indeed they love that.

296
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,791
So are we not friends book Numbers

297
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
We got

298
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
A German

299
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:54,239
Paul that Alex is reporting weirdly

300
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:59,103
Alex has done his own polling

301
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Bermuda on

302
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,063
What

303
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
You heard me on the

304
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
In the morning

305
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
That's not scientific

306
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:06,687
I don't know what conclusions you can draw from the type of calls you get when you guest on radio shows

307
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:13,087
I like the idea of calling that doing a little Pole right now

308
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
I don't know how long

309
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:20,768
For whatever length of time whatever number of people on several radio stations

310
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:25,632
Well that one out of 30 people in America want to kill me

311
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
What are we thinking about

312
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
Dumb

313
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
What hit did you

314
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
Did you research

315
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
What

316
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
His actual poll results

317
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
No

318
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:45,088
I didn't I don't think that I could ever find these Podunk radio show

319
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,416
No-name ass radio shows that he's been on

320
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,792
Have made it

321
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,352
I'll tell you that no no

322
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
New

323
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:02,496
Sober look Alex

324
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
The calls

325
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,080
30 Gates

326
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,224
Multiple interviews today

327
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Keyboard

328
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:11,360
The difference between a good and bad poll is all down to methodology

329
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:18,272
The number of participants is definitely one of the factors but it's much more important variables are controlled directly to end up with

330
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,320
Representative sampling of the population

331
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,160
Which is something that Alex is dumb radio interview pull doesn't capture at all like

332
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:30,816
There's a selection bias personality Alex there shows what types of shows are there

333
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,376
What types of audiences probably listen

334
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424
Do a shoulder would have Alex Auditore

335
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,008
What type of person would call in when Alex was on as a guest

336
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,824
There's there's a lot a lot of

337
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,688
Confounding variables here

338
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,064
Interesting Lee though there's one conclusion you absolutely can draw from Alex's telling their story

339
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,160
9/11 was the best thing that ever happened to him from a career perspective

340
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,976
He went from not really that many people being in

341
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,816
Understand interviewing him to people banging the doors

342
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:08,192
And that's because he claimed a level of confidence and assertiveness in the position you was putting forward

343
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,728
Which made him interesting

344
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,384
He wasn't saying that he questioned the mainstream Narrative of 9/11 and he wasn't saying there were anomalies he wasn't saying that he had doubts

345
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
Those positions would be boring

346
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,344
You were saying loudly and into a bullhorn that it was definitively proven the bush and his administration did 9/11 in the plane

347
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,624
Remote control

348
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,648
He had all the evidence

349
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Dead to rights

350
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
You don't even debating

351
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,584
What makes a person stand out and when is someone who has a clear inherit set of chops

352
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
Like Alex has

353
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
This can lead to a little bit of a media windfall

354
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
And that's exactly what

355
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:46,336
People were confused and trying to make sense of a national tragedy that's ended up affecting the entire world

356
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,896
And Alex is there bombastically offering answer

357
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,200
Hardly matter

358
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,576
Not the reason I bring this up is because it's a no longer profitable for Alex to be certain about 9/11

359
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,904
It wasn't 2002-2003

360
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,744
At that point being uncertain probably would have been a detriment to Alex's bran

361
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,816
And this is exactly what you see with him in the present day

362
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:11,168
He's all but disowned pretty much all of the insane bulshit he was pushing back then

363
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:17,568
You're never going to hear him try to sell a loose change DVD on his show or talk about how the hijackers are still alive

364
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
Stuff you pretend

365
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
Wasn't part of Macon

366
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,224
His career because that would actually be shameful for him to admit

367
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,832
He never could prove any of that stuff but because it got him more attention

368
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,648
Alex represented himself as someone who could prove it all

369
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,744
You manipulated people in the aftermath of a huge tragedy for his own profit

370
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,304
They want it was no longer profitable to sell those lies

371
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,376
He moved on and pretended he never said that stuff to begin with

372
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
I began lying about another

373
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,752
Alex's career is rooted in tragedy profiteering

374
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,592
The most notable events in his career the things that put them on a national stage

375
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,688
All of them were things were he was lying about something painful to someone else

376
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,504
Oklahoma City 911 Sandy Hook

377
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,808
The Boston bombing the Aurora Batman shooting

378
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,112
All of these are events where Alex sold his could

379
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,416
Levy made-up story in the immediate term

380
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,232
Heaven now doesn't want to be judged by what he sold

381
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,280
And I don't accept that and no one should

382
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,304
Its total b*******

383
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
Yeah

384
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,144
Absolute f****** nightmare

385
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:19,520
I want a good person to do huh it is odd like

386
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:25,664
It is it is so f***** up about the way that our media culture is just geared

387
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,040
Like it is geared towards making a man like Alex Jones a star that is a bi mean

388
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,576
As you were saying

389
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
Making those

390
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,696
Claims immediately makes him interesting

391
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:42,560
Think about the guy who wrote that French book

392
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:49,472
It's definitive

393
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:54,080
You cut the top of the bestseller list right it's kind of hacking that that detention

394
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:59,200
I think we accidentally built

395
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
Then

396
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
You know

397
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:05,088
Nuance or confusion or just

398
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
AAA

399
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
Blanket acceptance of like

400
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,184
Oh yeah this is a

401
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
Series of random occurrences

402
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,048
Turn on like NPR All Things Considered and I'll be like

403
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,840
Talk about a story with an extra like

404
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:22,240
If possible this is going to bed we talked we can see that being one way

405
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,288
Or we could see it being the other way

406
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,592
I'm God I'm listening to this then fuc

407
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,152
Comparison Keibler's coming on later

408
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,480
I would turn on Alex

409
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,296
Okay I'm listening

410
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,624
To look there's a lot of people out there in the world

411
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
Who believe 911 was

412
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
Sure I especially in France

413
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,256
And terminate that's true

414
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,632
About

415
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
We offer

416
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
I am stop this already

417
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,088
This report is in the audiobook

418
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Yes

419
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Alright

420
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,184
I don't believe that you read the entire report

421
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,720
Audiobook

422
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
Okay

423
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
I'm listening

424
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,944
He's serious

425
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
He's at

426
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
This is not a joke

427
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,112
Feathers on my back man that wasn't a report.

428
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
But the technology Minister did

429
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:20,000
This is entirely based on an interview that Andreas Von Bulow did with a German newspaper

430
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
Spiegel

431
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
I was published

432
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,608
On January 13th 2002

433
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,264
Modulo had been out of his position as the technology minister in Germany since1982

434
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,896
Miss Bedford technology minister of Technology

435
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:42,272
Yeah that 18 years there was like four more than 1821

436
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,576
He was definitely spouting 911

437
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,928
Conspiracy theories but he wasn't saying it from the position of certainty that Alex is claim

438
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:55,328
Again Alex's game relies on creating the fake impression of certainty and it order for the storage really pop for him

439
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,912
He needs to protect that certainty out to all of his sources including Von Bulow

440
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,312
It's not enough to have it's just say that he gave an interview where he said that he found it Unthinkable that the hijackers could have pulled off

441
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
The attack without intelligence community help

442
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,176
This story needs to be that he proved right

443
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Analysis

444
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,296
It can't be an old man far out of government going like

445
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:21,184
Man this is so crazy it can't be true also my head is Giant

446
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,488
If you're Alex

447
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,304
You need to cram CertainTeed on your audience

448
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
Ancestry

449
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:33,472
You want them to think of themselves as question again skeptical but in reality the most dangerous proposition for you is the eye

450
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
Idea that they might actually start question

451
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
Make things like

452
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
The things you're saying

453
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,896
Why are you so sure of this

454
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,736
Do you want the artificial are of questioning

455
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:51,136
Not so much the reality the impression that they are smarter for not asking you

456
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
You quest right

457
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
Yeah and

458
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
Repeating

459
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,256
The question

460
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
Pat yourself on the back for that

461
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,472
Just to be clear I think Alex now would love

462
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,800
For everyone to believe that all he did was say like

463
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:14,432
I have questions and you know I think the government let 9-11 happen what he wants people to hear

464
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:19,296
That's not at all what he was saying

465
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
You know

466
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:34,656
Pearl Harbor

467
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
Okay so they did it

468
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
All right thing

469
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
Alright so

470
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,920
Now I'm it's so now Port Pearl Harbor was not a false flag

471
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:49,504
No it was it was but it was allowed it was a real event

472
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,784
That could have been

473
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,136
Stop yo what was allowed to happen because might as well have been

474
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,952
Where is with 911

475
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,512
George W got in that f******

476
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:05,632
Complain I would say that's remote controls is probably more like Cheney

477
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:10,240
Right now it's pretty focused on that document but he didn't write

478
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
Yeah

479
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,616
I I think that this is this would be a tough thing for our

480
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
What's the standard height

481
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
In the present day

482
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,992
It is in the years since it is not come out

483
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:27,392
And we are not all convinced that the United States government did a number of things that were in the documentary that Hebrew

484
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:33,792
Produced not true

485
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,120
The only thing that was true was directed by

486
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,704
Jason bermas

487
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,496
So you can't kill the truth

488
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,384
Of some folks who may be trite

489
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
Conspicuous in their absence

490
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,528
The devil

491
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,680
Bought the game

492
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,984
Pandora's Box is open

493
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,456
Matter

494
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,480
Boy

495
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,104
World Order

496
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,896
It's interesting like as I was listen

497
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:57,248
That I was thinking that it can't kill the truth but

498
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:03,648
Apparently what will do the trick in terms of killing something for Alex to decide is not profitable

499
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,184
Pretend it's the truth anymore

500
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:09,792
These globalist don't need to do anything nefarious to get Alex to stop covering something

501
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,632
I just have to wait until his audience gets bored of it and he moves on to another subject

502
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,472
Entailed

503
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
Only proven

504
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:22,336
Are so embarrassing leave his debunked that he needs to pretend he never believe that stuff

505
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
To begin with

506
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
That's the trick

507
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,408
Yeah

508
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,808
Wait about you'll get bored

509
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,880
Anymore

510
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,952
The enemy was nice at the end though like

511
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
Weird that

512
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,744
These folks don't seem

513
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
We working for the devil

514
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
Not anymore

515
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Justin

516
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,960
Good old-fashioned can cartel with human motivations at plant

517
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:55,104
Wouldn't have to really be that crazy to buy into this stuff back then

518
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Really

519
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,944
Get me on the hook

520
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,832
Cartel causing problems very real not even not not only not surprising

521
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,136
Almost certainly happening concert

522
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:12,512
Recognizing that secretly believes that

523
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:18,912
It's a battle between Angels and Demons Supernatural forces

524
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,984
Not sound true to me

525
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
Fannie Mae Freddie Mac

526
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,872

00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,280
Alex is not a good answer

536
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,424
Impression or

537
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
Maybe some of your

538
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
I can't do John Oliver

539
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
Whomever

540
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
Maybe

541
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:58,848
Baby

542
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
Big little menu

543
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
Or getting

544
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,464
What

545
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,312
Cool I can tell you about the C-SPAN guy

546
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:41,600
Totally real that I have multiple sources but I can tell you about a book talk

547
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,928
I know your question was are minions getting cold

548
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,400
Thundermans

549
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Kevin

550
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:02,336
No idea grew is a character

551
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
Which character

552
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,152
I don't know what'll happen

553
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,688
So look

554
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
Talk to sources really

555
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,320
Why would you

556
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,928
Everything is so obvious obvious it's open source

557
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
What

558
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
What

559
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
What

560
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
Do you know how

561
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
No

562
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:23,488
I worried worried about me tell you how we're empowering the Illuminati

563
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,888
I don't know what's going on

564
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:36,288
Logical Veil evidence

565
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:42,688
What was the plan against 5:00 of footage of someone eating somebody

566
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,248
That's too long I don't know if it would take that long

567
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:49,856
Want to eat somebody I would stay fresh

568
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
Yeah

569
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,416
What's cooked

570
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:59,072
Also I love this like I do want to meet with us all the time

571
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:05,472
Great meetings where we have caviar and they tell me I'm great

572
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,800
I have conversations at the adult table

573
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,360
Not like you little babies who take dumb pigs

574
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:16,480
No no I no psychological warfare powering how they died

575
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:23,136
Tell me on this all right I'll try I mean look there's two aspects of it okay

576
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
Number one

577
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
We are

578
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,224
Good level

579
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Haha

580
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,024
Kickflip mctwist

581
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,096
Unbreakable came out in two

582
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:09,472
Something like that right right okay so do you understand what you talking about at all

583
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,824
Can you can you translate that

584
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,176
Is that by telling people what the Illuminati is doing and

585
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,504
People not really being able to do anything to stop it

586
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,856
We are desensitizing them to the Mead 202 stop

587
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
No

588
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
Okay

589
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:38,656
Intuitively on a subconscious level everybody out in the world already knows in their bones and in the

590
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,216
Their Spirit what the Illuminati is doing right

591
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,336
Fine I'm just telling you what I was just

592
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:50,688
So everyone understands that and what Alex is doing is revealing the method

593
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
So he's

594
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
Putting

595
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,576
To conscious mind what unconscious mind already knows

596
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
Sure

597
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,392
So he's telling everybody all this stuff

598
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,696
Which is actually a favor to the globalist

599
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,232
Because then once

600
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,048
The the the the

601
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:12,448
The Prestige happened

602
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:20,128
The Prestige happens in there's the revelation of like what the globalist erupt

603
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:26,528
Then there won't be open rebellion and like a like a civil war breaking out or whatever because Alex Azar

604
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
30 revealed

605
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,576
This two people

606
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,624
So it won't be such a cataclysmic

607
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,440
It's like telling people you're preparing them

608
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,744
Ultimate Echo

609
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
Well it's basically like

610
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,864
The idea that qanon folks had of like

611
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,472
Weird people are going to look at us like we're crazy and then once

612
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:51,872
The Prestige happens basically they'll realize that we we knew all along and we were right

613
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,663
Kind of idea

614
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:58,527
But it's serving the globalist interest because then there won't be a big kaboom

615
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,087
When they reveal happen

616
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,623
Right

617
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:07,743
What was going on right right right right part of the globalist plan apparently but

618
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,791
Subah twist within the twist

619
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,095
Alex's I think referencing

620
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
Like he has

621
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,679
Baked into his content somehow

622
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,215
Away there even

623
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:22,079
This isn't in the globalist best interest or something who knows all right

624
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:26,175
There's a second what's important is that he has outsmarted the globalist

625
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Somehow

626
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,735
I can tell you how

627
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:35,391
They're not real

628
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:41,535
Yeah if you create an enemy for yourself look stupid you know how smart am every single time

629
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:46,911
Who hears this never lost a game to myself and Chesnaught once here's the second way

630
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,727
Conspiracies helping the Illuminati

631
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,079
What happened

632
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
America

633
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
New World Order

634
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,527
Mines in the world

635
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
Liberal

636
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,303
North America

637
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,655
Wharf

638
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,191
Imperial MO

639
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:50,399
Cersei yes indeed

640
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,703
Say yes indeed

641
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
Clearer than the

642
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
First one

643
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:00,127
Right

644
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:03,967
So

645
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,807
If I understand correctly

646
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,879
Is allowed well

647
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,415
Let blood called the Illuminati

648
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,951
That's probably better

649
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:20,351
The Illuminati the the UN has a sub-branch directory

650
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,399
List of the

651
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,703
Okay so the Illuminati

652
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,239
Has revealed that

653
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,311
Delicious

654
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
That

655
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,383
The United States did 9/11

656
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
Right in order for the world

657
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,503
I hate America including America

658
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,527
The concert

659
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:44,159
And then Americans themselves will say we don't want America anymore we want to join

660
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,207
Do you end that we are already a part

661
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,839
Yeah more or less or less but I think the subtle difference

662
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,631
The distinction is

663
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,911
The globalist

664
00:44:55,167 --> 00:45:01,311
The Illuminati don't they're not putting out the America did 9/11

665
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,103
Take Alex to get that message out

666
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,687
Which time tarnishes the image of America

667
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,991
Doing their job well but he

668
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,271
He's trying to be very

669
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
Quitter

670
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,111
Said it's not America that did it

671
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:21,023
A hundred percent of his audience on a shirt that says Bush did.

672
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
He's doing the thing

673
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,887
He's not cuz he's distinguishing

674
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:31,007
Between the globalist of taken over the United States Americana

675
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
States rights

676
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,055
The Lure of America

677
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,151
He has more important that you can't kill the Lord Lord didn't do it

678
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:42,271
The Lord and do 911

679
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,087
The color has been interesting quote

680
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,647
To help Alex feel better

681
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,695
No

682
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:56,351
If you recall our last 2003 episode Canadian called in and wanted to get to fight with Alex

683
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:02,495
About how he's a coward for not supporting the war

684
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
Alex

685
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,103
Still a little Rob at this I think because this car wants to make him feel better

686
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,639
With a Teddy Roosevelt quote

687
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,687
I guess yesterday

688
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,711
Coming from

689
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
Tradernick

690
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,391
I promised really

691
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Or that we

692
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
Standby

693
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,831
Did you need to save us

694
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
And when the government

695
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,399
What

696
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
Real quote

697
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:10,847
That's an actual quote from an editorial that Teddy Roosevelt wrote in 1918

698
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,663
The problem I have is that that is not an election year

699
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,991
Woodrow Wilson won reelection in 1916

700
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:21,855
Hey Teddy Roosevelt has been out of office for about a decade at that point and one year away from death

701
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,671
The context for this quote is actually really ironic

702
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,719
If you know where this got

703
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:33,119
This caller is using it to defend Alex from that Canadian guy who said that Alex was a coward for not supporting the war in Iraq

704
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:33,887
Boarding bush

705
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,655
Well

706
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
In Roosevelt case

707
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,007
He was writing this editorial but how it's great the question

708
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:43,615
In the government of the president because he was actually born in favor of War than Woodrow Wilson

709
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
Any gotten some flak for that

710
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:51,295
In the previous two years he been writing editorials about how the US needed to get more involved in World War 1

711
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,599
Arguing that Wilson wasn't being strong enough

712
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:59,231
The editorial of this quote come from is his defensive himself on accusations of him being disloyal

713
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:02,303
We're calling for more war than the president was way too

714
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,887
We can all agree that it's fine to criticize the present

715
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:09,215
It's just funny that Alex is lying about when this was written

716
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:15,615
Hey takes this quote about justifying a desire from World War

717
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:22,015
Overthrow a government if it just decide that it's full of usurpers

718
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,063
You just can't stop himself

719
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,695
Compulsive liar Roosevelt was taking a bath

720
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,511
You know what's fun about Theodore Roosevelt taking a bath

721
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:36,607
He had two bathtubs that he put side-by-side he was the original

722
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,655
Viagra commercial I think

723
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,935
That's

724
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,751
Part of it was an Impulse to be like

725
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,823
He was selfless and saying this in the even when

726
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,199
And he was running for president he said it's good.

727
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,039
I don't know he wasn't good with

728
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,599
Presidential criticism when he was the president

729
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
Strangely enough

730
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
I think

731
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
Alex

732
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,439
Just thinks it's a

733
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,487
More interesting story

734
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
He wants

735
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:10,655
To be interesting really bad

736
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
It usually does start there

737
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
Yeah

738
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,007
I don't know I

739
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,055
I do find it

740
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,591
Little bit

741
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Frustrating

742
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,431
That if I did take the time to like

743
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:28,831
Really lay out every time there's like one that's an extraneous detail the gooseneck account we would never finish the show

744
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:34,975
We be here for a long time it would be a 24-hour livestream in perpetuity of dislike

745
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:39,071
Well here's a weird detail

746
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,863
Team 98

747
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,911
Alex really enjoyed

748
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,215
That idea that he laid out of

749
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:49,823
The globalist want to make the US look bad and want to join the u.s.

750
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,919
Think I've heard him say that too much

751
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,223
But he expounds on a little more.

752
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
Level

753
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:11,839
Okay

754
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:20,287
Because

755
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:24,639
There's so many fantasy layers to this belief but if you really think about it

756
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:28,991
I was kind of really does need to create this elaborate maze in order to

757
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,295
Defend his points against obvious Roboto

758
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:37,695
For instance you have to ask yourself is allowed to be on Aaron profit from yelling about how Bush did 9/11

759
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,767
Just go home and live in peace of it

760
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:46,399
The new world orders of bloodthirsty Kabbalah murderers will defend their banking cartel at all costs

761
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,703
They orchestrated both world wars

762
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,263
Zagato magic they can handle taking out an idiot in Texas

763
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,663
If you were doing something they didn't like of course and that's why they're letting him do it because

764
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:00,479
They're okay with thinking people knowing about 9/11

765
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,343
Alex isn't popular enough for him to use the I'm out in the public so they have

766
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,951
Let me live kind of think so I think this is kind of a decent tops

767
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,535
And for him to go with to explain his own existence within this

768
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:19,935
The scheme only did 911 but they did it intentionally sloppy enough

769
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:24,287
Subway so that the thinking people in the world would see the obvious Clues they left behind

770
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:28,639
And they would use these to argue that the US did 9/11 which is

771
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,663
A great

772
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:34,015
Plan B a judo move

773
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:39,647
In reality they want people to say that the US did 9/11 so that they can make us look bad

774
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,719
And trick people into liking the who at right

775
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,303
There's so many moving Parts in this plant and none of it makes sense

776
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,607
If Alex was right in the New World Order

777
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:55,007
Secretly wanted people to think that the US did 9/11 the people who said that the US did 9/11 be promoted and put

778
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,031
Bush by the media

779
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,079
And not completely marginalized

780
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,919
Do you think that the global is to control all world media

781
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:06,527
Wouldn't want 9/11 conspiracy theorist to be treated like completely unhinged idiot

782
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,319
Because their claims being accepted

783
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,135
Essential step in achieving the globalist

784
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,463
And yet every news story from around the time

785
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:19,071
About 9/11 conspiracies treats these people is completely wrong or is malicious liar

786
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:23,423
That shouldn't be the case of what Alex is saying is that you don't understand

787
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,263
Only thinking people need to know this information

788
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:31,871
Right and the only way to get thinking people to know this information

789
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:35,967
Is to have the mainstream media deny that information

790
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:40,319
Because thinking people will then go oh well the mainstream media is always lying to me

791
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:45,951
So if the mainstream media is telling this side of story that means obviously that the truth is

792
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,719
That the United

793
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,279
States did 911 however not the United States government

794
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:54,911
Actually the Illuminati

795
00:52:55,935 --> 00:53:02,079
Listen I would have been a lot better it's categories I'll tell you that right now

796
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:08,479
Really wanted to make people not like the United States ticket just have like a more realistic Frank discussion about US foreign policy

797
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,503
DNR history

798
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,575
That would probably tarnish people's impressions of our country real quick

799
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:18,975
There's no need to do a 9/11 what is unnecessary the real story of Banana Republic

800
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:25,375
In every high school textbook and everybody will be like oh yeah I hate America

801
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,167
So

802
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:32,031
I think I kind of agree with something that a caller says a little bit earlier

803
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,615
Point out how recently was

804
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,639
Uday Hussein

805
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,807
Celebrating the death of humanity

806
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,599
Totally forget the we've already lost

807
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,671
Everyday

808
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,591
So Alex is still not to believe in Minute saddam's Kids

809
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:12,991
They're fine another great prediction

810
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,831
He knows okay

811
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
Yeah man

812
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,951
The Illuminati it was pretty grotesque

813
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,255
The releasing the death footage

814
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,791
The Dead images of them

815
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,071
I understand

816
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,119
There was a reason why

817
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,703
The government did that we talked about that a little bit but like I still don't

818
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,543
How do I understand the reason as an explanation

819
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,847
Don't think it was the right thing to do

820
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,127
And Alex is really dumb

821
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,919
So

822
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,735
All those things can be true simultaneous

823
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,503
Alex

824
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,783
That believes they're fake

825
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,063
Eddie gives just the

826
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
Perfect

827
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,623
Real world

828
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,647
Analogy

829
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,183
Let's explain it

830
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,487
Photograph

831
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,399
Forensics

832
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,639
Anyway okay

833
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
When the computer

834
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,231
92

835
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:48,735
It's all good well to present a theory that the government's going to fake some kind of evidence but I think

836
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,319
It doesn't really make for a compelling case when you just come up with like

837
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:58,975
We're trying to come up with a real life example and you just reference of movie that Sub-Zero

838
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,511
Was chasing down

839
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
John Richard Wright

840
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,607
And he was on the ice rink

841
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,167
And that's the ice rink is the Twin Towers

842
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:10,495
Okay and so is skating on the ice rink and that's okay.

843
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,311
And then

844
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,383
In the Gold's net which is

845
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,967
Alex Jones story

846
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:25,855
You may notice that Alex does this all the time because he believes that movies are speaking cryptic messages

847
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:30,207
The New World Order is taunting him and revealing their truths through the movies

848
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:36,607
Mickey chooses to see it's just like running man

849
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,375
The New World Order

850
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,447
Do you think that he's claiming that they do all the time. He's

851
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,727
Out of his mind

852
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:47,359
The Pentagon did really just released photos of Uday and kusay is bodies which a lot of people

853
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,127
We thought was gross

854
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:54,015
Alex and just pretending that they didn't also do dental exams and x-rays to confirm

855
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,807
These bodies were in fact

856
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,623
Because it sounds more fishy if it was just a picture

857
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:02,719
It sounds way better if you say all of their spending days preparing

858
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,767
They're not doing any of those

859
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:08,095
Normal things are legit before this episode is over

860
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:14,495
Of course also there were things like he's having an 8-inch metal bar in its leg which they got after he was the tar

861
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:18,079
Target of an attempted assassination in 1996

862
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,383
Is he right now what

863
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,991
There were plenty of pieces of evidence that these were saddam's kids but the Pentagon was also

864
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,015
Really set

865
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,575
I'm making sure that people who are fighting

866
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,111
Against them in a rock

867
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:30,879
Accepted

868
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,159
These were saddam's kids

869
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,951
Because bad weather demoralized

870
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:38,303
I understand the reason why you would release the photos again

871
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,071
I think it's gross

872
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:45,471
I suspect that the clear intention that was evident that they wanted to prove that this was rude and kusay

873
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,287
Turn off the distrust alarm if people like Alex in this caller

874
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,567
Yeah and they can't accept

875
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,359
What's being sad

876
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,407
Because they are so trained

877
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,687
To be defiant

878
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,967
And

879
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,783
And it's almost a preemptive attack

880
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,551
Check on them

881
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,343
You know that idea of like

882
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,623
We're going to release the photos

883
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:09,279
So you can't lie about it you know they've they have to immediately go like a f****** lie about it for sure

884
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,815
For now

885
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,095
This defiance

886
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,399
Sing it doesn't even really mad right I don't

887
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,447
I think what's being said like if

888
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,471
Biden

889
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,263
The International Community

890
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:26,175
I don't know how this would happen but

891
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,455
Right

892
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,991
Alex will be defending Ukraine

893
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:32,319
You know yeah you're probably right it's

894
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,647
It doesn't matter it's just whatever is being said

895
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,207
By the people that he doesn't like he's got to take the office

896
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,231
Society

897
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,255
Tiring

898
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,791
Like we're teaming up with

899
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:45,119
Russia to fight the Nazis in Ukraine come out

900
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:51,519
I did qualify that I don't know how

901
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,799
How that would happen

902
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,871
Pick the opposite 700%

903
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,407
Sounds good another caller

904
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,943
This means nothing

905
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,967
It has nothing to do with any

906
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,039
But I really enjoy this guy's thought pattern

907
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
Intelligent

908
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,207
Started a new age

909
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,655
Yeah because

910
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,495
Several years back

911
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
Pass regularly

912
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
I said how could they

913
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,223
Protocol

914
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,159
Successful New Age Bookstore in Mississippi

915
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,439
He's like

916
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:48,351
A lot of other conclusions you could come too

917
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:51,167
Like a tax shelter shelter

918
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:57,567
Obviously

919
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:01,151
Independently wealthy

920
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:07,551
I'll run this new age bookstore in the red just so I have somewhere to go everyday

921
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:14,975
Successful person in business

922
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:21,375
Someday all kinds of explanations that don't require the CIA is subsidizing

923
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,959
My Town Barber the f*** you live what you do and you say that

924
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,775
Ninety-nine times out of a hundred

925
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:34,175
I'm wrong but if I'm right that one time I saved everybody's like let's talk about what

926
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,455
Gordon's this

927
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:41,855
Small-town bookstore or whatever has to the larger New Age movement

928
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:46,207
Secret of this conspiracy my friend I never saw anybody in

929
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,231
Is it like

930
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:53,887
The central Hub of the New Age movement

931
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,423
What he's got to do

932
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
Underground bunker

933
01:00:56,703 --> 01:01:01,823
There's something underneath there that is so his small town he's got

934
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,359
Giant oil deposit

935
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:08,991
Directly beneath the new age bookstore and CIA starts the entirety of new age thought

936
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,551
18 liquor

937
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,879
94

938
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:18,463
And that is how they get all the oil for tank

939
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,767
It all comes from that one new age

940
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
Wow

941
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:28,959
That we never would have cracked the code if it wasn't for the scholar I'm proud of him

942
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,983
Listcrawlers

943
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
I've been trying to

944
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,359
19

945
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,127
98

946
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,919
Now

947
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,111
Piano playing

948
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,135
Oh boy

949
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,695
Go and no trouble

950
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,999
Some idiot talking about

951
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,023
An invisible dog

952
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,983
1998

953
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,335
Leave us alone

954
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
Delois Smith

955
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,127
Chester Campbell

956
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,295
Well you need to go in

957
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,391
Get those bylaws

958
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,071
You'll be here in about 10 minutes

959
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
From New York

960
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
Emergence

961
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:50,879
Wow you must be really disseminating some pretty seriously dangerous information if

962
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:57,279
The fattest shut down these stations

963
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,863
Obviously

964
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,143
For whatever reason

965
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,703
How many coaches be situation where they don't have a slot

966
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,471
4 mg

967
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:08,799
And some people might be more aggressive about trying to get there slot

968
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:12,383
Maybe he's going about it the wrong way talking to attorneys

969
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:17,503
Yeah that is a weird way to go Alex's describing

970
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,551
Like give them a lawsuit

971
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,087
That is merit-based

972
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,647
He's essentially saying threatened

973
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,695
Put you on there

974
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,719
Do it on a deal with it

975
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:33,119
They don't have a log and slapped with a lawsuit anymore are yet in 2003 so depending on the state you might

976
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,655
Be able to let that s***

977
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:41,311
This is basically harass them with the threat of litigation that you'll get on air and then you can play my stuff in them

978
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,591
In doing so you

979
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,383
You will destroy the station

980
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,431
Correct

981
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,247
I like this I like this

982
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:54,623
Mediacom series of events that would totally occur

983
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,415
As he described

984
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,231
The FBI would show up

985
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:03,839
At a local Access TV station

986
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:08,959
Dare you sir are in the back want Animo totally

987
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:11,519
This is a bit racist

988
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:18,175
Well I mean that last caller was a bit racist to a touch he had the racism

989
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:27,135
Wildly specific about an idiot with an invisible dog fence

990
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,671
Yeah you might have tattoos

991
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,951
This is a bit more race

992
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,023
I will be nice a BioLife

993
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,583
The world I was in the military

994
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,119
But

995
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,911
15 years ago Alex

996
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,471
Fast food restaurant

997
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
McDonald's

998
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,519
Wendy's Taco Bell

999
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,799
You name it

1000
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:54,271
Hispanic working in the restaurant

1001
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
Frugal

1002
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:05,791
They were going

1003
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
Leader

1004
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,551
They're the majority report

1005
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
The government

1006
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,663
Works for the state of Illinois

1007
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,687
She told me

1008
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,223
Heard that.

1009
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,247
You do a lot of

1010
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,063
Gas stations

1011
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,343
Dunkin Donuts

1012
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,391
Pakistani or Indian

1013
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,007
What

1014
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,103
More

1015
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,991
Bring home

1016
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:42,303
You may notice that the scholars is bringing up a feeling buddy as they're all fast food kitchens have a lot of Hispanic

1017
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,887
Conversation

1018
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:52,799
It's fascinating how about a minority group getting mentioned and is mine flips through the

1019
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
Cointreau

1020
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,847
This is what comes out

1021
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,711
This isn't Alex complaining about his perception that immigrant crime is completely out of

1022
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,247
Control in that all these

1023
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:05,343
Fake IDs are accepted for immigrants at this is destroying the country

1024
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:10,463
Mind goes when someone brings up a feeling that a lot of fast-food workers are Hispanic

1025
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:14,047
And that should tell you a lot about Alex and his racist ass brain

1026
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:20,447
You bet also the idea that foreigners get tax exemption is a completely racist myth that circulated forever to demonize

1027
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,983
Non-white business owners

1028
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,263
But it's not true at all

1029
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:28,895
The irony here is that it actually has its roots in another reality of immigration the people like Alex

1030
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:35,295
Isn't real name leave it if you're not eligible for most federal benefits from the government till 5 years

1031
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
Cipher you immigrate

1032
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:41,439
Because the right-wing media are they need to portray immigrants as Soleus strain on the system

1033
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,487
This entire thing needs to be inferred

1034
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:49,119
In reality most folks aren't eligible for benefits and if they run a business they have to pay taxes

1035
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:55,519
This gets reported at by races xenophobe like Alex has them getting rich on welfare immediately and being text

1036
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,799
Exempt for 7 years

1037
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,383
It's just big and s*** and there's nothing real about this at all

1038
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,407
GIF at again

1039
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:04,991
Trec this payoff turn into the

1040
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,039
Great replacement conspiracy theory

1041
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:12,415
The idea that the globalists are trying to bring in all these immigrants using incentives like welfare tax exemption

1042
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,719
In order to bring in a population that votes

1043
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:18,815
Subserviently for things that'll take the country way from the rightful whites like out

1044
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
Alex

1045
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,399
In more recent times with a lot of mass shootings

1046
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:26,495
Violence directed at immigrants and being inspired by people's anger immigration

1047
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,311
This great replacement conspiracy has gotten a lot of a 10

1048
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:36,223
It's important to recognize though that this was a belief that was very clearly and regularly articulated on Alex's show going

1049
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,503
At least a decade

1050
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:42,111
The people who are carrying out these shootings now could very easily have been raised

1051
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,671
What kind of information space but Alex creates

1052
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:49,279
Or this fraudulent perception and perspective on immigrations just accept it as reality

1053
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:50,815
It's

1054
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:51,839
It's not

1055
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,119
Recent

1056
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,143
Yeah I mean

1057
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:57,471
You go back to Pat Buchanan you go back

1058
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,799
To you can just keep going back and back and back because

1059
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,103
White people are terrified

1060
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,639
That they won't

1061
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,223
Be able to run roughshod over the rest of the world for

1062
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,247
Long

1063
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:13,087
I am just that things are being taken the right over here

1064
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
Yeah

1065
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,135
You're not even being

1066
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:20,767
So throughout this entire episode Alex has been bringing up that the website is down

1067
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,559
Florists.com is down

1068
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,887
Non

1069
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,655
Scandal

1070
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,959
Open till the hack

1071
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,175
Compartmentalize

1072
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,439
Wait aren't they letting you

1073
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:56,863
The word about

1074
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:57,887
Alternative

1075
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:58,911
Information

1076
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,727
My iTunes

1077
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,495
A guy

1078
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,455
United

1079
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:15,807
Farm

1080
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,719
Dot-com

1081
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
Literally

1082
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,167
Reloaderz

1083
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,703
A few minutes

1084
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,223
What

1085
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,279
He doesn't know their names but Maddy's sure they're not bad

1086
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:02,399
Yeah so now we've got a coordinated a massive attack on the website

1087
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,935
Here's how we talked about it

1088
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,215
The beginning of the show like

1089
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,031
I didn't even check clips of him talking about it cuz I thought like

1090
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:11,103
That's basically all that was going on

1091
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,063
Tomorrow

1092
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,671
We've had it

1093
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,607
We have some

1094
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,375
Problem

1095
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,727
Because of some of the

1096
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,287
Where are

1097
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,663
And we've already got the

1098
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:48,991
Network

1099
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,015
Working in the bunch

1100
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,319
That people can

1101
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,879
Infowars

1102
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,951
Dot-com

1103
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,327
Detect problem

1104
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:09,727
What I heard them talking about it at the beginning of the show I was like you're leaving money on the table man

1105
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,287
Labradoodle

1106
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:16,383
Victim time baby you're under attack

1107
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,175
Because I mean obviously

1108
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,455
If someone

1109
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,735
Someone's attacking the website

1110
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,295
Call Buster.

1111
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,575
That means they're only doing it

1112
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,599
Cuz they're scared

1113
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:28,671
Of the information why you do this

1114
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,439
Right

1115
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:34,815
Here's the problem I have with this right now

1116
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,119
How can the global us both be

1117
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:40,959
Furiously trying to shut down alternative media sites

1118
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:43,263
And simultaneously

1119
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,287
Using

1120
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,335
Alternative media to

1121
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:52,735
Disseminate information that they need disseminated it's because

1122
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:57,855
They know that the globalist attacking him will make him look more legit right

1123
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:04,255
And so they're doing it right

1124
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,023
The United Nation

1125
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,327
I mean you know it when you put it like that

1126
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:15,775
Here's my problem WhatsApp

1127
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,055
There is that

1128
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:19,615
Tens of millions of hits every month

1129
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:26,015
Maybe there are millions of individual pageviews not visitors enough to

1130
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,807
F****** stupid site

1131
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:32,415
It's because he's too

1132
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:46,751
Mountain

1133
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:03,391
I mean he did say earlier that it was actually

1134
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,159
Not even

1135
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:10,559
Traffic in the town where the servers are weird

1136
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,607
We were hell

1137
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,143
The DDOS attack and

1138
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,935
Apparently a saboteur

1139
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:18,239
It's all things at once

1140
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,287
That sounds right this is sort of a inter

1141
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,591
Interesting Pro do a version of

1142
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,871
But Alex is marketing

1143
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,151
Plan that he would use

1144
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,455
Once I got kicked off all the Social Media stuff

1145
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:33,855
Verboten information

1146
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,159
This

1147
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:40,511
People not wanting my s*** around

1148
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:45,631
Kind of setback that I can have whether it is getting kicked off something or attack problem

1149
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,703
Can be presented as proof that what I'm doing is

1150
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:55,103
F****** serious and dangerous and it'll never stop because people really don't want me around is true

1151
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,895
Wow is it true

1152
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:57,663
Now

1153
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,199
We could have sex

1154
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,295
The saboteurs

1155
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:06,879
But actually we do

1156
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,671
Warren

1157
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:32,991
Wow

1158
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:37,599
That is very sad

1159
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,903
That's that's the type of

1160
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,487
Bulshit where I barely got offer that day like man that was

1161
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:48,607
That was so great when I ripped into that DDOS attack those pretty guys did you hear that

1162
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,631
We got attacked

1163
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:54,239
Angel I've heard this

1164
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:56,287
Those are song

1165
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,591
I don't remember any of the other members of

1166
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,687
Look

1167
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,223
This is somebody's.

1168
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:09,087
This is the furthest back I've heard the heck

1169
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,623
Attack

1170
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,415
Games played

1171
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,439
And

1172
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,463
Funky

1173
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,303
Young

1174
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:20,863
Internet * 03

1175
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:27,263
That's crazy it's true it's hard to choose probably hosting on Angelfire and s*** this is probably

1176
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:32,895
Play before he had an Infowars dating on Netscape

1177
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:36,479
So that's dumb it's fun for him

1178
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,015
But you get the call

1179
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,063
This is where everything goes

1180
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,111
Okay good

1181
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:49,023
It was a Sumptuous I won't know the main twist isn't this caller is a sovereign citizen

1182
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,839
Watching something I'm hearing

1183
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,399
Public Access

1184
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,007
Speechless

1185
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,591
I don't even remember who is getting

1186
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,871
He talked about

1187
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,431
Call Noni

1188
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,735
Nations are actually nations are really Corporation

1189
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
And

1190
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
Everything runs

1191
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,599
International marriage

1192
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:18,975
Actually work

1193
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,255
$630,000

1194
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:21,791
Do the US

1195
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,263
Could you stop

1196
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,543
World we post

1197
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111
34

1198
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,383
We don't

1199
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,783
Yeah this dude just tell him straight up siren City

1200
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,367
9 oz rambling around making

1201
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,927
Vague references to some document but

1202
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:24,255
Actually just the National Security study memorandum 200

1203
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:28,095
This is an analysis of population growth Trends and their implications

1204
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,375
For National Security

1205
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:32,703
Nothing to do with signing over populations as collateral in the

1206
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,983
The stuff about sterilization

1207
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:39,103
Is just Alex lying about suggestions in the document about providing funding for contraception and the develop

1208
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
Open world

1209
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:46,015
Yep everything Alex is saying is b******* deployed to justify The Sovereign citizen nonsense with his collar is asking

1210
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:52,927
Rubik's of wonder if Alex actually believes The Sovereign citizenship or if this is just a desperate attempt to make sure the

1211
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,999
The audience thinks he knows everything and is really interesting

1212
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,535
Yeah I can't tell

1213
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,815
Maybe both I mean

1214
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,655
That might as well be Sovereign citizenship

1215
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,215
No caller is bring it up and Alex's

1216
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,007
You bet

1217
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,031
In function

1218
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:11,615
Pretty bad if you're a listener and you believe Alex

1219
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,431
He's leading you down an insane and dangerous path

1220
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,527
These kinds of beliefs model directly into the world of sovereign Citizen Community

1221
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:21,855
A greater chance of taking an ideas about how your

1222
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:26,463
Supposed rights might make you kill a cop who pulls you over for driving without a license

1223
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:31,327
Alex should really be more careful and not just makes it up whenever he wants to feel smart

1224
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,423
But there's a sub twist

1225
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:36,703
Photo

1226
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,695
Three-story house

1227
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,112
I'm sorry what

1228
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,416
And that was

1229
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,072
Do I understand correctly

1230
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,864
That the judge said

1231
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:39,680
This is maritime law

1232
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:43,520
So the judges he was declaring this is akumatized

1233
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,872
All right I just want to be clear

1234
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:54,528
That Google Images no I really do and I see the judge being it

1235
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,808
An absurdly tall Ben

1236
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,672
She's looking up like I just went by Homeplace to making like a legitimate

1237
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,440
Really

1238
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:04,256
Grounded legal argument

1239
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:10,656
Lady I'm sorry it doesn't matter this is Mayor time I would like to quotes

1240
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:13,472
Many different citator cases

1241
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,520
Maritime law

1242
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:20,384
Marathon

1243
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:27,040
I have to really wrestle with the fact that

1244
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:31,904
Galax does believe Sovereign citizenship has also really fantastic

1245
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,520
Does sound ridiculous

1246
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,064
And everyone

1247
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,000
Construe

1248
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:08,768
Scary stuff

1249
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:12,096
That's some pretty scary stuff

1250
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:12,864
Pirates

1251
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,936
Should we be flying the Jolly Rodger

1252
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,240
I mean what do you mean

1253
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:21,312
Are you asking if it's a good idea to

1254
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,104
You like he's saying that

1255
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:29,504
1 ways to get around a lot of these problems they simply to fly the Jolly Rodger I wonder if he's actually

1256
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:35,904
We talkin about the Jolly Rodger flag or is it the metaphor for like the mark of the beast

1257
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,696
Need to generate

1258
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,232
Specifically about

1259
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,536
Well I make a skull and bones is

1260
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:47,936
Like the Jolly Rodger makes me think that it is literally a stall a crossbow

1261
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,984

1264
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,104

Well you got to give it up to him

1266
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:04,576
It's true wherever they are now Blackbeard is of the devil

1267
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,112
Something like that

01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,672
Weather make you walk the plank that's really about accepting Jesus

1269
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:13,280
So if I understand correctly if I understand correctly you

1270
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,584

1271
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,984

01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,712

1280
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,736
Or governor

1281
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,504
How did that go

1282
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:09,088
Alex doesn't seem to care that much of that also does not like

1283
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:13,184
Call wasn't interested

1284
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,000
Especially compared to like this Revelation that Alex's

1285
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,304
Probably a sovereign citizen

1286
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,400
I mean really she dances around it so much

1287
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:26,240
This is one of the more concrete instances of like oh you do believe

1288
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,008

I think I've

1291
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:31,616
Think he's at this place in his head where it's like

1292
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,176
I believe this is true

1293
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,736
But I know that they're not going to act

1294
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:40,832
Like it's true I'm not going to be the person who drives around without a license

1295
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,624
I have to follow all these rules

1296
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:49,024
But I know in my heart that I don't really have to I'm not going to send the notice in my social site
