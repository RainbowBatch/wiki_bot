1
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,376
Alex

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,424
Birthstone colors

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,384
And talk a little bit

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,784
Today's yeah we're both a little bit hungover

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,648
Very hungover we went out to have a few drinks

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,696
You repeat it

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,632
Gridley dosed with

8
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:42,240
The mayor may not be true

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,848
Regardless

10
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
Cuz you had to go get your own board you're on Scrabble board for the bar

11
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,696
Walk around with your own Scrabble board everyone was telling you how cool you are

12
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,560
Also for those interested Jordan did beat me by

13
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,096
Spypoint

14
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
Furious

15
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,264
Very unhappy about it

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,312
Series that you didn't like my words

17
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,640
I didn't I thought that your gameplay was

18
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
Possibly overly defensive

19
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,832
I was I was working to open up

20
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
The boardroom

21
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,464
The possibilities that we could collaborative right word

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
My girlfriend

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
No

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,192
It's a it's a game to your a capitalist man capitalist

25
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,752
Okay alright I'm more of an arc

26
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,056
Speaking of capitalism

27
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,104
I'd like to give a shout out

28
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
Are you transition

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,784
God

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,648
Like to give a big shout-out to Heather thank you so much

31
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
Heather

32
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
You very much

33
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,048
Don't get mad until you're brilliant

34
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
Yeah

35
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,888
Congratulations

36
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
Ever happened to the best thing that ever happened because

37
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,408
We talked about this not mattering is recorded but I've still self-conscious about it

38
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,552
So we have an episode that's going to drop at the end of the week that I intended to drop at the beginning of the week but I switched

39
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
So if you get a little bit confused by that

40
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
Don't worry about it everything is cool

41
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
But today

42
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:45,120
We're not deliberately f****** with your head

43
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
We're going to put out on Friday

44
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,960
I think we might say it's Monday

45
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,056
Or something like that

46
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
Alright

47
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,640
I don't know but

48
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
Jordan

49
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
Got to play this out of context

50
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Okay

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,648
Excited about what we're going to be going over today okay

52
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
2015 episode

53
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
2015 New Year's Eve

54
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,536
On the Alex Jones program

55
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,120
New Year's Eve is the best

56
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
Kind of holiday

57
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
Because it's a holiday that everyone

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Concelebrate

59
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,312
Has nothing to do necessarily with religion has nothing to do with

60
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,896
Nation of origin is nothing jingoistic about it

61
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
All it is

62
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:36,320
Is a time to reflect on the last year that's happened in your life

63
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
Talking about

64
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,024
A calendar is white nationalist Chinese New Year's Eve tattoo

65
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,424
Holidays that are really just about reflection and about like do better next time around

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm into celebration

67
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
Dave remember syndrome

68
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,664
None of this will be relative

69
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,296
He hasn't yet

70
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,368
I think I might have cut out some of that stuff

71
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:15,488
He has a guest on that I've been itching to talk about for the entire

72
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Podcast

73
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
And he comes on

74
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,607
It's the first time in the coverage

75
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
The era that we've been covering

76
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
His name is James David Manning

77
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
And he has number two

78
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,079
On my list of my favorite crazy on Alex

79
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:34,175
See the third Manning brother is not but here is an out-of-context drop

80
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,991
Make me laugh

81
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,575
Five minutes earlier today

82
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
I mentioned this

83
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
Someone

84
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
Someone sodomites

85
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Get me a bucket of poop

86
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,839
Did I tell you I left

87
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,919
Directions from the pulpit

88
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,855
Somebody said this dude a bag of entire story when when we go

89
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Get there

90
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
He is a he's a preacher he has it all

91
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
New York update

92
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
Open up in New York

93
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
He is

94
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,543
Amazingly crazy best kind of crazy

95
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
He may have

96
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
Accidentally sent himself a bye

97
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,943
I wouldn't put it quite frankly

98
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
Anti-gay

99
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,695
Preacher is in trouble

100
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
Also

101
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Anti-black

102
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,095
I should be clear about this

103
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
Hates black people

104
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,471
It's fascinating and we're going to get into all right but we got Noah

105
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
He doesn't come with

106
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
The beginning of the show

107
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
So we got to start as the show starts

108
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,151
We got to find out Alex Jones

109
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
The last we left off we talked about the 29

110
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
We discussed

111
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
Did you days prior to

112
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
Receiving

113
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,391
Alex Jones has accepted the years

114
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
With Donald Trump

115
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
Right

116
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
Who was like

117
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,535
How long does it take him

118
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
To go from there

119
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,655
To Americana 2.0 I think you're going to see

120
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:36,799
It was very quick cuz I think it might even be in this episode you start to see like the show is

121
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,359
So much more about Trump

122
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
I would say three quarters of this episode is about

123
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
How great

124
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
Gotcha

125
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
Very fast

126
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
But

127
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,087
Alex starts the show by talking about John Wayne

128
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Sun

129
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
And how he is one of the elite

130
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Anchorage

131
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
My son lives next door

132
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
The monster

133
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
Here Comes John Wayne's son

134
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,863
Hispanic John Wayne

135
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
And

136
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
It's not also if I were the elite

137
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,415
Don't think I would care about John Wayne's son

138
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,975
I think he would be very low on my list

139
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,119
Press release

140
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
You have no respect for

141
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
I don't

142
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
This is why the West is dying

143
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
Everybody knows you're not

144
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,967
John Wayne movie stars and their offspring

145
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:26,367
Americana

146
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,511
It is but I bet

147
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,327
I can't tell you

148
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
How funny I think that like

149
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,727
James David Manning not to jump the gun okay puts out

150
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:47,871
So many f****** videos on his YouTube channel that it's impossible for us to cover everything

151
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:54,271
We could do an entire podcast about him I think it might be more fun we're right on the

152
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
To find like

153
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,903
You know fun stuff that he said over the years

154
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
What if title was

155
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
Lights tent me a bucket

156
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,863
Is how it starts

157
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
To tell anybody about

158
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
You don't have to tell it just look at it and be like it's not like these.

159
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,551
Publicized

160
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,951
There's nothing funnier than that video

161
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,255
Alright I have some Madea movies

162
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
My friend

163
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
Wait till we get to Savannah's other staff

164
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
But strong

165
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Through

166
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
Alex Jones episode before

167
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
It's there in this clip

168
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,991
Expresses a good bit of

169
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
Ambivalent racism

170
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Assertive

171
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
I guess is a way to put it

172
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,903
Alright

173
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,207
More aware of

174
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
His bigotry then he likes

175
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Flashlight on

176
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
We need

177
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
Arab Spring in America

178
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,079
What is the radical left

179
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
Yeah sure

180
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,023
Black lives matter has some good points and you know sunset

181
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,399
Stole that it's George

182
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,703
Of course it's going to have some legitimate

183
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,799
What

184
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:59,199
Crazy

185
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,039
He's just going to be right you know he's got some good

186
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
Soros don't worry about that.

187
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,183
The points are about how you murdering black

188
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,023
People don't worry about those good points

189
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
Now there's a Civil War coming

190
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
And it definitely has nothing to do with the fact that we are f****** over black people nothing

191
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,711
Put the put them aside and I want to make you racist

192
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
Spring is happening

193
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
The radical left

194
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Is the thing that I

195
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,535
I think it will I think we're exactly

196
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:58,079
Right even though they were funded

197
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
Till the cows come home

198
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
They were radicalization.

199
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
Coming

200
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
The foot

201
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,111
So in the next Club this is

202
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
Buddy visit Mike down

203
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
In this clip

204
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,071
Alex says something pretty terrible

205
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Before he does he mentioned

206
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
Another one

207
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Children

208
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
Apparently I didn't look it up

209
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
System

210
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,439
Whether he did all this or not

211
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Gimme a Break

212
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
Give me a break

213
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
Where all this is going

214
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
Any photographs I shouldn't be laughing

215
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
Perform

216
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,991
And

217
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
I don't know what's going on

218
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,951
So I don't know what's going on fairly accurate

219
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:56,863
No but it shows that no no no no

220
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,447
Community kept saying take this pill is like

221
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,519
I don't see what's wrong with that

222
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,127
Run your even missing

223
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:12,223
The point in that what he says they're the fact that he understands

224
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,831
What the allegations and the reality of it is

225
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,791
Cool with it rape

226
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
Bright

227
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Spine

228
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,167
Tell Mom not to

229
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,751
The drug women just trying to take away their male vitality

230
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,823
Or something along those lines

231
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,271
Like not even like is like

232
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Listen

233
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,207
It's kind of primitive

234
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,559
This is his f****** insane

235
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,631
It is

236
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,703
It would be better if he just didn't I'd that

237
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
As opposed to being like

238
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
Yeah he totally did it but it's fine

239
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Look

240
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
OJ is allowed

241
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
The kill one wife

242
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:19,295
It's just from caveman days man of always

243
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
Female property with another man

244
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,863
From a timer case but as we all know it's fine to live like that nobody ever had

245
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,655
Had an issue is no reason

246
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,519
Progressive

247
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
It's not even

248
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
There's everything wrong with

249
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:50,015
Everyone understand let's move along

250
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
Shut you down or anything like that highlight

251
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,815
Did the problems of Alex get to the more fun stuff that's coming next

252
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,375
Alex

253
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
Trump

254
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Invitations

255
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
And

256
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
We add to the

257
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
But I'm working under that is

258
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
Mostly

259
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
It's Rodger Stone lying to him

260
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
And then

261
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
Interfering in our election

262
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
Business Holdings

263
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
Huge Hotel golf courses unit

264
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
Yeah

265
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
Just like Iran size

266
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,271
Hardcore

267
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,855
Rochester

268
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Diction

269
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
And Bush 41 Administration

270
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,375
Typically talking about

271
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,775
He's literally describing this person and not saying who it is after he's already given

272
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,847
Exact credits for Rodger Stone

273
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Great

274
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
Look I'm not going to say who my source

275
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
It is done

276
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
Also I'm pretty sure

277
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
Sure that Rodger Stone doesn't

278
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
Listen to Alex

279
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
On alok

280
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
He's not listening

281
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,231
Certainly

282
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Serious

283
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
Yesterday

284
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
This is the song

285
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
Hershel Greene

286
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
No he didn't

287
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
Greatest living journalist

288
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
He has to clarify that because

289
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
He's like

290
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
We didn't

291
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,703
View

292
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
Which even I have to point out is bunkers. Credible

293
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,503
This is a claim and no one's going to believe

294
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,319
It's okay to

295
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
The bolt

296
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,415
If you go you mean you can find it if you want to find it you can go listen

297
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
The entire interview with tigers

298
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:44,351
I am. He doesn't agree with Alex he's conflating interviews that he had with Steve

299
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,887
Pieczenik Non-Stop

300
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
Steve pieczenik also was Bill heck

301
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
It's true

302
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,855
Text Alex

303
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,695
I think you've got some bad information

304
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
This is the beginning of the

305
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,791
What I would describe as

306
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
On

307
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,911
Provable undisprovable stories about Trump

308
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
Elaborate strategy

309
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,543
Right.

310
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
He's been a patriot 430

311
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,895
Well this is last trumpet this is more the secret Patriots

312
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
That helped get Trump elected

313
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
And sort of work

314
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
But they were doing

315
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Not great

316
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Shed

317
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
No

318
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
You want to give weapons

319
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,303
And they deliver the weapons

320
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,519
Urban tropical

321
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Sabotage

322
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,487
Any further

323
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,791
It's not good

324
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
They're taking license

325
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,375
With their orders

326
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,447
If we imagine a scenario where in Alex

327
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
This correct

328
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,519
These people are giving weapons

329
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
The terrorist groups

330
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,127
But they're their way of lashing out is to break the weapons

331
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Before they get there

332
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:40,319
I think that the bad people within our military who are ordering these weapons be delivered

333
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:46,719
Are going to figure out that pattern pretty quick figure out who's breaking the weapons on the way it's not like

334
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:53,375
Communication

335
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,167
Nothing's broken and the generals

336
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:01,567
No they got us

337
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,319
Dairy Queen

338
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
Resistance

339
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,816
If you're on board an aircraft 777

340
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
Put on

341
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
Absolute

342
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,536
Uniform

343
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
So

344
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
Check your white privilege

345
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:04,800
Hope you get big head hope Habibi cuts off your head

346
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
As a

347
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:11,200
Freis okay to use that in my daily

348
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,272
Well I'm fine with that

349
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,320
As long as I get to say that

350
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
Because that is a fun center

351
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:24,256
You're on a plane back and then you're like chick flicks bro

352
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,840
Don't fight back against this terrorist

353
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
Listen

354
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
Listen

355
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
Honky

356
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
If you get your head cut off

357
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:40,384
Hey we're moving on up that's all I'm saying is a minority you got to let him

358
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,224
If it's a plane

359
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,016
No it's not mutiny

360
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
That's not harm you

361
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,112
Text Julie on boat

362
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:57,280
But it's also weather to Clear Lake chamber Brew

363
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,328
Then that's no longer mute

364
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,936
The guy who hijacked the plane

365
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
That's all.

366
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
Of Donald Trump insulting

367
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
All the other candidates

368
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
I'm the last

369
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,648
Person she wants to be running

370
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,976
Yeah that's true so he says that this is Alex's

371
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
Response

372
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
I love Donald Trump

373
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
I'm told

374
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,920
Real quick

375
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,016
Monetary distraction is Rodger Stone

376
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
I'm feeding him a line about why he

377
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,160
Or something like that

378
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:01,536
Yeah you know the Secret Service isn't letting anyone near him now you know sweetie I'm sorry Alex you have to wait

379
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
From Full Metal Jacket

380
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
After him

381
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:36,352
I'd like to oppose a alternative explanation for what Alex believes is

382
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Is the globalist

383
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
The major threat

384
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
Some people care about

385
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
People

386
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,568
A lot of people very early on

387
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
So how bad Trump would be

388
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
For their rights

389
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,112
For sure but not to globalist

390
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,160
To all of us

391
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,488
People surviving

392
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Alex

393
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
Also

394
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,352
A big threat because

395
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Donald Trump

396
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
Love's nuclear

397
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
Seems that way

398
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,776
Doesn't like that everybody

399
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,104
True

400
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
Everybody's love

401
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,968
30 presidential

402
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,040
Doesn't bode well for all of us

403
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,856
Let alone

404
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
Threatening

405
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,976
On Twitter he's even said recently liked

406
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:40,864
There's only one way to solve this problem all negotiations have failed so there's one way to solve it which suggests

407
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,144
He wants to do that

408
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,936
Posit

409
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
We've then

410
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
You know what I mean like

411
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,848
I'm not saying we should obviously

412
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,432
Stan I think he's I think it's still all blustery blossom

413
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,504
But I dye my fear is that it's not

414
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,808
She hasn't

415
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,112
Kind of means there's a reason he's not

416
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
Yeah

417
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
I think it's because

418
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
AT-AT

419
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
Sandpoint some jazz

420
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,000
General has brown

421
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:12,608
Wally's been like so who's carrying the nuclear football anybody over here and he's been beaten

422
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,704
Fake codes.

423
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
Take everything

424
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,032
Just put him in a small room

425
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
With a fake

426
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,824
Fake Twitter account

427
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,432
I will call on Twitter right now to build a fake

428
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:32,832
Twitter but only Donald Trump a Neo-Nazi

429
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:42,816
You got one job left before you go away

430
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,608
What's an outdoor

431
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,424
Then we have seen here on this stuff 31st

432
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
New Year's Eve

433
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,008
Day episode Alex Jones

434
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Onboard now

435
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
He loves us

436
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,152
You love him

437
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,968
Formal endorsement that we've been waiting to sign

438
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:05,600
Absolute and it's a little lackluster cuz we already kind of felt like this Eureka moment

439
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
Even if it was

440
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
Eclipse

441
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,952
5e appearance

442
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
Of Jane

443
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
David Mann

444
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
I first

445
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Discover James David Mann

446
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,376
Because

447
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,448
He really hated Barack Obama

448
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
In the lead-up to the 2008

449
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,568
That's all friend of mine found a video

450
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,152
That was a compilation of James David Manning screaming

451
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,968
And Reverend Wright Obama's preacher

452
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Screaming

453
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,552
Have a tooth have just a ridiculous s***

454
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:43,232
What the f*** is this his big quote

455
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,608
Barack Obama

456
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
Women out on the stroll

457
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
Okay

458
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,520
I started to look into him a little bit and I

459
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,080
He does not disappoint in any way

460
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,384
In terms of how insane he is

461
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,176
And how onion

462
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
Diaz

463
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,320
And from his own video podcast that he puts out called The Manning Report

464
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
We have so much

465
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Fun

466
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,768
To get into celestolite Alex let's let Alex introduced

467
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
James David Manning

468
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,752
Obama got in office

469
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Muslim

470
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,712
I just think you're going too far

471
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,600
Problems

472
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
That was years ago

473
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,816
The year before Obama got no

474
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,400
So this is Alex giving a lead-up to his his

475
00:28:54,656 --> 00:29:00,800
His appearance being like I thought he was wrong but

476
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:05,408
Barack Obama

477
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
Love that I love that

478
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,736
Idea that so many

479
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272
People throw out all the time

480
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,576
Create

481
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Right

482
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
You're just

483
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,208
He successfully made you look at it

484
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:24,608
Well but that's what this whole f****** country is

485
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,912
Narrative who did like sitting

486
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,264
They're like we're inciting racism

487
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,872
Yeah you know revealing how racist

488
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,408
As You Are

489
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,736
All throughout his

490
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,784
Terms of trying to I

491
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
You know

492
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
It's not even criminalizing

493
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,136
But like

494
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
Stigmatized

495
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
Denigrating black exist

496
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,352
It's sad how awful is it the vice president

497
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,400
Blue to Indianapolis

498
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,496
20 seconds of a f****** football game

499
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
And then

500
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:11,200
Angry about it was not a f****** publicity stunt

501
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
3 years

502
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:19,904
I told him to go

503
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
If not then

504
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
That's crazy

505
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,608
Is blind

506
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,472
Stroup no nope

507
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:39,872
No no we all have it because we have not yet delved into the Fun Fun World

508
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
Irreverent

509
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,224
So here is the proper introduction

510
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
I'm coming into the

511
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Infowars

512
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
Airways

513
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,256
Corsi's

514
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,328
Teaching

515
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Kids there

516
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,912
Going up again

517
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,712
Straightforward

518
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,512
81

519
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,376
Which is God name for Harlem

520
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,800
He created his own

521
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
School of course

522
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,408
AP gave him himself a doctor

523
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,688
So there's that

524
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
It's not even that look it up

525
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,816
We are in a fight

526
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,776
We are

527
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,176
Difficult

528
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,552
Because you've got both

529
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,600
Power booster

530
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,864
Not sure not sure that's the case

531
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,984
Maybe in his troubling if true maybe in his tiny insulated Church

532
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,008
Right of combat

533
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,872
Yeah maybe that's the case maybe he's been able to swing

534
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,664
But I don't believe the African-American

535
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
Community-at-large

536
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Thinking of trumpism

537
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:56,320
The man community-at-large

538
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:00,928
Been proven right along at all political spectrums for good long while

539
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,024
Especially

540
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:16,032
I regret that a little bit earlier signs that

541
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
Maybe you didn't take seriously

542
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,016
Reverend Manning

543
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,552
Explain

544
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,136
McDonald is the man

545
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
He is the man for America

546
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,120
The only

547
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,168
America

548
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,824
Can anybody else

549
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,944
And continued

550
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,320
Anderson Cooper

551
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
Spring Aldi

552
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,312
Egyptian spring

553
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,384
Join the Russians

554
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:36,160
Corydalis

555
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
Until we examine this

556
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,584
So someone needs to go to trial

557
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,472
Probably probably rather it be Barack Obama

558
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,032
Continue the policies of Obama I would prefer

559
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,848
Can you the policies of Woodrow f****** Wilson

560
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,920
Couple things I want you to hold onto

561
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,968
Two for a second

562
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
Cooper

563
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
Go back to that

564
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
And then also

565
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,344
The trial

566
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
These are two things

567
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,696
Do we have we have

568
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
Three more clips

569
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
A reverend Manning

570
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,048
From Alex Jones Show

571
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,120
And then we're going to get it to Reverend Manning

572
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
Oh yeah

573
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,192
And those two things are going

574
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
Very

575
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
For future clips

576
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:28,896
Put a pin in it myself although I really want to talk about it already

577
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
Reverend

578
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:34,272
Explains that he also believes the black lives matter is trying to cook up a race war

579
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,928
Is trying to see which is the most

580
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,512
Issue a race war

581
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,056
It's a beautiful statue

582
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,576
The sons of the Confederacy

583
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,904
We give you

584
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:18,304
10 Dalmatians

585
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Right

586
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,960
Crazy

587
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,264
Situation

588
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
Jeeps that's not

589
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,488
But yeah

590
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,304
They will shut you down

591
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,936
Like a cheap to wear a cheap suit

592
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,008
Not like you'll have a fever or something I think

593
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,544
Just mixing metaphors

594
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,432
I mean look at that look at that matter is being created

595
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,968
In order to try and and

596
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:14,368
They are there in the first place is a bit

597
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,160
Are there dormant

598
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,536
Big issue

599
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:27,424
Look we don't want black lives matter pointing out that we're being murdered by the

600
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
Confederacy

601
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
Because if they do

602
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,056
The sons of the Confederacy were going to murder black

603
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:39,456
Right if we keep it under the surface it'll just keep happening but if we talk about it

604
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,248
Terrible

605
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
Look

606
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,768
Don't antagonize racing

607
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,864
Don't antagonize these archaic violent races

608
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,448
So just be subservient

609
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:06,848
That's not good and I wish I was

610
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,920
Might be beautiful statues if they didn't have a contact

611
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,992
That they did

612
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,528
I don't know

613
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
They they are

614
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
I don't know if you

615
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,392
There was a

616
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Incredibles

617
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
Stalin

618
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
So

619
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
It was made perfect

620
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
Now yes

621
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,608
It does represent

622
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,632
Tens of Millions

623
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,984
I would like a statue of that bucket of poop

624
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,080
Terraria Mana delivery

625
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
The shortest

626
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
Sadist

627
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Bucket of poop

628
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:50,112
Adan y

629
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,648
Does Reverend Manning

630
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Support Donald Trump

631
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
It seems weird

632
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Seems very weird

633
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,704
Valley

634
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,992
Brother

635
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:26,464
And what they do is they support

636
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,536
Democratic Republican

637
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,328
Alicia

638
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
People

639
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,656
The reason why

640
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
Is

641
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
The people

642
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,176
80 songs

643
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,736
Various

644
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
Behave

645
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
Want to watch

646
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,912
This man sat in a meeting with

647
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,448
83 preacher

648
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Most

649
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
Except for me

650
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,848
We're telling him he needed to apologize

651
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
Roughing up the block

652
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,480
Alabama

653
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
I think it was

654
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
Dr. King

655
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,232
Patient

656
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,280
But risky

657
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,680
Nothing

658
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
Identify

659
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,712
Garbage

660
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,184
Any meeting ran over time he's

661
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
Steals

662
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,560
And listen to what they had to say in a dress

663
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
I said this with my man

664
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
Because he was

665
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,824
Wagner's

666
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
The Ike

667
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:36,768
Yuck he likes him because he went to a meeting and all these other black preachers that he doesn't like we're mad at him is like

668
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
Oh well

669
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:42,400
A billionaire lying about being a billionaire landlord

670
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,192
As we all know

671
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,216
Is a man

672
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
Connect

673
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,568
Right especially their billionaire landlords

674
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,360
Are always like

675
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,431
Hey let me listen to your concern

676
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:59,039
Especially a millionaire pretending to be billionaire landlord who's had the frequent

677
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
Renting to black people

678
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:05,183
Realtors whose father was a registered member of the

679
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,535
It's a lot of course you can

680
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,327
Sit there and listen for that long

681
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,375
Because in his mind all he's doing is

682
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
Is playing a loop

683
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
But his favorite song

684
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Trump is great

685
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,031
I am a lalalala

686
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,079
I'm sorry what was that

687
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
Say something that is accidentally

688
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
Alarming

689
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,111
America

690
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,719
What he can do to the America

691
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:46,655
Yeah

692
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,447
Do you not see how

693
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:52,287
You nailed it

694
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,591
Office

695
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,383

00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
Decorum

698
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,783
Bucking every convention

699
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:08,927
Everybody

700
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:14,815
He suggested that people shoot people people should murder Hillary Clinton

701
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,839
All of this

702
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,167
Care of her

703
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,959
How bad

704
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:27,359
EXO I think you speak

Hamp

709
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,415
It's like this behavior is so

710
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
Stupid

711
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,463
So silly

712
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,767
So ridiculous promise you

713
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,839
I promise you at the end of this everything is going to be alright

714
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,655
Okay everything is going to be alright

715
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,751
It's not the world still going to suck

716
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,823
This Arc is going to be really interesting that we're going to go on

717
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,663
Reverend Manic from his

718
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:08,063
Releases thumbs-up all the s*** they talk about all show

719
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,415
Another Noah setup necessary

720
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
This is f***** up

721
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,255
Broccoli

722
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,063
So she is sitting right behind him

723
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
Uyyala

724
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,159
He goes with it

725
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,735
Royal boy

726
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,527
Is so crazy

727
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,343
Terrific but it's

728
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,183
What is it's so crazy

729
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,511
Evergreen it be without

730
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:24,095
I would give her a left hook

731
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:29,215
That tears at the very least and over-reaction absolutely

732
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,335
Not by this he's sitting there like

733
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
It seems like

734
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:40,991
Don't give up James

735
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,783
If you if you were here

736
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
Witcher

737
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,831
Because you

738
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,231
Situations

739
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:58,143
I think I should releases this video because that's

740
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:04,543
Publix

741
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,847
Allegations

742
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,455
Kind of accusation

743
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,527
The closeted homosexual

744
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,855
Self-loathing

745
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,183
Those things will be borne out over the course

746
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,767
This next one is a little long

747
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
But it has

748
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,351
Play as this entire long clip

749
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
Cuz it's it's what

750
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,959
I think he thinks that this is a really intelligent

751
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,263
Deconstruction

752
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,567
Of why he is not a homophobe

753
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
I think he's

754
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Thanks everything

755
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,639
Is the most

756
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,687
Absolutely

757
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,247
Elementary logic

758
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,015
Problems with

759
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,367
I need to call

760
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,095
The same way

761
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,631
Which is

762
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,423
Walmart, Colton

763
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,447
Listen to the

764
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
Example

765
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,287
Let me ask a question

766
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,359
I think we're spies

767
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
You know

768
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:30,047
Do you sense where this is going

769
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:36,447
Stand where this is going

770
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:40,287

No

773
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,151
I think you know why

774
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:51,551
I think it to be very simple and Pacific

775
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,111
Let's Get Lucky beaver

776
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
Who are you

777
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,199
Jesters

778
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,927
Someone who you know

779
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
Actually

780
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,303
In Owasso

781
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,351
I said you know

782
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,215
Is that racist

783
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:44,543
Stereotypical

784
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,551
Perceptions

785
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,695
I don't want

786
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,535
You know

787
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
Sexual

788
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
Is that

789
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
Successful

790
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,575
Someone looks

791
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,695
Is that

792
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,719
Passage

793
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
He's got a number

794
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,447
People

795
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,127
Don Lemon

796
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:56,479
Remembers

797
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,719
He looks like

798
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:29,759
Bigotry

799
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,439
Free

800
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
A young boy

801
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,527
This guy is crazy

802
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,903
This guy is

803
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,231
Exactly right that's so f****** so

804
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:19,679
Missing piece tap of like why is it different a businessman in a homosexual

805
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:27,615
Erase part out of it

806
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:34,015
Missing the part of the argument be having

807
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,063
Represent is

808
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,855
What is it about these

809
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
Two nouns that are

810
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,439
I think if you were to

811
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:44,511
A little bit of become very clear very quick

812
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:49,375
A lot of things homosexual

813
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,983
Irib

814
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,823
If I see a man dressed

815
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,127
And I am going to describe his dress

816
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,199
Very specifically

817
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,015
He's a business

818
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,855
That bigoted

819
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,695
Also also if that businessmen were gay

820
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,279
And I punched him cuz he was gay

821
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
A little

822
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:24,447
Also on the fringes of the black community

823
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,983
Now is he a businessman

824
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,895
The unpacking that is like

825
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,687
Right or wrong about the business

826
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,479
Do you don't have any

827
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,295
Judgment that you're placing towards whether or not you

828
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
He's a businessman

829
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,111
Well with James David Manning

830
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,671
Whether or not someone is a homosexual

831
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,207
Is very important

832
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,047
In terms of his judgment

833
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,399
I was actually.

834
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,727
Also I didn't have time for you

835
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,287
I didn't have time to pull all these clips

836
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,383
Like cuz there's so much more you can find there's a clip where he admits

837
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,919
Like doing Deja.

838
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:14,367
Like Vegas just a crusade against that he was

839
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:21,023
He feels guilty about giving some dude a b****** want I think there's a big piece of that sounds about right

840
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,607
He's talked about struggling with Gay Thoughts

841
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,447
And stuff like that

842
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:34,591
Every single piece of it is this massive self-loathing whether it is for being black or four

843
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
He just lashes out at all these

844
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:37,919
Community season

845
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,991
That part's not funny but everything else is

846
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,271
F****** hilarious

847
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,831
So this next play

848
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,647
Next clip

849
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,207
He's responding to a Pisa viewer mail

850
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:56,863
If you realize it's pretty quick that the viewer is mocking him

851
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:01,215
And if you rolled with it admirably

852
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,519
Sort of renounces his blackness

853
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,383
We will be introducing our new product

854
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,407
Purple stuff

855
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,711
Community

856
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,991
And would like

857
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,271
To place your image

858
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:23,231
You're overheated attempt to gain National exposure by

859
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:28,095
Barack Obama

860
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:38,847
2 out

861
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:42,175
Around the election

862
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,367
It's okay makes a big deal out of the idea that

863
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,415
Not a problem

864
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,975
No

865
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,863
Okay

866
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,447
That's what that's in reference to about the idea that your campaign against

867
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,727
Barack Obama's parents

868
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,311
Fell on deaf ears

869
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
Oreo

870
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
S***

871
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:18,527
Person can choose their parents America still have the right

872
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,343
The true Veil favorite cookie

873
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,927
To whip

874
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,327
Disingenuous

875
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,703
Don't call me black

876
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,471
Call me

877
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,007
Stop

878
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,287
Kick it up one more notch

879
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,335
AAA

880
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:45,919
Gamma quadrant

881
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,735
And I do not think black on the end

882
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,271
That's right

883
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
I do not

884
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,575
I think I think

885
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,855
On the end

886
00:55:55,647 --> 00:56:00,511
Are you sure

887
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
Have you seen how the

888
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,583
Decrepit

889
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,935
Have you seen what you're doing

890
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,519
This is exactly

891
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,151
So is he not this color of the skin

892
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:32,511
But judge the man on the inside

893
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,079
Someone

894
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,639
Answer

895
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,663
Purple stuff

896
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,575
Make me a quadruple

897
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,111
.

898
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,695
Okay here's what

899
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,863
Don't think

900
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,887
Do we live

901
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,287
Inability to write

902
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,103
Being number one on the bottom of the world

903
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,479
Song

904
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,599
No no it's problematic

905
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,879
I think that maybe

906
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,463
He has no connection to music

907
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,767
Whatsoever he likes the Rhythm inherent

908
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:41,631
To a lot of the musical genres

909
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
I don't know

910
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:47,775
I don't know I can't unpack anything other than that song would that be

911
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,567
I am

912
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:53,663
You see him just

913
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,991
They came back the other night

914
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,527
Damn

915
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:00,831
Recant

916
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:07,487
It's wrong still but not wrong anymore

917
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,255
Oh man

918
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,607
Flippers not crying

919
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
Right

920
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:18,495
I don't know man

921
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:25,407
But it is I think

922
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,943
Not world

923
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,479
Are we fighting the Civil War

924
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:34,879
Civil War really dangerously close to Alex's rhetoric and I'm uncomfortable with that but

925
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,183
Nobody

926
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:39,999
In this next

927
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:45,375
We get we get them at that would be a way better if Alex

928
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:48,191
It's 1861 2.0 out of them like

929
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,215
Alright

930
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,751
You are correct

931
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,799
I don't like it anymore

932
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,079
70

933
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,359
But you did mail

934
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:01,759
Reverend

935
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,831
He's back behind the pulpit

936
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:09,695
He's giving it given his wife one more time

937
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,879
What

938
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,991
Naruto still on Plex

939
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:15,743
If you think a scandalous

940
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:19,839
You absolutely cannot understand why I how to pronounce his name

941
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,399
He's he's hitting the Quan

942
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,679
Exactly like alley

943
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:28,287
I think it might be giveaway you're into something wrong

944
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
Quite

945
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,383
Turn all that s***

946
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,663
To check his white

947
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:41,087
I mean going back to the club before the Martin Luther King said it's not the color

948
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:44,159
The cookie on the outside with the color of the cream

949
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,231
Bizarre

950
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:50,303
Such a remember to the opposite

951
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:54,399
That's the wrong lesson

952
01:00:55,167 --> 01:01:00,543
It doesn't matter if you're black on the outside so long as you remember

953
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
Junior specifically saying

954
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,615
Let's all be white

955
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,895
On the inside

956
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,175
Reverend Manning

957
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,967
Detox a lot of s***

958
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,783
He talks a lot of match

959
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,319
But he's also a man of action

960
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,391
Well that's worse

961
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,439

963
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,535
To a very funny story

964
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,495

Go to Harlow

975
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,591
For the trial

976
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,175

977
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,759

Mock trial

979
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,087
But he pretended was real

980
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:21,439
He was putting Obama on trial that he is ineligible to be president

981
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:27,839
But I have a right up here they might as well

982
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,399
Thousand people were going to show up

983
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:37,055
The actual attendance was somewhere in the neighborhood of 75 salon

984
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,591

Some pictures that you took documented

01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:44,735
It was supposed to be a seven-day March

He says the proceedings are not a mock trial and are permitted under the US Constitution

995
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:25,439
Make no mistake about it

996
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:29,279
Big Brother this is a mock trial

997
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,887

Countryside to quote

1002
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:55,135
The trial which will include a legal legal Scholars and retired Court officials will examine several issues including Obama's

1003
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,183
Birthplace is citizenship status

Reverend Manning has intestinal fortitude in the face of adversity

1009
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:13,823
He stands on ordering principle

1010
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,383
Having the courage to face the Obama machine

1011
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,199
This is one heck of a man of Courage with convictions

1012
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
Despair

1013
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,551
Obama's Marxist agenda and Obama himself cannot prevail

1014
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,623
Let the trial begin and may they find Obama guilty

1015
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:33,279

1016
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:39,679

01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:00,927
I thought WorldNetDaily was covering this trial but haven't seen any articles as of today

1025
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,487
So we got we get to some updates

Columbia University

1037
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,703
Fraud and mail fraud

1038
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:49,567
Columbia University knowingly concealed the fact that Obama is not a natural born citizen

1039
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,871
Columbia University 8th and obstruction

1040
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,639
Justice

01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,991
The president of the United States

1042
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,343
Sensitive material posing a danger to National Security

1043
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,623
Also of note

1044
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:08,511
The prosecution charges of treason and Espionage to avoid complications with a death sentence

1045
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:14,911
Wonderful even in the fake trial there like hold on I don't think we're going to get them on these couch

1046
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:21,567
I'm going to be too complicated

1047
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:26,943
People marched around Columbia University

1048
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:32,575
A couple people walked around Columbia University on day one

01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,367
Navigate to comes along

1050
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:40,511
D2 the Columbia trial started off with an alternate judge presiding over the case

1051
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:46,911
YouTube what is 1

1052
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:50,751
Loyal Church followers and she's also aspiring to run for governor of New York

1053
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:57,151
Judge hunger is reportedly returning for Sunday's hearings

1054
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,687
His name is Dave from Ida

1055
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:05,087
Are they should remain

1056
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:09,183
Keep an open mind not to make a decision or final determination as far as the verdict

1057
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:13,791
What is a horse and pony show

1058
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:20,191
The prosecutor is not going to be a partial

1059
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,495
Tributary bands

1060
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,031

A big bag of Oreos

1063
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:36,831
George Washington never had the powers that Barack Hussein Obama has

1064
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:41,951
Mannington mentioned that Obama has an ability to manipulate the media and people unlike any other politician

1065
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:44,511
Today this is given Obama even more power

1066
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,071
Manning's them suspiciously state

1067
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,375
But he would not be surprised if Obama Center

1068
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:54,495
Undermine his trial

1069
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,103
Easy dessert

1070
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,639
I don't know

Malia

Zehnder's

1073
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,479
Do some

1074
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,807
Not credible

1075
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,367
Don Lemon wearing a blond wig

1076
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,183
Non credible

1077
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,463
Judged at Jury

1078
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,511
Witnesses

1079
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:23,935
Can the Judge also be the witness that's Jim Johnson

1080
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:28,543
You are the judge but I also call you to the stand

1081
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,823
Okay

1082
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,687
Vet

1083
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,015
Obama's fingers stamp

1084
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,551
With a two digit

1085
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:42,111
Year and no one would ever do that

1086
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:45,951
So he got his mailman to go on record it set

1087
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,719
Well that's

1088
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,255
Concrete case

1089
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:51,583
Testify

1090
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:57,727
Investigators later determined that Obama reportedly had over 30 different Social Security numbers

1091
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,287
They came up in the computer what his name was entered

1092
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:03,103
Bentley then alleged that the number Obama is

1093
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,127
Currently using is

1094
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,943
I was born in 1890 in Connecticut

1095
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,759
He then noted that Obama never lived in Connecticut

1096
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:19,231
So they also have to bring proof he never lived in Connecticut

1097
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:25,631
Otherwise they could not definitively prove a 120 years old

1098
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:29,215
Real vampire

1099
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:35,615
Because he's lived for thousands of years we also mentioned that if you ran Obama's social security number

1100
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:38,431
The results came up as Barack Obama

1101
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,199
Did not belong

1102
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,223
Not sure

1103
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:46,623
That doesn't make sense yours where the postal worker gets involved

1104
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:50,719
Jeff Smith to take the stand

1105
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:55,071
Ask him about the controversy over the two digit and four digit years

1106
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:58,399
Smith testified that the post office always

1107
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:02,239
He was unsure how Obama

1108
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,263
Tube service card at home

1109
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,543
Show me a two digit year

1110
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:10,175
There's a bunch of nonsense

1111
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,455
If you lived in Harlem

1112
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,247
And you all the sudden

1113
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:16,319
Discovered that your mail was being delivered by a black white

1114
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,367
To promise

1115
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,255
It's interesting to me that the coverage of the case

1116
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,535
Just stopped

1117
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,863
After day 2

1118
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:31,935
Stopped after day to they may not have made it today

1119
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,215
Entirely possible

1120
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:37,055
Court was not

1121
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,103
It was nonsense

1122
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,919
Picture of

1123
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:46,527
The original judge was supposed to be there I don't think was a judge

1124
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,903
You know how like if

1125
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,927
If you run the show

1126
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:55,487
When someone cancels last minute

1127
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:58,815
Yeah it's trying to get it taken care of find replacement I imagine

1128
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,607
F****** Reverend Manning just sitting there like

1129
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:05,983
You knew fake judge all the Elders of his dirty ass

1130
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:11,615
You got to come play a judge

1131
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,151
That's where they

1132
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,735
This is one of my favorite things

1133
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:20,319
That James David Manning his alleged over the year

1134
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:23,135
At this one actually went a little bit viral

1135
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:27,999
So some people may know about this one this is great

1136
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,839
Inform you the song

1137
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,935
Liberty protest

01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,471
Sunday

1139
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,239
Shocking

1140
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,799
Several members of the

1141
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,079
Pennsylvania

1142
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,639
You know the fellow that was with us

01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,111
Someone

1146
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,951
Church

1147
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,639
It is

1148
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:23,295
Straight

1149
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:27,391
The Inquisitor

1150
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:30,975
News

1151
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,047
Paper

1152
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,375
Because we had stated

1153
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,423
Ground Zero

1154
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:44,543
Homosexual saltemike person such as

1155
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,383
Who lives

1156
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,919
Who is a sodomite

1157
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,071
No

1158
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:12,703
Nope

1159
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:22,687
Mail

1160
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,735
And they were

1161
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,831
There are

1162
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,719
.

1163
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,047
You think that use milk that ship expensive

1164
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:42,655
His argument breaks

1165
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:49,055
His argument breaks down to basically the gays like to eat semen and I have a great time XO

1166
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:54,687
Because they want people to have more of a fun time

1167
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:57,247
I'm so they stealthily put it into Starbucks

1168
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,271
Lattes

1169
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:04,671
But because of the cement and because people f*** in the bathroom

1170
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,487
Yeah but

1171
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,791
I think

1172
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,559
Okay

1173
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,727
Also easier than that

1174
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,007
You can

1175
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,311
Can sexually transmitted

1176
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:25,407
Airborne

1177
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:32,063
He's not a doctor

1178
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,415
Demonology degree from Heaven actually have

1179
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
This is just

1180
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,231
This is classic

1181
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,767
James David Manning ship

1182
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:43,071
This is my kind of stuff

1183
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,887
Going out

1184
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,959
It is putting in the pike roast

1185
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:52,031
And you know that you always do fibroids

1186
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:57,663
Call Gerald

1187
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,455
And the sodomites

1188
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,247
You know it's true

1189
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:04,575
Cuz I would drink

1190
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:09,695
India

1191
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,839
Information

1192
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:19,423
F****** sources

1193
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,263
He's at he's letting it loose

1194
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:28,127
This is great really like drunken hi Alex

1195
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,919
More life

1196
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,783
So

1197
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,367
I think if we break it down

1198
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
I think

1199
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,183
Reverend Manning

1200
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,207
Field left

1201
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:44,767
I think there's a big piece of it that like

1202
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,303
Aldi's sodomites

1203
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,583
Unlike targeting

1204
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,351
Starbucks

1205
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,911
I don't get to have fun

1206
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:54,239
I don't get to enjoy whatever one else if

1207
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,775
And he's bummed out about it

1208
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,871
I met on top of that repressing homosexual

1209
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
Stand that

1210
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,663
He's the reason

1211
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,431
Yeah

1212
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,503
Yes he thinks that everybody else's the barrier

1213
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,295
All the while

1214
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,319
It was him

1215
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,855
Or perhaps his wife

1216
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:13,183
Yeah they all that cream

1217
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:22,399
When I say that I believe he's a repressed homosexual I say that based on having listened to

1218
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,679
2 tons of clips of him

1219
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,703
Where is like

1220
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,519
Really talking about homosexuality

1221
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,543
I'm kind of

1222
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:34,943
Like the way you speaks about his hair is a like a sensual lysing of stuff

1223
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,783
It doesn't need to be sensual

1224
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,367
In that text

1225
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
Jeans

1226
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:43,903
And that

1227
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:50,559
Any talks about how they're going to get you and stuff like that

1228
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,583
Come on man

1229
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:54,655
It's very clear he thinks homosexuality is zombies

1230
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,679
More or less

1231
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,543
In 2015

1232
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,823
December 2015

1233
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:06,175
He comes on Alex Jones a show I think we've laid out pretty clearly he's alert

1234
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,479
I'm like

1235
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,247
Three other disease

1236
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:14,111
Is Ebola

1237
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:19,487
You're like a present because I mean if you're going to be a homophobic monster

1238
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,279
Hugo with HIV

1239
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:26,143
Caribou Coffee is Ground Zero for the whooping cough

1240
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:36,127
Go to be a high-class disease like consumption

1241
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:38,431
Nevermind

1242
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,527
So like I said

1243
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,855
It's freakin hysterical people

1244
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:52,255
Okay so he's on in December 2015 Alex has made his full jump

1245
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,279
Turn on team Trump

1246
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,375
I've made it a mission to try and get Trump in the office

1247
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,423
Right here's what's interesting

1248
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,751
Track of James David Manning

1249
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,799
You just blend into the background since

1250
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,871
The time that he said that that's out of my for putting semen in lattes

1251
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,199
I went to his YouTube page

1252
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,783
I found a video that he released just the other day

1253
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,575
That is a little bit interesting

1254
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,343
Okay

1255
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,135
I think

1256
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,927
Does he regret perhaps

1257
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,719
Trump getting elected

1258
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:25,279
I don't know but this clip is actually about Alex Jones

1259
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,303
Ocean

1260
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,615
I don't want to go on Alex broadcast

1261
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,199
Strongly disagree with

1262
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:44,991
And then

1263
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
The state of

1264
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,671
Actually

1265
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,583
But

1266
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,399
So he doesn't

1267
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:09,055
Call Tim tribulation Trump he believed the times

1268
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,103
Which begs the question

1269
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:15,199
Did he support him originally secretly in order to bring it

1270
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,503
What does

1271
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,039
As a man of the cloth

1272
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,319
So to speak

1273
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:23,135
Maybe a little bit too close

1274
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:23,903
To the end times

1275
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,439
It's possible

1276
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:31,071
What do you mean a broken Oreos today

1277
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,631
Quadruple

1278
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:37,215
So I want I want to just pull up real quick

1279
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:40,031
His his YouTube page

1280
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:42,335
Give you a little bit of a rundown

1281
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,639
Some of his recent

1282
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,407
Videos

1283
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,455
Because the titles of them

1284
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,503
Include stuff such as

1285
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,575
Donald Trump

1286
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,439
Turn

1287
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:00,511
And I don't know exactly what made him turn

1288
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:03,839
I don't care to go do an investigation

1289
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,423
Videos

1290
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,751
I'm so glad I'm coming out as gay

1291
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:18,944
The two days ago it's collusion everybody

1292
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,760
About how Russian collusion is real

1293
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,296
Hairstyle Trump

1294
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,088
Black white

1295
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:25,856
Just hate him

1296
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,648
There's no hope for people

1297
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:33,280
Get your little hands off Twitter you nasty little critter and his picture of trump with tiny hands

1298
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:36,096
Classic white trash a picture of

1299
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,400
Picture of trump supporters

1300
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:41,216
Goodwin

1301
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,240
Here

1302
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,800
Is the voice of racist in America

1303
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,360
I'm a victim of police brutality

1304
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:48,896
Contacts

1305
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:52,736
He also used to be a really big advocate of being against

1306
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,760
Socialism

1307
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:59,392
Socialized medicine talks about how

1308
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:03,488
He has a video from a week ago Healthcare is a right

1309
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,792
It's a picture of Bernie Sanders

1310
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,584
Something's bucking happen

1311
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,376
I mean I think

1312
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,496
Maybe

1313
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,800
Maybe he found out how awful we actually

1314
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,360
Trump calls athletes SOB's

1315
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:21,408
Will trump pardon Paul manafort

1316
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,456
There may be Russian death threats

1317
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:25,760
On it now

1318
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,528
Like is he

1319
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,856
To have a come-to-jesus

1320
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,136
I don't f****** know

1321
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,184
Tribulation Trump is creepy

1322
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:38,560
Will Mike that one's a little bit

1323
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,584
Lake Hughes

1324
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,608
He's on

1325
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,656
Bucked up

1326
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:49,056
It's so f***** up I like Sanders insurance plan

1327
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:58,016
Michael Flynn never expected to be in government

1328
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:00,832
Reasons why I'm kicking Trump's rump

1329
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,624
Well I don't like

1330
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
This is

1331
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,440
He's really bad it right

1332
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,048
What happened

1333
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:15,936
Lake at the end of this episode You couldn't possibly have imagined that the end result would be in 2017

1334
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:19,264
He's going against Trump he's going after him

1335
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,312
I guess he did

1336
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,616
Know what white supremacy

1337
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:26,432
Really was possibly or maybe got a payout

1338
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,456
Or something like that

1339
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,760
Fluoroscopy

1340
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:32,064
Okay I got I bet that's what Alex would say

1341
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:32,832
Yeah

1342
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:36,672
I don't know but I'm going to play for Alex

1343
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,720
Really wanted a black

1344
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:41,280
Brandon Tatum

1345
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:45,632
He's got that guy who put out a video about how the NFL players need to shut up

1346
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,680
Gravity is the new

1347
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:50,240
He's gone white male guide

1348
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:53,056
I'm not comfortable with that

1349
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:01,504
This is from 2017

1350
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,296
There is

1351
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:05,088
Further and

1352
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,136
Destruction on the way

1353
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,928
According to God's word

1354
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,208
Tribulation

1355
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,256
And the

1356
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,536
Donald Trump

1357
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,304
And the office

1358
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:18,400
America

1359
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
Yikes

1360
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:23,776
So actually it's not reasonable

1361
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,336
And what he's doing is that you realized

1362
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,384
Is Brandon works a lot better if he

1363
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:33,248
Always been

1364
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,040
The guy that you can go to

1365
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,624
To get your daily dose of being attacking

1366
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,464
President

1367
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:48,608
He was significantly smarter than Alex Jones in that regard

1368
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,144
I hate Obama cuz he's

1369
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,448
Is the president so I'm going to support the guy who hates

1370
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,728
The most

1371
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:56,288
Becomes president

1372
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:57,824
Supporting

1373
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,592
Trump

1374
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:03,200
He's like well I hate the guy who's president now so I love the guy who hates Trump the most

1375
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:03,968
Bernie

1376
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,992
Right

1377
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,320
And propaganda

1378
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,600
Like these guys

1379
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,904
Legitimately only work as under

1380
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:18,048
Right they can't be in power or else they realize that they become an apparatus of the state

1381
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,328
Alex

1382
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,888
What's the difference

1383
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:25,216
Pass that they've gone down is Reverend

1384
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,752
Element of the game

1385
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,544
F*** I've got to turn on Trump

1386
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,336
Or else this game doesn't work

1387
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:33,664
And whatever amount of money he's making is enough to run a church in

1388
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,200
Can Harlem look at the big building

1389
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:37,760
Yeah so he's making enough for that which is

1390
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,552
Which is something all so he doesn't pay it

1391
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,624
Second

1392
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
Well I mean

1393
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,464
He doesn't have to

1394
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:52,352
About it

1395
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,400
Governor

1396
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:04,896
The false narrative

1397
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:09,504
Someone in power

1398
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:13,856
So now the tax thing I want to leave everyone with it

1399
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:16,672
Is an article from Cocker or not

1400
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,976
Splinter

1401
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:22,816
Splinter news has the same layout

1402
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,840
Is Gawker that's what I thought

1403
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,400
Yeah well it's the actual website

1404
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,424
Is gone but

1405
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,448
Jezebel

1406
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,008
Spending all those webs right

1407
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,616
Okay so it's it's one of the family is essentially

1408
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:39,456
After a year of a couple of years of Gawker being gone there like

1409
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,992
That's fine but

1410
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,808
Right right

1411
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,024
Article from February 20th

1412
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,864
16 this homophobic preachers worst nightmare is about to come true

1413
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,656
As about Reverend Manning

1414
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:01,728
On the coldest Valentine's Day weekend in Harlem

1415
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,496
19 C

1416
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,544
Pastor James David Manning has

1417
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,080
The fires of Hell on his mind

1418
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,616
In less than two weeks

1419
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,408
The church was due to be foreclosed upon

1420
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,432
Quote

1421
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:16,576
This is a sodomite government landgraab he told his congregants advertising the church

1422
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:22,208
The Force 4 story brick and terracotta building on the corner of West 123rd Street and Lenox

1423
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:22,976
6th Avenue

1424
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,280
Reed's Jesus would endorse Donald Trump

1425
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,608
As the chief pastor of Outlaw world

1426
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,632
Wide Ministries

1427
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,912
1981 Vanagon

1428
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,216
Is Infamous for preaching homophobia and vulgar

1429
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,240
Conspiracy theories

1430
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:36,544
Not just from his pulpit in Harlem

1431
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,312
Live stream

1432
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,360
Twice each Saturday on YouTube

1433
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:42,432
But also his daily internet program to The Manning Report

1434
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,992
Before the recent foreclosure controversy

1435
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,016
Church

1436
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:51,136
Was probably best known for hosting a mock trial of Barack Obama in which the president was considered

1437
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:57,536
Convicted in absentia on 17 counts including treason fraud and sedition

1438
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:05,984
It's possible that this reporting is a little off cuz I went to the appeals court

1439
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,264
Throw those out

1440
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,336
Today's sermon have begun begun benignly enough

1441
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:13,664
We thank God for making it back from the ski trip safe and sound

1442
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,456
He said to about 70 worshippers

1443
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,992
Nearly all of them black women

1444
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,528
Many of them with young children

1445
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,576
His own wife was seated behind him at the altar

1446
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,904
Soon though Manning had to address the elephant in the room

1447
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,720
Last month a state judge order the building at

1448
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:30,816
It's a foreclosure 102 million dollars in unpaid tax

1449
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:33,376
An auction is scheduled to take place on

1450
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,656
On February 24th

1451
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,448
Venomous stroke of divine irony

1452
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,008
To lgbtq service organizations

1453
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:41,824
Launch fundraising campaigns to buy the property

1454
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:44,128
The Day of Reckoning was getting closer

1455
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:47,968
Manning says he believed the court order is invalid on legal grounds

1456
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,784
Cuz he has a law degree from School Of course

1457
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,624
He says it has to do with water and sewage taxes that should fall under religious

1458
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,392
Exemption rules

1459
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:59,488
But according to public records obtained by the website

1460
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:01,024
There are there

1461
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,608
Least nine federal tax liens against the church

1462
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,888
Among other dads

1463
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,168
Despite 186

1464
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,448
$6,000 in tax

1465
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,496
Benefits already granted

1466
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:15,104
Manning said he believes the case to be political retribution for his attacks on all Bob

1467
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:15,872
Huiclaims

1468
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:18,432
We believe is a Taliban

1469
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,712
Who killed his own grandmother

1470
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:24,064
Shut me up sees my ability to amass power and influence

1471
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,088
He said in his sermon

1472
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,112
But he pledged

1473
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:29,440
To fight I will continue to pursue Obama until he's in prison

1474
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:32,000
I believe God has given me the power to do that

1475
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:39,168
Then Manning apologized to the congregation before he said in describing President Obama's late mother

1476
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:40,448
Stanley Ann Dunham

1477
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:46,592
Not only was she a s*** but she but she was a pair of dirty underwear

1478
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
He said

1479
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,408
There were murmurs of all men from

1480
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:54,784
The pews in the third row a toddler in a three-piece suit played with the rings on his grandmother's fingers

1481
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,832
Richie at I held behind her back cuz she

1482
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,112
She solemnly about her head

1483
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,392
Alright journalist

1484
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,416
Set a little bit of a flourish

1485
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:06,048
Continuing to read this article

1486
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,120
We'll get you something that I

1487
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:09,888
School

1488
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,192
This is 26

1489
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,728
August 26th

1490
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:16,544
Virgo

1491
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,336
I think it might have been

1492
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:21,152
I'm not entirely sure I should look like

1493
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,688
You know what I should have looked at up

1494
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,480
And I will in a second

1495
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,760
But

1496
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,808
The reason that I want to get through this

1497
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:28,576
Or get down

1498
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,344
Intuit

1499
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,696
Tacular

1500
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,232
Piece of that

1501
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,024
Fun

1502
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:38,560
One of the groups

1503
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,608
That's what I was trying to buy

1504
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,144
The other property

1505
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:48,544
Is the Ali Forney Center which is lgbtq

1506
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,872
Organization

1507
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:58,272
That we have donated to in the past and we encourage people to donate to absolutely Ali Forney Center

1508
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,064
Lgbtq youth has raised at least

1509
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,880
Thousand dollars towards the purchase of Outlaw Church

1510
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,440
Rivers of Living Water in lgbtq

1511
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:07,744
Spiritual group nearby in Harlem is raised

1512
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,512
Significant

1513
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,840

New York found that about half were black

1523
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:30,272
The most common reason they gave her being homeless is

1524
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:32,064
Rejection by their families Williams

1525
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:36,160
They're more likely to drop out of school due to harassment and bullying

1526
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,976
Facing poverty and unemployment challenges many of them turned

Sex work

1528
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,536
They're victims of disproportion

Violence to

1530
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:45,376

Before he was murdered Forney would sometimes sleep on the hill in Marcus Garvey Park

1537
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,712
At the end of Outlaw block

1538
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,760
He was known for agitating

1539
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,576
I've known for agitating for police investigation

1540
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,600

Still 200 homeless gay and transgender youth are on the waiting list for a bed every night

1543
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,048

1544

7280 young people every month due to lack of

Capacity

1549
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,056
Taking over the outlet Church would allow Ali Forney Center to

1550
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:27,104
To put a roof over morehead's every night

1551
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,896

1556
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,344

1558
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,648
I am. That's her.

1559
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:43,488
It would be awesome if Christian

1560
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,768
In the f******

1561
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:48,864
I'm looking this up okay so

1562
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,400
Here lucky

1563
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,192
Here's what it says on Wikipedia

1564
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,240
In January

1565
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:57,568
Tina State order the outlaw worldwide Church would be sold to public

1566
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,336
Foreclosure auction

1567
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:01,664
After failing to pay creditors more than 1.02 million dollars

1568
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:04,992
I'm sad for the New York

1569
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,528
Recording a lot not liable for

1570
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,320
Define citing the Court's ruling of

1571
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,344
December 2000

1572
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,112
4

1573
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,440
Purposes

1574
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,208
Lgbtq

1575
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:15,232
To youth homeless services

1576
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,304
They're all this

1577
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,608
A temporary stay on the sale was granted

1578
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,424
21st of April 26th

1579
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,752
In September the Judgment of foreclosure was

1580
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,544
So they still on the prowl

1581
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,568
Goddamn

1582
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,336
Yeah that sucks

1583
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:32,128
God dammit

1584
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:37,760
That could have gone to helping right

1585
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:42,112
Jordan news for everybody but the good news is

1586
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,392
I mentioned

1587
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,440
Outside

1588
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,256
Someone sodomized

1589
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,840
Sup

1590
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:56,704
There's always that but I wanted to ask

1591
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,776
This episode was about this horrible

1592
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:00,544
Massage

1593
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,080
Self-loathing

1594
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,896
Homosexual probably

1595
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:09,760
With you know just a reminder that there are great organizations out there

1596
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:14,368
Amber Alert tons of them aren't necessarily the ones that we

1597
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,928
Support

1598
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,696
Absolute

1599
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:23,584
And stuff like that really is a reminder of the realities of intersection

1600
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,680
The world that we talked about this crazy bigot propaganda

1601
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,960
Conspiracy theorist world

1602
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,008
And people who were really trying to help

1603
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:34,592
People who are not being able to help because of these

1604
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:38,432
That is a reminder

1605
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:43,040
It sucks that we have to live in the world we live in but we do

1606
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,064
Anyway

1607
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,856
Redwood

1608
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,392
I don't either

1609
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,232
Everyday I eat

1610
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:53,536
We should be

1611
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:55,328
Burning ship

1612
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:59,168
Like the we're at the stage now towards

1613
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:01,216
Insane it's all crazy

1614
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:03,776
We're all just we're all this place where we're at

1615
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,056
Kind of like children

1616
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,336
Again

1617
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:10,176
Just like we were in the in the run-up to the election if it's like

1618
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:15,040
Will sooner or later later there's going to be somebody who's

1619
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:15,808
Reasonable

1620
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,088
Who is going to get in the way

1621
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,112
And there's no

1622
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,136
There's nobody,

1623
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,928
Yeah

1624
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:21,952
There's no reinforcements

1625
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,744
Go back.

1626
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,024
And there's no it

1627
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:31,424
Like we're trying to say is be the change you wish to see in the world

1628
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,752
It's just a lot more fire

1629
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:38,592
Sincerely considering starting August

1630
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,152
For what

1631
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:46,272
Is a generalized General hungry like that

1632
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,856
I had somebody

1633
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:50,880
Text me earlier

1634
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,416
Well

1635
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:54,720
If you want to make a change you need to

1636
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,816
And I'm just sitting there going like

1637
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,608
Until we get rid of the oligarchs

1638
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,888
That does not match

1639
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:12,128
It's not doing it like this

1640
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,688
The people that we f****** voted for

1641
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:17,760
Enduring a cross-check in those sorts

1642
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:18,784
Disenfranchised

1643
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,576
Champagne

1644
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,368
Buy these

1645
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:28,000
Oligarchs are lesser of two evils

1646
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:30,304
But also

1647
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,608
The amount of people that you could probably influence

1648
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:34,144
Is

1649
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,424
Not as much

1650
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,728
As will be invalidated by those

1651
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:39,264
Exact that Venus area

1652
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:44,640
People have put into place yes you should encourage

1653
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:45,664
To fix everything

1654
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:48,992
It is a toppling of all this b*******

1655
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:49,760
It has to

1656
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:52,320
To go it's system

1657
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:54,624
Broke

1658
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,256
B from scratch

1659
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:02,816
Write a couple of them Amendment

1660
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:08,448
That we have in their constitution terms of freedoms like that

1661
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,216
Especially

1662
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:09,984
Yeah

1663
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:10,752
And that's

1664
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:16,640
Special

1665
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,920
Hehehe

1666
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,944
Is is

1667
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,528
There is a war coming

1668
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,808
And it's not going to be us

1669
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:24,832
Does Russia

1670
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,112
It's going to be red versus

1671
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:26,880
Blue

1672
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:27,904
And right now

1673
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,952
All the guns are available

1674
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,232
Haha

1675
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,792
I'm just saying while they're available

1676
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,584
Maybe get a gun

1677
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,120
Because there have

1678
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,168
But a lot of them

1679
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,240
But I mean even Alex Jones is talking about

1680
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,800
You seen upswings of liberals with guns with

1681
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:45,568
The shooting range

1682
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,104
How much of that is just a

1683
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,176
Fear and paranoia is unclear but I do think you're seeing

1684
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:56,832
I mean some liberals arming themselves

1685
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:58,624
Kind of that kind of situation

1686
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,416
Yeah

1687
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:06,560
I get I get where you're coming from and I

1688
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:09,376
Tivity of discussing medicine

1689
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:12,192
Feeling these sorts of things but at the same time I don't want us to

1690
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,216
Descendant 2

1691
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:21,152
That's not where the show

1692
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:21,920
Works

1693
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:24,736
Because then we're doing the same thing on the flip side of the

1694
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:31,136
The thing we're fighting against her though

1695
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:31,904
That's what that's

1696
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:36,256
Rational I mean more like

1697
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,280
It is

1698
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,048
It is something

1699
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,584
Where are

1700
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:42,656
Genuine like at this point

1701
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:47,008

1702
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:47,776
Beer

1703
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,824

01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:15,424
Whoever left that

01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,448
Bucket of s***

1714
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:23,872
I hope so because you advocated for shooting multiple

1715
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:29,760
Totally possible we got someone to

01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:33,088
If you are a policy wonk that left a bucket of s***

1717
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:37,184
On his doorstep we won't get it

A lot of those problems

1747
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,360
This is steadfast

1748
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,384
Refusal to read any

1749
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,968
Refusal to check into

1751
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,528

Jon rappoport to f*** himself but

1788
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,912
I think in this instance

1789
01:41:59,424 --> 01:41:59,936
Reverend Manning

1790
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:01,216
Really takes priority

1791
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:04,800
This guy I've been waiting forever

01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:11,200

1798
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:28,608
Is it he has the anarch to him

1799
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,912
What is fascinated

1800
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:37,312
Respected scholar in the world like a very interesting area of study that he sexualization of Asian box

1801
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:41,664

Guitar and they wouldn't let me

1805
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:54,208
Napolitano is involved with

1806
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:58,816
Weird raisin electronic pulses that are going through

1807
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:04,704
So he's never I don't think he's ever going to be bumped out of the number one spot but number two

1808
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,008
Very close behind him is this Reverend Manning

1809
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:08,800
And we might revisit him again

1810
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:09,824
Cuz he is

1811
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,848

Unfortunate massari

01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:29,280
The untethered soul that she's a thematic

1817
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:32,864

01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:39,008
Reverend Manning although I think a lot of things

1820
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:41,056
Incredibly funny for the wrong reasons

1821
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:43,616
You need to go fuc yourself you dumb
