1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,560
Holding

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:08,192
Alex

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:14,592
Everybody

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:19,456
Jordan

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,296
Watch was the Obama

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,512
Documentary series on Netflix

7
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,912
Whatever the guy who showed up at a bank with like a bomb around his neck

8
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:46,592
Was crazy Irish

9
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
Connection with

10
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,320
So crazy

11
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,280
Fell down the stairs

12
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
That's coming from me

13
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,544
Long time

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,152
Episode

15
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:25,760
Call Joan about Alex

16
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
What we're here to do today

17
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,368
In the spirit of

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648
You know

19
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
Our donors

20
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,720
People who make the show possible

21
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,256
We have been tasked

22
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
With breaking down

23
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
The entirety of

24
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,376
Alex

25
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,288
Spiritual end of a season

26
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,408
Probably

27
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,504
6 months ago

28
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,576
I don't think there was anything groundbreaking it happened right before

29
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
Before we did

30
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
But like

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,952
I feel like we're entering a new era of covering Alex Jones

32
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
That clip from the leaderless resistance

33
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
Different ballpark

34
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,496
Pretty convinced he's been interested in white supremacist groups

35
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,080
For me

36
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,432
Especially the context in which I look at

37
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
This season

38
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
With

39
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Exhaust

40
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Steve breakdown

41
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
People who are

42
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,176
Deception

43
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,248
Title

44
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,696
I don't know I watched it when I was younger

45
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
And

46
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,800
Is that the conclusion of all of your research today is

47
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,896
When I was younger

48
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
Really long things on YouTube

49
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
Habit of mine

50
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
Just one of the many

51
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
Really stupid

52
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Long can

53
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
Conspiracy videos that I watched

54
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
Discarded out of

55
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,816
Realized

56
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
Think about it

57
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
I'm through it I realized

58
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,424
Documentary

59
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,496
Is the stupidest thing

60
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
It's so much worse than

61
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
Okay

62
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
Nightmare 49 hours

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
Bridge

64
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,416
FEMA camps than a lot of that stuff

65
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
Maybe about the same on this

66
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Complain up top or anything like that

67
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
But the experience of going over there

68
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
And watching

69
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
Documentary

70
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
With a critical eye

71
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
Was brutal

72
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:37,247
Duct or something like that

73
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,343
Yeah

74
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,415
The show up with a six pack

75
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,423
In the morning or whatever

76
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
Quick

77
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,103
Shuffle the first

78
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:12,831
We are going to pause probably 20 times in the first minute

79
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:20,255
Alright are you ready to get going

80
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,887
How much

81
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
Receipt

82
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Start at the beginning

83
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Because even though

84
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
Even though we're making

85
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
Phone of Alexandra

86
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
There's still a corrosive toxic

87
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
The effects of listening to

88
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,015
2 tons of Alex Jones

89
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
So

90
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,647
Eroded

91
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,559
Someone who hopes for our show 216

92
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,911
We want to grow and we want to be

93
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Best possible place but

94
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
It is

95
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,519
You should not

96
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
Listen to the show too much.

97
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
Lutein

98
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Don't even bother

99
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:48,319
If this is

100
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
Tell everybody they were

101
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,655
The shot of the

102
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
National Mall

103
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
People happy

104
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
I was not born in a manger

105
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:28,255
Drake

106
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,447
I already got to stop because of some sort of like

107
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
Memes of being like

108
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:43,359
He's full of himself

109
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,687
He fails to recognize or point out any way that this is eclipse

110
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,039
It was taken from Obama's appearance at the alberty Smith Memorial Foundation dinner

111
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,367
That dinner is a traditional

112
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Both parties

113
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
Poke fun at each other

114
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Damn themselves

115
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
50 forever

116
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
Exceptional

117
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
Humorous

118
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,519
The big-ticket fundraiser and Catholic charity

119
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,847
And others and their discomfort with supporters of abortion

120
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
The foundation non-political

121
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
On the video

122
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,831
I feel right at home here because

123
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,439
It's been said that I share the politics of Alfred East the ears of Alfred E Neuman

124
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Kills

125
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:44,031
Aerosmith I never knew your great-grandfather but from everything is told me the two of them had a great time together before

126
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,887
Here's another one

127
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
Maybe a little bit controversial nowadays

128
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:20,127
I have never put lipstick on a pig

129
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Or dog

130
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
For myself

131
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
That's one for Rudy Giuliani

132
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:30,111
The cross-dressing mayor of New York have a hard time winning the Republican nomination

133
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
And he looks over

134
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,231
Ethereal

135
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,591
Fox News African American

136
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
Obama speech

137
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
Masterpiece

138
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Embrace

139
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,719
Dinner on October 16th 2008

140
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:11,583
Conspiracies are already running wild Jerome corsi was already appearing all over Fox News

141
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
Claim to be short for

142
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
I've been released

143
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,263
Alex opening is telling a joke

144
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,823
About Bush's accusations people who are us

145
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
Alex

146
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,431
To give you a sense of where this documentary is

147
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,759
Spiritual level

148
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,855
So he's playing over

149
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:39,743
Obama's inauguration

150
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
Clearly what he's trying to do is make it look like

151
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,679
Even at his inauguration

152
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
Remember him

153
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
When is inauguration

154
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,271
These ideas in your head

155
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
It's incongruences clearly in a

156
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Humorous

157
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
Even though

158
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
I don't know about that

159
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
That's on the editor

160
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:39,135
Only honor military in order to achieve

161
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,207
National Security objectives

162
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,559
Obama gave on July 2nd 2018 Colorado Springs

163
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
Quotev

164
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,679
Around that clip that

165
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
You just played Obama said quote

166
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,567
We're going to grow our Foreign Service open consulate that have been shattered and double the size of the

167
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
Peace Corps by 2011 to renew art

168
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Diplomacy

169
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,223
We cannot continue to rely on our military

170
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:12,415
We do from listen to show 2000

171
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,487
Very selective

172
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:22,399
For the 10

173
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,239
He's not using military might is the sole Avenue towards

174
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
The re-establishment of focus on diplomacy

175
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Which I would think I was

176
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
But oh well

177
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Let me just

178
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
Keeps the service to others and

179
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,575
The community are really important

180
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
To ask people to embrace service

181
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Not that he intends to

182
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
To force anyone to

183
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,327
Already predicting for this entire

184
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
That

185
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,383
Regardless of how evil he is trying to paint

186
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,991
Feelings on Obama's presidency

187
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
Back mixed

188
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
At least

189
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Highway

190
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,271
Everybody somewhere between ages 18-25 will serve three months of faith

191
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
Training

192
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,463
Emmanuel

193
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,047
Thousand

194
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
Kokoro called the plant

195
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
Because because

196
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
Any other kind of

197
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,687
He also spends a lot of time talking about corporate welfare

198
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
We're in the long struggle

199
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,343
Terrorism in America is a target the best ways to prepare America

200
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
Forward

201
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
In understanding what their roles going

202
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
Everything from

203
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
It's

204
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
Chemical attack

205
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
What role they have

206
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
Understanding

207
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
A kind of civil

208
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
Just an idea that Robin

209
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
His co-author had

210
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
Not something that ever got put into legislation

211
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
He wrote This Book

212
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
Susan 2006

213
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
Well before

214
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,159
Well before right around

215
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
So this is this

216
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,791
I am already.

217
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
Because I do not

218
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Ever

219
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
Ever ever want

220
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
To defend Rahm Emanuel from

221
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,175
Send Rob Emanuel Chicago

222
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Criticisms

223
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Is dumb

224
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
If you want

225
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,559
Possibly

226
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,351
Would be a system that would be cumbersome

227
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,447
Myself

228
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,751
How are you going to get them today

229
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,055
Community service through

230
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Anyway

231
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Hecate

232
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
It's high-minded missguided

233
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:53,343
Everything that you just described their completely did not do

234
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,159
He was given every opportunity

235
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:02,559
The middle here because codes that Obama is saying is that we need a civilian

236
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
Peace Corps

237
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
But it's some sort of nefarious

238
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:19,455
International for Charlie puth that's just as powerful Justice from

239
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,719
What the fuk was that

240
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:37,119
African-American children

241
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
Routine talking about Obama's

242
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
Plan

243
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,847
Is without a doubt a visual dog with

244
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:53,759
Alex is trying to make you feel afraid of any large group

245
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,343
Children

246
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
Oh

247
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,183
Even if they're just children

248
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Spell with multiple lives

249
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,607
Alarm

250
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,447
There's no

251
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,431
Posted on October 2nd

252
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
2008

253
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,039
The video shows children one-by-one Express

254
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,599
Because they were inspired by Obama

255
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,231
Professional mostly being an architect

256
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:41,631
Be a better job

257
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,983
The procession

258
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,567
Immediately after this week

259
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
Kind of understandably

260
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
I guess it doesn't

261
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
Indoctrination

262
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
Children

263
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,527
The urban community Leadership Academy in Kansas City Missouri

264
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
The students because they were like

265
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
Legal action

266
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:13,119
ABC was the fact that the teacher was having the students study Obama's healthcare plan but not McCain

267
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
Not that they

268
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Be totally fine

269
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
Probably more important

270
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,311
Community leaders

271
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Academy

272
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
Charter School

273
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,407
Which is described as a failed experiment

274
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
2014 report

275
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Network of public education

276
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
Endemic patterns

277
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,159
High School

278
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,023
Michael

279
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
It closed in 2012

280
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,727
Missouri state auditor found notify

281
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,287
University of Central Missouri

282
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
107

283
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,943
$19,980 in school funds

284
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
Unaccounted for

285
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Even under subpoena

286
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,087
Cheats to justify the claim purchases

287
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,415
You kind of have to assume that this wasn't the only incident of

288
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,463
Conveniently sloppy record-keeping

289
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
Never got up to

290
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
That's the bigger issue that I see

291
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,823
You can study Obama's healthcare plan because

292
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,383
McCain's plan was super simple

293
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
N99 mask

294
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
Also

295
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,647
They're just assuming that the teacher didn't teach them both plans

296
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
The kids

297
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
I don't know

298
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,535
I have no idea but

299
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,631
You know the thing that I really feel bad about here is that

300
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
Element

301
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
If abuse

302
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
With him there

303
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,519
These kids were put in

304
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
Into this situation

305
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Not the teacher

306
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
Presumably the adult

307
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Situation

308
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
Feel like this

309
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
It's wrong with Alex to do this

310
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
Those kids don't

311
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
Deserved

312
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
According to this documentary

313
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
What stores

314
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Severe

315
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
For Alex's viewers

316
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,775
For free

317
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
Let me tell you something

318
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,151
They're action figures

319
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Could not keep them on the show

320
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,039
We meet one of the main Scholars

321
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,623
Documentary

322
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,927
Exactly like

323
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,511
The road but here is he

324
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
The Fray

325
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Obama is

326
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Cool Hawks

327
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
He works for wolski

Capital

329
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,007
Where did you come up with the number 700

330
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,055
Here's the treasury spokeswoman quote

331
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:06,175
It's not based on any particular data point we just really wanted to come up with a really big number

332
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,503
The Democrats and Republicans

333
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
I say

334
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Step Up

335
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Butterfly

336
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,879
A few members were even told

337
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,720
That there would be martial law in America if we voted no

338
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:25,376
California representative

339
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,448
About the initial bailout bill

340
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,336
I was just playing fast and loose with martial law

341
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,688
Threatened with martial law

342
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Consequences

343
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
But some people felt they

344
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,928
That's what represent

345
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,952
You know how I know this

346
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976

00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Conversation

352
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:13,248
Between numbers on the floor

353
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Alex

354
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
I understand

355
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,744
I think these were people who really believed they were saying

356
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,352
I don't think these people got called by Goldman Sachs

357
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,888
Take a life of its own

358
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,936
One person says the market will drop

359
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,264
Somebody else's 2500-3000

360
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,336
Somebody else's unemployment will immediately jump to 9%

361
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Alex

362
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
It spreads

363
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
It gets worse and worse

Brett

365
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:46,272
I don't think there was early so I'm not aware of this being carefully orchestrated

366
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,368
You made an appearance on Alex's show

367
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
Contradicted

368
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,928

Of the show

379
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:23,648
I want to bring him out so we could do it as a Duo

380
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,208
I wouldn't be against it

381
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
I know and one of a dozen

382
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424

Play Alex Wright

384
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
You look like

385
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,152
Robin Williams

386
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:49,504
The punchline

393
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
Introduced

394
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
Against Donald Trump

395
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
Wait what

396
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
What

397
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
So Alex has a documentary which is

398
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:42,752
The number of people who are in this documentary who have really funny

399
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:47,360
Makoto's to their career

400
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
There's one of the like

401
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,224
In preparation of this documentary

402
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
Sincerely

403
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,624
Went down some weird rabbit hole

404
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,184
Stories are so absurd

405
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
That they must be told

406
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
And this is one of them

407
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,304
Here we have Louie gohmert

408
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,376
Talkingshit about Henry Paulson

409
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
Secretary Henry Paulson

410
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
There's no George Washington

411
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,904
To talk about it

412
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
I got so like

413
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,376
Here's

414
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:47,776
Who is no George Washington

415
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:54,176
Terror babies for like 7 minutes

416
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
That Louie gohmert is pushing

417
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,064
That terrorists are having a baby

418
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
Years down the line

419
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
Anderson Cooper has such a hard time not laughing

420
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,488
It is one of the funniest

421
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
About

422
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
It 2013

423
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,520
This is the result of him defending his position that you should be able to regulate guns

424
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
Because gay marriage

425
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,592
Is the same thing as bestiality

426
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,896
His quote

427
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:30,016
The problem is once you draw capacity magazine

428
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
Cool

429
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
Good

430
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
Good thinking

431
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,888
Somehow

432
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,800
Your regulating marriage

433
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
He's angling it's

434
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,152
He thinks you're deregulating

435
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,432
Marriage

436
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,992
Episode deregulating.

437
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
Bridget

438
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,952
Beastiality somehow

439
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
Make a stupid

440
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,608
The country by pretending to be Mexican

441
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,448
We don't have any fear of Hispanics coming into the country

442
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,432
Backcountry

443
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
I'd like to keep having fruit

444
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
I'm a big fan

445
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
I'd like to

446
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,720
Thought of a great idea for a TV

447
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:48,352
It's in the wild

448
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:54,752
Pages from the 9/11 report

449
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:04,992
Is there a

450
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:11,648
Very weird visit to Egypt

451
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,696
Soon-to-be installed president General

452
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,744
Abdel-fattah el-sisi

453
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,280
Successful

454
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Erstwhile president arrested

455
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:26,496
For Morsi supporters and headed up by a girl

456
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:33,664
1420

457
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Camps of protesters in Cairo

458
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,760
After they'd been engaging in a six-week long sit-in

459
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:43,136
Human Rights Watch describe what it's doing is quote one of the worst world's largest killings

460
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
Demonstrators

461
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,208
It is single day in recent history

462
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:55,936
Less than a month later Louie gohmert visited to give el-sisi congratulations on

463
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
Performing Baku

464
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:03,360
He was

465
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
Weirdo Michele Bachmann and outright Nazi Representatives

466
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,136
Alright

467
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,048
Steve

468
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
Give me the plane

469
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:30,240
Congratulate

470
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,288
America

471
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:37,920
And this is after this is after he killed all those demonstrators

472
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,480
Elise's

473
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,320
2013

474
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:52,256
The pro-morsi protesters who were massacred remembers of the Muslim

475
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
Motherhood

476
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
Took it upon herself to

477
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
TheBlaze

478
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,352
Brotherhood for doing 9/11

479
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
It's not true

480
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,752
Because the Muslim Brotherhood publicly

481
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
Strongly condemned

482
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:09,664
Is this

483
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:17,088
George Washington ever done before him let him know Terry and revolution revolution

484
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,720
We met in general el-sisi a man who is the leader of the military who might have a shot at being a

485
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,304
President

486
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
Egypt

487
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:32,448
Is no George Washington lccc

488
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:37,312
CD record

489
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,384
Benevolent

490
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,272
C in overwhelming fashion

491
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,072
He's still at present

492
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:04,192
Human Rights Watch has described the government

493
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,520
Civil Society

494
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,336
Congratulations

495
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Anyone

496
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
Question

497
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
Mister Kashkari

498
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,992
Working hard

499
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:29,280
Resume the security and prosperity partnership talks

500
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,072
Between Mexico and Canada

501
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:37,472
The President Bush

502
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,496
Defense secretary

503
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,080
Leap year

504
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:48,480
And others that it was at Hillary Clinton

505
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
We've said oppressive

506
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,600
So frequently a lot of this stuff

507
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
Is going to be stopped

508
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
Thumbs up light

509
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,208
I'm not ignoring you real quick

510
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
When was this

511
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,280
This was released in 2009

512
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
I believe March

513
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
2000

514
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Obama

515
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
President

516
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:11,520
January

517
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Did he include anything

518
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
Post

519
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:20,736
Inauguration other than like video of the inauguration

520
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,552
Was inaugurated

521
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:33,792
Is about to pop up

522
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,864
Podcast episode

523
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
Was after

524
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
It is

525
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
Problem

526
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
Rushed this

527
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
2

528
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
The market

529
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
You should

530
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
YouTube

531
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
Lexia

532
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,880
Crazy

533
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,584
No

534
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
And it wasn't

535
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,192
We've got to give them a steak

536
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,984
In creating the kind of

537
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,288
I will order that I think all of us would like to see

538
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,552
Alright

539
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
Hold on

540
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,696
He was talking there is a big audible tear

541
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
He was not talking to a rally

542
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
That was edited

543
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:50,080
The World Series

544
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:54,432
From this documentary blew his

545
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,760
And refused to take it out because

546
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
Use of information

547
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,088
It is really crucial today

548
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,464
Camera pans out we see that this isn't just an animation of Barack Obama

549
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
It's a group shot

550
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:18,752
Geithner Jade Skywalker

551
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,896
Tom daschle was nominated for secretary of Health and Human Services

552
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:30,016
But by the time this documentary came out he had already withdrawn his name from consideration

553
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
Because of

554
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
Text problem

555
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,136
So I think that Alex blew his Budget on this shot

556
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Awful

557
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,488
Just refuse to change at 5

558
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,816
Because

559
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
Embarrassing

560
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,376
This is embarrassing

561
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:59,456
The Obama Deception

562
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
Cameras one rocking

563
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,192
If your burger is not done right

564
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,280
I want to go to the Supreme Court

565
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,152
Hungry

566
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:07,808
Burger King

567
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:14,208
Or to the bottom

568
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,888
I like to let people speak

569
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:26,240
Piece that's why I didn't interrupt

570
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
I don't

571
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,544
No

572
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Who

573
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
Actually is what

574
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
In that

575
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:38,016
I mean analogy

576
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,296
Okay so the cashier is

577
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
The courts

578
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
Your Burgers called

579
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,952
Metaphorically

580
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,232
I'll leave that part 11

581
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,840
Whatever

582
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Marillac

583
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,680
Go to the

584
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,240
President

585
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:06,432
That makes absolutely no sense

586
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,296
Now the second problem that I have with it is

587
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
If your Burgers cold

588
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
The cashier

589
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,184
The store manager

590
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,000
Can I help you

591
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,816
Owner doesn't have time for that

592
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:27,424
Not the problem

593
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:32,032
What is the fridge

594
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,784
And then the president is the store managers cashiers

595
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,880
One of my favorite thing

596
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:51,232
Conspiracy theory all dead how the government works

597
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:57,632
If you listen to the Riza talk about the government the funniest f****** thing you've ever heard

598
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,936
Little bit

599
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,640
Everybody knows that

600
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:16,576
If he's displaying this level

601
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,600
First of all

602
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,624
Lack of awareness

603
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
Of how our government

604
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,672
Networks

605
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
Substitute

606
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,232
Complaints about state government

607
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,304
And then also demonstrates this kind of like

608
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
Inability to wrestle with

609
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,680
Inference like the metaphor

610
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,664
A good one you don't need

611
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
Explain which

612
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
Part

613
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,552
Each individual thing is you know you don't have to be like

614
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,600
Go to the cashier

615
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
Go to court

616
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Explain

617
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:05,984
I've always admired Kerris one I still think a lot of his music

618
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,544
Disgrace

619
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,384
Need to take a step back and assess whether

620
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,200
Donuts

621
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,392
Chris Creighton The Fast and Furious movies

622
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
That's true

623
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,280
Hold off on that

624
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:34,912
Also it's important to point out that five months after this interview with Alex doing right now

625
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,216
Terrace One release a 600-page book

626
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
Call

627
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
The first instrument

628
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,336
Improv

629
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:46,688
I'm suggesting in 100 years this book will be the new religion on Earth

630
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,552
I respect Christianity the Islam's the Judaism but their time is up

631
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,136
He certainly has every right to start his own music based religions

632
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:03,328
I just think it's really funny that Alex

633
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:11,520
Who's actively trying to start a religion

634
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:16,896
With art

635
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,176
Hilarious

636
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,016
He's such a user

637
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,832
Like

638
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
Disappointed

639
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,840
Politics

640
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,264
In front of the camera

641
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
The public

642
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:50,432
I'm going to kick my opponent

643
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,992
Yep behind the scene

644
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,784
Y'all are friends going out

645
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,184
Dinner K

646
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:14,240
It's hilarious

647
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:26,016
Nothing is like politics is like

648
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:33,440
If your fries are cold

649
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:39,840
Every single person

650
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:46,240
The other day you told me about this great metaphor about fast food

651
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,479
Saying that Republicans and Democrats act like opposing forces behind the scenes they get along

652
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,527
That's how I want the f***

653
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Can government to work

654
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,343
This in Show Business

655
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,367
It's it's

656
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
Cubans disagreeing

657
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,207
Is the way that I would like things

658
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,023
To work once I believe

659
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
The other side beliefs

660
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
Position why

661
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
But they're both good

662
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:16,191
People could share a steak and talked about their families are golf scores or whatever the f***

663
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,983
That's how the world should operate

664
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,871
Jesse is saying which is like

665
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,455
Hey everybody in public hate each other but then we hang out

666
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
Improv

667
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,759
Trying to paint

668
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,343
You talk about pro wrestling

669
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:43,071
Hanging out like a

670
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,703
Absolutely not tragic

671
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:56,383
First

672
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
Look at things

673
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,759
Discounts and takes away the entire ideas at like

674
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Like you and I

675
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,551
Could disagree

676
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,879
Maybe you unfairly major position

677
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,671
Other common ground

678
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
Policy abmc

679
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Rhian f

680
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
G

681
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,399
There's no reason that that that you don't have to be idealog

682
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,543
What would make it make more sense

683
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,615
Everybody was like

684
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:32,479
We understand the climate change is the biggest issue

685
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,295
Still disagree on

686
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,391
Figure out where they come together

687
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
It's it's trouble

688
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
Less than right mean nothing

689
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
The only thing

690
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
Chances

691
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,631
Are you working for walls

692
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,103
Gigantic fight

693
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
Politicians

694
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:09,855
Hey there

695
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,415
I mean

696
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,487
60 Stoopid

697
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:19,583
Whenever he wasn't

698
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:26,239
Is this is also the only appearance

699
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:32,639
Most popular world

700
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
Tim to be all over this.

701
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,343
Before disaster

702
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,439
The Logical conclusion of that is not to adopt any of Alex's

703
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,487
It's to initiate

704
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,047
Institute publicly-funded funding

705
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,071
For campaign

706
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,375
And make accepting any donations illegal

707
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,359
America

708
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,919
2009

709
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:12,319
Years been disaster

710
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:15,391
Fair enough

711
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,231
F*** you

712
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,279
George Bush

713
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
Conservative

714
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,311
Shredded the Constitution

715
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:39,711
I was trying to figure out figure out what Alex meant by triple the size of the federal government

716
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,319
Couldn't figure out what he was saying

717
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
During endgame

718
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,903
I found out

719
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,695
Bibliography

720
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:55,071
Which is mostly Encarta Paisley TV

721
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,863
Encarta pages and then

722
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
Citation needed

723
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,311
Confined

724
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
So what do you mix

725
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,359
The claim that bush

726
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,895
Triple the size of the government

727
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,943
In order for me to talk about that

728
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:16,575
Government-to-government

729
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,927
What is he talking about

730
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,255
Guest for you

731
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,815
Right and that's going to happen.

732
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
Anyway

733
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,911
Destroyed the image

734
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:39,615
No weapons over there

735
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,431
Over a million dead Iraq

736
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:47,807
And more than 5,000 dead US troops

737
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,463
The Patriot Act warrantless wiretapping Supply

738
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,487
Patriot Act

739
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:59,071
In the Posse Comitatus

740
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:03,167
The Rose

741
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,727
A deepening recession

742
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,639
Create some sort of

743
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,759
Like really save your thoughts on that

744
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,743
He over-exaggerated misdemeanors will be terrorism

745
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,607
Embellishes exaggerated

746
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,239
Don't operate outside of federal proper

747
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,519
Is a 2

748
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:45,663
Like is the case that we went over on the show recently

749
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,015
2009

750
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,903
Cuz it's North American Union.

751
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
We have this

752
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,511
Recession that was happening

753
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,583
If you're responsible to talk

754
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
Lakers

755
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,423
February 2009

756
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,239
I haven't had a chance to do anything about it

757
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,103
Particularly jarring now that we live in the

758
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,407
And it's still fun

759
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,431
Going on

760
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
The equivalence

761
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
He has

762
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Putting

763
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,551
1million dance

764
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
Iraq

765
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,623
5000 dead ameri

766
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,927
And he does not

767
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:33,023
Like he just leaves that there puts them right next to each other like they're the

768
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:33,791
The same

769
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
And it's like

770
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,399
Yeah

771
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,703
One of these is not like the other

772
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,519
That's that's a fair as a fair

773
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,871
America's Best

774
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,455
The American people in a state of panic

775
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
Their future

776
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,759
I'm a very existence

777
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,671
People

778
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
Facade

779

Past

00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:10,911
Both parties

781
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,191
Universally hated

782
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,495
Congress 9%

783
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,543
The globalist agenda

784
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Poll numbers

785
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,551
Photography

786
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
Information from

787
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
13th

788
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,023
2000's hits 14%

789
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
Does the lowest

790
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,071
During this Panadol

791
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,887
Inauguration

792
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,911
On January

793
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,935
2009

794
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,727
The numbers are back up in the 30s

795
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,751
Sullivan great

796
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,031
But it's not nearly what

797
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:55,199
Never get down to 9% until November 2013

798
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,527
It's not hard to remember what was so bad back then

799
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,343
You may recall that this

800
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,135
Was the result of their being

801
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,951
A democratic majority Senate in a republican house

802
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
The Affordable Care Act

803
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
The Koch brothers

804
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,631
Tea party organization

805
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,471
It was an existential issue for them

806
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,007
The ACA gone

807
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,615
Auto insurance companies

808
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,943
Unregulated gambling

809
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,271
In September 2013 there was an Appropriations bill

810
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,295
Repast insured

811
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,111
Republicans

812
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,391
Crews used as a bargain

813
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
The dismantling of the affordable

814
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,791
Only if they could be fun

815
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,815
The Affordable Care Act

816
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,607
This strategy was literally

817
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,655
From the Koch brothers founded

818
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,215
Think Tank freedom to work which

819
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,495
Suggested that

820
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,079
Must be renewed in order for the doors

821
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,359
Stay open in Washington

822
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,407
The continuing resolution

823
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,943
Is the best chance we will get

824
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,479
Withdraw funds from Obamacare

825
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,551
This could be done by attaching bills bicep

826
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:07,135
For Congressman Tom Graves

827
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,415
Continuing resolution

828
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
Which will

829
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
Defund Obamacare

830
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,047
Congressman Mark Meadows

831
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
Get their colleagues

832
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,655
By putting your signature

833
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,703
Affirming that they would refuse to vote for the

834
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,727
A concurrent resolution

835
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
And guess what happened

836
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,359
The exact Republicans named in that release

837
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,639
Freedomworks

838
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:34,527
Led the charge not to approve the spending bill

839
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,511
With a strategy so we ended up with

840
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,791
They shutdown

841
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
The Federal

842
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:52,703
800,000 employees were furloughed in 1.3 million had to go to work not knowing when they be paid

843
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,263
The damage was caused by this petulant shutdown

844
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,407
Pretty hard to put into words

845
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,735
And governmental organizations are relied on federal funding

846
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,015
Cut off

847
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:06,783
Including to mess

848
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,343
Violence shelters in program

849
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,879
His many is 19000

850
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,183
Children lost their access to the Head Start program

851
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,231
Which provides education food in healthcare

852
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
Underprivileged

853
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,583
The national parks estimated that they lost approximately

854
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,375
376 million dollars a day

855
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,679
And tourism income during the shutdown

856
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,471
2.7 million a day alone

857
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,495
From the Grand Canyon

858
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,055
Which has a reciprocal effect on the small businesses

859
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,591
It exists around the National Park

860
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,895
They rely on them to bring in business

861
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
In the form of Tourette's

862
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,735
That's when Congress had a 9%

863
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,063
Favor of the government shutdown

864
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,087
And support

865
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,159
Cruise I'm not sure what that means

866
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,423
So you're saying that there were no negative effects

867
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,471
The billionaire

868
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,007
For this

869
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,823
Political stunt that never had any chance

870
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
Success at all

871
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,895
Real-world effects

872
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,431
Like regular

873
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,247
And and just like humans

874
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:16,927
America

875
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
Buddies

876
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,767
Super 4

877
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,071
Good good good everybody makes sense

878
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:26,399
I love it whenever there is a

879
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,959
Your ideology and your

880
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,727
Supporting

881
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:30,751
You betcha

882
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,335
That's the time

883
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,639
Poll showed an actual approval rating

884
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:41,759
Rasmussen poll

885
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:45,599
Percent of the 1,000 likely voters they pulled

886
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,927
The Congress was doing a good or excellent job

887
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,999
But that's not a 9% approval rate

888
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,607
For contrast gallup's poll was just opposed

889
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,423
Not necessarily likely voters

890
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,215
And they specifically asked a quest

891
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,007
Do you approve or disapprove

892
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,287
Way Congress is handling

893
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,359
Leave the way that they frame the question

894
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,127
In the Rasmus

895
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,807
Lynette wasn't

896
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,831
Looked at

897
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,879
Also when was the last time Congress had

898
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,647
Positive

899
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:23,487
I don't know

900
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,303
1950

901
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,143
Also a minor point but both parties Alex

902
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,703
Universally hated absolutely

903
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,543
Okay by 12 points

904
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
Which makes sense

905
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,103
Because in the 2008 election

906
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:39,871
Democrats

907
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,247
For the Main Street

908
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
Right the ship

909
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,599
Contact

910
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,391
The last time one party had fee

911
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,415
57 cm

912
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,207
As the Democrats

913
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,231
2008 election

914
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,023
Was in 1992

915
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,095
Republic

916
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,631
Intitle majorities at Large

917
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,655
In the election of 90

918
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,959
20

919
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,983
President at 11

920
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:11,871
For the Senate vote

921
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:16,223
So just giving you that the world we lived in the last time Republic

922
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:20,063
Had his a majority the Democrats enjoyed

923
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,391
Crazy how did it go the last time the Republicans had that

924
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:27,743
Massive majority

925
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,303
Since that so it's almost like there's a pattern

926
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,375
When the Republicans are in power

927
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,399
They did

928
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
Everything

929
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:46,175
Youth history

930
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
We could all be

931
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:52,319
Already go f*** yourself you came onto the scene

932
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,623
It's perpetuated by the right-wing

933
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,159
Came out of nowhere

934
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,975
It's used to in service of the ID

935
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:05,631
The creation of the Illuminati

936
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,167
Even a demon

937
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:07,935
Nothing

938
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,215
Promise complete bulshit

939
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,287
Try running for President Obama

940
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,847
Is the senator in Illinois

941
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,383
Gets rid of the he came Outta nowhere

942
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:24,831
For being Senator Obama was a member of the Illinois Senate winning his first election in 1996

943
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:30,207
Deep are the state senate that puts Obama right on the same level as all these weirdo state senators that Alex

944
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,743
Constantly has on his program

945
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,815
To talk about reasserting their 10th Amendment rights

946
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,631
He was in

947
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,191
State Senate since 1997

948
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:43,263
That's almost as long as Alex has been on the radio

949
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,567
Obama has been an elected

950
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,615
State position

951
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,199
What is the state senate

952
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:57,599
Alex police

953
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,439
Legislature

954
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,767
It's not cuz he's black

955
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,791
It's all good

956
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,287
It's fairly easy to see why

957
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,567
Is time in Congress

958
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,103
Turn basically

959
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
Obama was

960
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,151
The primary sponsor for

961
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,687
For bills that were enacted

962
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:27,807
I'm out right now

963
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,623
He's only got one bill passed

964
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:38,559
Obama was an active member of the state senate in Illinois

965
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,823
And in 2004 he gave a super important

966
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,871
Speech at the Democratic National Convention

967
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,919
Which state was

968
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:54,687
It was

969
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:58,015
Like it was the first time the world was like

970
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:02,367
Breakthrough like the idea that came out of nowhere even if you wanted it

971
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,207
Before 2004

972
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
He gave that

973
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,767
Groundbreaking

974
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,911
A patriot

975
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,519
Was a sleeper Canyon States

976
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:22,079
Who else it was a community

977
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,807
Barack H Obama

978
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,879
Bring our troops home

979
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
Yeah

980
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,951
The Constitution

981
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:39,999
Federal government

982
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
Find America

983
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
He did all right

984
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:45,375
Like some of the

985
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,143
Issues of the

986
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,423
Specifics

987
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,959
Later is out

988
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:52,031
But like you've already brought up it's so important to remember this is

989
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
Is less than 2 months

990
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,967
Imply

991
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,247
Use

992
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:05,087
Executives it'll act unilaterally

993
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,159
Which kind of makes sense

994
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,695
Now considering in present day

995
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,327
While the same time upholding the Constitution

996
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:21,727
America with no regard for the other branches of government

997
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:25,055
While still maintaining the Constitution right

998
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,103
All the amendments

999
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,575
No I don't

1000
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,255
Breaking news

1001
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
2 months

1002
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,839
In this film we will prove

1003
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,887
But Obama says one thing

1004
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,983
She'll just breathe

1005
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,007
Bush serve

1006
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,799
The very interest

1007
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,847
Engineering the financial collapse

1008
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
Formation

1009
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,175
I'm addicted to real world

1010
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,271
Best film is not about left or right

1011
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:14,207
Go fuc yourself

1012
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:22,655
You like hearing that violin come back

1013
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,775
Yes Humanity

1014
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,335
Directions to the better

1015
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,151
Will not come from the Madison Avenue false reality make

1016
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,943
Barack Obama

1017
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,247
Batman

1018
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,087
To alter our course

1019
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,879
To defeat the corrupt Elite

1020
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,535
Do puppet

1021
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:52,607
Coming into view

1022
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,703
A world in which there is a very serious Prospect

1023
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,727
Seven New World Order

1024
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
Webster Griffin

1025
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:00,799
Noticed

1026
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
Christmas decoration

1027
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,247
You think when he was videotaping West

1028
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:18,463
Before Obama

1029
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,231
Christmas

1030
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,767
Geopolitical animal

1031
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,399
Are the unauthorized biographies of George Herbert Walker Bush

1032
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,935
Barack Hussein Obama

1033
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,983
The postmodern coup

1034
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,287
Bushkill

1035
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
September

1036
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,383
New World Order

1037
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:37,919
I'm confused about

1038
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,991
The New World Order

1039
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,295
A Moorpark

1040
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Angela

1041
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
Second world Empire

1042
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,727
Twisted the work of

1043
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,543
Who put out the book The anglo-american established

1044
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,335
That has been

1045
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,407
Misrepresented

1046
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,943
In the naked capitalist

1047
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:15,039
Gary Allan and none dare call it conspiracy

1048
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:19,647
These are

1049
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,047
Now I want to tell you about Webster

1050
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
Griffin Tarpley

1051
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,399
Guide

1052
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,959
Okay

1053
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
Pretty fantastic

1054
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:37,823
Their website

1055
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,407
Judge people's

1056
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,943
The same way that Alex

1057
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,711
Right right

1058
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,479
Helix

1059
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:50,879
Exactly the billionaire

1060
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
Lebowski

1061
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,327
5 is the billionaire what

1062
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,863
Looks exactly like

1063
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:04,959
He does there are still married

1064
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,495
Cuz he look

1065
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,311
List

1066
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
I wanted to

1067
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,759
Metairie

1068
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,319
Call Webster Tarpley

1069
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:27,999
Let's just do a documentary about webs

1070
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:32,351
Because he is

1071
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:36,191
Completely fascinated with this guy by the time

1072
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:38,239
I finished this bio on him

1073
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:42,335
So Webster play here in the documentaries created as an author and historian

1074
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:48,991
He's notably not also credited as a guy who has a radio show on the Genesis Communications Network

1075
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:57,439
It's a bit of a conflict of interest

1076
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,719
Is also similar

1077
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,999
The payroll of the

1078
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,535
Distributes Alex's radio show

1079
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:10,239
Cinnamoroll and they have a little sit-down now

1080
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,519
Get back

1081
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,799
Deception book

1082
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,871
The only way to get past the North American Union

1083
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,663
Babadook

1084
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,455
Ted does not show up

1085
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,367
The Protege of Lyndon larouche

1086
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:31,231
Who comes up on our normal show every now and again

1087
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:38,911
Tangentially related to the matters at hand so we're going to save getting deep into him for another day

1088
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:43,775
But suffice to say in 1979

1089
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,311
Somatic

1090
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,639
The suit was thrown out just as Michael.

1091
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:51,455
Of the New York Supreme Court ruled that it was a fair,

1092
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:59,903
Reasonably give rise to the description of him is a piece of heaven

1093
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,231
You are legally a fascist you dumb idiot

1094
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:11,167
Accidentally made a New York Supreme Court Judge rule on the record that his actions could be fairly called anti-Semitic

1095
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:17,567
You are a sort of idea log

1096
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,335
Magical predator

1097
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,407
I decided to check into tarpleys credential

1098
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Nice pose

1099
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,223
Epsom salt

1100
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:28,063
Most of his books are unauthorized

1101
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,623
Like George Bush the unauthorized

1102
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,463
Obama the postmodern making of a Manchurian Candidate

1103
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,999
2 subtitles

1104
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
Funny note

1105
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:44,703
The book was called Obama dangerous when it was released

1106
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,567
I like that

1107
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,967
Jimmy James munky funky donkey for karate Murphy death card

1108
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:59,039
Mistranslated as likes

1109
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
To buy Hut

1110
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:12,607
The author of the book called Barack H Obama the unauthorized biography

1111
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:23,615
Right

1112
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
It was titled

1113
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
Just

1114
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,991
Weird Bishop of America

1115
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,039
Polygamy theocracy and subversion

1116
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:35,135
Subtitles

1117
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:42,303
Any interest in reading these books but reviews

1118
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,863
Oppositional Style

1119
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,983
That makes numerous leaps of logic and there is no evidence

1120
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,007
And another time

1121
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
Contrarian

1122
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,591
Information

1123
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,383
That reveals a more complex picture

1124
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,663
Sounds like

1125
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,711
Exactly the sort of guy Alex

1126
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,783
To be an expert so if he were to go in front of the New York

1127
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,063
State supreme court

1128
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,879
They would legally say you are not a historic

1129
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:10,207
Kind of a historian

1130
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,767
PhD in

1131
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,815
Early modern history

1132
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,095
Which is today the Middle Ages

1133
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,143
However that degree is from

1134
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,679
The Catholic University of America

1135
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,007
University

1136
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:29,407
Well early modern history

1137
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,431
Catholic

1138
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,967
University of America is

1139
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:36,063
Good school according to the Princeton Review I still going to raise my eyebrows

1140
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:40,671
Concerning what a school literally founded by the Vatican might be teaching about the Middle Ages

1141
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:46,303
Seems like they might have skewed version of events from that. I have no idea if that's true

1142
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,959
The time that it was multiple popes

1143
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:56,799
Distrust of organized religion

1144
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:57,823
Especially

1145
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,103
Rotational tool

1146
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,663
Association of college

1147
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,943
Professors

1148
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,479
Catholic University of America

1149
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,575
All that being said the school

1150
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,415
0.0%

1151
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,207
There's no abortions there ever

1152
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,023
That is not even

1153
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,863
True it's not even it's not even 0.0%

1154
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,959
That's not the most interesting thing about

1155
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,799
Steven is bachelors in the languages

1156
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:29,567
Is from Princeton

1157
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,895
Is a Fulbright scholar at the University

1158
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,687
Whataburger

1159
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,479
The reason is interesting is that

1160
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,015
The Fulbright program is funded

1161
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:41,599
Entirely by the Bureau of education and cultural affairs

1162
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:46,463
State State Park

1163
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,487
We'll see

1164
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:51,071
Fulbright program

1165
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,375
Students abroad

1166
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,959
Improving Intercultural relations

1167
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,495
Abreon said Nations

1168
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:01,311
Together you think the Fulbright program

1169
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,335
For the guy who came

1170
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:07,967
William Fulbright

1171
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:17,439
Insofar as International laws

1172
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:23,839
International laws

1173
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:27,679
Kings of predicting the behavior of those with whom we have

1174
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,751
The creation of

1175
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:34,079
Practice international law

1176
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:37,151
So what we have here is Webster

1177
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,199
Money

1178
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:42,527
Globalist

1179
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,927
You should make a new one all that surprised

1180
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
That

1181
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,767
In the lead-up to the 26

1182
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,535
The election

1183
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
Webster Tarpley

1184
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,863
Strongly in favor of Hillary

1185
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,935
He accurately figure it out

1186
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,215
Collapse

1187
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:01,983
Kind of a prince

1188
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,775
Libertarianism in America

1189
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,055
Was leaving it open

1190
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,359
Trump could exploit to bring in fashion

1191
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,151
He wrote

1192
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,431
On March 25th

1193
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,455
2016

1194
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:16,831
If we look for the roots of the Trump phenomenon in particular The Savage immorality

1195
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,879
Of a candidate whose supporters applaud

1196
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,415
20 calls for expanding

1197
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,439
Severity of torture

1198
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,719
Mass deportations

1199
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,487
The mass killings

1200
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,767
The families of it

1201
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,303
We should not forget about the

1202
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,583
Tremendous

1203
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,911
Including included by a figure like Ron Paul

1204
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:35,007
Paul wanted to abolish all u.s. emergency food at MiniMed about 6

1205
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,543
50% of the emergency number

1206
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,127
Usually available worldwide in a given year would have disappeared

1207
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,919
Leaving once again to genocide

1208
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,711
He literally argues

1209
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,015
Libertarianism is the front door

1210
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,551
The natural introduction

1211
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
To fascism

1212
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,599
And that Ron Paul is

1213
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,439
Ended

1214
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,463
In this blog post

1215
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,279
He's clearly also talking about Alex Jones

1216
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:00,351
Between 2008 and early to

1217
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,631
2015

1218
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,703
The libertarian bloggers and broadcasters

1219
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,471
Accelerate

1220
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,495
Decline

1221
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:09,823
Especially in terms of the moral honesty and ideological quality

1222
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,591
Output

1223
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:16,223
We're watching the astounding ease with which veterans are Libertarians blithely throw their

1224
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,503
Principles overboard

1225
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:21,087
And rushed like Lemmings to join the bandwagon of the fascist Trump

1226
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,647
Who's dictatorial and authoritarian tendencies

1227
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,927
Hardly be

1228
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,511
I don't know

1229
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:34,911
Also I totally help them out also sorry I was in the Obama

1230
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:43,871
Yeah we're giving you a year of intellectualism

1231
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,175
Clearly something I regret

1232
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,967
After you put up that block

1233
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:54,367
Prison Planet

1234
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,999
I have no idea what to think about whether sharply like as a whole

1235
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:03,583
He's going to be factually and spiritually wrong about almost everything

1236
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,911
Get Lisa the Goodcents

1237
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:09,727
Was

1238
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,263
Crazy

1239
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,543
Considering the other

1240
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:17,407
Most likely conclusion here at is what I'm going to stick by because it's

1241
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,175
The easiest

1242
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,455
Simplest explanation

1243
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,247
Explain all of

1244
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,015
The things

1245
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,831
Is it Webster Tarpley is a charlatan in a con man

1246
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,135
Generally knows

1247
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
Better

1248
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,695
Is Dino better than to

1249
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,999
To support the rise of something overlay patch

1250
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:37,631
Because generally you have to pay them for your con

1251
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:41,983
Also just ignore things are being unfair

1252
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,007
Huge piece of s***

1253
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,567
Yeah he supported multiculturalism abroad

1254
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,383
However he protested Brown versus the Board of Education

1255
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:54,783
And ironically

1256
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:59,391
He's part of the Great Republican

1257
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,159
Exodus

1258
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,207
Pontoon out there

1259
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,743
In August

1260
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:09,631
With a high-end prostitute

1261
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:14,495
Which quickly led to a libel suit

1262
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,311
You're totally settled that lawsuit

1263
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,079
Which were private

1264
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,895
Topology

1265
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,919
A substantial

1266
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:29,343
He's off the wagon

1267
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,671
Spiritually

1268
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:39,071
Don't get yourself into libel territory

1269
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,399
I hear you

1270
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:55,199
9 minutes into this documentary and already we have the other

1271
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:59,295
Literally the main person in the documentary

1272
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:01,599
Entirely against

1273
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,623
And what he's up to

1274
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:09,535
And the other got sued for libel for calling

1275
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,839
And Roblox before the election

1276
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,607
Calling him

1277
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,143
Aspire

1278
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,703
Authoritarian

1279
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,799
New York washing

1280
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,591
The world

1281
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,871
It's hard to get people to

1282
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,199
You call it the Angela

1283
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,479
World

1284
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,503
If you call it

1285
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,783
The New World Order

1286
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,343
India or someplace

1287
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,367
European Union

1288
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,647
Might think

1289
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,487
I just want to stop by

1290
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,255
Except

1291
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,023
F****** stupid

1292
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,607
Anglo-american

1293
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:45,887
Quarter

1294
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,167
It's really the old

1295
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:48,959
The British Empire

1296
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
Morphe

1297
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:51,007
American Empire

1298
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,287
Do us British

1299
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,055
World Empire

1300
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:57,151
Talk all the time

1301
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:58,943
Subway

1302
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,087
Is

1303
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,623
Are you talkin about is the idea that I

1304
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:12,767
They called the new world order instead of the anglo-american

1305
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:13,791
So they can can

1306
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:16,607
People in India

1307
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,167
I don't know what that means

1308
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,703
To the people in charge

1309
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:26,847
He's not talking about getting Indian citizens

1310
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,663
The would-be oligarchy

1311
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:39,391
If it was called the anglo-american whatever the name of it is if they're involved

1312
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:45,535
Does a f****** matter

1313
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:50,399
So he's arguing with Ben have to be front angle

1314
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,823
That come up

1315
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:04,479
I don't really honestly do

1316
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,759
Bingo

1317
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575
Powerful men

1318
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,695
Maybe true as a

1319
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,719
Isolated

1320
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,767
Gerald Celente

1321
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,423
People that are knowledge

1322
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,447
No

1323
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,495
Got the fight

1324
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
This country's been

1325
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
Waging

1326
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,567
Section

1327
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,407
Not to take over the

1328
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:40,831
This is so funny because if you're not watching this video.

1329
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,023
Both cameras are showing

1330
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:54,655
Just involves him moving his head

1331
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:57,471
So we've run into a number of time

1332
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,751
Times on our coverage

1333
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,871
Or that is his business

1334
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,895
The trends research

1335
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:11,295
Protagonist

1336
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:15,647
Strong

1337
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,975
First thing is really funny about Gerald Celente being one of Alex

1338
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:24,607
His go-to guys

1339
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:36,383
U.s. passport

1340
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,175
Considers himself a citizen of the world

1341
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:42,527
Globalist to me

1342
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:49,439
We know Gerald Celente is a guy who appear in land Alex's show a little dramatic

1343
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:52,511
Flair with his expert delivery and cranky old man

1344
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:55,071
We also know that he existed on the show Almost

1345
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,351
Exclusively to help

1346
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,119
Sell gold

1347
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,167
As you constantly warned the audio

1348
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,983

01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,720
Despite overwhelming public

1537
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,256
Support of Congress

1538
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,024
For the bank

1539
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,864
Push for the removal of government funds from

1540
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,912
Can back which he succeeded in carrying out

1541
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:41,984
These funds were specifically placed in his favorite quote

1542
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:42,752
Pet Banks

1543
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,032
State Bank

1544
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
How to be loyal

1545
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,592
Inspiration

1546
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,896
In 1836 the federal banks Beast

1547
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,432
Became the State Bank

1548
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:54,016
Historian James Sholar noted quote

1549
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:58,112
34 there was some five hundred or more

1550
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,904
United States

1551
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,928
Circulation

1552
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,976
Several times

1553
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,000
Sterbank which Jackson

1554
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,280
Packers running down

1555
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,072
It is clear servers noted

1556
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,096
Existence

1557
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,888
Half a thousand distinct currencies

1558
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:11,680
Great deficit

1559
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:17,312
The poster regulation

1560
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:19,616
And so did little

1561
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,920
Which was with those in favor of the Second Bank

1562
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:22,944
Navigate

1563
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:27,552
And in his deregulatory laissez-faire attitude towards everything

1564
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,600
All of these competing currencies came up

1565
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,880
Traded mask

1566
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,464
Who said that he should be

1567
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,232
Working on

1568
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:37,280
Controlling

1569
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,048
For their help

1570
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,840
Historian HW brands

1571
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,400
Explains the situation that Rose

1572
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,168
Interim

1573
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,240
It got worse

1574
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,544
Primarily as a result of Jackson's

1575
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,360
Free from the restraints

1576
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,128
Vittles

1577
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,152
Actress Skye G

1578
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,224
Biddle's Bank

1579
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,528
Issued

1580
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:01,856
Cue up the ramp

1581
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,392
Speculation in every time

1582
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,160
Commodity

1583
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,720
Do much about the speculation overall

1584
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:09,536
Except worried that it jeopardize the stability of the economy

1585
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,352
And threaten the welfare of millions of Ordinary People

1586
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,400
On July 11th

1587
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,448
1836 Andrew Jackson put out of

1588
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:18,752
Land speculation

1589
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:21,568
Only be brought bought by you

1590
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:22,592
Using gold or silver

1591
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,384
Historian major l Wilson

1592
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:28,224
All that did was to make cash poor Farmers more dependent on

1593
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,504
Capital Rich speculate

1594
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:31,296
It magnified

1595
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,576
Defraud the president

1596
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,344
Expunged

1597
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,392
Loyalist

1598
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,672
The fight little

1599
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,440
Every state

1600
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,208
The Union

1601
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:42,304
Golden Silver Reserve that millions of dollars were taken out

1602
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,840
Used in land speculation

1603
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,632
Or just privately hoarded

1604
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,912
Leaving Banks vulnerable

1605
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,936
Kohl's on deposit

1606
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:51,520
All this led directly to the panic of 1837

1607
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,312
Where the country was plunged into

1608
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,080
2D procession

1609
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:54,848
The last until

1610
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:55,616
Midday

1611
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,384
1840s

1612
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,176
Unemployment reached

1613
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,456
Over 20%

1614
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,224
Many area

1615
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,528
Andrew Jackson was a really stupid president

1616
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,904
Also really dumb Point Alex yells all the time.

1617
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:08,928
Crack fiend

1618
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:13,280
Party the KKK and how Lincoln was a republican all this stuff so they're the ones who are really good

1619
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,656
Changed you could make the argument

1620
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,448
The Democrats are the party broke up

1621
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,752
Potater Jackson was a Democrat

1622
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,032
He almost

1623
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:24,800
Destroyed the entire

1624
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,640
Stupid and short-sighted Petty accent

1625
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:34,784
He is one of if not the worst I mean

1626
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:39,904
It's to Andrews in the running for president has

1627
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,696
I will tell you that right now

1628
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,192
Yu-Gi-Oh

1629
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:55,520
Hell yeah

1630
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,080
Centralized

1631
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,152
He was supposed to

1632
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,176
Renewing the charter

1633
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,224
Expire when

1634
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,296
Consequences of his actions

1635
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:16,512
Proves the need for those Bank more than the guy who

1636
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:23,424
C13 Creighton Federal Reserve

1637
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,496
I mean

1638
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,032
Alex is also saying

1639
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,824
There are multiple

1640
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,360
Bank agents

1641
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:33,152
The try to assassinate

1642
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,320
Yeah but he

1643
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:46,720
There's one guy who attempted

1644
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:53,120
I love that the other f****** good was a minor fight Jackson got into it

1645
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,400
Press charges over

1646
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,360
Richard Lawrence

1647
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:08,736
Lawrence born in England

1648
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,528
Which I get most

1649
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,296
The crown

1650
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:21,280
To lead and other chemicals in the paint of the day

1651
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,304
Decline

1652
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,096
As he reached the age of 30 and on

1653
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:30,752
England only to return a month later

1654
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,056
But how we couldn't go

1655
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:35,104
The first time he complained it was

1656
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:39,200
Second time the story was much more

1657
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:41,248
He been in Philadelphia for a

1658
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,832
The US government didn't approve of

1659
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,856
England

1660
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:49,440
Amedia read several articles in the Philadelphia newspaper

1661
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:52,000
Critical of his travel plans and character

1662
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,048
Richard quit his job

1663
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,888
He told them that he was Richard

1664
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:01,472
The third the king of England to a died 380 years earlier

1665
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:12,224
And how that would not make

1666
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:12,992
Money in issue

1667
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:13,760
Still

1668
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,000
Send a letter

1669
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,048
Because Richard

1670
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,072
Richard

1671
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:33,728
Write for reasons that aren't entirely clear.

1672
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,520
Vetoing of the Second Bank of the United

1673
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,056
Made it impossible for

1674
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,848
To collect the money he was owed on the

1675
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,408
He reasoned that if he killed Jack

1676
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,944
Martin van Buren

1677
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,736
Compressor heat setups

1678
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,016
And just like that

1679
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:49,856
He gets all the reasoning that he use

1680
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:50,880
And that's what Alex

1681
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:54,720
I am fine with that

1682
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:58,048
At this point Richard started dressing up like British royal

1683
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:04,960
Began to appear

1684
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:05,984
Is always

1685
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,032
Is there

1686
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,592
Much more

1687
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:11,360
Familiar with

1688
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:14,176
US Capitol

1689
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:14,944
Didn't fire

1690
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:17,504
Hold up his back backup pistol

1691
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:21,088
As this

1692
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:22,880
Beating Richard the third with his Cane

1693
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:26,720
Richard was by the crowd which included

1694
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:33,888
Davy Crockett Hollywood

1695
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:39,776
You going to face trial that area

1696
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:46,176
What is where was none other than France

1697
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,040
Richard was found in his

1698
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:53,600
By virtue of

1699
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,136
Until his death 26 years later

1700
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:57,184
In the aftermath of the assassination

1701
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,000
Really to find a reason for it

1702
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,792
Rumors spread that he was working for the

1703
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,328
Proponents of the second

1704
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,632
A theory that literally had

1705
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,400
No proof

1706
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:08,192
No backing and evidence at all

1707
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:10,752
In a mirrored by at least

1708
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,776
1 president

1709
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,848
Conspiracy theories

1710
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:15,616
Has it helped

1711
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,640
Can look heroic

1712
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,664
Demonized

1713
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:21,248
So it was crazy

1714
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:24,320
And you're actually talking about entertainment

1715
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:27,136
He's a crazy dude

1716
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:36,096
Story that you already know I feel like

1717
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,376
I felt like

1718
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:39,168
You know what it is on this show

1719
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,192
Your reaction

1720
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:42,496
Sincerity

1721
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,520
That you worked

1722
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:48,896
Surprised

1723
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,176
Cuz you weren't responding

1724
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:54,528
Delighted

1725
01:36:55,808 --> 01:37:00,672
I think it was like at least a couple of years ago a friend of the show

1726
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,976
Sent me this video

1727
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,768
Of somebody who is done

1728
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,840
Essentially my Andrew Jackson B

1729
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,376
On his album

1730
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:12,704
Oh no it what we had

1731
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,920
Define Allina does his line for line what I say

1732
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:22,944
Which is that

1733
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,016
The Secret Service

1734
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:28,064
Keep the president from being assassinated

1735
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,136
They kept the president from assassinated

1736
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:37,536
Because that was a good line

1737
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:45,728
B*******

1738
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:53,152
Gerald Celente

1739
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,432
It was something that Abraham

1740
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:58,016
Lincoln War

1741
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,320
Okay

1742
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:05,440
The money Powers Prey Upon the nation in times

1743
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,280
X

1744
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:11,840
Is mulch

1745
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:13,120
Despotic

1746
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:15,936
What is silento

1747
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:16,704
Receipt

1748
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:17,984
More selfie

1749
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,008
Iraq

1750
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,080
Sing in the near future of Christ

1751
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:22,848
Approaching

1752
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,408
Cause

1753
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,944
To tremble

1754
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,224
Safety of Mike

1755
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:30,784
Corporation

1756
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,368
Pennyroyal corruption

1757
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,928
And the money power of the

1758
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
Tree

1759
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:44,352
Will endeavor to prolong its range

1760
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,424
In a few hands

1761
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,472
And the Republic

1762
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,032
Wall Street

1763
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,312
Is killed

1764
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:59,968
Slavery

1765
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:04,064
Valenti's argument for Ham Lincoln was a fast

1766
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:11,232
That's a fact

1767
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,304
Utility

1768
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,144
Select Abraham Lincoln collected works

1769
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,424
You can't find that quote

1770
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,984
Twenty years after Lincoln

1771
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,800
1896 presidential

1772
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:31,712
Release a bogus letter about nefarious forces trying to meddle in the economy during the 1896 election

1773
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,784
It's hard to say for sure but one pretty strong

1774
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,368
Is that the gold standard was one of the top issues in that election Williams

1775
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:42,208
Democratic nominee

1776
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,256
At the Democratic National

1777
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,584
It makes this would be an issue

1778
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:49,632
Comeback

1779
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,912
And everybody likes

1780
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:53,984
To try and take historical heroes and pretend they said

1781
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,008
Things

1782
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,544
Predicted

1783
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,080
Died supported their cause

1784
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:01,920
Hitler said that

1785
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:02,688
In the past

1786
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,480
Alex Jones and his crew used

1787
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,784
Completely fabricated quotes on a regular

1788
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:09,088
Almost everything

1789
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:10,880
It was nonsense

1790
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:13,440
That's definitely

1791
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:18,816
But in this case they might have a slightly better argument

1792
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:19,840
Then impact

1793
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,888
They just don't know

1794
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:25,472
Because in 1950 Archer HR release the Lincoln in Psych

1795
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,288
Wikipedia which purported to be a One-Stop shop for all things

1796
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:31,104
The problem is

1797
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,640
The terms authenticating

1798
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:33,664
He put in the

1799
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:37,504
The letter that this quote comes from in that encyclopedia

1800
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,784
A letter supposedly

1801
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,320
The colonel William FL

1802
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,112
But historians and researchers are

1803
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:43,648
Clearly determined that letter was

1804
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:46,720
It was far from the only example of the lack of

1805
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:47,488
Completion ism

1806
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,072
It's not being as well put together resource for

1807
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:51,840
Information

1808
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:57,472
But I could see Gerald Celente or Alex seen that book called The Lincoln encyclopedia

1809
01:40:57,984 --> 01:41:00,288
Any further steps

1810
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,592
Tear

1811
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,384
You can have credit

1812
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,920
You're still wrong

1813
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,248
Church

1814
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:12,832
Whatever I get where you coming from you're not you're not active

1815
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:13,600
You're not an act

1816
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,880
Participant

1817
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:30,752
Unpopular

1818
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,544
You seen as helping Banks

1819
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:35,360
We just had a shot of

1820
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,688
From their beds

1821
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,480
I promise you I guess

1822
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,808
Open syllable

1823
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:49,696
World progress

1824
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,720
Assassination

1825
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,280
And the others

1826
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,328
Beginning of the Vietnam

1827
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:58,912
McKenzie

1828
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:05,312
That is now

1829
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:07,872
No longer

1830
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:08,896
ProgressBook

1831
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:16,832
The military-industrial complex has taken over the country along with the walls

1832
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,600
Street game

1833
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,648
If you look also at the

1834
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,928
People that Obama has

1835
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:21,696
Put on his

1836
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:24,512
It's all walls

1837
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,816
It's government of Wall Street by Wall Street

1838
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:27,840
Fort walls

1839
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:30,144
Not wrong

1840
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:30,912
Israel

1841
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,240
From Silicon Valley

1842
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,776
Nobody from

1843
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:36,544
Okay well yeah

1844
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,568
Defense

1845
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,104
No women

1846
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,640
No retirees

1847
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,408
Small business

1848
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,176
Nothing

1849
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:46,016
People who have a voice in Obama's

1850
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,064
Bar Wall Street

1851
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,088
Finance

1852
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:51,392
That's all there is nobody else

1853
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,440
Under Obama

1854
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:54,464
The most extreme

1855
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,232
Wall Street

1856
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:03,168
A little bit

1857
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,776
It's important to recognize like I'm old

1858
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:09,312
When I did a lot of his research

1859
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:13,664
Basically use the information that would be available

1860
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:26,720
Substantiv claims I tried to limit myself to available before March 2000

1861
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,488
Fair Shake

1862
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:30,048
They do not deserve

1863
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:35,936
You know all of these

1864
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:51,552
His first claim their that laundry list

1865
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:58,464
Heavy Industries pretty range usually means steel mills that sort of thing

1866
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,256
Uninvolved incense contract and arrows

1867
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,280
Space work

1868
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:04,096
In February 2009 Obama appointed

1869
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,424
Senior advisor to the Secretary of Treasury

1870
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,728
Previously Ron Blum

1871
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:10,496
Ben

1872
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,544
In both the Arenas of Labor Relations

1873
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,616
Special Assistant

1874
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:17,152
The president of the United States

Representative

1876
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,040
Industry in there at least one

1877
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:24,064
So I know that that

1878
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:24,832
Famous Subs

1879
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,952
Miller might be active

1880
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:35,072
Seem like it doesn't seem like I can't I can't find any autoexec you

1881
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,400
Important

1882
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,680
Advisors early on

1883
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,704
Which considering

1884
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,520
Where is

1885
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:49,920
General Motors and Chrysler

1886
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:55,296
The time to have Auto executive you know what I mean

1887
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,392
Did I don't know

1888
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,208
I'm going to give him a mic with

1889
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:02,976
You know

1890
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:05,792
Display the kernel

1891
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:08,352
Boil

1892
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,376
This one makes no sense

1893
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,312
Queens of England

1894
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,080
The Denmark

1895
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,480
Complained

1896
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:28,320
About if it wasn't

1897
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,112
Canelo fight

1898
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,416
I'm not sure what it is

1899
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,440
Is big wild

1900
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:35,744
Defense secretary Robert Gates

1901
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,512
Drilling which is

1902
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:38,816
The company involved in offshore oil rigs

1903
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,096
So it doesn't really seem

1904
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:43,680
Also National Security advisor

1905
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:44,704
Directors for Chevron

1906
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:52,896
There's nobody from defense such as other claim is next one that's Ludacris the aforementioned Robert Gates

1907
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:55,200
Who's the Secretary of Defense under George W bush

1908
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,736
What do you agree with Mr nada

1909
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,016
How does a job

1910
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:58,784
Which I do

1911
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:01,600
Experience

1912
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,440
This documentary

1913
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,208

1914
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,000

01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:15,424
By the way he specifically allowed to stay on in order to give that appearance

1917
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:19,776
Within that situation

1918
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:22,080
Exactly

1919
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:25,152
Jeff said he says there's nobody from labor

1920
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:28,992
The aforementioned Ron Bloom at a previous career in labor unions

1921

Obama Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis had a career in the House of Representatives

1923
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,952

01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:40,768
She's the only member of Congress on the board of the America

1925
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:41,792

Approach Union organization that is

1927
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,632

And that's not even

1937
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:10,976
Complete list is just another example of

1938
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,048
Nothing

1939
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,584
There's no retirees

1940
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,376
Punt on this one

1941
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:25,312
I don't think it's necessarily one of you trademark signs of a hell

1942
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:26,592
Healthy Administration that there's

1943

A guy who came out of retirement

1944
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:34,272
I don't want those people there

1945
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:38,368
Yeah I don't I don't know what anybody who's not invested in the future

1946
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:41,440
No small

1947
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:43,488
Exactly what your definition

1948
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,512
Small business

Setting up their own private practice

1952
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,944
Not always

1953
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:03,968
Is exactly the same

1954
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,272
It's pretty similar

1955
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,576
Also truck

1956
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:13,440

Implicated as a nice

1959
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,176
Executive at Google

1960
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:36,736
Obama's director of the office of Social innovation

1961
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,760

The philanthropy sex

1964
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,672
Google

1965
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:49,024
A person out that this claim is also

1966
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:50,048
Not true

1967
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:52,096
Is claimed that Obama's administration

1968
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:01,312
People who actually have involvement in Wall Street

1969
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:02,592
There weren't that many

1970
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:06,944
They're only like three or four people that you can make an argument out of

1971
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,224
The 22 cabinet

1972
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,528
Positions that are the official

1973
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:14,368
I said have any real history in

1974
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,184
Would go on to have her

1975
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:17,952
History

1976
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,744
Sure sure

1977
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:22,816
I'm debating

1978
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:23,840
Right right

1979
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:26,144
You look at other

1980
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:26,912
Ministrations

1981
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:28,704
You look at like Trump Administration

1982
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:33,312
Steve mnuchin Gary Cohn and James Donovan

1983
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:34,080
Executive

1984
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:34,848
Who

1985
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:35,872
Had positions that were

1986
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:36,640
Specifically

1987
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:38,688
Areas that had to do with

1988
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,224
Phoenix Financial

1989
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:41,504
Century

1990
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,064
George W bush

1991
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,368
People from Ball Street

1992
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:50,464
This is not really I mean sure we could all be idealistic and say like

1993
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,488
Be great if there wasn't

1994
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:54,304
But to say that there's some sort of a

1995
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,328
The most

1996
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:58,144
Aggressively Wall Street cabinet ever is

1997
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:58,912
Is Ludacris

1998
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:05,568
Dino's when fascism

1999
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,848
Apparently that's nice

2000
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:10,944
He knows whenever he's

2001
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:11,712
Onslaught

2002
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:14,784
Play Eminem

2003
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,320
Hell yeah

2004
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,368
Pick up Matthew Moore

2005
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:22,208
12 minutes

2006
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:25,280
54 seconds

2007
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,304
Before his death

2008
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:28,352
President Woodrow Wilson apologize

2009
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,376
Republic

2010
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,400
Regret

2011
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:33,216
My group of International Bank

2012
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:35,776
And the country's Financial system in fall

2013
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:40,384
Iron grip

2014
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:43,200
Woodrow Wilson was one of the biggest

2015
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:45,504
Piece of s*** president

2016
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:53,184
He didn't he didn't apologize

2017
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:57,024
The Federal Reserve propagandists

2018
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,048
You justify that sort of

2019
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,328
Claiming that narrative

2020
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,096
Is as follows

2021
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,424
Industrial nation is controlled by a system

2022
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,448
Democratic

2023
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:05,728
My credit is privately

2024
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:09,568
And all our activities are in the hands

2025
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,848
Fu man who is Iraq

2026
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:11,616
To be honest

2027
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:12,896
Republican

2028
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:15,968
Are necessarily concentrated upon the great undertaking

2029
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:17,760
In which their own money is involved

2030
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:21,600
Chill and check

2031
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:23,392
And destroy the genuine economic

2032
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:24,160
Freedom

2033
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:26,464
We've come to be one of the worst rule

2034
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,232
One of the most

2035
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:30,304
Completely controlled and dominated governments in the Civilized world

2036
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:34,656
No longer government by free opinion no longer government by conviction in the

2037
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:38,752
Small group of dominant

2038
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,800
That's the quote that Alex's

2039
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,336
To justify the sergeant

2040
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,640
Woodrow Wilson apologize

2041
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,920
Just before his death

2042
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:46,688
About

2043
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:49,248
The Federal Reserve

2044
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,296
Problem

2045
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:55,648
Is it busy

2046
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:58,464
Of Woodrow Wilson's writing combined to give the impression

2047
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,232
But this was

2048
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,000
What he was saying

2049
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:01,536
The first paragraph

2050
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:04,608
A speech that he gave at the Democratic Club in Harrisburg PA

2051
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:06,144
On

2052
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,424
19

2053
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:09,984
And the other was from a book he wrote called the

2054
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:10,752
Published

2055
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:11,520
1813

2056
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:14,848
Both of these passages were written before the Federal

2057
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:15,616
December 9th

2058
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,664
Have nothing to do with the effect

2059
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,432
To the Fed

2060
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:22,784
Information is demonstrably fraudulent

2061
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:27,648
Began making the rounds

2062
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:28,416
The 1950

2063
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:30,208
Has the Cold War got moving

2064
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:34,048
Like Alex Jones espiritual

2065
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:36,864
Godfather

2066
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:42,240
So the Phyllis Schlafly is of the world

2067
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,776
And this narrative was cracked

2068
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:49,152
Regretted creating the Federal Reserve

2069
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:50,176
Couldn't events

2070
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,224
Before the Federal Reserve

2071
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,832
Also also Woodrow Wilson

2072
01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:00,160
Everybody who is black

2073
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,184
To hide

2074
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,512
Woodrow Wilson

2075
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:07,584
A giant piece of

2076
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:14,496
Better president

2077
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,384
He's knowing

2078
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:23,456
You got to give

2079
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:33,184
I know I don't be the most racist president

2080
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,464
The Civil War

2081
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:36,256
You mean that Lincoln

2082
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:43,936
I think they're very worth

2083
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,984
Pointing finger

2084
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:47,008
Nicole

2085
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:50,080
In terms of Alex's claims

2086
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:51,104
All that's important is

2087
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:51,872
Alex

2088
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:52,896
Just regurgitating

2089
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:53,664
2:02

2090
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,968
Images Frankenstein monster together by 9

2091
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,016
250g communist propaganda

2092
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:01,856
The Federal Reserve

2093
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:03,648
Thanks

2094
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:07,232
No I got to work to you

2095
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:20,800
Potential for the day

2096
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:22,080
The fastest rising

2097
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:22,848
Misplaced power

2098
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:23,872
Exist

2099
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:24,896
And will persist

2100
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:35,136
That the military-industrial complex was taking over the country

2101
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:39,232
President Eisenhower's prophetic warning concerning the threat posed

2102
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:42,304
Industrial complex

2103
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,912
What happened to John F Kennedy

2104
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,032
Expected to be

2105
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,312
A puppet it was.

2106
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:54,336
You pop it

2107
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:58,688
Republic

2108
01:54:58,944 --> 01:54:59,712
Speculator

2109
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:01,760
Guaranteed

2110
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:08,160
Establishment

2111
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:11,744
Discovered

2112
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:14,304
Bad back though

2113
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:19,936
Having a space probe

2114
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:23,264
Making deals paper I started before him

2115
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,568
What about the secret space program

2116
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,920
111 10

2117
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,712
Shine by president

2118
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:32,992
Began the process

2119
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:41,184
Pulling the troops out of Vietnam

2120
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:45,792
Alex

2121
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:48,608
Because he signed

2122
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:50,144
Executive order

2123
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,984
That would begin the process of eliminating

2124
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:58,080
Now that executive order wouldn't

2125
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:01,920
Fantastic example

2126
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:03,456
Even about the topic

2127
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:04,224
He's made his bread

2128
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:08,832
Frankly this is just another example of Alex parroting conspiracy theories

2129
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:11,136
Propagated

2130
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,416
In this case

2131
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:15,488
He's just repeating things that were written in gym bars

2132
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:17,024
Conspiracy Theory Book Crossfire

2133
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:22,400
Executive order 110

2134
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:27,008
I first need to explain to you Public Law 280 8-36

2135
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,800
Which is what the executive order eggs

2136
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:30,336
To be a compliment

2137
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,408
In 1961 President Kennedy realized

2138
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:36,736
The demand for silver to be used in industrial industrial metal

2139
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,016
With increasing at a rate

2140
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:41,600
Then the prices enjoyed at

2141
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:42,368
As a currency

2142
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:45,440
Emerging Markets like microchips nuclear reactors

2143
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:48,000
Medical applications of conductors world

2144
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:50,304
Silver approximately 80 /

2145
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,840
Percent drop in the United States

2146
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:52,864
XS silver

2147
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,144
Noticing

2148
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,448
This could be a problem can be called on Congress to

2149
01:56:57,216 --> 01:57:02,336
Status of silver as a metal for which

2150
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:04,384
There is an expanded industrial demand

2151
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:06,176
Except for its using coins

2152
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:08,224
Silver serves no useful monetary

2153
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:11,552
I recommend authorization for the Federal Reserve System

2154
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:12,320
The issue notes

2155
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:14,112
In denominations of $1

2156
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:17,184
So as to make possible the gradual withdrawal of silver certificate

2157
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,464
From circulation

2158
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:19,488
And the use of silver

2159
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:21,536
Released from coinage

2160
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:22,304
Purposes

2161
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:24,608
Congress to take prompt action

2162
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:27,424
So what do you think about

2163
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:29,984
So

2164
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:31,264
That's the quote

2165
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,032
They used to

2166
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:33,312
To say that he was trying to

2167
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:35,616
Destroy the Fred

2168
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:38,176
Used to urge Congress to enact

2169
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:39,456
Public Law 88

2170
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:40,224
36

2171
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:41,248
Which

2172
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,320
So if you

2173
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:45,344
If you

2174
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:49,440
Shut down silver

2175
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:50,720
As occurring

2176
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:52,256
Then

2177
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,328
The Federal Reserve disappears

2178
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:58,144
Nono Alakazam

2179
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,680
This is just a coincidence

2180
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:13,504
Isn't that

2181
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:18,112
Response Congress passed hr5383

2182
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:19,648
53 with large majority

2183
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:24,256
Become public law 8836 effective

2184
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:26,048
Repealing the Silver Purchase Act

2185
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:29,376
Republiclaw 8836

2186
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:33,728
The government

2187
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,008
One of the element

2188
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:40,128
Federal Reserve the authority to issue dollar bill

2189
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:44,224
$1 bills were originally released in 1920

2190
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,272
Change the silver dollar

2191
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:50,880
The public law and the ensuing executive order

2192
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:52,928
The Federal Reserve actually expanded its

2193
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:53,696
Responsibility

2194
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:54,464
As far as

2195
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,000
Concerned

2196
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:57,536
Aldi executive order did

2197
01:58:57,792 --> 01:59:00,096
Was the treasury Department to issue silver

2198
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,632
In the interim

2199
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:03,168
. while the transition

2200
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:03,936
What's happening

2201
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:10,336
Alex's. Relies on the idea that executive order 1110

2202
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,104
Print money

2203
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:12,128
The Federal Reserve

2204
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,152
And give that power to

2205
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:15,712
The treasury the closer look at the order itself

2206
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:16,736
As well as the context

2207
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:20,064
But that's the opposite of what it did

2208
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,856
There's no way these acts

2209
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:26,208
Could justify an argument that the Federal Reserve was mad at JFK about

2210
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,536
It's complete

2211
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:34,144
And this is going to

2212
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:34,912
Frias

2213
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:36,960
From having to deal with Alex

2214
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:38,496
Quoting subsections

2215
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:44,128
And it's all because of 1111

2216
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:47,456
We have to name all bills

2217
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:48,224
In binary

2218
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:50,272
Okay so you can just stay the night

2219
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:51,552
Whatever whatever

2220
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:53,600
So you have to say it

2221
01:59:54,624 --> 02:00:00,000
What

2222
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:04,608
110 00010001

2223
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:08,704
Betrayal watch Revolution

2224
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:15,360
Have you heard about HR one-woman 000 you can just be like

2225
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:19,712
Trackdown

2226
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:22,528
Really confused

2227
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,552
Barcodes

2228
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:34,048
Vietnam

2229
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:35,584
The time he was in office.

2230
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:40,448
People

2231
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:49,920
I don't see that as a good argument and he says there is that he was trying to make real

2232
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:51,200
Civil rights

2233
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:53,760
I don't know

2234
02:00:54,528 --> 02:01:00,672
Somewhat but I don't know what real civil rights mean civil rights

2235
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:05,536
It's a problem

2236
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:08,352
Understand

2237
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:14,752
What is Alex divinest Euro civil rights test

2238
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:16,800
The right to vote or whatever it is

2239
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:25,248
Real civil rights

2240
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:28,064
Is making sure

2241
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:33,952
Change

2242
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:38,048
You can have

2243
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:41,376
Fundamentally systemically racist states bordering

2244
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:42,144
Statesville

2245
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:47,264
Everyone like TiVo

2246
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,616
The last time you had an actual

2247
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:53,152
Was

2248
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:57,504
Indecisive

2249
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:02,880
Later Alex

2250
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:05,440
Every president

2251
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:07,232
Has been controlled by

2252
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:09,280
So if

2253
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:12,352
If you use those two

2254
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:15,936
Give me like not controlled by

2255
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:17,984
Definitely not Jews Banker

2256
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:20,032
That's what he say

2257
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:24,384
International finance auto parts

2258
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:32,576
I think he's a charlatan

2259
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:33,344
Princeton

2260
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:37,696
Get a Fulbright scholarship to Italy and then get a PhD

2261
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:38,976
Just

2262
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:41,024
Without some sort of

2263
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:46,400
That's possible

2264
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:50,496
Next thing you know everyone's going to be posting messages call Webster Tarpley

2265
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:51,520
Larry Nichols

2266
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,104
You f****** nuts

2267
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:56,640
Okay cool

2268
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:06,624
I just think there's an interesting Dynamic going on where Webster Tarpley saying

2269
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:11,744
In-N-Out is on Words later I guess

2270
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:12,512
Coolidge

2271
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:13,536
Was the last real president

2272
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:17,888
Hooverwood

2273
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:20,704
Ser don't know how to make

2274
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,752
Like there should be some sort of like

2275
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:26,336
I don't know how to

2276
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:29,152
The talk or think about presidential history

2277
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,176
Without

2278
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,736
Thinking that centers on one

2279
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:35,808
1 president

2280
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,416
Right

2281
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:46,816
That doesn't make any f****** sense at all and it doesn't even make sense if you take the entire picture of his

2282
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:51,168
Which has to take into context the presidency before

2283
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:53,984
Like you shouldn't be allowed to

2284
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:02,688
Should have restricted access to history

2285
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:08,576
Maybe

2286
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,648
Pedaling

2287
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:14,208
Talk about

2288
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:19,072
Nixon expanded the Vietnam War

2289
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:22,144
Channel in order to get reelected

2290
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:24,704
He got hundreds of thousands upon

2291
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:31,104
The people killed

2292
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:36,224
People in the likes of Alex Jone

2293
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:39,552
The intellectuals fear of his

2294
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:41,088
His influences

2295
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:49,024
Fortunately most of them supported George Wallace

2296
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:53,376
It's not better

2297
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:01,568
Good-news-bad-news

2298
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:04,640
Yeah I think I think there is

2299
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:07,712
Responsibility that

2300
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:14,112
People like this

2301
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:15,392
Call Ted

2302
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:18,208
The last real president

2303
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,232
What do you mean

2304
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:22,048
What does that mean

2305
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:27,424
Specificity

2306
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:31,264
It's the same thing with saying that was Triple the federal government

2307
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,568
You skate by on these

2308
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,616
These are the vague Notions like

2309
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:40,736
Are you trick a lot of people

2310
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:42,272
Fraudulent narrative

2311
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:50,976
I guess that's what I guess it's what you do when you call

2312
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:56,608
Here's Jeff.

2313
02:05:56,864 --> 02:06:00,704
Also apparently

2314
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:03,776
Burgerville

2315
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:04,800
It has

2316
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:18,112
Abraham Zapruder

2317
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:24,768
The future US presidents

2318
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:29,120
Back

2319
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:31,680
And to the left John Fitzgerald Kennedy

2320
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:34,240
Thanks for using this full metal name

2321
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:37,312
Until the globalist removed from Power

2322
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:39,104
You will never have another real one

2323
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:46,272
Is a puppet

2324
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:47,552
Puppet

2325
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:49,856
Play pop it pop it

2326
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:55,232
When he's obviously been chosen

2327
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:07,776
Miami Subs

2328
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:10,848
Krs-1

2329
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,152
It's not just knowing.

2330
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:20,320
It's so funny

2331
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:27,488
You can't go from Webster Tarpley saying that Obama is giving

2332
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,536
International Airport

2333
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:35,936
Episode

2334
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:43,872
Ksr1 I like that

2335
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:45,408
6 or 78

2336
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:48,736
Has been a strong voice

2337
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:55,648
What makes

2338
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:57,952
Now means nothing

2339
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:12,544
Arms crossed on the brink of revolution

2340
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:13,824
Does that mean

2341
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:15,872
You know what

2342
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:19,968
There is something of an argument to be made that

2343
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:26,112
I mean had the financial crisis been allowed to

2344
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:29,440
Growing

2345
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:31,232
Depression that it could have become

2346
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,256
Had we not

2347
02:08:32,512 --> 02:08:33,024
Stimulus package

2348
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,560
Which somehow there again

2349
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:44,800
Maybe you could have you could say you better make an argument

2350
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:51,200
If elected it passes the same as unlikely

2351
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:54,272
You don't like a puppet of the finance oligarchs

2352
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:59,392
And whatever

2353
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,160
To win

2354
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:02,464
Then he would have passed the stimulus bill

2355
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:05,024
Because that's what the globalist want them to do

2356
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:07,840
The argument is so f****** stupid

2357
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:22,944
Although although I do like his boy

2358
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:25,248
If you

2359
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:31,392
Hold on

2360
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:37,024
With the the election of Obama and everybody kind of leaning back

2361
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:37,792
Saying

2362
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:44,192
Lead to the Republicans taking over literally every state government

2363
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:48,544
The brink of a revolution

2364
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:49,568
Self

2365
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:54,176
Kara's ones better

2366
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:55,712
Forecast

2367
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:58,272
Forecast

2368
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:06,464
Password is writing songs

2369
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,512
Really good at writing

2370
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:13,888
Freestyle

2371
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:18,240
The money

2372
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:19,264
They give him the Buns

2373
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:21,056
Fraud

2374
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:23,104
The media whores

2375
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:24,128
They give him going

2376
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:25,664
Elected official

2377
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,224
To put people in jail

2378
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:28,992
Criticized

2379
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:30,272
In public

2380
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:32,576
All of this is the month of corgis

2381
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:37,440
Oxymoron

2382
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:38,208
More of a puppy

2383
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,512
Even more of a

2384
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,072
Is the maximum

2385
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:46,656
Jimmy Carter

2386
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:47,680
They put a black

2387
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:52,544
Space from the new world Carter was a puppet I don't care

2388
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:58,944
I honestly don't give a

2389
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:04,832
Hey Jimmy Carter was a puppet

2390
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:05,600
Peanut sauce

2391
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:08,160
Peanut the puppet

2392
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:11,232
Mr. puppet would be a wonderful

2393
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:14,816
You don't say

2394
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:17,120
Suppressor

2395
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:19,424
Complex

2396
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:21,984
It's cellphone by the International Bank

2397
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:26,848
This is a very triangle heavy traffic right now

2398
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:43,744
Power structure

2399
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:49,376
System of world government

2400
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:50,912
Pyramid around the globe

2401
02:11:52,448 --> 02:11:55,776
Alex is reporting that in

2402
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:57,824
On the perfect

2403
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:01,152
Graphic

2404
02:12:02,944 --> 02:12:06,016
This is a perfect

2405
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:07,296
There is a graphic

2406
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:08,576
When the app

2407
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:21,120
Before this graphic came up Alex

2408
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:26,752
Secret meeting David Rockefeller Define the New World Order

2409
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:32,896
Shark special it raises the question

2410
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:37,760
It should come as no surprise Abraham Lincoln

2411
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:41,600
Recording or unofficial transcript

2412
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:43,392
It comes from Daniel estulin

2413
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:45,952
Respect someone told him

2414
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:46,976
How did Rockefeller

2415
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:51,584
We got deep into Daniel estulin sourcing problems back when we covered

2416
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:53,120
And we learned

2417
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:56,192
An expert on Bilderberg

2418
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:03,360
Repetitive

2419
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:04,128
All over again

2420
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:07,456
Daniel estulin is full of s*** unless this quote

2421
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:09,760
Be in any way since it's not

2422
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:10,528
Worth thinking

2423
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:12,064
Much like building a

2424
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:15,904
Injury

2425
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:16,928
In that clip

2426
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:21,024
Alex said that it was the 1991 Bilderberg conference in Avion

2427
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:25,376
The 1991 Bilderberg conference was in Baden-Baden Germany

2428
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:27,168
To confer

2429
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:29,216
Lebanon

2430
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:30,752
Seems like you should know that

2431
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:36,896
Yeah you know I'm detail normal documentary

2432
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:37,920
I be like

2433
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:39,712
Okay you f***** up

2434
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:40,736
That happened

2435
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:42,784
You should know

2436
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:44,320
Documentary

2437
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:45,344
F*** off

2438
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:53,280
F****** Jew going to make an argument entirely based around the globalists and Bilderberg being the most horrible thing

2439
02:13:57,632 --> 02:14:01,472
I have specific information about that this Bilderberg conference

2440
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:03,008
Yeah I can't get basic

2441
02:14:03,264 --> 02:14:06,080
Exact right

2442
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:06,848
Fair enough

2443
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:11,968
The secret conference is always where it was going to be the next

2444
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:15,296
But the real conference

2445
02:14:15,552 --> 02:14:20,416
It's like it's like the Montreal

2446
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:27,072
I will gladly switch locations for the beach

2447
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:31,680
Go to warm up a boiled dumpling

2448
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:35,520
National stuff

2449
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:37,312
Being deliberately destroyed

2450
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:41,664
After years of denial

2451
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:43,968
The media and the elite themselves

2452
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:45,760
Proudly announce

2453
02:14:46,272 --> 02:14:47,296
That not only

2454
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,576
World government

2455
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:49,856
What is the answer

2456
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:51,392
To the financial crisis

2457
02:14:56,512 --> 02:15:00,096
Hey everybody is dead

2458
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:00,864

First episode here

2462
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,008
We got a cliffhanger

2463
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:09,312
Did the media come out and Save

2464
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:13,408
Is Alex.

2465
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:14,176
Talking about something

2466
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:14,944
Real or is it

2467
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:15,712
Is yet another

2468
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:17,248

Underscore

Which is really wear a lot of

2477
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,752
The real action goes on into

2478
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:40,544
I'm really terrible at

2479
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:41,312
Keeping

What's up

2485
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:52,576
The other place

2486
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:56,160
Real bad at

2487
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,024
Michelle hope you're enjoying it

2488
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:03,840
Redwood back for part 2

2489
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:04,864
Of The Obama Deception

2490
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:05,632
Coverage

2491
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:06,912
Tomorrow in

2492
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:07,680
And it just gets

2493
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:08,960
You're in juicier

2494
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:09,984
By that

2495
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:11,264
I lose

2496
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,544
My patience with this.

2497
02:16:13,568 --> 02:16:14,336
As it goes on

2498
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:20,992
Just doing a little

2499
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:22,272
Bumper here

2500
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:23,552
Has anybody to referee

2501
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:26,112
I'm the only person

2502
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:29,184
Anybody find a one guy who has

2503
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:30,720
Technically

2504
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:32,256
Theoretically it's guilt

2505
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:34,048
And I forgot who goes by

2506
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:41,216
Alex

2507
02:16:41,472 --> 02:16:43,264
In color
