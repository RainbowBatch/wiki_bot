Streaking

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
Something that you probably do while drunk enough time.

6
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,160
Remember it

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:34,560
That's not what we talked about

8
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,192

We've been in the world of Project Camelot

14
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,344
So that is what we going over today

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,928
I like to give a shout out

16
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952

00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,856
I'm a policy wonk

25
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
We appreciate it oh so very much

26
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,048
So Caleb you are now a technocrat

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
Don't get mad until your brilliant someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
Palatka

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
I don't want

30
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,272

Sports bar website

33
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:14,144
I want to see real quick Rogan episode Iowa's

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
I was editing

35
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,496
Took forever

36
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,384
Got into a little bit of an argument with someone trying to f*** with me and

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Twitter

38
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
I got really excited about it in the right headspace to be like

39
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,928
The actual interaction and then like

40
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
I started to see you like

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
Why haven't I

42
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Hookahs.

43
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,616
With social media and stuff like that I just don't really care about it all weekend early post whenever

44
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,944
Off all social media

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
The future

46
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:06,112
Like what people

47
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,696
Completely

48
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
Happens to me every now and again I got really excited about the possibilities

49
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,496
I'm going to be on this posting all the time I started following some listeners who was suggesting that I

50
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:31,712
But I've never go to be posting stuff not caring about Twitter at all but

51
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
Windows are where I thought like I'm following I'm going to build this account

52
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,488
It went so fast

53
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
Yeah remember you are G

54
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,288
Ram

55
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:01,920
That is a Liquors look like

56
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
Interact

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
Yeah

58
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,064
Social media presence visual brand Ali

59
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
F*** you this soon as I wake up

60
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
What were you think

61
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,720
The reason I got off Twitter was because it was

62
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
Wow you're really funny

63
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,655
Let me follow you on Twitter on Facebook and on Instagram

64
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
I don't really

65
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:31,359
Do that he's like as like weird

66
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
I think I've ever wanted to do

67
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:38,271
I just deleted everything that night yeah so anyway that's to say

68
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:43,135
That's just expect that I'm jumping in and actually going to

69
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
Probably

70
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,535
Probably not he's got this project

71
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,887
This is an episode where Carrie sits down with a gentleman by the name of

72
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
Jer subok

73
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
Alright

74
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,823
He's a bit of a yeah I don't know how to phrase this

75
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
He believes

76
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,247
That he has decoded a universal language behind all language

77
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Okay

78
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,343
And that the aliens are f****** with us through our line

79
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,927
That's kind of his big promise

80
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
I think that's the plot of snow crash

81
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,071
I think it's the plot of a number of things

82
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Pierre subok

83
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
Man that's a great man

84
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
Eclipse

85
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,959
Consultant

86
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
For Ridley Scott

87
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,079
I can find a citation on that other than

88
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,479
His own website was written with his input

89
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,807
Has been involved with

90
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
On my radar is

91
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
I believe

92
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
I don't give a s***

93
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
Hi everyone I'm Kerry Cassidy

94
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,583
Project Camelot and very happy

95
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Today

96
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,655
I have a fascinating guess

97
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
His name is

98
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
The Box

99
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,775
And I we are going to be talking about

100
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,567
Holographic

101
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,639
And the secret

102
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,455
Hidden alien code in language

103
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
Very exciting

104
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:17,087
There is a secret alien I like it find out

105
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,183
How would it even work

106
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,023
I would say that it's mostly involving snakes and words that have to do with snakes

107
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,191
I wasn't the whole thing and I don't know I think you just doesn't understand

108
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,079
Bring up repeatedly

109
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Big question

110
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Can he speak

111
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
We in language

112
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,503
Like

113
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,319
Because of

114
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
Speak of f****** a lot

115
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
He doesn't like Carrie get many words and you being very rude

116
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
Peter jumps

117
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Into the proceedings

118
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,423
And he's going to lift off

119
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,775
Strike you it sounded like they're relevant to linguistics

120
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
I studied theology at a level

121
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
I Got a Name

122
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
Theology a level

123
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,015
So real quick just because we're in the United States grew up in England

124
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
I still think he's French space-based

125
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
A thing which

126
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Might be a bias on my part

127
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
I'm going to leave it alone

128
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
A-level education is done in high school

129
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
It's a part of college prep course work somewhere

130
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
Equivalent to but not the same thing is

131
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
By AP classes

132
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
The G-Class in 80 level

133
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:40,287
It sounds like

134
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
I'm happy about that I'm sure his mom like that on the break card but

135
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,271
High school so I can tell you very certainly

136
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Pieris

137
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:57,183
Your only contact like really with formal education in theology which isn't even linguistics

138
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
I got some

139
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,631
Opportunity informally to go to office today theology

140
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,543
By teaching you a professor on this professor was looking for them

141
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
Basic basically with the right credentials

142
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,807
So which are you

143
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
So I would

144
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
Phone number of years

145
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
Apologize

146
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,607
I got an agent and I kind of exhibited within London at st. Martin's

147
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
It didn't really turn out

148
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:45,311
Chihuahuas fight difficult to up next living as a pulse right on sister

149
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
People

150
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,127
To make a living

151
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,199
Now basically video advance of the computerized

152
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,527
Twenty years ago it was extremely difficult

153
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,879
So then I did a teacher training costs and I talked or not

154
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,207
And I did this for about 8 years

155
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:07,071
Increasingly became interested in occult symbolism

156
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
So I decided

157
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,191
Take my job and focus full-time on

158
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
So you wanted to do that

159
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
This makes no sense

160
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
To be a really interesting

161
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:24,479
Figure out who are the people behind the presentation

162
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
And he's just like trying to figure out like what the words and he

163
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
His bio Eva

164
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
Where flummoxing

165
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
88

166
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,439
He's presenting himself as like

167
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Expert in

168
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Secretive

169
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,279
6 would make sense why you try and make everything

170
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
Assertive

171
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
You responded to what does it mean

172
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
To be informally

173
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,895
If I understand history correctly he was asked

174
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,455
Informally to come to Oxford because one of his

175
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:00,063
Former teachers you a professor professor and they were like

176
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
We need somebody with the right

177
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
Credentials

178
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
In Oxford

179
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
And those credentials I assume

180
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
Being

181
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,887
A friend of a former teacher that the professor

182
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
Scholar on Ancient language

183
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
He has a degree in Fine Arts Pacifica

184
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,711
He claims he's starting to Urology in formal offer to study at Oxford

185
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
No sides

186
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Turn it down

187
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
It really doesn't look like Pierre

188
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,367
Actually studied any of this.

189
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Informal

190
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,463
Which is a huge problem because ancient languages are infinitely

191
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,535
Complexity

192
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
Often disagree with them

193
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,863
The finer points but etymology

194
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
If you read his bio

195
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
He claims that he turned down his offer to go to aux

196
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Statues

197
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Degree in painting in art history

198
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
At the University of Wales

199
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,479
Interesting late the University of Wales isn't really the University of we understand it it's a system of universe be spray

200
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Read through Wales

201
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,855
Biggest schools in the system are adverse with Bangor

202
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:11,999
Example not the University of Wales

203
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,071
It may just be an example of him putting it really weirdly

204
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
I find it a little bit

205
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,263
Degree in painting in art history so even if he's telling the truth it really doesn't matter

206
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,663
He does have a degree in pesos

207
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
Whales because he's talking to Carrie cast

208
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
So he did not graduate from

209
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,463
Possibly I mean the way I look at it like you could say the University of Missouri

210
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,047
What you do your references University of missouri-columbia

211
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
University

212
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:55,007
But there is a university system like there's a um Rolla there's other like satellite

213
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,359
Yeah if you graduated from University of Missouri at Rolla you probably say you got a degree from

214
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
I'm have you right

215
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:07,295
Maybe I don't know it's not like it's not like many people would say I graduated from the University of my

216
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
Miami Ohio

217
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,207
University of Miami Ohio

218
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,863
Music like that

219
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
Are specific to a certain thing you're studying

220
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,335
Okay satellite campuses will have like a really good act program

221
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,175
Different places I went

222
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
The school I got that

223
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,551
Degree from that school

224
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,623
I don't care to spend a whole lot of time on this but I just thought it

225
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Because that's

226
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
Not expensive

227
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
For learning

228
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
His credentials cuz that sounds like a really

229
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
So I can see him

230
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,007
I really think that's probably like preschool education

231
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
Dude

232
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
You're so close

233
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
Between 2002 and 2014

234
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
Better able

235
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
It's not

236
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
Someplace where he could have learned two languages or got credentials and

237
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Linguistics

238
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
It's more an indication that he was probably on a track

239
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Becoming

240
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:25,119
What you described in that clip in the early 2000s

241
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Workout

242
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,959
The further reinforces idea he claims to have been a member of the ins

243
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
Which is a specific level of their organization

244
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,151
Annapolis diploma related

245
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
The teaching and specific formal tea

246
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Teaching

247
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,039
In order for Pierre to a bit member his educational path

248
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
After his art degree

249
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
Would likely have had to have been in

250
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,159
Is it further bolstered by the claim

251
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,463
That he holds a postgraduate

252
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
Application in further and higher education

253
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
Education which can

254
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
If you're not paying attention sound like

255
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,887
I have a postgraduate degree

256
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,703
In some form of higher education

257
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
A degree in education

258
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
So he is

259
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,335
He was on a teaching path and then decided

260
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
I don't want to do this I want to f****** talk about aliens

261
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,175
I can read words

262
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
Whatever

263
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,527
Eddie presents himself now

264
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Pierre is a leader in the

265
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
The field of biology

266
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
Which is described as quote

267
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,463
The study of Angelica vessels through religion and mythology

268
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:29,119
I'll go ahead and admit that you're the leader in that field considering he made the word up and I'm the only person besides

269
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:35,519
Whenever they're read

270
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,847
Skype

271
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,759
Also in 2010 pierce the back with a guest on the overtly Nazi leaning and white nationalist show Red Ice Radio

272
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,087
Unfortunately their shows are behind a paywall

273
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,903
Listen to it but the description of the episode includes this

274
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
We discuss Zionism

275
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:59,839
The connection to Mars ritual sacrifice or the origin of the idea of a holocaust

276
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
That doesn't make me feel great

277
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:07,007
If you're going out of Nazi sympathetic show to discuss quote of the idea of a holocaust

278
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:13,407
I'm pretty comfortable assuming you don't think it was a real thing

279
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,807
Questions about it cuz I might

280
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:26,207
There's no way to create a fake account

281
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,303
Yeah so this guy seems like he doesn't have any credentials

282
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
You be saying things

283
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
But he does about linked

284
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,703
Little bit

285
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,007
May or may not have been a fine

286
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Green painting

287
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:46,175
An art history wanted to be a teacher his portrait painting business wasn't lucrative cuz the internet wasn't around

288
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
You know what is lucrative

289
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
Talking about weird s***

290
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
Great career path

291
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Bebe

292
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,631
It's not honorable somewhat Noble profession

293
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
Maybe maybe you should

294
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:23,039
Still working my way

295
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,647
So this is what I found myself actually

296
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
Becoming interest

297
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
In this episode

298
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
Because before this

299
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Kind of seems like

300
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
You've got a a weird but

301
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
Fairly common path of

302
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,983
Is is like

303
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
She's not going well

304
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,567
I'm going to Pivot into this weirdness

305
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
Yeah because

306
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,663
They know that there's large communities of people who are very suggestible

307
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Fairly gullible

308
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,879
A bad with the word known as he's pretty good at making bad points

309
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
This is where I became

310
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Interested because

311
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,887
Pierre in the next clip reveals what

312
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
2Pac

313
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
From being an art teacher

314
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
Into

315
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,543
Being this guy

316
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
He doesn't save this is what got him off track

317
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
If you pay close attention

318
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Stoptech

319
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,271
You'll see that is exactly what is another book

320
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,463
Interesting office. That I found very fascinating which inspired me to research and children

321
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
The subjects

322
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:41,375
Aliens and then how we will Jam Define 189h last so

323
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,679
That there was the academic Robert temp

324
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,495
Send email the Sirius Mystery

325
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,543
This was a baby

326
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Waste Management

327
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,151
The ancient amen hypotheses

328
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,967
Sertraline

329
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
Aliens

330
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
Facebook really awesome being bastard

331
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:05,695
My book studies Ancient Aliens in Hainan this is another book but until

332
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,351
Taking shots

333
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,703
Wow

334
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,311
I like it I like it

335
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
No

336
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:30,015
No is that about how SiriusXM

337
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,367
Mystery is a book published by Robert temple in 90

338
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
1876

339
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,743
The book argues that a tribe called the dogon in the African nation of Mali

340
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:45,631
Extraterrestrials from the Sirius star system to up till present day

341
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:52,031
These. Talk to jougan about culture and art

342
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
And all other cultures from which all these cultures spread

343
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,855
Without Alien Force

344
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
Set the jougan we're talking

345
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
Star people

346
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,423
Was that was just to visit them

347
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,239
Surprised to learn that the jougan people were aware

348
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
Of the furious's

349
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,847
Compendium Stars which they shouldn't have known about since

350
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,687
Are white doors and are essentially invisible

351
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:37,087
So they wouldn't be able to tell if those Stars about them which people in other cultures know about

352
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,415
Conviction took note about

353
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,279
The fact that they did because they were relatively uncommon

354
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,119
Like they were isolated

355
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447
This was not information to Robert Temple

356
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,519
To buy visiting the jougan

357
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:00,895
He learned about this star wisdom that they had from reading a book called The Pale Fox by Marcel Gruelle

358
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
And Germann

359
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,271
A pair of French anthropologist ethnography

360
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Who studied the dogon

361
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,647
Groupon hotels in Amazing Stories

362
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
The dogon

363
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,511
Who told him if he's invisible stars in the Sirius system which they called

364
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
Tolo

365
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:23,679
It's a great story and really if you look at the world at the time it's super unlikely that they picked up isn't

366
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:29,823
Information from past visitation from other cultures cuz like you were at they were fairly uncontacted

367
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,127
And the people who had come did not appear

368
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Do I have the

369
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
The information that they were relay

370
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
To these French

371
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,295
I kind of don't

372
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,623
Because that suggests there is an Eddy

373
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,415
Kind of oral tradition

374
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
From

375
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
Prior to any number of

376
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
It is

377
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:54,655
I don't know I don't know how I actually you that I'm not going to destroy this

378
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:01,055
No I didn't know existed

379
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:12,319
Unfortunately 1991 Anthropologist Walter Van Beek

380
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,159
Ultimately

381
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
They were offered a Coke

382
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,536
He found that a whole lot of the things that greeland detailing

383
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,216
He wrote this about the Sirius ID

384
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,872
Tolo interpreted as real as their name for Sirius

385
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:40,480
They disagree about it with each other as to which star is Matt

386
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,784
For some it's an invisible star that should rise

387
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
To announce these to do or the fast

388
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Okay

389
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,720
For another is Venus

390
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Guto lautz

391
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,632
All of them agree however that they were told about the star from Brielle

392
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,360
Well I think I think that there's actually an interesting wrinkle

393
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,688
Do this I think we're going to get to a deer.

394
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,248
Okay I'm not entirely clear about that

395
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
Stop the mail down

396
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,368
You want that so

397
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,184
Walked away from the main camp

398
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
Had to pee

399
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
Started singing the classic

400
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Sirius song

401
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,144
Maybe stories complete

402
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,448
French Dudes didn't do this out of any actual

403
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Evil intention

404
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
It's most likely that they asked

405
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,080
I misinterpreted our answers

406
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:43,200
Because they're reporting on the study wasn't overly sensationalized initially got very little attention

407
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
When it was published back in the 90

408
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
T30

409
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,528
Either way it's

410
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
Complete nonsense

411
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
But that

412
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
GameStop Robert Temple

413
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
Using it is the central

414
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Surface Book

415
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,720
Arguing that the serious aliens were the route of human civilization

416
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
And his book has been a big

417
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
Piece of alien Cannon Everson

418
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Gotcha

419
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,936
Gotcha noted that Roberts working on the Sirius Mystery in night

420
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
67

421
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
22

422
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:10,848
Is that Mentor was a man named Arthur Young who actually invented the Bell Helicopter

423
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,896
But was so disgusted by the

424
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,944
Nuclear weapons after World War

425
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
He completely dedicated

426
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,272
Themselves to be real weird paranormal stuff

427
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
I like it

428
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,392
He seems alright in a lot of his stuff is

429
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,184
Is around where I don't know if I like it

430
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,584
For that but

431
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,936
You like f******

432
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,520
She Too Young establish the foundation

433
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
For the study of consciousness

434
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,128
He would meet young enterprising Robert Temple

435
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,920
We'll go on to become a secretary

436
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,320
For the organization level

437
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
Super into the idea of the

438
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,624
The Council of nine

439
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:59,744
These paranormal conspiracy world when you hear about someone channeling alien information

440
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,632
The Council of nine is very often mentioned as 9 powerful alien beings

441
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,704
From serious and often have some sort of like

442
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
Creator deity

443
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,008
The motions

444
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:18,432
Right in 1952 the young was one of nine people who attempted to make

445
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:23,296
First contact with the council at a gathering organized by Andrea

446
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,112
Who Rich was a bit of a paranormal hype man

447
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,184
His most notable for introducing the world to URI Geller

448
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,584
Climbing The Gallery at which point

449
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
Quinones Hoover

450
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,264
Also Keller could apparently teleport rise stuff is true

451
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,664
A lot of the stuff that

452
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,736
Approval Richwood. Come out and say about gallery

453
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,064
Like that he had come up with while he was at the time

454
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,096
Lavagirl

455
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:15,264
I'm like that

456
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,360
You can buy anything if it comes from the Council of nine

457
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,640
Not just like

458
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:26,528
Do these aliens it was the Melchizedek order

459
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:36,768
B2 at 13 years after the Gathering young would tell a twenty-year-old Robert Temple about the French Anthropologie

460
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,560
Its findings with the dogon people

461
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,888
It almost certainly added a little bit of his own to it

462
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,984
People who study the supporting documents and the book temple ended up writing

463
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,544
How weak it is on evidence

464
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,616
30 must have been writing it to please his boss R3

465
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
Who was a bit obsessed

466
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
With the aliens

467
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,064
Some serious helicopter

468
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,648
Pricing

469
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
Hit my boss loves buck

470
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,560
This article about the dogon having contact with aliens

471
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,120
Increase

472
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:19,520
Temple by brown-nosing his way into a helicopter

473
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:24,640
Wound up creating entire f****** mythology behind alone

474
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
Erik von detten

475
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,040
I don't know exactly how the timeline works but

476
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,880
It's not like controller

477
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,976
But it's not like he's single early responsible for a lot of this stuff he's just a p

478
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
He's a big tender

479
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,608
Make make that might make it

480
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,448
A little bit of a surprise to learn that on the cover of the Sirius Mystery

481
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,984
There's a promotional blurb

482
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,032
From Isaac asimov's that reads quote

483
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,592
I couldn't find any mistakes in this book

484
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,248
Has like a piece of literature

485
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,576
I know that asthma doesn't have the best track record at least not

486
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,840
It turns out later clarified what was going on here

487
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,168
He sent me the manuscript which I found unreadable

488
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:28,896
He asked me point-blank if I could point out any errors in it and partly out of politeness partly to get rid of him and partly

489
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,712
Because I have very little of the book

490
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
True

491
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,904
I said I could not put out any certainly did not have permission to use that statement is part of the form

492
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,000
I'll just have to be careful hereafter

493
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,328
Perfect Saturday

494
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,936
Perfect story but it also speaks to Robert temples manipulative

495
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,264
Business like hitting that blurry

496
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:01,920
His work false credibility well done well done

497
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
What is a good Griff

498
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,784
The Robert Temple Road is shooting misleading book to suck up to his boss

499
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,112
Misinterpreted

500
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
7 Frenchmen

501
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:15,488
And that is what Pierre's the Box B is a major influence in his life

502
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
And that he said

503
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
The book made a good argh

504
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
This guy is

505
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
Super dumb

506
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Yeah

507
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,544
Wow isn't that great a great story also I really like

508
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,336
I really like as above

509
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,408
Clarification

510
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,712
How dare he use this quote it's more like

511
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,768
My bad on this one guys

512
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,072
That's a delight

513
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,120
And now we get into like other in

514
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
Does the pr sabaq hat

00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,960
And one of them obviously is David Icke

516
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032

Omnipresent

520
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
David Icke

521
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272

00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Around

523
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,600
Probably around 2

524
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,904
It's contact with David ice work

525
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
NFL

Is research how absolutely I'm fascinating

527
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,560
I was a little babe

528
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
Dissatisfied with

529
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,104
She got a loss of this which sense is circumstantial evidence

530
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,432
Circumstantial evidence

531
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
Primary source

532
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:46,880

Bakeries

537
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,712
Already I did firmly establish to someone who might be a good

538
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
Formal education

539
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
But it is next I didn't want to

540
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,416
Include all of the

541
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,464
Times you just rattles off words

542
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:31,168
Nail Wednesday

Instances that he talks about Greek stuff that I actually know something yeah we can talk about the

00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
Include this is just sort of

545
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
Acrostic

546
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
Action of what

547
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
It's like listening

548
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
Him talk about his work

549
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944

00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,552
Knock knock

552
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:52,416
Okay

Uncomfort

556
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,840
Symbolism Cindy true

557
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,888
There is a universal grandma

558
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
So for example

559
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,104
Different on numerous languages

Are you outside are the Mesa contumacious liverwurst or what

561
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
So you at work

562
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,040
Many different languages

563
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,880
Give you a few examples of the word play

564
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
In English

565
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
Wood

566
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,280
Versal of the word

567
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,144
La choza Pollo Loco

568
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,448
Gospel was the Roman god

569
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
The game within the Japanese

570
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,616
Coming to God

571
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,152
Hello, is a wolf

572
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
Virginia Arabic

573
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480

574
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
Iowa

575
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:56,928
Will be out again so I guess though I'm not entirely sure

576
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,256
A little bit down the road

577
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,048
I can explain exactly why he's

578
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
Very wrong

579
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
Episode first of all I love that Robert Temple stuff

580
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,496
Highways

581
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
Not take the

582
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
Talk about stuff like that

583
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,592
But then I started to listen to

584
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
Just rattle off

585
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:19,200
These words and make connections between

586
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,272
Larger point that isn't fair that doesn't make any

587
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,832
Did it really reminded me of when I was

588
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
Fairly young I

589
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Check myself

590
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
Cuz I was really depressed

591
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
And I was

592
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
I was going through this

593
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,816
And I checked myself out of it

594
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
Because the people there

595
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
Refuse to let me

596
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,704
And the roommate that I had in the room I was in

597
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
He would always be

598
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
Carrie rounded

599
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:44,800
Dictionary

600
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
And yelling at me

601
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
About various words

602
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
Profound

603
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
Be related to

604
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:52,992
To each other

605
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,552
But this is a preoccupation that Stumpy

606
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
People have

607
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
Rooted in

608
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,136
Mental illness

609
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,464
Right life of connections that don't exist

610
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,048
You don't realize it's hidden

611
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,608
Intentionally

612
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,496
And they put red at front of it which is why I

613
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
Need to happen on Wednesday

614
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,360
It's obvious Dan it's that level

615
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,664
Behind the time that I'm

616
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
Referring to

617
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,272
There's a little bit of a hostility behind

618
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
Pierre stock

619
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:32,672
Talking about if only because he won't let Carrie talk

620
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,208
It is the idea of like

621
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Usurping

622
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
Ruler aliens

623
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,304
Dominating the planet

624
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,864
There is an anger that he has towards them

625
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,144
In his like

626
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
I've cut through their code

627
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,984
Let me freak you

628
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:53,408
No

629
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:59,808
But they're also got

630
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,344
Mention that I don't even have a clip of

631
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Is there a dog

632
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
I'm up I like that

633
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
Human beings best friend

634
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,816
Yeah exactly

635
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,376
How are you I like

636
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:18,752
When they just throw in something that you're familiar with and they're like yeah that's also an alien

637
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,336
Yeah I know but that's what they all say everything

638
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
Anyting

639
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,640
Strfkr

640
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
Obviously there is Delia

641
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,992
Alright what about

642
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Figure dogs

643
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Figure dogs

644
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
Absolutely

645
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:38,976
Small dog teacup dogs

646
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:44,608
Serebii

647
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
It's just nonsense

648
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
And maybe it's just me

649
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Because I had that

650
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,592
But I did get really

651
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:59,712
Creeped out by listening to him just prattle off words

652
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:05,088
Later where I will explain why he's wrong about them and then explain on a larger sense

653
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,624
What he's doing

654
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,648
With linguistics

655
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,440
If you studied linguistics

656
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
He would know is that

657
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,280
But it just

658
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Just is

659
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
It just feels like someone

660
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Is a little bit

661
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
A little bit off

662
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,264
Little bit little trouble

663
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
I don't know if they're real

664
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,384
I'm going to go with coincidence

665
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
But in this next clip

666
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
Larger mythology

667
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,648
Mystic part of it out of it

668
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
Lot of the larger mythology

669
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
Come down to

670
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
Misunderstanding

671
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
Specific

672
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
And

673
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
Next clip

674
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
Pierre

675
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
What that thing is

676
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,200
Which was the creation of the original

677
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,392
Serafino Electric

678
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,928
The other is the Caribbean

679
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,464
Protohuman rice

680
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,864
Relationship The Rock hello and the High Spirits

681
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,680
So this is essentially the answer

682
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:28,544
No the unsurpassed was have corrupted by the Denny's

683
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,128
Danielle

684
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:39,552
Is really another word for a genetic engineer the engineer

685
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,832
Chase Bank

686
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,904
What's the song

687
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,208
You just basically co-opting Nas

688
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,768
Stick ideas

689
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,864
Consulted on Prometheus

690
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,984
Bulshit like that in the ology in high school's version of

691
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Throwing

692
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,384
The anthroposophy the demiurge

693
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,200
The idea of

694
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
Stuff like that the first

695
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
Creation

696
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
Being that Realm

697
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,440
Ours is the secondary creation is created by the demiurge

698
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,280
Like that's that's a lot that that's a lot of stuff that's very complicated

699
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,816
That is very freaky

700
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,608
5

701
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,936
He's World an example of

702
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
Douglas Adams

703
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,848
People whenever they

704
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:41,248
Okay I'm going to take something you had this thing that you really probably don't know but

705
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
Same thing that you know

706
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,696
No no no and then it goes into

707
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,424
And then that is also this and this and this and then and then

708
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,240
Where is the

709
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:08,640
And so the whole thing that I'm saying is absolutely nothing but it's stuff that you already know that makes me sound smart because I'm

710
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,920
Differently

711
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,504
You know enough of it to know that it's

712
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,904
Uno

713
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
Greek word for man

714
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:33,728
The Greek letter for

715
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,032
That is not correct

716
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,568
8th District results

717
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,128
Okay

718
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
Explained

719
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
DPAC

720
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,200
That's a humans have taken

721
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:49,344
So really when we talkin about the adamic really talkin about Marsha

722
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,928
Interesting and shrugging coffee

723
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,048
Now obviously Mi 45 Destroyer

724
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,168
My understanding of this Sunday

725
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,288
Is that the seed of man was taken to the Moon

726
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
Systemic signifier of the money

727
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:22,880
Which is an egg

728
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,696
Second creation

729
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:32,096
So yes there was war in heaven established

730
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
There was a war in heaven

731
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:39,520
Mars destroy the Moon the Moon has evidence

732
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:43,104
By the The Pearl

733
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,504
Normal

734
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:57,440
I'm not sure why you had to outpost on the moon for a little while not sure what the point of that was

735
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
The Earth

736
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,536
You don't need to refuel on the moon or even I don't like

737
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:07,680
That's that's absurd if you make a trip to stop over there

738
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:14,080
Crazy so if you are going from Mars to be

739
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
To Columbia Missouri

740
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,920
And you stopped off ingested

741
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,456
On the way

742
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,248
Alright Jefferson City

743
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,344
Cool people from Missouri College Jeff City where everybody is in there

744
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,744
It's like maybe they left for Mars whenever bars was closer to the Moon then

745
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,400
Jefferson City is in its orbit

746
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,960
How about this one on there

747
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,800
How do we even know the moon was orbiting Earth at the time that this occurred

748
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
The Moon is real

749
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,968
What does the moon itself

750
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,296
I don't know

751
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,856
Project Camelot actually really great question

752
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:03,488
I'm sure he would accept that booking to start a change.org

753
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:09,888
To be the best way to do

754
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:20,896
Really asked whether the Moon is really imagine how much you would Gala Kari Jobe you the best

755
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,528
Just to use

756
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,600
Broad spectrum of knowing language

757
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,392
She's already talked a little bit about Greek

758
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
He's talked about

759
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
Hebrew

760
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,864
Did he think he can speak please

761
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:47,264
I want you to put a pin in that cuz Carrie asked him that later

762
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,848
It's not supposed to be a got your question but it ends up being blocked

763
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:58,015
And you of course need to say yes to this question

764
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
And then maybe speak

765
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:03,903
Little bit of one of those languages

766
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
If you just said

767
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,839
Yep I do know these languages

768
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
Cool let's move on

769
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,423
It's a problem that like if

770
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,751
Like I know this from my study of

771
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,319
Baseline understanding of ancient Greece

772
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,879
What are the things that I was very impressed with is

773
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,927
If you don't understand

774
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,207
The nuances of

775
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,999
Pacific language you're talking about

776
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,303
You don't understand the particular word

777
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,351
Because sometimes things mean

778
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
Completely different things

779
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,423
Depending on the context of the Sun

780
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,703
Depending on

781
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,007
Acquaintance of the noun

782
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,823
Think 10 min different think of the word f***

783
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,663
I don't know the context of the word f*** you don't know what the word Funk mean

784
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
Sterling

785
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,967
Totally there are those things

786
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,271
Idiomatic

787
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Isn't that exist

788
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,927
You don't study the actual language

789
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
Your talkingshit

790
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,743
And that's what he's doing a lot of butt

791
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,047
S*** about Hebrew

792
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
Scary

793
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,911
Where your way came from the tetragrammaton

794
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:23,263
The word of God

795
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,359
Comes from directions in

796
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,151
Aramaic they would be like

797
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,455
Yeah that's the right way but it is

798
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,223
This is

799
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
We blow her show on

800
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:40,415
The same ideas and counted as well

801
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,719
Because the magic word

802
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,255
Yahweh

803
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,823
Hold on one second

804
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Sorry

805
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,527
I'm sorry I was saying that

806
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,879
Emoji of yet Yahweh question the word

807
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,535
You think it's so funny to me that carry get the

808
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,375
Explain the word play involved in the name

809
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,679
God I love it

810
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:30,079
I every time every time her show is revealed in terms of like

811
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,127
Yeah

812
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
So good

813
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:42,879
Sayings that the tetragrammaton is a play in some ways on I am I was

814
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,951
Like that that's what is the idea behind

815
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,583
I think you don't prove anything I think you proved it

816
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,119
Okay how do you prove it all

817
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:59,263
If you were an all-knowing all existing all-powerful God

818
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,311
Your your presentation

819
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,335
To the

820
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
The people who are subject

821
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
Obviously

822
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,175
Would be in Powerpoint

823
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,991
Certainly

824
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
Then you would just stress

825
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,807
I am

826
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,623
I am I was I will be

827
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,647
That sort of thing

828
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
I don't I don't see any

829
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
Nefarious word

830
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,535
Replacing here I think I see

831
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,583
A very basic think I think

832
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,143
As I understand it and I don't know the store

833
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
But I don't

834
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,007
That's even like a nun

835
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
Conventional thought

836
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,591
Like I don't think

837
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,127
Oh isn't this week

838
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
Colors are cool

839
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,807
Pitstop minor

840
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,575
Ancient Greek

841
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,623
You don't get all the learning

842
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,999
You would have gotten at least a little bit of Hebrew

843
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,535
I doubt it

844
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,327
Because the Council of nine

845
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
Apostrophe

846
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
Yeah well that's

847
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,239
It certainly has taught college courses

848
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
On Biblical Hebrew

849
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:07,103
We learn more about

850
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,127
Linguistic play

851
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:13,247
I know that he hasn't established visit

852
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:19,647
Talking about is little bit

853
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,207
Play like cognates

854
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,511
And then like twisted around

855
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
Inverse dog

856
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,143
You bet like that's a whole thing

857
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,727
Supposedly

858
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,287
Dear that he is aware of

859
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,823
A universal language

860
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
Behind

861
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175
Cities founded

862
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,551
Yeah

863
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:51,391
There is a lot of that going on

864
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
2 hours until

865
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
Long idle

866
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,231
Really understand what

867
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
He thinks

868
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,839
I don't know what Carrie is trying to get to other than

869
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:03,167
There's a lot of words that sound similar to Spartacus

870
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,055
It's tragic

871
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
Telescope

872
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,943
We learn about the word worship

873
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,503
Okay

874
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,295
Wows

875
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,623
That's not it

876
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,415
Distance

877
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Interesting

878
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,279
Cattle mutilation is going back thousands of years old

879
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:35,679
Coupling what's happening within the natural world

880
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Collection

881
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,943
Kenosha

882
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,503
The Angels is very important

883
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,575
So if just the brakes for a second

884
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,855
What are you talkin about is

885
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,135
UFOs

886
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,927
Upside down

887
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:05,119
I was thinking

888
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,399
He wins

889
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,471
The moment he said that he was like check this out

890
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,287
Exsanguinated

891
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,591
I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page

892
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,527
The word worship from

893
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,855
Angelica Schuyler

894
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,695
Disgusting

895
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,983
Angelic Silas with the boa

896
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
Worship

897
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,359
Because that's very

898
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
Worship

899
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,783
I'm not sure what that means war or w

900
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,111
Nor

901
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,951
Reference to a vessel

902
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,559
Flying Saucer

903
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:15,007
Yeah but I'm just waiting

904
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,127
It's nonsense

905
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
And ship

906
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,527
From the old English

907
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,063
Mike Skype

908
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,367
Which is a reference to a state

909
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,183
So it's a state of being Worthy

910
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,743
Is worship worthy of

911
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
Praise

912
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,071
Backpack

913
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,399
Has nothing to do with

914
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,935
Ships

915
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
That comes from a can

916
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,007
Completely different etymological

917
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:51,103
That sounds like something that you would learn if you were studying

918
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,503
Pretty simple really simple stuff but nope it's alien spacecraft

919
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,927
But we don't need to worry about the war part

920
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,487
I'm just upset right now

921
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:14,655
War war war war war

922
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,751
We did it yeah

923
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,031
V

924
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,335
I think that's the bigger issue here

925
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:27,455
Troublesome is low

926
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,039
Innocent cliff

927
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,599
Pierre discusses criticism

928

00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:41,023
Stop plus his answer is not very good

931
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,839
U.s. mail around Hopewell

932
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,727
Next question that most people ask when I talk about

933
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:58,687
Wendy's worth

934
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:06,367
Save this generally is your scholar is opening in your academic

935
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:09,951
Community

936
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,487
Cuz this is b*******

937
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:18,655
Most of the time you're not coming from a great place to be if people are constantly ask if you're making

938
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,703
What's up

939
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,239
Of course he's real

940
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,055
Britain because the most polite way for you to say

941
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,847
You're full of s*** in Brittany

942
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,639
Are you sure you're not mad

943
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,407
Making

944
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,455
You sure I am giving you one chance

945
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
To say

946
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
You made this

947
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:38,879
I made this all up I'm going to tell you you're full of s***

948
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,951
Well if it's in a lot of different

949
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
That's a process

950
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,863
That's question

951
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,167
You're just going back to your bad Avenue

952
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,983
I need to talk about how you came

953
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
It's dicey

954
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
So

955
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:00,383
Number things that he says that at that same thing like God back

956
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
Gorgeous dog other languages words

957
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,223
Either a

958
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,271
Deity figure it out

959
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
To the name of a dog

960
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,111
Or something like that

961
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,903
And not worth talking about

962
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,439
Frankly put this next one

963
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
Absolutely

964
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,303
So I know a little bit about

965
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
You suggesting

966
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,423
Crazy

967
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,447
Lunacy

968
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,495
Remember

969
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:38,015
Call Integrity

970
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
So

971
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,951
And it's going back to veneration

972
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,535
Creekwood office surfing

973
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,631
Office worker this is why the office worker

974
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,911
What is the symbol of

975
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,983
Oh my God

976
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,359
Thrilled

977
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,383
It's pretty

978
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,431
Oh man

979
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,015
Cookie said something

980
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:16,415
It's very similar to Soros there and then

981
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,487
Office in Greek

982
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,839
Or opus

983
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:29,471
It's not related at all

984
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:32,543
Our word office comes from the Latin word Christian

985
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,079
Which

986
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:34,847
Pierre might want it

987
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
Into the word

988
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
A serpent

989
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,967
It's very

990
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,247
But they're very different words that

991
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,039
Roots that come from different places

992
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,599
It sounds the same but that's it

993
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,415
It's wonderful for you to

994
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,695
Have real

995
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Knowledge

996
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,023
About etymology and how this guy is

997
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,047
Full of s***

998
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
But

999
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:58,655
At the same time I feel like anybody was even a cursory

1000
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:02,751
Ability to critically think about this

1001
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:05,055
Would listen to what he saying go

1002
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:05,823
That is

1003
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:12,223
Dum dum dum

1004
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,991

1005

For serpent

1007
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,415
Most common

1008
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,951
That's the second most common

1009
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:27,839
The word office from

1010
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,375
Yes

1011
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,911
If that is

1012
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,959
McKay's

1013
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,007
For office

1014
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:35,775
Not that

1015
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,615
Because that's what they're trying to communicate

1016
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,991
So the plan is I understand his plan

1017
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:48,319
For the Council of nine or whatever it is that we're talking about here

1018
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
Correctly

1019
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,647
What he said

1020
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
Across

1021
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
Timeline

1022
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,975
Through different languages

1023
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,767
In order to influence

1024
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,375
By using this underlie

1025
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,191
Secret language that connects all of them

1026
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:07,007
Together

1027
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,287
Manipulating ability

1028
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,311
Did not extend

1029
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,103
Before the Greek language

1030
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:15,711
I just want to f*** with those people what they want

1031
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:21,599
How what what's the word for office in Greek sound a lot like

1032
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
Graph paper

1033
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,951
What do people use in offices all the time

1034
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,535
Directly similar to etymology Roots there I believe

1035
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,215
Graphite

1036
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:41,311
Graphite pencil for writing

1037
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
Escape that can talk

1038
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,383
Calculator

1039
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,407
Graffiti

1040
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:51,551
Conspiracy

1041
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:57,695
Spectacularly really think the guy with the telescope

1042
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,023
F****** sewed

1043
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
Buy accents

1044
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,607
European accent

1045
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,631
She's like

1046
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,679
Because if you imagine

1047
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
Like

1048
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,615
Southern twang

1049
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:24,575
That

1050
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,439
You know why we think what we think about the south right

1051
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
Cuz it people like

1052
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,535
But the guy is funny

1053
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,351
Yes

1054
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,399
But Pierre does

1055
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,679
About what the Mayan

1056
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
We're up to

1057
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:44,799
As we all know wondering what the Mayans were up to in all of this

1058
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:47,359
Believe that the end of the world

1059
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,639
Skorts

1060
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,919
Rare

1061
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:56,575
Pretty clearly that wasn't good on him for that

1062
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
Bye

1063
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:03,999
Currently the scoreboard 199999

1064
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,327
To what

1065
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,655
But

1066
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
Pierre has

1067
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,703
Maybe about the Mayans

1068
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,727
We're actually up to

1069
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,031
When they were writing

1070
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:19,615
Miss calendars and stuff

1071
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:24,991
Possibilities trying to change the timeline

1072
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,551
Possibility.

1073
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,903
Mankind

1074
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,695
Call Nelly

1075
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,071
Clearly

1076
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:41,887
Is correct

1077
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:44,959
Essentially what we're doing this while living in the past

1078
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:49,567
Some of these coaches are trying to do

1079
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,359
Was trying to almost

1080
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Address

1081
00:57:56,223 --> 00:58:02,367
Well the timeline would be intensified the Next Generation the next calculation

1082
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:11,839
Would be an explanation possible while they met another culture.

1083
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,191
Attract

1084
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,727
That

1085
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
Was

1086
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:22,591
Astonishingly stupid it's wild that was

1087
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:28,735
Truly almost almost respectable in the level of idiocy involved

1088
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,783
It's almost like

1089
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:35,391
Even somebody who is stupid enough to believe that would be smart enough

1090
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
Never to say it out

1091
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,951
Well it's

1092
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:44,607
Because someone who would have these ideas kicking around of their heads would be able to articulate

1093
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:52,287
I can't prove it

1094
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:57,919
Here's an outlandish thing that I believe in and it's definitely true

1095
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,991
I read that weird restraint that he's showing that also I kind of

1096
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,527
There's a part of me that resents

1097
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,087
I really kind of

1098
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:05,855
Captured

1099
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,903
Like

1100
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,207
Former WWE writers

1101
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,607
WWE

1102
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,543
Give me your wildest bulshit

1103
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:30,687
Bernie Mac

1104
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
Man that's

1105
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,015
Stupid

1106
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,039
Not as stupid as

1107
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,623
Talking about Greek words

1108
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:42,719
And he blows that blows it real bad

1109
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:48,863
Cuz they knew that a crisis was happening eventually and

1110
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:53,471
Or whatever

1111
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:56,543
And they knew that back then they're trying to avert

1112
00:59:59,103 --> 00:59:59,871
Just trying to avert

1113
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,943
220

1114
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
28

1115
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,759
Or something like that

1116
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:09,087
I thought you meant I thought he was thinking that the reason that

1117
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,111
We didn't

1118
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,351
Knew we were going to die in

1119
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:24,191
And so they sacrificed a s*** ton of people in order to change

1120
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,215
Is the timeline

1121
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:31,615
Because in 2012 we would have had a complete disaster annihilator

1122
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:34,943
What is an agonizing come up with

1123
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,479
Might be what you saying

1124
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:43,135
Ballpark

1125
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,231
Ballpark

1126
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,047
Yeah a lot of underappreciated

1127
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
Screwing up again

1128
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,007
Greek

1129
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,567
Basilisk is a second person

1130
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,591
Basilisk off

1131
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,639
A type of cake

1132
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,479
So this isn't a long string of various cultures have

1133
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
Words

1134
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
For like royalty

1135
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:14,623
We're just going through working gone through everything

1136
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,303
I don't know or any of that stuff

1137
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,863
I'm sure it's as bad as this

1138
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,423
If this is example that I do know some

1139
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:31,263
So the issue here is a misunderstanding how language works

1140
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,591
There's a mythological being which dates back to at least the timer

1141
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,895
Pliny the Elder kaldi basilisk

1142
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:41,247
And plenty the Elder was right on everybody knows him now

1143
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,783
100% Acura

1144
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:47,391
Visit large rooster snake hybrid they can kill you by looking at you

1145
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:51,743
The issue is that it was named the Basilisk because of the Greek word for

1146
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,279
King beanbath Oleo

1147
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,839
The idea that this thing is

1148
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
King of the snakes

1149
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,447
Sewing Greek it was called Bacitracin basilisco

1150
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:03,519
Which is just a slight tweaking of the word to mean little King

1151
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,055
Yeah that's all that is

1152
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,871
It is proof of some kind of linguistic word placing

1153
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:10,943
Hide the reality the world or at least

1154
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,503
Bars Pierre comes along and crack the code

1155
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,319
It's just a mythological creature being given a name

1156
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:18,879
The story

1157
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,647
Wanted to

1158
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,183
Convey about the Beast

1159
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,463
Mainly it's royalty

1160
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:28,351
This would be legit as stupid as me making the argument that kings are notoriously all drunk

1161
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,911
Because there's that cream ale out there called Little King

1162
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:36,031
And why would the word be the same if it weren't for hitting reality about King

1163
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,591
Aliens aliens

1164
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,919
The name Bassett like basilisk

1165
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,711
Comes from basileios come

1166
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,503
Comes from

1167
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,271
So like

1168
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,295
Right

1169
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:51,391
Is just putting the cart before the horse reimagining

1170
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,159
How

1171
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,951
Linguistic Evolution happens

1172
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,231
And how things are named

1173
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,279
Incredibly stupid

1174
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,327
This is Baseline

1175
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,399
Right now the French phrase Le Petit more

1176
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:08,799
Is actually coming from because every time you came

1177
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,567
Used to die

1178
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,615
That's just trick

1179
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
This french guy

1180
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,151
You might be

1181
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:20,319
So this entire interview in the basis for a frozen scholarship boil down to two

1182
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,599
Phenomenon

1183
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,623
The study of language

1184
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,159
If you ever be much more aware of

1185
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,695
He actually studied languages

1186
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,535
These are what's known as false cognates and false

1187
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
Friends

1188
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,583
There are tons of examples

1189
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,607
Words in different

1190
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,399
Is it sound similar in

1191
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,679
Even have similar meaning

1192
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,471
Butterbeer

1193
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,239
Because they comfort

1194
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,543
Distinct etymological basis

1195
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,079
This is what's called a false

1196
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
Cognate

1197
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,127
What are the most

1198
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,175
Common and famous examples of

1199
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,711
Is the word dog

1200
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,735
Being the same in English

1201
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,551
And in the Aboriginal

1202
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
Languages

1203
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,111
Despite there being no relation

1204
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,391
The two cultures that would

1205
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,415
Explain this, now.

1206
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,463
We have to consider is that ever

1207
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,231
Language contain

1208
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,511
Thousands and thousands of

1209
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,071
Possible the two cultures

1210
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,351
Come up with the same name for

1211
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,679
Vocabularies you're looking at

1212
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,703
Eastbound

1213
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:09,727
In some cases

1214
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:11,775
Yeah

1215
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,311
What's important here is that

1216
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,103
These things are understood

1217
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,127
Blue study linguistics

1218
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,175
Because they consider the etymology of

1219
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,735
The words and how these languages are formed

1220
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,759
And where the

1221
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
Influences

1222
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
It's not some

1223
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,087
Mysterious

1224
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,623
And completely lost

1225
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:31,487
And a false friend is Alex Jones Joe Rogan

1226
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,279
Their words in languages that

1227
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,047
Look like there

1228
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,095
Connected it sounds very similar but mean

1229
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,631
Thanks

1230
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,423
These are what's known as false friend

1231
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,215
And they're often the result of lying

1232
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,239
We're just borrowing words

1233
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,775
Assured Source language

1234
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,311
Then tweaking the meaning over

1235
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
The time

1236
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,127
Call Pearson deck.

1237
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,919
Pretend that just because of word

1238
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,479
Great sound similar to word in Japanese

1239
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,759
They must be related

1240
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,551
As proof that the reptilians are playing

1241
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,575
Tricks on us with words

1242
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,599
Almost

1243
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,391
Absolutely simplistic way to look at

1244
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:04,511
Linguistics what about Dan the Native American group that

1245
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,535
Spoke Japanese

1246
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,327
What what

1247
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:13,215
Group or whatever it is

1248
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,591
Found that their language was

1249
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,359
Strikingly

1250
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,127
Similar to Jeff

1251
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,919
Bright

1252
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,687
Clearly mean

1253
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,711
Haley

1254
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:26,527
Contacted them and aliens

1255
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,575
So we can assume that all

1256
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,367
Chinese people are aliens

1257
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,903
Getting into it I don't know what the explanation

1258
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
Is or even if

1259
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,695
If you're not making

1260
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:36,255
It's up but you're not

1261
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
There are plenty

1262
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,631
Mayan

1263
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,679
Is there a hundred different explanation

1264
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,983
Cultural transmission

1265
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,007
Happens

1266
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,335
And it all comes back to the

1267
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,359
Trade route

1268
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,151
That happened to know it early

1269
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:53,919
Early Times

1270
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,735
All that sort of stuff

1271
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,319
Could be that explains the whole lot of

1272
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,879
Look I'm not an expert in the

1273
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,159
I like languages

1274
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
Stuff like that night

1275
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
I have a

1276
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,511
The water

1277
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,303
In terms of knowing what I know about

1278
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,327
But be

1279
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,607
Because I do know that

1280
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,631
I have had

1281
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,655
To study some of this

1282
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,423
Stop

1283
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:20,287
That doesn't mean that I know what the same roots of things are anything like that

1284
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,591
Buddy doesn't for my ability

1285
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,359
I need to know how you

1286
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:27,199
So that part is where I get a problem with him

1287
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,991
Because these things are so

1288
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
Easily

1289
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,831
Like the Basilisk vasileos kind of

1290
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:43,839
The prefix on the word for a kiss up and down both of blood

1291
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
This is like

1292
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,935
It's embarrassing

1293
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:52,799
On a number of levels

1294
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
Pierre

1295
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,615
He's presenting fun

1296
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Siri

1297
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,919
Namely that the reptilians

1298
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
Behind everything

1299
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
Pictures of language for

1300
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,991
Course

1301
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:01,759
And that's fine

1302
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,039
I understand he's got a

1303
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,087
New portrait

1304
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,647
For the rest of his life

1305
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,671
That whatever

1306
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,975
Does indicate a realtor

1307
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,815
Understand Linguistics enough to understand

1308
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,095
This guy does

1309
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,375
Not know what you talkin

1310
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,399
In about

1311
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,447
He presented his academic

1312
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,471
Credentials

1313
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,239
I have nothing to do

1314
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
The subject

1315
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,287
He's talking about

1316
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
Complicate

1317
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,615
That he has

1318
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
I guess

1319
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,431
Read an article

1320
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:33,759
Is inspiration for all of it is a book

1321
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,855
Yeah you are you correctly stuffed it up

1322
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:42,207
It's one of those things where you are

1323
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,487
Capable of

1324
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,327
Tricking people who are not going to look at

1325
01:07:56,287 --> 01:08:01,663
The idea of getting super super high and saying look at all these words

1326
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,503
S*** that does make a lot of sense

1327
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,807
But if you're somebody who's like okay cool

1328
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,831
That sounds like a

1329
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,599
Interesting information

1330
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:13,951
I'm going to take one more step and then

1331
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:17,023
Inoculated himself from the second

1332
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,047
Stop by

1333
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:18,815
Earlier like

1334
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:22,399
People come up to me and they say Pierre

1335
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,935
You just make us up

1336
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,007
He sort of shielding himself

1337
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,287
From Carrie ask that question

1338
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,055
Because he's

1339
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:35,199
He's already a strawman caracat he's already brought it up and addressed it and salt it

1340
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,551
To why this is sort of relevant

1341
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
To our world

1342
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,367
Like Alex Jones

1343
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,183
The interview

1344
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,255
About how long

1345
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,607
Might have

1346
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:57,471
Call language

1347
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,239
Conspiracy

1348
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,543
He wants to

1349
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,079
Get into what she wants to talk

1350
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,383
The Moon

1351
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,967
She also wanted to also bring up

1352
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,247
Maritime law

1353
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
We're basic

1354
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:17,695
Rule by maritime law Jordan Maxwell talks about satellite

1355
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,375
Fibonacci

1356
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:30,495
Steak

1357
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:34,079
State is a mirror image of the ships which is

1358
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,895
Of course

1359
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,175
And stuff like that it's kind of

1360
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:38,943
It's a metaphor

1361
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,967
But they're also like

1362
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,247
You have to consider again

1363
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,807
Part in worship

1364
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,087
Are

1365
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:45,855
Current route

1366
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,391
Just because they are the same

1367
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
Same word

1368
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,439
Anna written

1369
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,743
The same doesn't mean that they come from

1370
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,303
The same etymological Root Beer Crazy

1371
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,327
He's obsessed with

1372
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
Ship beef

1373
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:56,863
Because he doesn't

1374
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,631
Understand

1375
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,911
Changing path that word

1376
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:06,591
The reason that we are under maritime law is because and you can take this from the etymological

1377
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,895
And time

1378
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:16,319
Which means that we are married to our concept of time

1379
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
You can mean

1380
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,111
Happy

1381
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,671
So we are happily married to

1382
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:22,719
Set the timer.

1383
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,487
Yeah

1384
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,791
No we can't do that

1385
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:31,423
Alien

1386
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,335
I promise

1387
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:42,431
I promise you I'm not ending this episode no way to make him look

1388
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,199
Like

1389
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,735
Kabul or anything like that

1390
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,783
I've done is cut out

1391
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,807
Rambling

1392
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:50,623
Paragraphs of word

1393
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,951
Ultimately

1394
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,975
When I started listening

1395
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,255
Who's this I was like

1396
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,279
We have to do an episode

1397
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,047
Because I love the robber

1398
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,095
Yeah I want to talk about that

1399
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,911
And then as it went along I like this Izzy

1400
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,679
Desert

1401
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,215
Eclipse

1402
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,031
Because he's doing

1403
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,335
Long paragraph

1404
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,615
That he's just

1405
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
Delivering

1406
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,431
Need to talk.

1407
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,223
This is

1408
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,015
Tragic

1409
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:18,783
And then you get to

1410
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
The end

1411
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,319
And where at

1412
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,087
40 restarts

1413
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,367
Mike maritime

1414
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,415
It's unfamiliar

1415
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,975
And I was like oh okay

1416
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,255
Well we can we can

1417
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,279
We can deal with that

1418
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,375
I'm not making

1419
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:37,215
He's an absolute moron

1420
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,007
Duskull

1421
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,567
Address

1422
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,103
That he is

1423
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:43,871
Is using

1424
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
Language which he is

1425
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,687
This is

1426
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
Conspiracy

1427
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,735
Byhalia

1428
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:55,135
You're asking me if he addresses it what does that mean

1429
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,487
Bring it in

1430
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,767
Either

1431
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,839
Female garment

1432
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,607
You want me to

1433
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,631
To put on a dress

1434
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:08,191
Is that what you're asking me for

1435
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:12,799
Then

1436
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:17,407
Because the very words I speak betray how important the aliens are

1437
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,711
Reptilians wanted when wearing dresses

1438
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:26,367
Confirmed

1439
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,647
Of any validity

1440
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,183
Is it he then says

1441
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:32,767
And I am working on a language that is under influence

1442
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:45,567
One World Language bring up the fact that he

1443
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:50,175
Is now working on a language that is unencumbered by alien influence

1444
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,967
You can go f***

1445
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,015
Well he did bring up at one point

1446
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:54,783
Like

1447
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,319
Is a twin

1448
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,623
Call Weldon nevermind

1449
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,183
Like telepathic

1450
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,743
Good interact when they were younger course

1451
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,559
And we all know from studies the twins telepathic

1452
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,607
Really connect and then also have their online

1453
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,887
Is there gobbledigook today

1454
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,447
Everybody else

1455
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,471
There is that in

1456
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:17,567
But

1457
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,615
I don't know if he like actually

1458
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
Advances that as

1459
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,783
Are we okay with twins

1460
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:31,903
I don't know I don't think so

1461
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,183
I don't think it's okay

1462
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:35,743
So that I'm racist

1463
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,303
There can only be one damn

1464
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:45,471
Highlander version of fertilization

1465
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:48,799
He's

1466
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,103
Pierre's

1467
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:51,871
Is

1468
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,431
You like calling out word

1469
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
Play

1470
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,479
Past culture

1471
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,527
Clearly

1472
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,063
Because the serpent

1473
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,599
And in this case that mean

1474
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,879
Sort of the demonic

1475
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,071
They love it there like

1476
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,887
They're like those friends you have a go hang out with and it's just

1477
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:19,519
Honda Accord like Non-Stop

1478
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:23,871
I like that serious aliens

1479
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,431
What aliens and run

1480
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,711
I'm a big fan

1481
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,759
I like it too but it does

1482
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,039
A little frustrated

1483
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:37,439
Oh no I already hate this guy and I wish I'd never talked

1484
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:42,559
He's against the wordplay of the ride the surf

1485
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:48,703
So you don't have to

1486
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:01,503
What holds

1487
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:04,319
I love just

1488
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:10,719
Might be one of my favorites

1489
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,487
Jose like

1490
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,375
Man has always been battling the shores

1491
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:22,751
Human languages

1492
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:30,687
About this encryption

1493
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,527
Which is a high degree of artificiality

1494
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,903
The artifact is this

1495
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,951
Idea of a universal grammar is

1496
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,487
Prove with olive

1497
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,767
These disparate words and

1498
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
Four languages

1499
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:50,399
That sound similar or appear similar to

1500
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
Artifact

1501
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:55,263
Artifact that is

1502
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,287
The proof of the

1503
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,079
Alien transmission of

1504
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,127
Bababababababa culture

1505
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,687
Linguistics all of that stuff which is like

1506
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,247
Make that clear cuz he hadn't brought up

1507
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,015
The artifact

1508
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:10,111
Is juice

1509
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,647
Leprosy

1510
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,743
If you wouldn't come

1511
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:19,583
All the woods

1512
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,431
About the same

1513
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,967
Because the language is working

1514
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:46,975
Okay very very well said well

1515
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:47,999
F******

1516
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:55,423
Dance

1517
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,471
Robert Whitehorse

1518
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
Suggested like

1519
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,543
We are really

1520
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,567
Undercutting

1521
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,383
Like rare really

1522
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,407
Yeah that's

1523
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,455
Seems like a cumbersome plan

1524
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Cuz it has to be

1525
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,503
Been going

1526
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
Chinese

1527
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,319
As a language

1528
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:16,159
And the morphological roots of the Chinese language

1529
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,695
Thicker learn Chinese

1530
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:18,719
In that time

1531
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:24,351
These aliens could be do you know multilingual

1532
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,935
Be that complicated.

1533
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,239
Why do you imagine that it's difficult for them

1534
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,311
Why not just introduce Babelfish

1535
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:37,151
We have right now

1536
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,711
Well this is

1537
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:46,111
This is snoke explained it's never been made into a movie

1538
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:50,463
Giving away the Tower of Babel

1539
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,791
With the Tower of Babel

1540
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:58,655
What happened was man freed himself from the dominance of the the nam-shub

1541
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,935
The people who can speak

1542
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,703
Things into

1543
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,495
Tubi

1544
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,031
Hypnotize all Humana

1545
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:09,407
The Tower of Babel coming down and everybody not being able to see the camera on

1546
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,967
The whole thing falls apart and that is

1547
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,783
Protecting ourselves from from

1548
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:18,879
And

1549
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:22,975
She is an example of somebody who is trying to hypnotize you

1550
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:26,047
Buy just really quick

1551
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:29,887
Awkward

1552
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:32,959
That he uses to surround dog equals God

1553
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,751
And then he called it a day

1554
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:37,567
I get man

1555
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,591
There wasn't any point

1556
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,127
Gravel Springs episode that I do

1557
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,831
I don't understand how somebody could listen to him say one paragraph and not be like

1558
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,879
I got it we're going to move on

1559
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,695
Well and it becomes especially bad after the

1560
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,743
This next clip where Carrie asked

1561
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:57,791
And that we talked

1562
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,559
Better

1563
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:01,631
You actually speak these other languages I mean

1564
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:08,031
Etymology

1565
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:11,615
But I'm interested

1566
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,151
Helicopter symbolism

1567
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:17,503
So again when I'm I'm following an idea through an unthinking roll

1568
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,559
That's not how it is

1569
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:31,839
You can't be like

1570
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:35,423
You can't have no awareness or understanding of these languages

1571
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,447
Just look forwards

1572
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,495
I get that

1573
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,335
What is

1574
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,103
Out of it

1575
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,383
You're just

1576
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,687
Looking on a very surface-level

1577
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,479
Make an argument out of

1578
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:52,063
No he might as well have just said

1579
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,879
That you got a bunch of dictionaries

1580
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,415
From all different languages

1581
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,183
Any just

1582
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,231
Closes eyes turn the page

1583
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:03,327
Spin around and presses down on he's like okay this one says

1584
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:09,471
Canterbury

1585
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,263
It's like that's what he's described

1586
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:15,360
Let me Care Bears

1587
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,920
Came up with

1588
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,456
Express

1589
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,784
I don't know his tales are full of s*** to

1590
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,320
It's the same

1591
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,368
Is exactly what he's doing

1592
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,160
It's just a embarrassing

1593
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928
Like

1594
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,464
If you're presenting yourself

1595
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,000
Does an expert you have to stop

1596
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,560
You ever had

1597
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,584
Yeah

1598
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,352
Carrie cast

1599
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:37,888
And you go on

1600
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,168
Do you know these lines

1601
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,496
You're not going to be asked

1602
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,264
Prove it if you

1603
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,032
She said yes

1604
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,568
If you say no

1605
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,200
Another language

1606
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
Like

1607
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,552
All you have to do is not say stuff like that

1608
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,112
And then you could maybe sound like you know your schedule yet

1609
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:58,880
But

1610
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,928
I don't know maybe he's not used to having

1611
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,696
People call them out

1612
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,976
Also what's his

1613
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,000
What is baseball

1614
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,048
4 proof

1615
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,352
Bounce

1616
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,656
That's a good Baseline

1617
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:15,008
My bad

1618
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,336
So he says

1619
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:26,784
So here I go into the English dictionary and I look in Latin

1620
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,088
There it is

1621
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
There it is

1622
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:32,160
Oh there's this word in Chinese there it is

1623
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:34,464
How many languages is

1624
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,536
Required for him to prove that connection

1625
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,864
Yeah right so how can you even

1626
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,704
Consider describing a universal underlying language

1627
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,544
When you only have a few examples from a couple languages

1628
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,848
Knowing that there have been thousands upon thousands

1629
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,896
Right

1630
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,664
Doozy

1631
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,200
To find like

1632
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,992
Even prove it to be

1633
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:57,760
Is totally up

1634
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,624
King

1635
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,160
Giving basilisk

1636
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:04,928
Being

1637
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,232
Mr. hybrid

1638
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,000
Character

1639
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:08,768
From mythology

1640
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,816
He would then need to

1641
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,352
Prove in other languages

1642
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,632
Is there is a bad Leo

1643
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,680
Connection

1644
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,960
Being being

1645
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:17,728
Cross trans

1646
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:18,752
Through all of them

1647
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,288
Instead of

1648
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,568
Culturally

1649
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,616
Ambiguous things

1650
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,152
That are similar enough

1651
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:28,992
Gabru from that

1652
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,272
Specific

1653
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,320
Is that whoever

1654
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,112
Initially created

1655
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,392
Mythological being

1656
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,720
Impart that it was kingly

1657
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
With that

1658
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,608
Can't really prove that king equal snake

1659
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,888
Right doesn't work

1660
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:51,008
The only way his b******* would even be

1661
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,544
Like

1662
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,568
Considered

1663
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,848
The only way that would be

1664
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,896
Considered as if by some

1665
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,176
Ridiculous

1666
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,968
Diculous coincidence

1667
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,272
Literally every human language

1668
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,552
Dog memes.

1669
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,856
Well there's only two

1670
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,648
Do we know of one is that average

1671
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:12,000
Right

1672
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,536
Puzzle

1673
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,072
Sweet mystery for linguists

1674
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:18,144
Not really long time

1675
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,496
But if it was like oh in Chinese the word dog the sound dog

1676
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,776
Transfers to

1677
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,544
Dog

1678
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,592
English dog is Dog

1679
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:31,456
And in Swahili.

1680
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:34,784
I would just be like so much of a coincidence that you

1681
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:39,904
You could not help but think maybe there's something by agreed that would be a Cause.

1682
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:40,672
Take a step back

1683
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,208
I still do

1684
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,232
Approve anything

1685
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:44,768
Because a lot of those cultures

1686
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,792
Might have

1687
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:48,352
Etymological roots of

1688
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,656
Whatever dog is based on

1689
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,424
That

1690
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,192
Could be being

1691
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:54,240
Played with

1692
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,520
Between like cross-cultural

1693
01:23:57,568 --> 01:24:00,896
Like I know my my we've loaded everybody called the dog.

1694
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,688
Play it still

1695
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,224
Prove his argument that alien

1696
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,504
Created language

1697
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:12,160
Oh listen to you continue

1698
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:17,792
Instead of like

1699
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,240
Psych

1700
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,288
Not kick him out of the office

1701
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,896
Every language

1702
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,712
Even an American and

1703
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:38,272
French and different sign languages

1704
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,808
Everybody knows

1705
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:40,832
That that

1706
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,880
That you are sitting on right there

1707
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:43,648
Is an office

1708
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,232
Everybody says everybody

1709
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:50,048
Snake that's because of demons and aliens

1710
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,984
Casual are they working against

1711
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:04,384
The serpent is that everybody's ever really taken down and argue

1712
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,152
You meant by saying

1713
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:05,920
What about

1714
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:12,320
Startups what is the sign of the serpent office in Greek

1715
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,344
Like what if

1716
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,648
Then Buck

1717
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,952
System startup

1718
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,976
Who are evil

1719
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,000
Internet themselves

1720
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:20,768
That allow you

1721
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,048
Dress casually

1722
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,584
They are there were two

1723
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,120
Did the serpent sister

1724
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,888
Right

1725
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,168
How did you deal with that

1726
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:32,800
Well we've been having the great Noti Wars for a long time

1727
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:36,384
And that is not including people

1728
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,432
But not as a major

1729
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,224
Your player so you got Google

1730
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,784
Right

1731
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,576
Add a note

1732
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:52,000
I don't know what you want to do that and imagine everyone their worst eyes cry

1733
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:55,072
Google where's Dartmouth banking operations Binaca

1734
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,376
It's those extra four letters that's what

1735
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,168
That's why

1736
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,704
Bakery

1737
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,752
He doesn't know he's lying

1738
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,032
That's one

1739
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800
I want

1740
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:08,896
There's an inch

1741
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,664
Justin problem

1742
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,200
Without you even for people like

1743
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,224
Who

1744
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,784
Like I think I think there is

1745
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:15,808
Intrinsic

1746
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,344
Egyptian

1747
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,392
Hieroglyphics

1748
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,184
Are always a sore

1749
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,720
About what

1750
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,536
Imparted here

1751
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,560
The perfect

1752
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,864
Translation

1753
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,912
Rise of a lot of hieroglyphics

1754
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,448
Really understand

1755
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,216
The idioms

1756
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,032
It becomes much more difficult

1757
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,848
I will say this

1758
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,176
Does not study

1759
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,296
Sometimes it takes a fresh pair of

1760
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:50,368
I agree with I agree with me one

1761
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,136
Primus

1762
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:51,904
He's making

1763
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,184
That is

1764
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,208
Well now I think

1765
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:57,536
He probably would say that but it's not part of his argument

1766
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,816
I don't think there's a

1767
01:26:59,328 --> 01:26:59,840
Understanding

1768
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,120
Any academic

1769
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,912
Of the hieroglyphic

1770
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,680
Language

1771
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
From

1772
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,288
I think that's probably I don't know I have

1773
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,312
100-percent

1774
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,336
I think that's the

1775
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,152
Where he goes from there

1776
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,432
Is not good

1777
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,016
Very good

1778
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:21,856
Probably going to disappoint a lot of y'all

1779
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,928
I think we

1780
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:31,840
Willa dealing with

1781
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:34,656
Also a relationship

1782
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,472
You have to understand.

1783
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,776
Do not want this information disseminated

1784
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:44,640
So there are if you like example

1785
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,176
Heartless

1786
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:52,832
Brookwood

1787
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:56,928
Priest-class

1788
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,000
Are there villain

1789
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:05,120
From Context Clues

1790
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:12,544
Okay I mean I never went out circulation in the priesthood know how to read

1791
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,896
They just don't make sense

1792
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:22,528
Agree completely

1793
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,296
That

1794
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,576
Ino just

1795
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,368
We just want to say that I have noticed

1796
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,136
Stop

1797
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:30,976
If you study the glyphs

1798
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,280
Listen

1799
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:35,840
Explanation

1800
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,912
They try to tell you what one thing

1801
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:39,936
Looks like

1802
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:45,568
It almost never looks like what they say it looks like and yet it does look like something

1803
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,432
Castle

1804
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,552
Concealment

1805
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:58,880
The two things that are that

1806
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:01,440
Just talkin over Cary

1807
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:03,488
Very rude

1808
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,024
Let's play this out

1809
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,048
I'll be karaoke

1810
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,072
You be someone at

1811
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,912
That one

1812
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,752
I well I was going to say that it

1813
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,032
Actually looks

1814
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:19,360
A little bit like my arms are crossed

1815
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,640
Sakhmet

1816
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,176
Who is

1817
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,456
Eyebrows

1818
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,296
Okay

1819
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:30,368
Now there is a lot of room for interpretation

1820
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:34,208
There are many different things that can go on it

1821
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,232
100%

1822
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:39,072
I do believe that we understand it enough to point to the fact that

1823
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:41,376
This is been seen on many different worse

1824
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,656
Chip sites for the godson

1825
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:47,264
And so we can kind of draw from all of these conclusions that

1826
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,312
They were most likely referencing this

1827
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,872
I can see your frustration

1828
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,152
Space

1829
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:53,920
Ship

1830
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,480
Alright

1831
01:29:56,736 --> 01:30:02,880
We're going to have to get you out of this McDonald I am a map

1832
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:10,560
I imagine happens like I go around

1833
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,096
I go to these tours

1834
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,144
Hieroglyphs

1835
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,168
People who are on the

1836
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,448
Tours in the expert

1837
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:19,776
They don't like what I see in it

1838
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:23,616
That's fine. Two different conversations they're trying to lie to you

1839
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:25,152
You about it

1840
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,432
And then also I do

1841
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,712
Just did I just say

1842
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:30,528
Regard

1843
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,808
Dismissing of Scholars

1844
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:34,624
But because the people that he's claiming or lying about

1845
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,160
Dedicated

1846
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:37,184
F****** life

1847
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,208
This research

1848
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,048
This is another really important

1849
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,840
Done what

1850
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:44,864
A debauch

1851
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,632
Is done

1852
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,656
I love these

1853
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,424
People are project

1854
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,264
Is short circuit take a shortcut around

1855
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,312
Like legitimate

1856
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:55,360
Rigorous study right

1857
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,896
Because people in academics

1858
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:59,200
Things you study I don't know linguistic

1859
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,736
Study evolution of

1860
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,528
They study cross-cultural

1861
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,552
Language

1862
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:05,088
Did the way there

1863
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:07,904
Uncultured then it's

1864
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,440
Borrowed

1865
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:11,232
Like

1866
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,024
The form of

1867
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,304
Actually

1868
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,120
What he's done

1869
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,144
Created the

1870
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:20,960
Without

1871
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,240
Any of the critters

1872
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:23,520
Come to the academic

1873
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:26,848
Because if you are you saying that his

1874
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,128
If you are someone who is

1875
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:29,664
In the f****** academic world

1876
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,432
You were baking

1877
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,456
Arguments

1878
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,992
You would never it

1879
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,016
Would never fly

1880
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:36,832
All the academic world is is about

1881
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:37,856
Being like

1882
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,672
Let's let's look at what you're saying

1883
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,976
And if you are right

1884
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,000
Hooray

1885
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,280
But if you're not

1886
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:46,816
Perreo Sola

1887
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,352
Because then we can refine our ideas

1888
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:51,424
From there

1889
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,448
Team from

1890
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,216
And hope week

1891
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,240
Figure out a way

1892
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,520
That also help

1893
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:56,800
Future Honest

1894
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,592
And because he's not willing to

1895
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,616
Engage in that process

1896
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:01,408
Nephew lives entirely outside

1897
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:03,200
Of the academic world but

1898
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,224
Still pretend

1899
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,248
The part of it

1900
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,272
And all that does is

1901
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:07,808
It's a cheat

1902
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:15,232
Alex

1903
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,536
I said Alex

1904
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:19,072
Because in Ennis

1905
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,352
They start

1906
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,376
Talking about some really

1907
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,144
Galaxy

1908
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,168
Okay

1909
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,192
And some of these things

1910
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,472
Or exactly what

1911
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,496
Heard Alex

1912
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,800
On Rogan's pod

1913
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:34,944
Also

1914
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,712
Getting.

1915
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,088
So there's a military structure

1916
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,672
The reptilians again having a militant a hierarchy

1917
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,696
Call structure

1918
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:48,768
And they are where you get you know the Army gets

1919
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:49,792
It's orders.

1920
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:55,168
Absolutely centralized intelligence

1921
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:59,008
Where we have there is Carrie a

1922
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,312
Express exactly what Alex

1923
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:05,152
Was talking about for a very long time on Rogan podcast

1924
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,480
These alien

1925
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:12,832
Literally speak to you are given the military and intelligence order

1926
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,112
Stuff like that

1927
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:17,184
That is the big truth that Alex wanted to

1928
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,464
The drop

1929
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:22,304
His you take all the military the general generals

1930
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,096
Vmg and then they go into meetings

1931
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:25,888
All that s***

1932
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,984
That's what's being expressed by carry a stomach here

1933
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,008
Like

1934
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,288
What would

1935
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:36,384
Look at that stuff coming out of Alex's mouth it's not interesting

1936
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,920
It's exactly what.

1937
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:38,944
Youth fox say

1938
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,992
The point I want to make

1939
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,272
Is that like

1940
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,064
He's not treated like these

1941
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:45,856
Bucking chute

1942
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,904
You should be seen as a

1943
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,672
You have

1944
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:52,512
Yeah you're being like

1945
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,048
Maybe he's talk

1946
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:56,352
About some secret document I haven't read

1947
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,120
He hasn't

1948
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,448
Talkin about the same s*** that's on Project Camelot

1949
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,008
Justice unfounded

1950
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,336
It's really disappointing that everything is

1951
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,616
F****** related to it

1952
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:14,016
Like episode episodes about the Sandy Hook investigation and then the very next thing we do

1953
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,040
Something modern

1954
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:15,808
With

1955
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,600
Tim and Joe Rogan

1956
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:24,000
We talked about Sandy Hook let's do a project Camelot episode that'll be fun and unrelated

1957
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,816
Everything and then bam it's right

1958
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:32,448
Some of that is the sort of just the foundation of why this show exist

1959
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:38,080
When we started this and the reason the Project Camelot is part of our sphere is because Thursday Loki

1960
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,360
Connection between

1961
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:40,640
Like it's not like

1962
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,920
It's not like that

1963
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:47,040
It doesn't always come up

1964
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:47,808
Really important

1965
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,088
It is the same

1966
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:49,856
I'm sort of

1967
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:52,928
That's why I named the show they're all con men

1968
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,976
Or something like that you know

1969
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:03,680
Play the longer Twitter handle that's for sure

1970
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,008
It is

1971
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,544
People are playing with

1972
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,080
Masks

1973
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,360
Maybe you're different prison

1974
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:16,480
Yeah that is

1975
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,272
Manipulating gullible people

1976
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,296
Into heaven political

1977
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:22,624
Who's that are f***** up and are really bad

1978
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:27,744
It is up to earlier to talking about their like we're under maritime law that's trying to

1979
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:28,768
Encourage people

1980
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,048
Be Sovereign citizen

1981
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,120
Ubisoft

1982
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,680
That's what hard right is he

1983
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,056
You know that

1984
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,896
Boil

1985
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:47,968
In Greek is actually basilisco so

1986
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,504
Now that's hot

1987
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,088
It's a coil office world

1988
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,184
That's a good product

1989
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:03,840
Where's salad office oil it's going to really do I don't know what do you need in the office

1990
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:06,400
Through the day

1991
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,680
That was one

1992
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:09,728
40 /

1993
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:10,496
About like

1994
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,520
What Alex is bringing him

1995
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,288
The world map

1996
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,360
Much like a

1997
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:18,944
Pierre I can't prove any of this

1998
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,712
Partially in in

1999
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,784
30 recognizes that

2000
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,576
These sorts of ideas are really attractive

2001
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,136
He might be able to pay

2002
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:32,000
Yeah yeah

2003
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,536
Even Project Camelot

2004
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:34,560
Nurse who are

2005
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,328
Into the

2006
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,888
So the idea is it like

2007
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:38,912
He's mirroring

2008
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,448
Here.

2009
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,240
Edit bases

2010
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,008
Probably

2011
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,032
Just alyx trying

2012
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,336
His audience

2013
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:49,152
Portfolio

2014
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:49,920
The same time

2015
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:50,944
Do you still Express

2016
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:53,504
This next clip

2017
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,272
Does a little bit worse

2018
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,296
Because

2019
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,344
Scary mirroring Alex

2020
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,368
And not very.

2021
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,696
So we're also talking about

2022
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,232
Money

2023
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,280
As being a form of

2024
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,728
Imprisoned by this financial

2025
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:16,544
Indebtedness and then

2026
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,128
Yeah and then this is how they rule is through

2027
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:22,688
The indebtedness that one is supposed to

2028
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,248
Feel and behave as if

2029
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,088
And then their control over money as the Rothschilds

2030
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,624
Of course the red shield

2031
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:37,024
You are hiding that the the higher levels of the Anunnaki

2032
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:38,816
Illuminati

2033
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,936
Their services to hide the others right

2034
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:45,984
He does agree

2035
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,312
It's just a

2036
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,592
Federal Reserve

2037
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,152
With

2038
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,944
Like a little bit better

2039
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,712
Dressing on

2040
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:57,504
That's the same

2041
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,576
Years ago about the idea of the Ross

2042
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,856
Child's Run the World

2043
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:02,624
Wingstop near me

2044
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:04,160
Hidden Powers behind

2045
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,976
She's just powers are there

2046
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:09,024
Well

2047
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:12,608
I do remember this

2048
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:15,680
I do remember that both Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders

2049
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:16,704
Steamed up to audit

2050
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,984
The aliens

2051
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,032
Correct

2052
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:27,200
The Federal Reserve was created

2053
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:31,040
Really find the most

2054
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:31,808
Repulsive

2055
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:33,344
It's all bulshit

2056
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,648
There is an idea

2057
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:37,696
Is the system

2058
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:38,464
That that

2059
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:39,488
United States

2060
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,512
Credibly

2061
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,536
Abusive system

2062
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:43,072
Business interest

2063
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:43,840
Used to

2064
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,376
Make you in

2065
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,680
Incapable of escaping their grass

2066
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,960
2/3 mix.

2067
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:51,008
You know Alexa

2068
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,288
They do not

2069
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,592
Some sort of Anna farias globalist

2070
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,640
Alien plot

2071
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:57,920
It's

2072
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,456
The extension of

2073
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,576
You can't get away with it

2074
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:05,856
And you're an amoral

2075
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:07,648
Company why wouldn't you trapped

2076
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,440
Why wouldn't you

2077
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:12,768
It makes the most sense financially

2078
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:18,656
Note so many of these people whatever they want whenever they describe all of these problems

2079
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:19,936
And then

2080
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:23,008
Ghetto you come up to them with historical basis

2081
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,640
You know whenever people describe is making us all slaves you know like all of this stuff

2082
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:33,248
And the solutions that are

2083
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,272
They're like

2084
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:41,952
Finale was not enough racism and it sounds like socialism so I'm going to go with us it's probably a lie

2085
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,024
The s*** why would she

2086
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:48,864
Come into the studio and be like listen I have just uncovered a new plot

2087
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:51,680
The reptilians have started payday loans

2088
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,216
Or something like that

2089
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,240
Why not

2090
01:39:54,496 --> 01:40:00,640
Cuz then you could use your services for good

2091
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:04,736
They charge

2092
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:06,784
Don't f******

2093
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:13,184
Who's whatever narratives your ear bandying about Notre Dame demonize the Rothschilds is it that f****** matters notion

2094
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,464
Their family's wealth

2095
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,024
Been diffused over generation

2096
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:21,120
Right now

2097
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:25,984
For some sort of positive thing like that

2098
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,520
Target your f****** audien

2099
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:33,152
Prisons and we need to get rid of it

2100
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,712
Why not why not

2101
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:36,992
If you care why not

2102
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,784
Well because

2103
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:42,112
I don't know I think it's because

2104
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:45,696
They're trying to attract and they know they're trying to

2105
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,488
Like that's hard

2106
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:50,560
When whenever I whenever we talk about self-awareness

2107
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,328
The farthest

2108
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,704
Even if you're saying that they are are on the stupid evil Spectrum

2109
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:59,264
You know where they're more on the stupid side

2110
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,616
They're smart enough to know who is going to buy their b*******

2111
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,152
It's right winger

2112
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,480
Ugly stupid

2113
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,504
It's that whatever

2114
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,344
Whatever language they want

2115
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,392
It whatever they want their points to

2116
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:16,928
Ardmore track

2117
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:18,720
People on

2118
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,024
Absolutely

2119
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,120
I mean it

2120
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,400
Some of the day would never

2121
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:31,008
But he was like I was a tribe of the

2122
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:35,104
The political divide

2123
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:35,872
I'm talk about it

2124
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,664
Got all that s***

2125
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:38,944
No

2126
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,736
You know damn well

2127
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,576
Is attractive

2128
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
AR

2129
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,160
Aggressively

2130
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:50,208
Like skeptical pasta

2131
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:53,280
Reasonability

2132
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,328
Hallmark

2133
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:57,888
For sure

2134
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:58,656
So

2135
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:03,008
Work

2136
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:07,104
Look I know that your guy loves

2137
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:16,832
Novel

2138
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,624
I don't do superhero,

2139
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:19,648
I can't do them

2140
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,440
But have you ever in your life

2141
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:25,280
Are younger man I've never done superhero

2142
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:31,680
Swamp Thing on the superhero powers

2143
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:34,752
Tragic representation of the damage that we are doing

2144
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,520
To the environment

2145
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,312
I understand

2146
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:38,336
Superhero

2147
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:41,408
I don't think so he has powers

2148
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,712
Powers don't make you talk to the guardian

2149
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:44,736
Dad

2150
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,528
So many people could be Spider-Man

2151
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,832
It's not about Spider-Man

2152
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,904
It's about the choice to be a hero.

2153
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:55,232
Okay so now

2154
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,304
Like Marvel stuff

2155
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:04,704
Are you just saying if they aren't superheroes

2156
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,472
Gyros

2157
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:13,664
Thrust behind

2158
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:20,832
Engage with the mythology of it I don't read the

2159
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:23,648
Ethology

2160
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:25,184
Because we're about to we are going to get in

2161
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:31,840
Superheroes in

2162
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,912
I remember the Greek for Ironman

2163
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,448
Is actually

2164
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,216
Iron

2165
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,240
Experiments

2166
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:43,360
Nampa Idaho

2167
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,176
So Jordan

2168
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:46,944
Here Comes

2169
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:48,736
We're getting into comic books

2170
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,040
Be ready I don't know

2171
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:52,832
Think about this

2172
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:53,856
I think this is really fast

2173
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,672
G

2174
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,696
Nope

2175
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:00,256
Terry is bringing in stuff

2176
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,536
This is very familiar

2177
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:02,304
Alex Jones

2178
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,328
Phones world

2179
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,608
Then trying to

2180
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,632
To bridge the gap

2181
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:07,936
World

2182
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:08,960
Like

2183
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,264
Really insane

2184
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,336
When I heard this place I got really trouble

2185
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,432
You'll see

2186
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,248
But what I want to ask you how

2187
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:23,296
To do with the role of five

2188
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:26,368
Which is the internet

2189
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:32,000
Follow the information and as well as

2190
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:36,864
In connection with technology

2191
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:41,984
Do you even see has a lot of radiation and that this is somehow

2192
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:46,080
Supposed to be detrimental to at the same time

2193
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:49,152
It's quite possible that this radiation

2194
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:54,528
That mutant if you follow the X-Men story and this is

2195
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,600
Space Program knowledge.

2196
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,392
If you want to

2197
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:05,792
Basically a human for special powers in human

2198
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:10,656
Get them to expand into that their brain that they use excetera

2199
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,192
What you need to do is

2200
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:16,544
Houston with radiation or doused the mother with radiation

2201
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:20,640
Yeah this is what they are doing now planet Earth and

2202
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:23,968
People are in a panic over this

2203
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,040
People are in a panic

2204
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:32,928
People are in a panic

2205
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,208
Acknowledge

2206
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:34,976
LG but there

2207
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,512
Their concern seems slightly

2208
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,280
Difference

2209
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:40,096
Inasmuch as carries cancer

2210
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,376
And the ex

2211
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:44,192
More like a bonus

2212
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,776
You watch any of those movies

2213
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:48,544
You know that

2214
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:50,336
Pretty terribly

2215
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:52,640
Right

2216
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:54,176
Magneto

2217
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:56,992
Or whatever.

2218
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:57,760
He did a people just

2219
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:58,528
Accepted Newton

2220
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:02,624
Allegory

2221
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,416
Just like Jessica

2222
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,208
Completely destructive villain

2223
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:08,512
Yeah like that guy who was a toad or whatever

2224
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:15,424
Free creative

2225
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,704
I get I get it

2226
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:18,752
Do you know

2227
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,032
Do you know why

2228
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:22,336
Do you know why all of those arguments

2229
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,616
Easily

2230
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,920
Bulshit

2231
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:26,944
Incredibly stupid

2232
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,504
Just on their face

2233
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,784
The X-Men is a Sikh

2234
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,576
Secret space program plan

2235
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,344
Of course

2236
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:35,904
No that's that's utterly stupid

2237
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:40,256
But part of the reason that it is such a stupid idea is because

2238
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:41,792
Those comics

2239
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,072
Started

2240
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:47,680
Around the timeline when we understood

2241
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,704
Radiation

2242
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:50,240
Right so

2243
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:54,336
If something's going to bring up a little bit later

2244
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:59,200
We're radiation to be capable of creating powers

2245
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:00,736
It would have happened

2246
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,296
70 f****** years ago

2247
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:10,464
In the early 60s late 50s comic books

2248
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,232
Restarting

2249
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:13,280
To be created it became a MacGuffin

2250
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:15,328
Became like a storytelling

2251
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:17,120
Actually forget

2252
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:19,424
In order to tell these stories

2253
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:24,032
If you really want to get into that it's about people who are different

2254
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:26,592
Not being accepted by

2255
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,640
Humanity as a whole

2256
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:30,176
Dumb people responding

2257
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:32,224
Poorly to that in some people

2258
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:33,248
Trying to

2259
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,016
GeoVista

2260
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:39,136
Of the Xbox

2261
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:40,928
But you can tell 100

2262
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,208
Print stories

2263
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:42,976
And they

2264
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:48,608
Well I mean when you look at the I don't remember

2265
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,912
Did the first of the second X-Men

2266
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:51,680
It was

2267
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,728
Higher

2268
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,800
Coming out allegory there

2269
01:47:57,824 --> 01:48:03,712
This is the gay experience of coming out there is one line that I thought

2270
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:06,784
Justified literally the entire X-Men series

2271
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:09,856
Whenever somebody comes out to their mother as a no

2272
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:10,880
Axeman and she goes

2273
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:16,512
Have you tried not being and you're like that is the f******

2274
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,816
Kingline

2275
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,632
I don't know necessarily

2276
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:23,168
If it was intended to

2277
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,960
Any specific

2278
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:26,496
Group that is other

2279
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,824
Early exit

2280
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,896
About

2281
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,944
Groups that are marginalized

2282
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:35,712
Needing to

2283
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:38,016
To find each other to help each other

2284
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:40,832
Exist in the world where people don't

2285
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:41,600
Understand

2286
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:48,256
Program kind of thing

2287
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:50,048
Gracie's mute

2288
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,328
That's what they were

2289
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,376
Dikets that implies to me

2290
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:55,936
That's something that she's hiding her mind for a while

2291
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:56,960
Fit like

2292
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:03,616
Not even just 5G

2293
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:04,896
Before g-technology

2294
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:07,456
Is it the flood women with

2295
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:08,736
Do they give super baby

2296
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:11,040
Do you know how you can

2297
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:13,600
Tentatively

2298
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,392
Is because

2299
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:18,464
With radiation

2300
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:23,072
Whenever radiation was this new cool

2301
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:25,632
Something they used to put it in goddamn toothpaste

2302
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:27,424
Heathwood glow

2303
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,240
You then lost all your teeth

2304
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,776
Another good

2305
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:32,800
Lost Sawyer

2306
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:33,824
Another good

2307
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:35,872
What is a general stubblebine

2308
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:37,664
Create superpowers

2309
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,200
People that failed miserably

2310
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:45,856
Military test where they would set off

2311
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,392
It would set off a nuclear bomb

2312
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:51,232
And they would have if I know what you're going to say

2313
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,768
Bunch of soldiers got to

2314
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,304
Superpowers

2315
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,400
Training exercise where they walked

2316
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:00,704
Through the

2317
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,240
Debris that was left over

2318
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:05,312
Whether or not they were visible and what

2319
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:07,104
We could set up a nuclear bomb

2320
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,408
And then we could use that

2321
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:10,432
Is a cloaking Tech

2322
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,968
And those guys

2323
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:12,736
Did not

2324
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:16,576
Superpowers bulshit

2325
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:17,600
That is how that

2326
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:24,256
Bulshit is operating under a I don't

2327
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:26,816
No 70 rolled

2328
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:27,584
Do you understand

2329
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,352
What radiator

2330
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:30,400
Exactly

2331
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:31,168
That's

2332
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:33,984
Nut hold on hold on

2333
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:38,592
Percent of people who get exposed to

2334
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:41,408
01

2335
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:47,808
They're all in bunkers having their secret abilities test

2336
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:48,576
Sounds

2337
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,440
I would say

2338
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:54,720
In terms of

2339
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:56,768
Approve

2340
01:50:58,816 --> 01:50:59,328
Whatever

2341
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:01,632
Is like a side

2342
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:08,032
If you want to tell me

2343
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:10,080
They all say I rejected

2344
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:12,640
First

2345
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:15,456
If you told me that 99.9% of people

2346
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,480
Exposed

2347
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,248
Two tons and tons

2348
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:20,064
Horrible debilitating

2349
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:20,832
Right now

2350
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,184
Or whatever

2351
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,976
Get super powers in the government

2352
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,256
In the lab

2353
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:30,816
I'm going to tell you I can't disprove that

2354
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:32,352
I don't think

2355
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,376
The true right

2356
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,424
My gut says no

2357
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,728
And I'll wait until there's any evidence

2358
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,264
You say it is

2359
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:43,360
The bad represented

2360
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:45,920
Because what you said

2361
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,200
Text clip

2362
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:48,224

These Brave brought that into

2413
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:55,616
It's okay coming in

2414
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,408

Friendly neighborhood spider

2450
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:50,560
No matter what the argument is it's unacceptable

2451
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,168
Ausable

2452
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:56,960

It's crazy

2454
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:02,848
That is 104

2455
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:05,920
This is not the first

2456
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:07,456
Conspiracy douchebag

2457
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:09,504
To talk about Marvel character

2458
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:10,528
And radiator

2459
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:14,112
Conferences

2460
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:16,160
So many of these paranormal bulshit

2461
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:17,696
Schooner or later

2462
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:19,232
In her path

2463
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:24,096
20-year career of being a conspiracy theorist

2464
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:26,912
Somebody must have been at a panel at have been like

2465
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:33,568
Mutants are creative it's just like in spider

2466
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:41,504
And I think there's one

2467
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,272
Possibilities

2468
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:44,576
Just working with us so well don't carry

2469
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:49,184
It hinges on Reese

2470
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:54,048
Let's laugh at this or whatever

2471
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:02,240
But I do remember the TV service

2472
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,776
Incredible Hulk

2473
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:05,824
Incredible Hulk

2474
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:12,480
Level of gamma radiation

2475
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:15,296
I have recently also found that the

2476
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:19,648
Spider-Man with also bit by a radioactive spider

2477
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:23,232
This is very cute because this is where they are going

2478
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:26,560
She is so deadpan it's hard to tell

2479
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,864
Not a bit

2480
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:35,264
Also Phil Hartman levels right now

2481
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,032
Also didn't

2482
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,080
Radiation

2483
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:40,896
Because of something

2484
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:46,784
He doesn't become the Hulk because of the radio

2485
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:51,392
That's the root of it

2486
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:54,464
He's Bruce Banner David Banner depending on

2487
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,072
Yeah

2488
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:06,240
I like the idea that she

2489
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:08,032
Like I said

2490
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:08,800
Well

2491
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:09,568
Well plate

2492
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:12,384
Second is Snow dead

2493
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,408
Orthodontics

2494
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:15,968
I think it is probably

2495
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:17,248
Speculating

2496
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:18,528
Is the into the spider-verse

2497
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,344
And it's a more diverse

2498
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:24,160
Version vampires

2499
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:25,952
People end up

2500
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:28,512
That have been attacking much more from the right

2501
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:33,376
In the same way that went Ghostbusters Ghostbusters came out

2502
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:37,984
Everyone on the right was to protect and they're like f*** this I hate this noise

2503
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,032
And so the ideas like into the spider-verse

2504
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:40,800
Being a movie

2505
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:42,592
They came out with a black

2506
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:48,736
Spider-Man other Spider-Woman Spider-Man

2507
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:52,064
Right

2508
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:55,648
Spider-Pig Peter Porker

2509
01:59:55,904 --> 02:00:02,048
Spider-Man

2510
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,072
Dia of

2511
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,144
That identity

2512
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:06,912
Spider-Man

2513
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,496
Just there was so much right wing

2514
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,312
He's online

2515
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:14,848
That you became aware of it

2516
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:17,920
Is also the Multiverse theory in

2517
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:21,760
Into the spider-verse so that maybe one of the read

2518
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:23,808
Jason said it penetrated into her Bowl

2519
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:28,160
How many maybe but I think I think the bigotry is a much more like

2520
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:30,976
Right

2521
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:33,024
Why is it now stuck in your craw

2522
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,048
It's been

2523
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:38,656
Almost sent Spider-Man came out

2524
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:39,424
Like

2525
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:42,752
It's been a long f****** time

2526
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,800
I don't know

2527
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:46,336
70

2528
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:50,432
I think

2529
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:53,504
Superman

2530
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,320
Is an alien

2531
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,624
It's not even from here

2532
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:10,400
You know what I did

2533
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:13,472
The globalist

2534
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:17,824
Did you hear what I just recently

2535
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:18,848
This

2536
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:19,616
Goblin King

2537
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:22,432
Whole Foods

2538
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:25,504
Banana

2539
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,040
Is the Green Goblin

2540
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:45,728
I'm not sure if I'm going to go with Aquaman

2541
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:46,752
You know what's crazy

2542
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:51,360
What's up watch the Aquaman movie the most recent

2543
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:53,408
Weather

2544
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,944
Really negative

2545
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:02,624
There's this massive undersea War about whatever it is

2546
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,440
Is right and Jason Momoa Aquaman

2547
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:08,512
Can communicate with all of the animals or whatever

2548
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:12,864
But it's not presented as communication so much as it is mine control

2549
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:19,264
So what Jason Momoa does is create an army of

2550
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,032
Slave

2551
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:23,360
Nobody ever talks about that

2552
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:26,688
Well I don't disagree

2553
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:36,672
Cars

2554
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:37,440
Oh yeah

2555
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,208
Spiraled out of

2556
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:51,776
These guys are still go to driving cars

2557
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:57,152
. but I lost the thread don't know how to do this

2558
02:02:57,408 --> 02:03:00,992
Coming out I can't wait for it

2559
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:03,296
83 Howell

2560
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:08,416
Which are the complete inability to die regardless

2561
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:10,208
To have that Wolverine

2562
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:15,840
Regenerative main character Shield to Avery

2563
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:18,912
Anyway that's a

2564
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:19,936
Is better than

2565
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:20,704
Spider-Man

2566
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:26,592
You haven't seen into the spider-verse actually really really great

2567
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,920
Passengers is better than all other franchises

2568
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:31,200
Of all time

2569
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:37,856
Anyway I'll talk about that because it's the craziest

2570
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:39,136
B******* in the world

2571
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:42,720
It's nonsense

2572
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:46,560
So we come to the end of this episode Jordan and what we have is

2573
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:48,864
In front of us a tableau of like just someone

2574
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:50,400
Doesn't understand linguistics

2575
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:51,680
Linguistic

2576
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,472
Which is fun

2577
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,008
I think that Robert

2578
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:57,568
And I always enjoyed

2579
02:03:57,824 --> 02:03:58,336
That's what

2580
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:00,384
We got to talk about that

2581
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:04,992
Did the

2582
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:06,784
Influence of the Alex

2583
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:08,576
Whether it's

2584
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:09,600
Sovereign state

2585
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,136
Whether it's

2586
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,416
Rothschild Bank

2587
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:14,976
Whether it's

2588
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:16,512
The ideas of life

2589
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:17,280
What's 5G

2590
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,048
Being dangerous

2591
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:18,816
Yeah

2592
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:19,584
Play kits

2593
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:21,632
These worlds are similar

2594
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,936
The way they're not similar

2595
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:25,472
Alex

2596
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,496
Concerned about 5G

2597
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:27,776
As trying to give

2598
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:28,544
Cancer

2599
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:34,944
Serious concern has recently found out about Spider-Man

2600
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:37,248
Which is nuts

2601
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:38,016
It's nuts

2602
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:39,296
I love it

2603
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:45,696
That's why we talked about this I don't like that Alex has a literal reasonable

2604
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:46,464
Position

2605
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:51,584
In terms of radiation causing cancer

2606
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,632
Is it based in

2607
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:54,400
It is

2608
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:55,936
Bananas exaggerate

2609
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:59,008
But the idea of radiation causing cancer

2610
02:04:59,264 --> 02:04:59,776
Make sense

2611
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,312
It's fair

2612
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:02,592
Yeah where at

2613
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:04,384
Radiation creating the X-Men

2614
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:05,664
Not fair

2615
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:10,784
The idea that you don't know this I can't get over that

2616
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:11,808
Good job good on you

2617
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,856
Goodonya

2618
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:17,952
Tabaxi Eddie Bravo this episode

2619
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:20,768
Reality-based

2620
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:22,048
I'm so I'm glad we

2621
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,376
Weird for us to do this on a Monday

2622
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:26,144
But that's what it is

2623
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:32,544
Is

2624
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:33,824
We needed a breath

2625
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,360
We all little bit of a

2626
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,640
We all need

2627
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:39,712
Another episode

2628
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:43,296
You with

2629
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,392
Geppetto

2630
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:49,952
Debra wants to go check out a believe there's actual

2631
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:57,120
On Facebook I'm not good at I'm not good at promotional

2632
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:57,888
Free promotion

2633
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:01,728
Nothing like that but

2634
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:05,056
You can find it Cosmic Geppetto's good time I really enjoyed talking to

2635
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:07,104
Amanda I mean

2636
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,664
If you listen to this podcast pretty regularly I don't think

2637
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,456
We talked about all that much

2638
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:12,480
That's new

2639
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,064
So check it out

2640
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:18,112
Good

2641
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:19,136
Beyond

2642
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:23,488
For my plugs if you would like to see me do stand-up
