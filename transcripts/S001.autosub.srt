00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
Just the existence of them I shouldn't watch

00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Grotesque

73
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664

Time in my life

We have begun

120
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
To take necessary

121
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239

Trump going

00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,791
Big fan of intelligence briefings and then everything going to ship

What could he have done

138
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
That room really

139
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,471
At least pretended to be a

00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
F****** know

141
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,591
Who's very convinced of his incompetence

142
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,199
He probably would have only screwed it up more

143
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,503
What what we put in

144
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783

Bubble wrap

150
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743

Just full of bubble wrap

152
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:03,935
Whenever he comes out of it 6 years from now whatever

00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,007
Bubble wrap

154
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,151

Give him a little bit

198
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
That is the duty of the American government and then he

199
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
Talks about shutting down

200
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
The suppression of

Cult leader nonsense

220
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
Millions of videos

221
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,975
Well that Maybe not maybe hundreds of thousands

222
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,607
Is amazingly boring

223
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:51,263
But this is unconscionable

224
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
Wondering

225
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
Exist

On the past episodes when I was so mad how long is he been talking for

229
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,719
It seems like a year this is the most boring human being ever

230
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,535
He is at his job

231
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,655
Merit

232
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,215
So he's boring

233
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Alright

234
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
His drool

235
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
Is in stark contrast

236
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
To Alex's

237
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Frenetic

238
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
Insane pace

239
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,479
Yeah but it's sort of Elders

240
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,319
We've all fallen in love with Alex Jones

241
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
Glacier David Knight

242
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183

243
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,583
Are you sure he's trying to I'm trying to find a corollary like the only thing I can think of is

244
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
Hey Alexa

245
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Okay

246
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959

251
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943

David Knight

259
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
Not worth knowing is named it's not worth

260
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
Let's see how it looks

261
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087

Big at Arnold Schwarzenegger because Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,879
He just throws us out there as a joke.

280
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
But that's the only thing

281
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
Out of this

282
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
Significant speech that he gave the only thing that the media

283
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Want to talk about

284
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
Of course when he talked about

285
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631

This whole time to he is not made icon

289
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:12,223
Contact with camera is just looking down at papers of course not

290
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,879
If you looked into his eyes you would see the empty otamatone that exist

291
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
The in-between

292
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
You just need dirty.

293
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,327
If you'd like do you remember Men In Black do you remember watching that movie

That's what David Knight teams like to me

301
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
There's a tiny little alien inside of his head

302
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
Driving a David Knight

303
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975

Do I

338
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,823
Do I think that Obama believes in religion the way that

339
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Christians believe in

340
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,663

Tended

352
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
At the very least

353
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
To give a s*** about.

354
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Trump

00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
I made fun

356
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,551
Schwarzenegger's ratings ratings are great

357
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
Those are bad

358
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
That is

359
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
1

360
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Hilarious

361
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,863
I want a black was I one hundred percent support a president

362
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,263
If it weren't for the score for the rest of all the ship

363
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,383
What are the things that I'm having to wrestle with

364
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
More and more like

365
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
Bailey is

366
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
How

367
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
It might suck

368
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
Wenxuecity

369
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Is petty

370
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
In the real world

371
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:05,695
How funny it is in constant diarrhea

372
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
Has other things

373
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
To it

374
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:17,215
So scary if we lived in the real world Obama is doing all of the other

375
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
Normal stuff that he does

376
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,335
And then just one day he just shows up that at the National Prayer Breakfast

377
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
That is just a

378
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
Dick

379
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
That's so f****** funny

380
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
But still funny

381
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,855
Trump like no regrets can be all lit on fire but also

382
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
In order for this

383
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Analogy to make

384
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,023
Accent like let's say Obama put out a single

385
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:46,911
Before word for he was president

386
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,727
The junior high with put out a single

387
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
The-Dream

388
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
Right if so

389
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
Migos the prayer breakfast is like

390
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Look

391
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,687
Wasn't I know the dreams got a great great song

392
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
It's better

393
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,319
Hilarious hilarious

394
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,135
But ya never exist in real world

395
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,695
This is the world we live in

396
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:14,815
Anyway here's more boring ass Days of Night

397
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
The bigger story

398
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
More so

399
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,471
Ban what came out of these quotes with a not there true now course the Mexican Government

400
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,751
Has denied

401
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
What was

402
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
Leaked to the

403
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Associated Press

404
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
Mexican government

405
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:31,967
Slammed the claim as a downright

406
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
Troops to Max

407
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,087
The co if they don't take care of them

408
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
It's an affectation

409
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
Donald Trump might

410
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
Send troops to

411
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,791
Like who the f*** talks like that

412
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:51,935
That I'm not picking up

413
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Mug

414
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,823
It sounds smart it's very small it sounds like such a it sounds like

415
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,895
It sounds like Madonna coming back from

416
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Britain

417
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:07,295
What being married to Guy Ritchie whenever Alex

418
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,855
It's kind of weird attacks on his ear

419
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,647
Yeah there's that towel

420
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
Yeah that were David Knight

421
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Lies

422
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
Is this

423
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,095
Speaks his smugness picks up a little bit money

424
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
He's one of these like

425
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,519
Brownie playlist bad video games

426
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,335
Like like Megaman

427
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,871
The early Mega Man games

428
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,663
Are you there

429
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,551
Mega Man 2

430
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
The pattern is super

431
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
Liquid-filled Bubble Man

432
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,463
The Robot Masters in into like

433
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
Dr. Wiley

434
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
Dr. Wiley

435
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
Piece of s***

436
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
Super easy

437
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
But like

438
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
You see the pattern

439
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,007
Pretty quickly with the first man to probably not

440
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:03,871
No it was the hardest game. But once you got to make a man

441
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,199
And then you went back to Mega Man 2 you like

442
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,599
I get it

443
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:20,000
MB truck listening to David Knight

444
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Or is

445
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
That David Knight is

446
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
First boss

447
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,704
In Megaman

448
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:38,176
He doesn't have the 11 Alex Alex keeps you on your toes

449
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,576
Zane keeps you entertained wacky bulshit listen to

450
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Maybe

451
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,184
One minute 45 seconds

452
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,512
3 minutes including that

453
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
Developed a respect for Alex

454
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
I could ever have imagined David tonight

455
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
Are the world go

456
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,688
Dirty dossier

457
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:16,064
Is reported to have said what the AP reported that he said was you have a bunch of bad Hombres down there

458
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,904
You're doing a cobra

459
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
So I just might send them down to take care of it

460
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Here

461
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
Kind of

462
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:30,656
MPR of Infowars

463
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,216
Your right is the crazy Wing bat

464
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
MPR

465
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Yeah

466
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
He's there to Loop Inn

467
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,640
V like really old people who think Alex Yelp

468
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,248
I don't like it when Alex

469
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:52,416
But Davidson tonight I like I liked it when I hear the same insane

470
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:58,816
Very comforting tone that really makes me feel good

471
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
Dirty dossier

472
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,752
That was the allegation of the Madeleine

473
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,824
My wife had no comment on that

474
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,016
Australian prime minister

475
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
Malcolm Turnbull

476
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Those

477
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:31,072
He received no what if your address

00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,496
If you're if you're going on air

479
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:42,336
You really should know what the title of the person you're talk

480
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:47,200
This has become my favorite thing for us to do now because we have no

481
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,016
Like we've just been set free from the

482
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,880
Boring like we can do whatever the f*** we want now and then

483
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,768
What does Comics Unleashed yeah yeah just

484
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,888
Justice f****** The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe

485
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
Kind of situation

486
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,240
Wasn't David Knight is the Turkish

487
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,800
Crystal Light Of Hope

488
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:17,664
Going to go.

489
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,968
Yeah there's so much more left

490
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
How

491
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,648
What is happening with

492
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
Dirty.

493
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,680
Make it sound very impressive

494
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
Political Pulp Fiction

495
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
How to try to

496
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:51,968
Also just a little note on the dirty dossier one of the guys who is suspected to be one

497
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,528
One of the leaks from Russia was found dead

498
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
In his car

499
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,624
Yep couple other people who respect

500
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
I've been arrested by Russia for treason

501
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
So

502
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,280
Maybe it's not bulshit perhaps

503
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,632
Shortly following the election

504
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
Population of Davao

505
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Call

506
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
With the

507
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,408
The prime minister

508
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:26,016
Let's not be remiss in saying

509
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
How to call with Putin

510
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,344
Mysteriously wasn't recorded

511
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,136
You know what's crazy about that

512
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:35,488
That Cole wasn't recorded and then immediately following that

513
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,120
There were a lot of bombs dropped on Ukraine almost immediately immediately

514
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
To the point of

515
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,192
Noticeability

516
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
600

517
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
The day before

518
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
0

519
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
We're close.

520
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,712
Close enough to zero within the margin of error

521
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,272
But there was still conflict

522
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
We're not we're not

523
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
We're not embellishing anything

524
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:09,280
When we say the number is 911 was way less than

525
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,120
Yeah and then the next day the number was way more

526
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
N1000

527
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,472
I don't know if that has anything to do with each other

528
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
Themes

529
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Unrelated

530
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,080
If I if I

531
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Just put on my

532
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
I wonder if

533
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,456
I want David

534
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
Weather

535
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,552
I would actually buy that

536
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Anyway

537
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,392
Tell us the truth David

538
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,000
Of course that's what they're trying to do

539
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
It's about

540
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,816
What was supposedly said

541
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:47,168
I'm between Trump and the Australian prime minister between Trump and the Mexican

542
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,984
Is not a fool

543
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,056
Show called Dirty.

544
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Sissy

545
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
He was doing this leak

546
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
And he knew that was coming

547
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
Who's coming from

548
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,576
Intelligent

549
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,368
Community leaders that are they

550
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
Through the narrative

551
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
Infowars

552
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
Spinning really hard

553
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
Trump

554
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
He likes

555
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Selective leafedout

556
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
Information books

557
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Call Central

558
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Who would lie

559
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:25,056
That's really good like a classic is like

560
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
You give

561
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
Each you give each agency some

562
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,456
False information in DC which comes back in your life

563
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
I know which one's leaking at

564
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Smart move

565
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,808
They have that story

566
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
Not real

567
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,952
Trump is not smart enough to do that but that's the really smart move

568
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
Engine have

569
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,816
Stop is coming from

570
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
The fruit Folk

571
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
But we've been so concerned about

572
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
Withdraw

573
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
Surveillance of the American people

574
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
This is something that people have been

575
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,544
Rightfully concerned about

576
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,080
What's the Frank Church

577
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
And the congressman Pike

578
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Hearing

579
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,200
Back in the 1970s where they realized

580
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,736
The CIA in the NSA

581
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
Doing

582
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
Unconstitutional

583
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
Illegal surveillance

584
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,112
Of American citizen

585
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,416
Here in America without search warrant

586
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
I got to stop that

587
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,096
They need to stop

588
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
Is the breathing in on Mike

589
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
I have

590
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,288
35 North I don't know what your

591
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
Talking about

592
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,896
It just seems like

593
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,200
It's time for us to

594
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,248
These Mikes cost about $100

595
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,040
So I have breath guards on them

596
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,392
And I like

597
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,416
I wasn't back to the

598
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,464
Before I post them I don't

599
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Think there's any

600
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
But what

601
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,912
It's so I think I think it's just that there's no old

602
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,472
Your breath there just a little going on

603
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
In his brain

604
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
So

605
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,616
So this Desiree like you nailed it when you made the MPR

606
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,432
Like I I remember listening to

607
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Napa

608
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
Of your

609
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
You're This American Life

610
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,648
Where is American Life

611
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
I did that

612
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
What

613
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
David Knight was on it

614
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,584
Now that does sound like that sounds right

615
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,424
For 45 minutes to remember that one

616
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
I really was

617
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,240
In-depth investigation about

618
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
People who can

619
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:36,896
By the way sponsors

620
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,432
We be a big ass

621
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:42,016
Real talk

622
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
George Soros

623
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
If you're out there

624
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,976
Give me some goddamn money no s*** right if you're the architect of what you purport to be

625
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,376
Or at least other people for

626
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,448
Us more than I think putting up

627
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728
This amount of work for

628
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
For free

629
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,336
What I have a nine-to-five goddamn job

630
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,152
Stressed out

631
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,200
We get we get 25

632
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,992
$0.25 /

633
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,576
And $50,000 year retainer

634
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,624
Was bulshit

635
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,648
$50,000 a year

636
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
Work

637
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
925

638
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
More than

639
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
I work yet

640
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
I don't make

641
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
You and me both

642
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
Iran protests

643
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
No I wouldn't

644
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,264
I wouldn't do that if I didn't believe in what it was

645
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
Cuz I wouldn't even

646
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:44,992
Navigate work.

647
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,296
Hypothetical b*******

648
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:51,648
Responding hypothetically to hypothetical situation is never a good

649
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:56,512
How is it the David Knight has not made it through 10 words before I was falling asleep

650
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,304
Who f****** bored

651
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,608
Intelligence surveillance

652
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,680
Back to say

653
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
We don't want

654
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,032
What was searches

655
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
The Pfizer

656
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
Powers

657
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,040
The fisa court which is a single judge

658
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:25,952
And the government bureaucrat goes to that single judge in size I want a search warrant for mr. mrs. Verizon or whatever they want

659
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,072
And there is no publicity of that

660
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,120
That's one hundred percent right

661
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
I agree with him

662
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
100%

663
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
Okay

664
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,240
Fisa is a f******

665
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
Absolute rubber stamp

666
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Court

667
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,360
That allows them to surveil all of us

668
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,920
All the time with no real surveillance

669
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,480
Sure with no real like

670
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
Check

671
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,040
It is

672
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,088
It is absolutely unconscionable

673
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
I agree with him

674
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
David Knight has nailed it

675
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:03,072
And I am about to fall asleep he is the most boring man in history of the world

676
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,888
I don't think surveillance is great

677
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,240
Google

678
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
Bay

679
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,104
Claim that with that fisa Court they are amending the Constitution

680
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
Real quick just to make

681
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:26,112
The the way we're going to make this interesting as one of us dies at the end of this, right

682
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,928
BET our lives on the end

683
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Okay

684
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
Over-under on how many

685
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
More times is dirty.

686
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,448
Five you take over or under

687
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,520
5 / Runner

688
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
Okay

689
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,384
So that you're going to say one more time

690
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,712
We're not even allowed to know about that

691
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,528
How to close all the way back to the 1970s

692
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,112
You saw them talking about the assassination gun

693
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
People didn't talk about

694
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
What's the fact that

695
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,744
Congressman

696
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,816
Everybody try to exist

697
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,632
They all said

698
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
If I said I want to see

699
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Your

700
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,872
Reorganization that's what was created we were created by an executive order by president

701
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
No we're not going to show that to you

702
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,712
I swear to God I feel like

703
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,760
I feel like

704
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:29,856
We're just going to fall asleep and this clip is going to end and that's going to be the end of the

705
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,952
This is the most boring thing I've ever heard in my entire life

706
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,536
Supposed to be about phone calls how is this possible

707
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,352
Don't know this man is so boring

708
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,680
This is what I'm worried I'm worried that

709
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:50,336
Going to keep saying I'm worried that we're going to become boring by pointing at like

710
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,872
Sent to this boring man

711
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,152
It's going to rub off

712
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
God

713
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,480
What what is it feel like

714
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
Okay

715
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
Imagine you're married to this

716
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,904
He's married actually I have no idea about it

717
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,488

00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,072

Food from

00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
Asia

732
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:49,216
All right how do you spell medieval

733
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,008
Food from Australia

738
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:10,720
Alright alright

739
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
You can't know what we're about

740
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
We don't report to you

741
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
What we see here

742
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,240
After Decades of this after every attempt has

743
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,288
Then turned around and used against us

744
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,592
People are coming after

745
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
A president

746
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,128
Who doesn't

747
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Support

748
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
They're dark

749
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Globalist

750
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
Agenda

751
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,576
And they're doing everything they can try to destroy him to try to embarrass him

752
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,904
That came out

753
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,184
It just made him look better

754
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,720
With the people who voted for him

755
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
Because what he's telling

756
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,816
Australian prime minister

757
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,352
Is a Goldman Sachs Banker

758
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,264
It just came out in the last week contributed I think it's like one and a half a million dollars maybe that's Australian money

759
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,592
The most money on the Phillies

760
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,128
Electrician as ever

761
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,456
Country has no idea what Australian

762
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:09,856
No idea what I was really

763
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:15,488

767
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,920
Just a little bit earlier in this clip even like

768
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,248

He gets

770
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,064

And tell this story without any idea of what he's at

772
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,184
Actually saying

773
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,232

Maybe you should

778
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,752
Maybe you should have some idea of what you're saying

779
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
This clip is the

780
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848

Top talk

782
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Like

783
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,688
Talon

784
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
World leaders what's up

785
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
So far

786
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,088
We don't know what Australia skirt

787
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,904
We don't know what the name of the leader is

788
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
We don't

789
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,232
When we know it's truly know it's

790
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,768
We don't know his title

791
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,352
We don't know exactly really what happened

792
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,168
We're pretending a call to Putin didn't happen

793
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,704
All the stuff

794
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
You're not

795
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
Gamer

796
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
He

797
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,920
Was a literate man

798
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,968
He would act

799
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:44,320
Actually believe that Turnbull was the villain of the

800
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,416
Iodine

801
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Kind of get that

802
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,256
Let's get back.

803
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,608
You hiccup the a******

804
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,216
Otpp he still wants to keep the TPP going even though

805
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,520
Trump has shut that down with America

806
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
Climate change agenda

807
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,736
So he's there on all three of those issues this is a hardcore

808
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
Goldman Sachs

809
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,064
Text guy who is on with all three legs

810
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
Of the globalist agenda

811
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
What were they

812
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:23,488
Talking about what do they have the contentious conversation about what

813
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,120
They were talking about whether not refugees which Australia would not allow into their country but instead

814
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,448
For housing and Papa New Guinea

815
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,104
Dave said well we want you to take them off of our hands

816
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,224
I 1000% don't believe

817
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
I'm struggling

818
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,344
To follow along

819
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:56,000
Every every word he says makes me less interested in the word he said before it

820
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:00,864
He's insanely boring like the fight that they had was

821
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
Was about like

822
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,960
The Australian prime minister Turnbull being like

823
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
Dude

824
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:13,408
You got to take some of these refugees off our hands makes more sense to me than

825
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
Demi-leigh

826
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,992
Act like if the conversation that

827
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,064
What address

828
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,392
You should take

829
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
Some of these refugees

830
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
No do you ever mixed up

831
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
I'm supposed to be doing that to you

832
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,560
No but I mean

833
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,096
Take some refugees

834
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,144
I do be tremendous

835
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:39,520
I might I don't even know

836
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,080
David Knight has got both of us

837
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:48,480
So bored I that's what I'm trying to do I don't know we're losing

838
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,136
This is what happens when you listen to David Knight login us

839
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,208
Like their fight came up because

840
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,608
Really would like to take some over refugees and long enough without

841
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:09,728
Alex Jones anoculus unbelievable

842
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,008
Iris

843
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,544
2 believable is just a

844
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,080
Parcel of boring

845
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,872
The but yeah that's what I'm saying

846
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,920
It's not that it's believable

847
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,968
It's so unfair andalus

848
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:25,856
Yeah because he's not yelling at you eating the morning traffic report

849
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,904
You would believe any like

850
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,024
Eating like on 90/94 we have

851
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
A block there

852
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,608
I'm not block is called by

853
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,936
Caused by Muslim refugees who are

854
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
Dancing around

855
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,776
They are burning an effigy of

856
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
Trump right now

857
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,104
That is a block on a

858
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
Before you be like

859
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,920
Oh yeah that makes sense

860
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,712
But he's saying that

861
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,528
Australia in a spot because

862
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,552
Australia wanted us

863
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,160
If Alex was saying

864
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,256
Re-reading that news he would be screaming

865
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,048
About the history

866
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,864
Of Australia being a penal colony

867
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
And how they're a bunch of dicks

868
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,960
Right right

869
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,008
England tip walk

870
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
Player

Some f****** panache

873
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,872
Yeah

874
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640

00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:34,208
There's only like another minute left of his self in a minute left open listening to David

878
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,000
Flight 46 years hopefully

879
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
40

880
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304
The seconds of it is

881
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,680
The envelope when I when I was a young man David Knight started talking in this club

882
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,032
Why are you going to die while you're still talking

883
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
PJ's but they want us

884
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
To take them all

885
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,943
He's wearing Dental right

886
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,735
Lodi

887
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,295
That's a dangerous man

888
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:03,903
Prime minister was doing a Donald Trump says a disagreement with Obama

889
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,719
I'm not interested in doing that

890
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:11,839
About 25 minutes

891
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,631
Panda. 22 Donald Trump

892
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
Hung up on him

893
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,471
Rightfully so

894
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
With ease

895
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
Leeks

896
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
That

897
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,103
Kind of making him look better

898
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,407
But the key thing here that is really dangerous

899
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
It's a fact that we have

900
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,991
Surveillance

901
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
Open late

902
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Attacking

Unprecedented way

00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:41,535
National real estate is a problem that was the end of the clip I totally agree

Nationals

908
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:55,615
But it has nothing to do with what he was talking about

909
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,919
Let's be clear let's be clear

910
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,223
Never

911
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,783

Fake Hitler in another country

920
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,223
They start talking

921
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Yeah

922
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,039

00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,463
I still would rather him

927
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
Trying to make negotiation

00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,799
Shutdown

955
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
Communication

956
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
I do think that that

957
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,455
It is it is the most damage

958
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,575
If I heard that Obama hung up on some

959
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,599
Foreign leader

960
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,999
I would think that was f***** up is because all

961
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,535
All the time that we're listen to this

962
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,351
We find ourselves constantly

963
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,119
Not concert

964
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,911
I would say occasionally

965
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,703
Or frequently enough

966
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,263
Agreeing with their endgame

967
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
Write their final Point like

968
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
Yes

969
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
The national security system

970
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
Is out of

971
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
Comes to observing

972
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,735
American citizens

973
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,367
And we're against that because they can be used against citizens

974
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:51,743
Because imaginal beings are following us you know like

975
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,767
Like that

976
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:59,167
That's the area where we disconnected it happens when you don't have a team like

977
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,007
Is you and I don't have a

978
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
Team

979
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:07,359
Like when you come to the Democrat vs Republican thing

980
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,151
Like

981
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,455
Thank God we need one building

982
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:17,855
Right now at least at least women are doing a way better job than

983
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,879
We are

984
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,159
Spider-Man

985
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,999
F*** yeah because I'm a giant pile of garbage

986
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,351
So so but that's that's what happened

987
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
Is if you don't have it

988
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,423
Team to constantly defend

989
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,983
Like when Obama was President

990
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,519
S*** tons of

991
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,823
Extradition

992
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,639
Killings that he had withdrawn bombings and all that

993
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
Where you like

994
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
No

995
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,735
Know you murdered

996
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,759
An innocent

997
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
Family

998
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,319
I just an innocent guy

999
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
Anderson

1000
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
Family

1001
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:50,879
You killed it

1002
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,415
That's on you

1003
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,207
Obama yeah we're mad at

1004
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,047
But if you have a team you're like oh well

1005
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,607
It's Obama doing it so he believes it's right

1006
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,959
Murder that f******

1007
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,799
Can kid you with a shity thing and you're on that team so you're like

1008
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:13,919
Oh no you just opened up a really interesting thing that I

1009
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
I think we need to

1010
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,967
Address for how many

1011
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,783
What hour of this podcast are we on

1012
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,063
Jesus Christ

1013
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
There is a

1014
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
Perspective

1015
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
From

1016
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,951
The Infowars side that

1017
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
They keep saying

1018
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,047
Felt like when Obama did these things

1019
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
Yeah

1020
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Care

1021
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,607
And that's

1022
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,655
Illusory that's not yet

1023
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
Obama

1024
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,239
Did drone kill people

1025
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,543
People speaking out against

1026
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,639
Literally pissed off about it

1027
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
That's

1028
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
That's a complete

1029
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
Absolutely not true

1030
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,575
Well it's not a complete Straub no cuz some people work

1031
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:58,975
It's not a complete set because there is there is an element of work hairdos

1032
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,511
Right

1033
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,559
But if you're playing the game as a

1034
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,631
Team sport which it seems to be that

1035
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,655
Versus d

1036
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:13,055
And it really does seem to be the overwhelming reality of what we live in now is that

1037
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,335
Anyway

1038
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,383
Ladies and gentlemen

1039
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,455
I believe this has been our first

1040
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:25,855
I think this is our first Short episode regarding David night hopefully

1041
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,159
Episode regarding David Knight I Hope

1042
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:33,279
Or it never one this is this should be the end

1043
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
The other guys

1044
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,631
Like unpleasant

1045
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,399
Manipulate

1046
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
The voices

1047
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,775
Paul Joseph Watson we could do an episode about him

1048
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,335
You would hate him just as much forever.

1049
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,407
Like these guys the rest of his cohorts

1050
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:54,783
Are terrible about Alex

1051
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:01,183
We're going to find each of these guys

1052
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,463
Still them

1053
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,743
To their essence

1054
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,535
Switch and David nights case

1055
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559

1056
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,607

1057
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,911
From The Lord of the Rings

1058
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:17,311
The Rings

1059
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,847
But user-friendly

1060
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,407
David Knight

1061
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431

1062
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
Racist ass

@jake

1080
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,095
I don't want anyone knowing my business

1081
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:18,495
I am at and then cross.

1082
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:25,663
If you feel like isolating the audio from each of us you may find out which one I am

1083
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,711
Them to figure out who we are

1084
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:31,807
I don't want just in case someone randomly finds it I have no

Goodnight

1089
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,591
If we were drama coaches

00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,687
Let's give him a little bit of outro advice

1091
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,479
Pick it up

1092
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
Right

1093
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,039
Be a little more dangerous

1094
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
Projector

1095
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,879
21 the only thing

1096
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,647
He's doing fine

1097
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,999
Disagree he seems like he's talking into his chest

1098
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
That's the entire

1099
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,095
He is in love

1100
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,167
Make it seem like you care

1101
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,703
Make it seem like you can

1102
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,727
Act

1103
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,007
Yeah like

1104
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
Like

1105
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,383
Did no matter what bulshit he says

1106
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:33,759
He might care Alex believes 20% of a of what he says and

1107
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,063
Believes that he believes

1108
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,855
Hundred percent of everything

1109
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,159
Ever said

1110
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,207
Believes 100% of what he says

1111
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
Hebron

1112
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,535
