1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan pipes sweat it

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge like I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
Fight.com

4
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Acknowledge

5
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
What up

6
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
I need a second to think what are you doing

7
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
Necessarily celebrate

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,872
Anniversary of Maha

9
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:25,760
While I believe the Edible Arrangements would bake to differ

10
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
That was twice

11
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,136
Pics for her birthday

12
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,536
But it has been four years in January

13
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,424
Relative anniversary time. I bought her these I bought her a

14
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
Bouquet of South African flowers which she loves

15
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,640
She has no interest in like she would have slapped me in the face

16
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
Because I have never met her before

17
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,552
So I got it he's and I got it this beautiful face and she f****** loved it

18
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
And I feel like I crushed it I even put it on the scoreboard I have

19
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,352
1 romance Point nice to her 0 right now she's got s*** to do it's a tough year for for most people

20
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,264
Getting that one on the board first of the year get it on the board

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,104
Move on it feels really good and she's very happy and it

22
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
Awesome

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
My brakes by Jordan little more materialistic perhaps a little less romantic and we got this box of

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
Candy

25
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
And one of the things that was in it was velvet crumble

26
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
What is a honeycomb

27
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
Candy

28
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
And that sounds more like a exotic dancer but that's up to you. I love it so much

29
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,656
I ordered more of it and I ate all of the stuff

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,104
You know what happened to the sea turtles

31
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,504
Go get them, play scary monster ship because they stayed and they were

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,368
Lottery

33
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,000
I was so close to ordering more after stop myself

34
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
It's so good

35
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,608
I love the crunchy bar which is a fee sort of

36
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
The honeycomb

37
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,960
Covered in chocolate

38
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
You can get it like Treasure Island grocery store but it's so much better

39
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
The Velvet crumble is

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
So much better

41
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
Amazing

42
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,040
Stop sending me candy

43
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880
400 lb

44
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
But I

45
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,280
So a Jordan we are talking

46
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
About a little bit of stuff

47
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,448
Address Ruth Alex Jones

48
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
I'm done

49
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
Hey we go

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Blackjack

51
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,200
21 no dammit

52
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
Damn this is 2021

53
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Blackjack

54
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,720
I don't know

55
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
It's

56
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Something

57
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
It's not going to work

58
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
Interesting little stretch of time Alex

59
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,703
Just trying to rationalize again

60
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
Instill the events of

61
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,383
The sixth not my fault not my fault not my fault bunch

62
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
Antifa did stuff and now they're planning more attacks

63
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
Assure

64
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,831
Find a little bit annoying

65
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
Oh

66
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
But

67
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:50,559
At the end of this we are going to have something remarkable happened okay and I'm so excited about it that I want to get down to business

68
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
Okay

69
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,239
Troy thank you so much

70
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,079

71
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,663
Next I see spiders where there are none thank you so much and I'll probably want

72
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735

73
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Stacy thank you so much you're an alcoholic

74
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,439
Spider Stacy

75
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,071

76
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,399

77
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
So Isaac

78
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,847
Progeny of technocrat

79
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,879
Money off that heroin

80
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Yub

81
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,487
Is freakishly large

82
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:57,887
Isaac progeny of sin but aren't we all

83
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,239
I believe in the Bible

84
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
We are all born out of the first

85
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
Indeed

86
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,431
I wanted to say 22 folks thank you all

87
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,991
Show we are incredibly behind

88
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
Shoutouts

89
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599

It's

93
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,935
I don't know we were you here how many we do up top you don't want to hear 30 of them

94
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,775
Impossible situation

95
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,639
It's a bit and a structure that is really affected with no one's listening

96
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
And now it's

97
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:48,831
Impossible makes us feel sad and I don't want anyone to feel

98
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:54,207
Left out for

99
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,559
Alias you'd like to send a message and we'll get that taken care of

100
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Timely

101
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
Timely joke

102
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
Yosser

103
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
Also Jordan

104
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:08,287
Who's very excited today is Friday when this will be coming out

105
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,359
But on Sunday the 17th so special

106
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,711
It was happening I would like to give a pre-emptive shout-out for that and that is

107
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
Couple of walks

108
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:23,391
Eric and Michelle are celebrating their second anniversary happy anniversary

109
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,463
View yes indeed got a very nice

110
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
This message

111
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
Very cute

112
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,351
About diadem enjoying the show and Eric doing Alex Jones voice

113
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Oh

114
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
The shoe to say sweet things

115
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:43,103
Happy anniversary to you too hope hope you have a great one this weekend to end

116
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,919
I don't know how you could say

117
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
You have a lovely figure

118
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,271
Now that doesn't sound right now it's like I'm good

119
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
Look at it

120
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Austin 13th

121
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
Coming right at you but

122
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
He's not a context drop

123
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
From Today Show

124
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
A little plant

125
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
I love you

126
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
See isn't that sweet sweet

127
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:13,311
That is sweet. I do like to imagine Alex as a Georgia O'Keeffe

128
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
That's what I open

129
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Secret Garden

130
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,319
Alex's

131
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,599
Michelle predict

132
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Violence

133
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Sure

134
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
Because of

135
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
Did the CIA

136
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
They're running qanon

137
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:37,119
Declared a National Emergency a particular martial law emergency in d.c.

138
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
Program

139
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,823
Across the United States owe

140
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
Martial law

141
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,039
But the CIA cooperative

142
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Turtle launcher attacks

143
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:01,951
Argument is Vicky was like this operation to make

144
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
Supporters look bad you should

145
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
You should have been

146
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,375
Really aggressively going after the Mongo cuz they were making Trump supporters look bad

147
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:16,031
Hard know I would I would argue that we didn't have to do anything to make them look

148
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
No

149
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:23,199
I so I think that this is all like basically the preemptive stuff where Alex has a good science

150
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,503
Maybe some violence there might be some

151
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
Exit domestic terrorism

152
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
Friends with Stewart Road

153
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Exactly

154
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
Who's still conspicuous in his absence on the show by the way

155
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
Preemptively explain these things you got to you got to make sure that the audience has a

156
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
Ready to go Justin

157
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
Application for why I like

158
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
This isn't a sign that our world is f*****

159
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,239
Right information so you also have to text you at roads and let him know that

160
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,079
You're still on his team and you're just running interference for him so we can commit

161
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
Violet

162
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,503
Don't worry Stewart I'm still scared of you this is a smart move for all of us for me to say that you're bad

163
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,623
So what's going on is that there's a globalist revolution that's happening and

164
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
Sino CIA running

165
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
Qanon in order to precipitate

166
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
His violent reveley to the global

167
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
What's taking over or something

168
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
Did you know that that's all in the Bible

169
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,495
We're in the midst of a global New World Order

170
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
Revolution Against Humanity

171
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
This has been foretold

172
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,807
What do you believe in God or whatever it is our psychic vision of the future

173
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,623
Is the future of the only two options

174
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
Space time continuum

175
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
We saw this socket

176
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Becoming

177
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
Award

178
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
Thousands of years ago

179
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,191
Not just by John on the Isle of Patmos

180
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,239
Yeah so what time

181
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
Okay

182
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:57,407
And so John and Patmos to the Future Trump

183
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Losing

184
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:04,063
Yeah you know I always thought of time as being more like a singularity

185
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,367
Existing at all times

186
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
Simultaneously

187
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,743
Back and forth

188
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,607
Yeah and empty John of course in Revelation you can see all the

189
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,423
Signs that he was talking about Trump

190
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
This is disgraceful

191
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,823
Seal was opened and

192
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,711
May was medicare-for-all I'm not religious

193
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
I don't care to

194
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,343
Be offended on religions behalf but it's a sacrilege Superbad

195
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
To be offended by this

196
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,975
Starts talking about

197
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
And then then he

198
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
He starts playing on my side of the street

199
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,031
It doesn't want us to declare that and so are you

200
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
The thing that should not be

201
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Someday

202
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Maybe even death

203
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,719
Oh no I kind of agree that Alex is what the enemy fears but not because he has any kind of competence

204
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
There is a force of Truth or any of that s*** no

205
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:23,167
Diesel the enemy fears in the same way that a parent would fear a charismatic weirdo trying to convince their four-year-old child that fire can

206
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
It hurt them

207
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
They aren't scared that the

208
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,079
The b******* of the mainstream media is propaganda about fire being dangerous

209
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,687
They're worried that this negative an insane influence will lead to the harm of people that care about

210
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,503
Fire can't hurt you I have candy in my van let's go

211
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
As for the Lovecraft reference

212
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Of course Alex goes with that one

213
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,695
He's such a 101 dudes of course is going to rot something from Call of Cthulhu

214
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,327
Thing that he's misusing and reciting is part of a much

215
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,167
Puzzled over passage from the Necronomicon that is referenced in the story

216
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
It goes like

217
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Is

218
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,287
That is not dead which can Eternal lie

219
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
And with strange Aeons

220
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Even death

221
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
May die

222
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
What are the chapters in that story

223
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
Call the Cthulhu is inspector lacrosse

224
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,575
Where you hear about a Cop who discovered a group of cultists performing a ceremony and chanting

225
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
Thing Louis magnegas

226
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Cthulhu really are

227
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,951
Bomgaars Alliance fhtagn

228
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Beautiful language

229
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
Meant to be on pronounce

230
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
Human tongue

231
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,119
Blue Springs Loosely translates to

232
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,447
Quote in his house in really a dead Cthulhu Waits dreaming

233
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
What are the cultist to lagrasse interrogates

234
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
Old Castro

235
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:36,127
Necronomicon

236
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
Is it helps Gibson

237
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Some contacts that are cheap

238
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
So the reader can piece together that they worship

239
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
Dormant God is in this place waiting and dreaming

240
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,575
And this God will never die

241
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,135
Life span longer than death

242
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Anyway

243
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,255
The point here is that this phrase has nothing to do with what I have to stalk

244
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,327
LOL that's not about death dying really at all

245
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
I know that he thinks he's really cool and the most of his points of reference are very sci-fi things he barely remembers but this is a little bit

246
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Get silly

247
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
For one thing Alex should not compare themselves

248
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Cthulhu

249
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Cthulhu did not want

250
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
To follow the concert

251
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
The tution and protect the Second Amendment

252
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,735
It's really clear the textbook Cthulhu was interested at what's that

253
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,855
Those first men formed the cult around small Idols which the great ones showed them

254
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,903
Idols brought in dim areas

255
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
From dark stars

256
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
That caught with no

257
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
Never die until the stars came right again

258
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
It will take great Cthulhu it from his tomb

259
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
Victon resume his rule of Earth

260
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,727
The time would be easy to know for that mankind would

261
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
Become like the great old ones

262
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,359
Free and wild and be gone good and evil with laws and morals thrown aside

263
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
In all men shouting in

264
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
I'm killing and revelling enjoy

265
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,711
Also Alex is a lot like

266
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:49,599
Then the liberated old ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and reveling enjoy themselves

267
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
And Oliver quit playing with Holocaust of x

268
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
Freedom

269
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,767
I don't have nothing in common except they were both races

270
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
The difference

271
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,887
Between them is it Lovecraft got less racist as his career progression

272
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:08,287
That is true anyway.

273
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:14,687
Lovecraft death may die is a kind of cool same but no sense for what

274
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,759
What he's talkin about love sayings

275
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
F****** old

276
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
And we're going to die before he

277
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Call Amvets

278
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,231
That is not dead which may turn Ally Israel

279
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,303
Is basically saying that he's just gone dormant he's not.

280
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,655
No he's been sleeping for centuries under under in really a

281
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Why

282
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,007
I mean why does the Stars weren't right for him

283
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,335
Come back and rain and Terror on Earth

284
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,175
I never liked the arbitrary rules that are given to the old ones or this

285
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,551
The devil or all of these things man if you want. Ultimate Evil buddy install

286
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
That's

287
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Fiction

288
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
That's why

289
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,743
I was making up arbitrary rules for the devil in the real world

290
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
Works a little bit

291
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Silly

292
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,143
Alex was in DC over the. Of time when

293
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
The other store mango Capital happen

294
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,471
And

295
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
We're getting a new piece of reporting

296
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
Do you replace an antifa caused

297
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
Dolls are troubles forever

298
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
According to Alex

299
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,943
Alex

300
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
He almost got swept up

301
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
They planned

302
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
The SWAT team

303
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
In DC and blame me

304
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
What happened

305
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
We confirm that

306
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,303
I'll be honest I was so exhausted

307
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,863
I just ate a big meal on Thursday

308
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Under stress

309
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Yourself

310
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
I did not

311
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
Police cars came for me

312
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
I'm having told you this whole story

313
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
I will tell you all of

314
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Please start using this one

315
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:03,487
Shows I could drink half a bottle of vodka and a big meals I was like I don't even give a s*** that is 100 police cars

316
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
Coming to SWAT team

317
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:11,679
Talk about Isaac maybe the reason that they were going to take me out and blame me for storming the capital

318
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
But then the police would

319
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
Go along with

320
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:19,871
Go fuc yourself to go with the police didn't arrest you because you were right out at the tip of the spear yelling

321
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,967
Runaway Runaway we can't do this this is bad

322
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
We get this kind of speech from Alex

323
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,623
Pretty regularly

324
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:35,487
Haha now I see everything become clear to me

325
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:41,887
Nlcb entire picture

326
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
Almost a subatomic level

327
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Add

328
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:50,079
I know what your next moves are I know how to stop them I know what's unfolding

329
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,639
Underestimated

330
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,943
2 is 100%

331
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
Public intelligence

332
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
100% what's left

333
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
U.s. government

334
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,487
Use the movement to educate

335
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
You're not cute

336
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
Mom shooting

337
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,703
Bombings and capitals all over I told you that Sunday

338
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
From

339
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
DC police

340
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
This is a game how he's preemptively

341
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:27,199
Constructing this narrative just in case there is bombing as in stuff that are done by Trump supporters

342
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
You know at least

343
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
Alex is

344
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
On the surface

345
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
Telling his audience not to be viola

346
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
Right and there was some

347
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,463
I mean I guess it's better than the alternative in some ways but

348
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,511
It's too little too late and its meaning

349
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Stole the election

350
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
So they need violence

351
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Be part of it

352
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
It's a lie

353
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
The setup

354
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
And we now know the LIE

355
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,407
We now know the setup we know

356
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Every

357
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
For this moment

358
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,695
Doug and Harwood everybody else has been shut down

359
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
It's all the Holy Spirit

360
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
The Divine transmission

361
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Receiving

362
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
I'm telling you I'ma give you the transmission

363
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,519
Weather

364
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
God speaking through him

365
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Fun

366
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,223
Also it's not a surprise to hear Alex insisting the people shouldn't be violent and the reason for that is pretty obvious

367
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,807
Alex knows there's a large enough population of people who work

368
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:40,927
Completely fried and disconnected from reality going to be disillusioned by the non-fulfillment of all their promise

369
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
Fantasies

370
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,231
That they might turn to violence

371
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:48,095
He's obviously not responsible for all of it but Alex's rhetoric has absolutely been in

372
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,679
Contributing factor to getting us to the dangerous situation we're now in

373
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
Ernie knows that

374
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,871
When your allies storm the capital and you make your money encouraging people to do things like storm capitals but you don't want them to actual

375
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
Can we do it

376
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
You have a few immediate priority

377
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,503
The first discovered with a framework to allow your audio

378
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,831
Pretend to be actual storming doesn't involve you or anyone like you

379
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
This is achieved by blaming antifa

380
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:16,767
In this case there's the unfortunate aspect of the story where a bunch of the people who stormed the capital of public figures and then

381
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
I've been very clear that they were doing it for

382
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:23,423
There's also a bunch of people involved who don't match your characterization of antifa at all

383
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
So to get around that object

384
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:30,079
Now it says Durham q12 the bus which is probably going to be persuasive to some portion of his audience total

385
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,151
The next most important thing you have to do

386
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
As what you're seeing right now

387
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
If you're Alex

388
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,039
You know damn well that this is not going to be a one-off event

389
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:44,927
Alex has been friends with Stewart Roads for years now he knows the kind of insurrection is threat that dude makes

390
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
And he's supposed to be the public

391
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,767
Thanks for the oathkeeper can't imagine who's

392
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
And underneath

393
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
I think we should

394
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
To kill everybody

395
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,679
And as your subordinate I would like to follow up with

396
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Your neck

397
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
Yeah I mean store Road

398
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,311
Is the pr guy and he's talking about like

399
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Rounding people up

400
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:08,223
Alex knows there's going to be more attacks so it's super important for him to create a pre-emptive narrative

401
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
Explain them when they eventually happen

402
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,343
This is achieved by more throwing you under the bus

403
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,391
If in the next 3 weeks

404
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
Instances of domestic terrorism in the people carry it out

405
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Lapeer Dipietro

406
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,816
Supporters now Alex can fall back on saying things are really Trump supporters

407
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,656
They're people who were misled by the Insidious globalist psyop it is qanon

408
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,984
Song up there specifically running to make people like Alex

409
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
Trump Patriots look bad

410
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,592
Google very transparent it's stupid but it's

411
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,128
Crucial for Alex if he wants to

412
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Continue to be able

413
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
Justifies

414
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Behavior

415
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,760
In the face of the inevitable consequences of his behavior coming

416
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,064
Wow he needs to be a

417
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,624
Against the inevitable consequences to stay on

418
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Write make money and not get arrested

419
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
I believe this is a very teachable

420
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,376
In the aftermath of the storm the capital I believe that you can see it very clear distinction between people who mean what they say

421
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,168
And people who are primarily scammers

422
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,496
People who really mean it are still calling for right-wingers

423
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
To show up in DC on January

424
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:09,408
People who really mean it are like the queue Shaman insisted that he was proud of his actions on the six

425
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,248
People who really mean it or even like Alex is boring intern Harrison Smith

426
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,528
Reporting the capital

427
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,368
Baldwin and the Patriots were in control as the events of the six transpire

428
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,440
Conversely Alex is a scammer

429
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,024
He has a very profitable Griff that depends on tension to continue

430
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
In order for that tension to exist

431
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,120
He has to operate in some distant ways

432
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,424
For instance if you believe the things

433
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,448
He says on his show

434
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,008
Here's what'll happen if Biden gets into office

435
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,080
The literal Christian devil will rule America

436
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
Christianity will be outlawed

437
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:46,272
Everyone will be forced to get vaccines it'll put tracking chips in them and killed them true

438
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,344
The door killing conservative as they died of the vaccine

439
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,464
And Alex will be one of the few to survive long enough to kill his neighbor and feed them to his daughter don't forget.

440
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
Mexican shirt that's

441
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,304
Somewhere in the middle

442
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,376
If you actually believe those things in anyway

443
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
He would not be opposed

444
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
Insurrection immediately

445
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,240
I believe those things that be only

446
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:11,360
Yeah because this is a fight with the Devil

447
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:16,736
If this were just about policy than sure you can accept Biden presidency where you try to Lobby conservit

448
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
Congress members to push

449
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,296
For policies you'd like to see

450
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
With all that she doesn't

451
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,856
Matter if you believe a lie

452
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
If I can get them to office there's no policy discussion

453
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,000
There will never be fair elections again in the future

454
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:33,632
If you believe Alex than this election itself was stolen which has supposedly already been proven

455
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:39,520
If you believe that and you believe the futility of any action you could possibly take one to Biden gets into office

456
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,312
But it's a natural conclusion

457
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,128
Do decide that you need to do whatever you can

458
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
Before he gets into office to stop that from happening

459
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,552
This is the inherent dissonance Alex's nonviolent position brings up

460
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:56,416
He expects his audience to believe in but if they actually do the only conclusion they can come to his

461
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
Exactly the conclusion

462
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,744
The people who stormed the capitol on the 6th

463
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,328
He's basically made an argument to his audience where he demands

464
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
The be definitively except

465
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,448
The he's proven every one of the premises in his argument

466
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:13,568
But hey man I don't want to take responsibility for you

467
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
I can see through the Matrix

468
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,896
And I can see that your death

469
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Is eminent

470
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
And what I would like you to do

471
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,784
Nothing well or you could give me money

472
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:31,488
This is how we will crush them

473
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
Satan

474
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,888
You understand like this is this is nonsensical this this this kind of behavior

475
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Anyway

476
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:44,544
Here we go again it's a good thing nobody will face consequences

477
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
For this type of behavior that that's

478
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,616
That's really heartening

479
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
Thing to know

480
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
So we get to Narrative of the six

481
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
I just being laid out

482
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,600
Pretty much found his his final version of

483
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
Handcuffing

484
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
Kelly members of Congress

485
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Lockdown

486
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,936
Happy fuzzishot Force

487
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
All in unison

488
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
The Patriots

489
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,592
Help the police

490
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:27,808
This is serious so this didn't work so now they need 2.0

491
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,904
We're going to

492
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,928
It's a storm

493
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,744
If I were officer leaving Goods family I would have

494
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,048
Definitely Sue Alex Jones for defamation

495
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:44,448
Immediately

496
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
Absolutely not proven is just

497
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
Making up and then either killed himself or was killed

498
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
To cover it up

499
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,248
Whenever there's something that the police should have stopped but don't it's important for Alex to pretend its some nefarious Force ordered

500
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
Stand down to allow it to happen

501
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,808
As opposed to them

502
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:06,208
Just being a Nazi to time it's because of Apple

503
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,792
Aggressively

504
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:15,936
And again the argument on the other side is they seem to turn a blind eye a lot of the time when there's these

505
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Hard right

506
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,752
Extreme protest

507
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,872
Guardian just had something about that everyone already knew

508
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,432
Which is that police are meaner to the

509
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Yeah yeah

510
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,272
In the case of the storming of the capital A traditionally discussed

511
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:35,392
Offenses that Alex has decided to just pretend that a man who died by Suicide was actually secretly killed

512
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,464
So you couldn't reveal who had ordered him to order the stand

513
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:43,072
As far as I can tell officer liebengood isn't someone who would have been in the position

514
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,376
To make orders at the Capitol Police would follow

515
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
It's not like he was

516
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,472
The chief or even in the executive department of the Capitol Police

517
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:55,104
I can't imagine that he would have been someone who could have unilaterally acted in the manner that Alex is claiming it goes higher

518
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,688
This isn't based on anything other than the fact that this man is now dead

519
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,992
The fact that he's dead makes him useful prop

520
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
Sprouts using creating disc

521
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Conspiracy

522
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
Because it creates a dead end

523
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,648
We could figure out who orchestrated this whole setup

524
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
Nystatin as we can't reveal that information

525
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,024
Which obviously would prove alexandrite

526
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
The guy is a thing to Alex

527
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
That's not a person

528
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
I find that

529
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Disgusting

530
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,472
I used to be so rude

531
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
What's the

532
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,544
We're at the point now where it's like

533
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,664
If Alex does this I'm I'm almost like sending a message immediately like hey

534
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
This can't happen

535
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,760
I don't fortunately you're the only person with grounds

536
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:39,136
I would love to do a bond like the world should work like this but apparently the law doesn't count

537
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
So disgusting

538
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
Search

539
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,584
The law won't just be like hey you know he's bad for Humanity so Humanity has grounds I certainly hope

540
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
The officer's family is in

541
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
Dealing with any kind of harassment

542
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
And from

543
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,728
Folks who believe the sort of things that Alex

544
00:27:55,264 --> 00:28:01,408
Based on the past and actions of Alex's audience they will

545
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,968
Able to think that it might be happening not salute

546
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
How do I

547
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
What's fancies himself

548
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
Peaceful

549
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Kind of protest

550
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
Forgot he wants a peaceful Revolution

551
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
Kind of like Martin Luther King

552
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
Right

553
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Martin Luther King

554
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
Free

555
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
90%

556
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
But

557
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
What folks think

558
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
And they watch them get their heads

559
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
People like

560
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
Their parents dead

561
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,272
There's a big ass man. Boys not doing

562
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,344
That is a f***** up setting

563
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,416
I don't understand the timeline

564
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
I don't know what's going on

565
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Hellboy

566
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,864
Severely Alex's grandparents are black people singing Christian hits

567
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,264
That means like we're not going to be racist anymore no I think they're not going I guess they were all the ones who had the fire

568
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
Fire hoses

569
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,640
I got his Alex's whole family was holding fire roses and they were like

570
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Oh I get it they're sick

571
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Yeah

572
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968
Also I know that Alex loves

573
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:13,088
The product this idea that he respect Martin Luther King and his non-violence and that's all good and well

574
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:19,232
The standard line to hear from people on the right thing but I wanted to discuss how out-of-touch he is with his own intellectual turn

575
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,328
Most of Alex's ideas or just reheated John Birch Society talk

576
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,864
Points that is you know

577
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,960
Underpinnings of patriot lure for the last generation

578
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:33,568
His favorite book the one that woke him up to the New World Order of courses and none dare call it

579
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,104
Conspiracy by Gary Allan

580
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,920
A thing like Gary Allan didn't just write one book

581
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,248
His first book is called Communist Revolution in the streets

582
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:45,088
Switch is all about how the Civil Rights Movement is actually secretly a Communist front

583
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
That sounds like a better dance party

584
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,440
The book was published by Western Islands

585
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:54,560
Which is the John Birch Society publishing imprint and it has a forward written by W Cleon skousen

586
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:59,424
Another of Alex's Gyros on the uncle of his regular Infowars gas Joel skousen

587
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,520
The book is a slightly different take on Martin Luther King and goes out of

588
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:09,920
This way to suggest that he was a violent revolutionary who only said things about nonviolence to appear acceptable in public

589
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,992
In a caption on a picture of Martin Luther King on

590
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,040
Page 1 of this book

591
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Allen Reitz

592
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,696
Although King talks nonviolent many of his alliances are formed with negro leaders who Advocate violence

593
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,000
And give the movement it's quality of revolution

594
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,584
This is an important idea of the ante, no

595
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,656
Set the entirety of the Civil Rights Movement was a communist

596
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:35,776
Facade and that Martin Luther King was essentially there to trick white people into thinking it was a peaceful Revolution

597
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,568
From page 2

598
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,176
King closed his talk by declaring that of course he meant that should be done non-violently

599
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,224
Many in the crowd last opened

600
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:49,344
They felt the term non-violent was ashamed was being used by King primarily for public relations

601
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
Whether Alex knows it or understands it is irrelevant

602
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:59,328
What matters is that the system that he supports and all of his intellectual influences who molded his beliefs when he was young

603
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,168
We're deeply racist people who had a particular hatred of Martin Luther King

604
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
Not because he was violent

605
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,520
Because he was Christian and Zack him yeah

606
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,592
I guess what I'm getting at is that Alex Jones is a coward

607
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:16,992
He's not even willing to leave his beliefs the way his forefathers would have totally he knows that it looks pretty racist to be opposed to Martin Luther King

608
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,528
These days

609
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:23,648
Who pretends that I mean

610
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
Someone

611
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
To talk about

612
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,768
Standing down

613
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,352
In the face of something and then to talk about Martin Luther

614
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,704
The King Jr very shortly afterwards is someone who does not know anything about Martin Luther King

615
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,520
It's another little interesting element of Disney

616
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,336
Yeah yeah yeah it's like

617
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,432
It's like somebody being like a my my dad was in the FBI and

618
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,736
You know when they murdered Fred Hampton he was like

619
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
That was one too many bullets

620
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,832
As for me I'm going to choose

621
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
The path of

622
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
Peace from here on out

623
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,976
Can I find so fascinating is like how much Alex

624
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
Wants to live in the shadow

625
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,096
Of these anti-communist Heroes and like

626
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,656
It's so his worldview all of this is

627
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
But he refuses to take

628
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
Ownership

629
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:13,056
Of these things that he knows absolutely

630
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,384
Yeah I can't be against the Civil Rights Act

631
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,688
You know it's it's one of those things where it's like

632
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,480
You can see how

633
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,040
Bankrupt their ideology is over

634
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,856
Time because they just abandoned s*** after it

635
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:29,952
You don't like just refuse to accept it public

636
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,744
Well I mean yeah

637
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
I mean that that like

638
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,328
Martin Luther King Junior is so

639
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
F****** revered

640
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
That the right

641
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:43,776
Has to now use him to try and reinstitute slavery they can't like

642
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,336
He's such a great guy

643
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:52,224
He would have wanted us to own you again I'm sorry Alex drunk enough you would talk about how he's

644
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,528
Sure

645
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Anyway

646
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
There's truck bombs coming

647
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,880
But also Alex says

648
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
Y'all got to go.

649
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184
Your Capital sure

650
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,768
Bombs in major cities this weekend or next week

651
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,536
Master plan

652
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
It's too early stage mass shooting

653
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Why would we do

654
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,360
We want to be out of the capital this weekend

655
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Gun

656
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,112
What happened

657
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
Jesus

658
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,976
Have your video camera and.

659
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Document

660
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,608
Every person so you don't want to do that isn't it kind of contradictory

661
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:46,752
Maybe just unwise to tell your audience like hey there going to be a bunch of s*** to everybody

662
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
I'll be fine cuz I'm in a tank

663
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,104
You guys are good

664
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
Fairly certain

665
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,688
That's not

666
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,296
If you think this is going to be like staging as of mass shootings and bombings

667
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
I would say for the party

668
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,880
Protection of your audience stay home

669
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Listen

670
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
They're going to blow everybody up

671
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
Killing you

672
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Left and right

673
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,048
And that's why you got to go

674
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,912
Themes

675
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,312
There were some looking like the people that I'm supposed to tell you are

676
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
Antifa

677
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
Picture

678
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,896
There was a people who are not answer

679
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
See if I actually who were involved on the

680
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,736
Who plays Bob

681
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,296
No that's a couple pipe bombs

682
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
You can't miss these at

683
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
Antifa

684
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
You can't miss

685
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
You'll see Chinese

686
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
Backpacks as well

687
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,568
They are deep State marks

688
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
Core

689
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
Halliburton

690
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
United

691
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,480
Houses

692
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
All of that up

693
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,368
Nothing real about any of that you know what is boggling my mind

694
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,416
What's that is that he literally did

695
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
Did say it

696
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
And it is

697
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
True

698
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,024
They were planning on taking hostages

699
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,816
And assassinating members of Congress

700
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Yes

701
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
That was a

702
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,656
Well that's something

703
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,960
Like a conspiracy theory Dan

704
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,056
Did something that is disgusting

705
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,360
Certainly their people who have some suspicions

706
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,200
That that is that was the plan there indications

707
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
Of that

708
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
Start. To learn more

709
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
Thanko s*** that's

710
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,856
Are they have members of Congress helping him that's

711
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
Alex

712
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:42,208
Alex is definitely of the

713
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,792
Mind in terms of reporting that it was supposed to be way worse

714
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,072
Yeah

715
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
And that might be that might be the case

716
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,168
There's a lot of details there yet to be

717
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,520
Solidly understood but some of the indications are really really terrifying

718
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,128
You know there's there's some issues between Alex

719
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,176
Some cute

720
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
Estranged

721
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
Stuff like

722
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
Why did

723
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
You do this earlier

724
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,904
No no

725
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,304
To get to the point where you realized it was actually the people remember only two years ago

726
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
What he said he could

727
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,912
Could see through the Matrix and saw their plan and knew what was

728
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
He could read the

729
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,544
The conning Tower scale yeah

730
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,824
Now he understands

731
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,896
But all of that and now he sees why qanon

732
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
Trapped him

733
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,200
In the early stages

734
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,736
I'm just going to throw this out the

735
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
If

736
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,552
He he said

737
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,856
The same thing two years ago and got everything

738
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,136
Wrong

739
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
Okay

740
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
Why would I been trust him now when he says

741
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:53,632
Because you forgotten that he said all that stuff that's why I wish I could do that

742
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,936
You attacked our totally onto and here's why

743
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,472
This isn't my opinion

744
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
We know where this is going

745
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,824
We know what you really on

746
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,872
Because you figured out

747
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,736
4 years later

748
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,552
Under orders

749
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
Operation

750
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,208
Let's do this so we can put on information Mike Jones books out

751
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,280
Axillary interesting but so nobody gets sued

752
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,352
But it was instantly taken away in three weeks by the group

753
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,168
The Trump campaign people.

754
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,704
I don't believe any of this stuff

755
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,032
But if it is true that seems insanely illegal

756
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,336
Also again

757
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,152
Trump was officially running qanon

758
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,176
Beginning

759
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:42,016
Why do you keep telling me how shity your

760
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,576
God-king is it doing this

761
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
3 weeks

762
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,744
Just steal the greatest f****** conspiracy from the government that's all it took

763
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
3 weeks

764
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
And how

765
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:59,680
Password to put two-step notification what what are we doing here

766
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,472
Home

767
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
And if that's the case

768
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,056
Bright and all this happen

769
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,616
At 3 weeks and it got commandeered

770
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,152
By these nefarious people

771
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,224
Wouldn't be in the best interest of the Trump campaign to like

772
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,576
Really make sure the people understood that this was something that was a malevolent Force

773
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
So it didn't

774
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,880
End up becoming such a

775
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:22,208
Used part of the Trump base or at the very least

776
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Utilize

777
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,048
The vast resources of the United States government

778
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
To take

779
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
Back

780
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:33,472
Oh yeah they could do that to 3 weeks they stole our access to Q

781
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:38,336
About an hour later we stole it back it's a hardware the government

782
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
Yeah

783
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:46,272
I do love the idea of the other like they attacked because I knew I was the only person

784
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,600
God dammit

785
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,136
Detective only person

786
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,952
Besides everyone else now

787
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:58,816
God I hate them some other things that are starting

788
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,912
To come to light that are a little bit problematic for Alex's narrative

789
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
Namely that

790
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
We are proud boys

791
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,288
Who were around the capitol

792
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,848
And sometimes you know there's some indication

793
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,872
Even

794
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,920
Some of the problems might have been there

795
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,456
Regret if they get going

796
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,480
Getting going Park

797
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,040
Say something

798
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,392
Very close to revealing information

799
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,024
Major Patriot group was infiltrated

800
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
Ahead of the savanna

801
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Leader was arrested

802
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
Global Offensive

803
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
Bhattacharjee

804
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
But they can also

805
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
Command

806
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,624
Mario get arrested right before he's the leader of the proud boys

807
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
What didn't you big

808
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,464
Become the leader of

809
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,256
Yeah buddy

810
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,560
Yeah this I'd like this is the way these

811
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:08,960
This is the way these games died it's whatever exactly whatever they decide but some of them

812
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,032
Working against them and they tear themselves apart

813
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,592
That's that's the good news here that's what I'm

814
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:18,688
Hearing idiots

815
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,480
Cowboys accident

816
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,552
Counter to the scam narrative that I need to

817
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:27,392
To keep my money, then so well guess they actually got infiltrated

818
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,672
I just

819
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
Hey

820
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,720
How often

821
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
I said

822
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
Before this all happened

823
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,304
Guys

824
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:41,216
They're going to abandon you the moment I do something that they don't like yes they don't have any loyalty to

825
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,496
You can't trust

826
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
How these things work

827
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,616
Yeah and to see the ways that like it's hard to have

828
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,408
Too much pity for

829
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
Someone Like You

830
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
McHugh shaman

831
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:57,088
Community interacted with him after the fact somebody tried to

832
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,648
Play I got a lot of suspicions about it like

833
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
You're done

834
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:10,144
Everything happy you guys told me to do I became the hero that you guys needed and now you've abandoned me

835
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,192
How could anyone have predicted

836
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:18,848
So this episode Alex is really like acting in a lot of ways that I think a bad

837
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:25,248
Because as we discussed earlier that like if you take him seriously and you believe the things he saying

838
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
Going to kill you

839
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
They're coming to kill you

840
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,088
And he just in your home

841
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,624
He keeps banging that drum

842
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
They want

843
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,256
They want to inoculate you and watch you have a convulsion

844
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,816
They want to kill you they love hurting you

845
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
They're coming

846
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,168
Comics there's nothing you can do except

847
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
Face reality

848
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
How we beat the

849
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,056
We have cancer he have a satanic cancer

850
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,687
Are you or them

851
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,991
Look at that their race look at Schumer

852
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,551
Look at Pelosi

853
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,367
These are not human

854
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,391
They're coming

855
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,463
I need your brains they need your soul they don't have it

856
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,047
They want to destroy you they want to bring you down

857
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,839
They love Chinese death camp

858
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:18,495
They're all turned over to evil

859
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519
I mean

860
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:25,919
And that's why you need to stay at home and write your congressperson on violence and send letter

861
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:31,807
And just be aware that's why you need to go put up Infowars bumper stickers and buy

862
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,135
Colloidal iodine fuckyourself man

863
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,439
So Alex is saying here's what you need

864
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,767
When they come to your home

865
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:47,167
Knock on your door to kill you

866
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,495
And then they leave

867
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,031
Yeah yeah

868
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,615
You flash your Infowars bumper sticker and it's like garlic to a Dracula

869
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,015
Has a really interesting relation

870
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,063
Ship with the events of the 6th

871
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
Thunderstorming

872
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:08,927
And I've noticed a little thing that he's starting to talk about more or starting to

873
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:13,279
To bring up and I think that one of his primary concerns is that they planned it

874
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
Poorly

875
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
Will you sleep

876
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
Bullet Button

877
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:22,751
They are controlling the dumbest violent elements to make sure that it's all

878
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,591
Lcq saying

879
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,455
Schumer's house or go to Obama's house or where they're at

880
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
Oh no no no

881
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,319
That's kind of sucked up

882
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,343
Yeah

883
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,391
I mean he's probably not wrong

884
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,207
Black if you

885
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
Planned it better and used

886
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,303
60 and you f*** everything up then

887
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,631
Trump takes power says that it's all actually antifa

888
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:54,751
Gets the military on his side starts f****** everybody up who isn't a proud boy or whatever

889
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,079
But instead they did it poorly so here we are

890
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:04,223
Maybe it's hard to play what if game

891
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:10,879
It shouldn't be that Alex is like Wildman a plan that s*** for lately

892
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,951
Right right

893
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
Resent

894
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
As much as

895
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,023
They got tricked

896
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:23,679
Qanon and antifa

897
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,727
On the other side of the building where you at

898
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,263
Oh no it's okay

899
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,543
He's 100%

900
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,591
I mean we know that

901
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,663
Those little indications a little momentary like

902
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,479
It's poorly planned and they didn't go too soft

903
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
Target yeah

904
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
Okay yeah

905
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
Yep

906
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,903
Now you might think

907
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,695
Let me ask you a question

908
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,463
Shorty

909
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
If Alex

910
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,511
Jones

911
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,535
Sees a guy

912
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:55,423
Sorry I did and you didn't finish yes he's a guy who's got like a really hot wife

913
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,263
I'm sorry nevermind he's a jealous of that guy

914
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,103
Absolutely will he say so

915
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,967
No well actually he will by going on a long-winded rant about how he's not

916
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,743
Horse or something

917
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,047
I'm just glad you're having sex

918
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,191
What the average man I've learned

919
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,751
Just as envious of ever

920
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,287
That's weird

921
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:36,127
That is a weird thing to say that's a weird thing

922
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:42,527
Bowser like I'm so glad you get to f*** that in my head I was waiting for him to say some

923
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:46,367
Something about miseducation like that's the level of you get f***** up I'm

924
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:52,767
Operating a person's attractive you get to f*** them and have kids Jesus I look at that like

925
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,535
I got a horse

926
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,375
This is not just this is not just a very

927
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:01,215
Weird way for me to still experience jealousy

928
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
Jesus

929
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,311
Alex has a Gaston

930
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,383
It is interesting because this person is basically be

931
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
Been shouting qanon

932
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,943
Stuff into the wheeler or weeks

933
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,735
Yeah

934
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,295
Patrick Byrne is a really smart fella

935
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:19,391
Tell you about where there's a peaceful way

936
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:20,927
Violent

937
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:27,327
Patrick Byrne is the former CEO of Overstock who's yalla

938
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,911
Qanon nonsense. Nonsense

939
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
On the six

940
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:41,407
Or the rally before the before the rally

941
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
Tell you but if your violin

942
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,551
You're just helping Nancy

943
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
Pelosi

944
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,695
What you were doing

945
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,583
20% of America

946
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,423
And then the other thing is

947
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:08,543
Basically she wants

948
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:18,527
They keep talkin like they were talk to BonChon in Fort Worth about outlawing the Democratic Party

949
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,319
What are you doing

950
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:25,183
We need literally word for word we need to get rid of the Democratic Party

951
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,975
And then the Republican Party

952
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:31,327
Split into two parties one the far-right party and one the right party

953
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,887
That's what I said.

954
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,983
The important thing now is that you don't get viola

955
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,135
Kill everything

956
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,159
Calling for

957
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:56,927
Not go

958
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
Take selfies

959
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,047
Don't want to go to prom

960
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,935
We don't want to do it but if you raise everything a burned-out everything

961
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,983
Kill Everybody

962
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,775
I am

963
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:15,359
Blinded by the idea that you could think

964
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,175
The guy saying you should toss the Geneva

965
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:24,319
Conventions right back up your ass and burn everything to the ground along the way

966
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,855
He's a good guy

967
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,391
That confused

968
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
This is me Dan

969
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
Well it's B

970
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
Because

971
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,975
Do you know he's at

972
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
He's good

973
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:38,399
The Democrats are evil and they're run by Satan and what you need to do is not take the moral High Ground

974
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,471
Turn everything to the f****** ground

975
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:46,591
He's not saying what he wants to do that just did it would work

976
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,711
Also again

977
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:56,319
Again he would defeat the global cfra

978
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:01,439
These Patriots did a Sherman's march right and that burned down everything killed everyone around them

979
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,487
But it's antifa who did all the

980
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:09,887
The violent dial blahblahblah singers

981
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:13,983
They were proud boys who'd been co-opted by a fan

982
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:20,639
You guys got to work overtime to say we didn't do exactly what we said that

983
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,687
Headed to do it's a little silly

984
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,575
A lot of people burn

985
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:34,719
He's got a really simple suggestion for what needs to happen start Overstock too.

986
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,815
Overstock pallets

987
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,887
Okay

988
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,935
These guys

989
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:50,591
One of the things they always have is like a solution to the problem

990
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,895
Today of a solution that's

991
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,687
Really really simple

992
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,247
But man it is not simple

993
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,295
Insanely complicated

994
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,855
Would be outrageous to actually do but

995
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,415
This is all we watch

996
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:10,815
Count

997
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:14,143
Live stream TV by the National Guard

998
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,983
We see what happens if

999
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,055
How does helicopter

1000
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,479
Election

1001
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:38,719
Show is 500,000

1002
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:54,079
30 days 45 days they're going to run it

1003
00:50:54,591 --> 00:51:00,223
If you want

1004
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,271
It'll be most drunk Heights

1005
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,951
Ha

1006
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,023
I would be

1007
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:23,775
Is it so much to ask is I will I say this to you honestly

1008
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,823
I think the only thing that could get

1009
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,663
Over ninety percent of Americans to try and overthrow the government

1010
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,503
Any party saying let's have another election right now

1011
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,063
I think everyone is a little burned out

1012
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,111
I'm f****** done

1013
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:44,511
F****** done not doing this not doing

1014
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,327
Not doing another election

1015
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,399
That will make me want to burn everything to the ground

1016
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:56,799
I like when people like Patrick trying to play this game is essentially

1017
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,823
Offering this like

1018
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:04,479
False idea of a simple solution but why wouldn't you accept this really simple solution totally

1019
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:07,039
Bisphenol of Arkham

1020
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,599
You're obviously not true

1021
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,647
It's a setup it's a trap

1022
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,951
Imagine a scenario where an

1023
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,767
This world or the United States is like

1024
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:20,095
Yes okay we will do this National Guard hand

1025
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,631
Count of these ballots

1026
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:28,031
What would end up happening is the NAT will be used as an opportunity to find a new problem that they can use to complain

1027
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
Trying

1028
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,615
Get this national election

1029
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,895
National Guard

1030
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
Or whatever

1031
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,711
Don't just a f****** stupid game

1032
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,503
Trying to get sufficient

1033
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,343
Adventure they're trying to go on volume something to complain about

1034
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,367
Airbnb

1035
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:48,767
Almost makes me long for the days when they would have to actually move the goalposts instead of being able to see that they've set up

1036
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,071
Goalpost exactly Twenty Yards apart for

1037
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,631
Infinity and every time you reach one they're like

1038
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,911
VSCO post

1039
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:59,775
That one over there

1040
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
Mad annoying

1041
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,359
So at the under-12

1042
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,407
Trump was speaking in Alamo TX

1043
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,943
Which is not the Alamo

1044
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,991
Which was totally on purpose

1045
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:15,391
You chose Alamo the city 100% on purpose at work just cuz nobody knew that he was coming doesn't mean that you didn't choose album

1046
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,671
Another city 100%

1047
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:23,071
And Alex knows that it's the city not the Alamo building would help and he is also said the people are gathering at

1048
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
Alamo

1049
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,375
There is some confusion

1050
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,423
And I think that Patrick

1051
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:31,007
I'm not sure if he knows if it to the Alamo or Alamo Texas

1052
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,823
These people

1053
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,151
Alamo

1054
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:45,599
It would be

1055
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,391
Area

1056
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,815
Morals

1057
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:00,959
No.

1058
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:07,103
Questions with people who are at the Alamo

1059
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
I don't I don't go off

1060
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,199
The past Lloris later on

1061
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,479
He's going to save it

1062
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,295
Both sides of his family were on the Mayflower

1063
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,367
Why.

1064
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,183
Why not I love it

1065
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:27,583
I was married to Queen but I don't think he's related to Colonel Travis at all

1066
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:30,911
Now anyway we get a revelation about spiritually they're both drunk

1067
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,447
True

1068
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,519
Bumblebee

1069
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,591
Hyperfocal bug

1070
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:43,967
Trivia about what's going on in Patrick Burns

1071
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,191
Do people get cold people get fluids but they're calling

1072
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,751
The PCR test we have any viral background

1073
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,031
Pheasant you have felt

1074
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,639
Trying to convince wow wow

1075
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:13,919
Cheese's

1076
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:18,015
Did Patrick not realize you weren't supposed to actually have covid ever

1077
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,063
If you are near Alex's show

1078
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,903
Yeah it's only imagine that 40% of info Warriors it probably had it

1079
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:30,815
I think I'm not working

1080
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,887
I bet the numbers High

1081
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,703
So Allie Alexander

1082
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,495
Is the head of stop the

1083
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,263
Bastille

1084
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,567
He was involved in the the rallies

1085
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,335
On the six

1086
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,615
2 something

Capacity

He has done some live streams or he talked about how he planned

1089
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,991
The event

1090
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,015
Franco's

1091
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:54,367
To put pressure on the people voting about the Electoral College

1092
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,415
Along with

1093
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,695
Paul gosar

1094
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
Mo Brooks

Send Andy Briggs

1096
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,559
Yep three members of Congress

1097
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:07,167
Yeah it's good to know in the aftermath of everything he is

1098
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,959
Kicked off all social media

1099
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,055
Rumors flying around about him being in hiding

1100
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:17,919
And some of that might be a little bit of a crowdfunding operation

1101
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,735
The Drifters got a grip

1102
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:24,063
But if they're trying to play this really interesting line about weather or not

1103
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:24,831
He's in hiding

1104
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,135
Because they don't want him to be in hiding

1105
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,439
Cuz that makes him look like a week

1106
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
They also

1107
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,743
Want him to be in hiding

1108
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,791
Because that makes everything really scary

1109
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,327
Stop

1110
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,863
I'm not in hiding

1111
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,423
You know for my own

1112
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,447
Protection because of

1113
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,471
Tents

1114
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,239
Thousand

1115
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,543
People that the media has

1116
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,311
Inspired

1117
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,847
To issue me

1118
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,455
Call from my

1119
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,735
Maya Pub

1120
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,015
Public execution

1121
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:57,343
I am patient

1122
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,879
I've had to travel

1123
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,671
By unconventional means

1124
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,719
You taking a dirigeable

1125
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:10,655
That would be I would be if I would be happier if Allie Alexander did try and overthrow the

1126
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:16,543
Government but Viator Isabel at that would be great

1127
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,663
Normal force

1128
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:28,063
Call Bliss will let me get around but I have to look silly doing it I don't know why it's part of their rule

1129
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,879
Put one leg on a skateboard at all times

1130
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:37,023
It's not in hiding but I'm also in an undisclosed location and I have to

1131
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,303
Travel video

1132
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,095
Vegetable beef and sauce

1133
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,375
Fox News

1134
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,471
Sort of narrative about what happened.

1135
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,495
At the Capitol

1136
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,287
Pretty similar to Alex I guess

1137
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,895
I believe it forces within our government coordinated with the paramilitary arm of the

1138
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,919
Democrat Party

1139
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
Discuss

1140
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:01,599
Inside the US Capitol not everybody was discussing

1141
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
Okay

1142
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,047
Is are

1143
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:10,815
Belmar

1144
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
What's coming

1145
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
Performance

1146
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,935
They would have breached the US House

1147
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,983
What we know is that only

1148
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,007
Jake that weird

1149
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,031
Your shaman

1150
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,567
And by the way

1151
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,871
A lot of people don't know this here's an exclusive

1152
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,455
Counter-protesters

1153
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,479
The last doctor

1154
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,271
You rally in Arizona

1155
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,623
Stop the steel

1156
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:41,023
In Arizona he's probably answer your phone I looked into this and apparently what happened is that the

1157
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:46,143
Showed up at Allie Alexander's event

1158
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,519
Alright

1159
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:57,919
Yeah they did get a speaker slot videos not happy about it proposed a new solution to our problem

1160
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:58,943
Alright

1161
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,223
Here's my here's my pic

1162
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,295
Okay all of these grifter type

1163
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,855
Are scrambling to

1164
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
Scapegoat

1165
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,927
Which I like how it's 2020

1166
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,207
Are 2021

1167
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,631
Too late now it's already happened

1168
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,751
There's scapegoating people

1169
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
Got to do it

1170
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,567
Even though they love them

1171
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,615
Mx400

1172
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,919
Propose

1173
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,455
The Thunderdome

1174
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,527
Alright Alex Jones has to go up against

1175
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
Execution

1176
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,343
Thunderdome two men enter one man leaves

1177
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:43,743
Are you talking about the place where they now have WWE Raw absolutely Thunderdome

1178
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
Two people

1179
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Enter

1180
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,863
One leaves until we have a single ideological group

1181
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,143
I mean

1182
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:54,751
Post better ratings and Alex's normal show

1183
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:55,775
I'd watch that

1184
00:59:56,031 --> 01:00:00,895
The paramilitary wing of the democratic party it's just

1185
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,343
It's really short interview cuz Alex has another

1186
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,647
This guy's uncle

1187
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,671
Wrote the foreword

1188
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,695
For a very racist

1189
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,511
Book written by Gary Allan about the Civil Rights Movement

1190
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,047
Joel skousen

1191
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,583
He has some interesting

1192
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,935
To ask about hey we're supposed to admire General Flynn

1193
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:30,591
No Alex did that interview with flying in that interview General Flynn said 100% Trump is still going to be

1194
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,615
President after

1195
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,895
January 20th

1196
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,175
Amscot

1197
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,967
How could you be so stupid

1198
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,271
How many believe something

1199
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,343
But I'm convinced that there's somebody else

1200
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:47,999
Perhaps General in the military

1201
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,791
Was talking to them and telling them

1202
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:56,191
I'm a patriot are you know there's a whole group in the White House

1203
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,799
No other explanation for why

1204
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,079
General Flynn

1205
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:06,687
In the face of all that we know about the Deep state would make a statement that there's a hundred percent

1206
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:11,551
Donald Trump's going to win

1207
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:25,375
Yeah I wish you'd ask him if you have contact with those who was to contact who told him

1208
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,959
Somebody perfect

1209
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,519
I'd appreciate that

1210
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:38,175
That seems rude I would appreciate that as well I am going to sleep better tonight knowing that Jenner

1211
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:42,015
Errol Flynn is being bothered by the nephew of w Cleon skousen

1212
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:46,623
Ignoring his text make me feel very good

1213
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:53,023
It's nice to know the general plan is soon going to have to get a new phone number cuz skousen woke about fathers

1214
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,071
That's what I want out of this whole thing

1215
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,887
Epstein

1216
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,679
Let's bring him back

1217
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:02,239
Everybody realize that they just trying to

1218
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,543
Start the f****** capital

1219
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,823
He's dead

1220
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
Right

1221
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,127
I guess

1222
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:14,271
I guess what drives the Deep State the promise that we will make all of your sins go away

1223
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,807
Unless you do something

1224
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,575
Stupid

1225
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,111
Jeffrey Epstein

1226
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:26,047
Exit him

1227
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,423
You know you can't put anything past

1228
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,775
Gay people suspicious

1229
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,567
Whatever alright

1230
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,663
There was a video that was going around

1231
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,455
On Twitter

1232
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,759
I believe that this is what Alex is talking about

1233
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,831
Someone brought it to my attention, people actually

1234
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:52,671
There was a video of Alex yelling of Alex

1235
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,695
Yeah

1236
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:56,255
It was supposedly like

1237
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,791
After all of this

1238
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:01,631
Like Trump conceding Abbey has turned on amateur

1239
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,655
And it was

1240
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,703
The videos from when Alex

1241
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:08,287
Got mad at Trump for bombing Syria

1242
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,591
Messes up his dirty ass it was that same day

1243
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:14,687
Realize the feeds were alive

1244
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,967
Okay

1245
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:23,647
And people people like about it saying it was implying that it was

1246
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,671
Alex

1247
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,951
Thinks it might be a deep

1248
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:32,351
Martial law

1249
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,911
I've been through a lot of stress

1250
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:38,239
In 27 years on are probably 10 times I flipped out late at night

1251
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,055
My dog died

1252
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,639
Dog.

1253
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:46,943
Custody

1254
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:51,295
But there's nothing modern

1255
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,087
Jesus Christ

1256
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,927
A long time like that sounds like

1257
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,975
And it took something I've done

1258
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,255
Together their exaggerated

1259
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,535
Am I bi a deepfake

1260
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,559
Yeah that sounds right

1261
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:05,119
Sounds right it's probably deepfake

1262
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,679
Videos nice screaming of Sanity about Trump

1263
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
Is that the only difference

1264
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,287
Between the right-wing in like

1265
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,591
Other people is just like

1266
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,871
Other people who like hey

1267
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,919
I suppose I could be wrong

1268
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,455
About something

1269
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,479
Not Deepak

1270
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,015
Yeah the right is just like

1271
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
I am going to have

1272
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,599
To go with I'm still right no matter what

1273
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,951
So skousen interview is not really all that info

1274
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,255
Interesting either you sort of going on the same

1275
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:36,863
Tracks that we've already seeing not really bringing a whole lot more to the

1276
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,399
The conversation outside of

1277
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,471
Glen's number sure and reviewing that Epstein's probably alive

1278
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,751
Still

1279
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
Alex

1280
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,079
I'm sorry about

1281
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
Presidents

1282
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,151
This might be the light

1283
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,711
President

1284
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,783
He's our president he's in a marriage

1285
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
Probably the last

1286
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
For the return

1287
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,719
Does God gives you the example of what to do right before the fall

1288
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,023
This is what you could have had

1289
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:08,095
So Alex is the fourth hour now

1290
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,119
Because

1291
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,399
Trump's going to give his speech

1292
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,423
In Alamo

1293
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,215
Alex is

1294
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,775
Constantly going on and on about how like

1295
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,335
No one else is broadcasting this speech

1296
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
She's

1297
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,895
It's very annoying

1298
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
But

1299
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:25,247
After the speech he gets into like this really f***** up headspace

1300
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,039
I swear he's just talking about how like

1301
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:31,391
I've lived in the fire

1302
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,415
The fire alright

1303
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,695
The bacon grease

1304
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,999
People like Jones are you scared

1305
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,023
Theophilus

1306
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
Graceful

1307
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,423
I've been lowered out of it

1308
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,215
Whole life

1309
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,567
The wave

1310
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,151
Because I believe

1311
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:53,919
But I warn you

1312
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,271
When you get lowered down into that Grayson your toes hit that

1313
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,551
Boiling

1314
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,391
How's your legs

1315
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
Waking up your chest

1316
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,767
That you're going to fight

1317
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,047
I'm

1318
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,071
Betting on

1319
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,095
You

1320
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,191
Lived in the grace

1321
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,471
For decades

1322
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
I would say physically

1323
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,103
My bad is made of Greece

1324
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,175
Weird

1325
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:32,319
I don't even see melted Grace either I see they're like solid stuff ever leave it out for a day and then sitting there

1326
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:40,255
It's basically like a sensory deprivation tank

1327
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:46,655
Joe Rogan got me all this information please

1328
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,191
What's every two weeks

1329
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,799
Crying also at the underwear episode

1330
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:55,103
Nothing will fulfill you like the Holy Ghost

1331
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,663
Holy Ghost will fulfill you so much you

1332
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,455
Even believe it

1333
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,831
Like God demands you take action

1334
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
Which team scary

1335
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:08,927
Don't know why I be

1336
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,951
Salon

1337
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
It isn't a joiner

1338
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,095
It is

1339
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,423
Why was I not doing before

1340
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,703
There's actually

1341
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
Guilt

1342
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:26,847
Once you join God Satan is a rotting dead

1343
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,127
Carcass in the corner

1344
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,919
With maggots covering it

1345
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:34,015
And your Galaxy

1346
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,831
How did this ever quite well how is this

1347
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:41,183
Heading you watch civilization falling your people falling

1348
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,399
Chuck

1349
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,935
Replace Trump

1350
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,031
Replace your mother

1351
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,055
Was Satan

1352
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,615
Everything that song

1353
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,663
And everything is good with Ally

1354
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
Why

1355
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
What you do that

1356
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:09,855
Alright Alex imma need you to do this again from the top.

1357
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,879
That's what Alex

1358
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,951
Grape truck with lighter

1359
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,511
Are we having for dinner tonight

1360
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,303
Batman

1361
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:25,983
I want to wait I can't wait for the inauguration

1362
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,519
Cuz I want to see if Alex

1363
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,543
The Joe Biden

1364
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,567
Pump It Up

1365
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:40,063
I do I do love the idea that you can you can reach Enlightenment like

1366
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,623
You think of the great the great Buddha

1367
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:50,303
They managed to pierce the veil and detach themselves by seeing the ultimate meaninglessness of our space at the unit

1368
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:53,887
Instead of like being like I've reached Enlightenment they were just like

1369
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,519
Odf

1370
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,543
Interesting

1371
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,079
So that we get to the 13th

1372
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,919
And Alex is in a different heads

1373
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:09,503
Feels doomed a little bit

1374
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:14,623
Ever see the children of men that movie I have

1375
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,439
Let people talk about it right now

1376
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,535
Divorce.com

1377
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,071
How to put a live audio video

1378
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,679
We are now in the New World Order

1379
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,007
Tune into this emergency broadcast if you want to live

1380
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,079
Because when you look at

1381
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:39,967
And when you see children are 23 years old today

1382
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,759
They're growing up in a dystopia

1383
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,135
That's the last generation

1384
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:50,207
Barely be able to have children and most of them won't be able to

1385
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:52,255
And most the children you see today

1386
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,815
Will be

1387
01:09:56,351 --> 01:10:01,215
Cancerous

1388
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,543
You're all being killed

1389
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,639
All the FBI agents to know

1390
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,039
Part of the system

1391
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:18,111
I can tell you the people running this

1392
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,391
Are not in control

1393
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,695
Then are they running it

1394
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,023
Advanced knowledge

1395
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,655
S***

1396
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,959
Aliens

1397
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,751
The devil it's the devil alien

1398
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,031
Okay

1399
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,639
Interdimensional

1400
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:46,783
Interdimensional demon Devils trying to give you vaccines in order to kill you but please don't storm the capitol

1401
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,831
I am almost 100

1402
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,903
Percent positive whatever you do just spread link

1403
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
To my contacts

1404
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,463
I'm just so sure

1405
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:59,839
There's a promise that you at least won't be f***** over by the devil

1406
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
Inhale

1407
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,887
Until after you die

1408
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,471
He's poking you here

1409
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,751
I just don't think

1410
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:11,615
The Pitchfork is actually three vaccines

1411
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,919
Sharks

1412
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:16,735
Broncos right so so silly whenever they take

1413
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,295
Stupid religion and they're like

1414
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:25,695
Now let's add some science to it now that we know about different dimension

1415
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,231
Airplane man

1416
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:33,631
Which lowers everything down from like a spiritual thing to just add another f****** thing takes a lot of value away from it

1417
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:40,031
It's like oh you know I understand that lightning is static electricity as you know what it's like

1418
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
It's not as

1419
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,871
Magical is if is Zeus with throwing it at me

1420
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,943
Now I know God's just some a****** in a different

1421
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
Dimension

1422
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,735
But that guy

1423
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:55,135
Music by Dimension if you want to tell me what to do and it doesn't reduce the

1424
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:55,903
That like

1425
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,183
Once you realize this

1426
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,207
Lightning isn't

1427
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:01,023
Thrown by Zeus electrical

1428
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,815
You can then create lightning

1429
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:05,119
You can understand it

1430
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:08,191
And if you know it kind of takes away the point of religion

1431
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:10,751
If you bring all this science stuff to it

1432
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:15,359
It's within the realm of human comprehension and then it's not really

1433
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:20,479
Religion at all you see through a glass Darkly

1434
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,879
Dimensional travel could if it is X

1435
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,647
Dimensional

1436
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:30,463
Then that would suggest that there is a possibility

1437
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:34,815
That we could eventually Pierce our way through into God's Dimension and

1438
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:41,215
Finally kill and overthrow God like we've always been dreaming or conversely Alex does have an actual shot of the

1439
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:45,823
Destroying the death

1440
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,223
It sounds silly.

1441
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,063
The devil's behind everything

1442
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:59,135
I gave him 20 to 1 odds that's generous

1443
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:03,999
We can look at all this news and all the things that are happening all the insanity

1444
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,815
We just said ourselves

1445
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,607
Well this is this is

1446
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,399
But it's not

1447
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,191
We have a fallen nature

1448
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,239
We are being manipulated

1449
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,055
Dimensional

1450
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:19,871
Creature

1451
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,663
What is out of the blue

1452
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,687
Spectrum vision

1453
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,295
Velvet planet

1454
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:32,415
And has a plan to overtake us play God and then use us and our creativity

1455
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,719
To build an escape system

1456
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,303
What

1457
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,607
We're way more

1458
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,447
Seize the creature

1459
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,471
That turned against God

1460
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:46,751
What

1461
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:51,871
Bible churches in the Mason

1462
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,175
And all of that is to keep you from that information

1463
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:58,015
Churches are trying to keep this Friday

1464
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,319
I love that

1465
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,879
I want to end every insane things

1466
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:06,207
Everything think I say was just now that's the Bible

1467
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,487
That's the Bible

1468
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,791
Build guys

1469
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,071
Put that one in the book

1470
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:11,839
Yeah

1471
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:17,727
It'll be in to be really interesting if like all the stories about Alex that end up getting printed in the

1472
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,263
You know these Outlets

1473
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,799
Like they LED with

1474
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:29,759
F*** you how dare you pretend that any of these people have anything other than

1475
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:33,087
Believes nonsense before their name

1476
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:38,207
Who believes that communism is being directed by a literal demon totally

1477
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,511
Totally

1478
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,047
Staying away from him

1479
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,839
Bad whenever you're like oh that

1480
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,887
So

1481
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,911
In the future

1482
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,447
Sick people before

1483
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,215
To merge with me

1484
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:49,983
Machines

1485
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
Sounds right

1486
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,031
I'll actually be killed

1487
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,311
What you

1488
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,591
Have to pretend

1489
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,919
That they haven't been killed and these machines are actually them

1490
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,943
Or else you will get in

1491
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
Trouble

1492
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,783
Coffee

1493
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
But if you don't

1494
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,343
Understand

1495
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:08,415
Everybody dies

1496
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,207
And there's no more children

1497
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:15,071
And in the process of wanting to live to the social credit score

1498
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,191
Until you involved

1499
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,727
Public ritual

1500
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,519
Sterilizing your children

1501
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
Sterilizing yourself

1502
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:28,127
Resisting God resenting God

1503
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,687
Because you're so sick

1504
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,479
You got the mercy machine

1505
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:35,039
So you just believe you have a chance to fill live

1506
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,319
Do you will actually die

1507
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,623
Should be a law

1508
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
But you cannot

1509
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,159
Call

1510
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,439
The synthetics that are

1511
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,207
Human

1512
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,255
Machine merge cyborg

1513
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,607
If you say that's not a person anymore

1514
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:53,727
They didn't transfer over to machine it's a fraud why mean honestly that's right

1515
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,311
I don't know if I would go that far

1516
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,663
Now that's

1517
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,431
The Bible

1518
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:07,039
Study just so much and now he wants so far

1519
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,855
Levels

1520
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,951
Anybody can go away with the globalist and what they

1521
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,487
Carryout

1522
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:19,327
But now from my immersion in this since about 7 years old

1523
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:27,263
Great analogy

1524
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
It's only going to get worse from you

1525
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,335
This is a lunatic

1526
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,639
Yeah.

1527
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,431
The end.

1528
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,503
This lunatic here he wants

1529
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,271
What's 2

1530
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,831
It seems like he wants to distance himself

1531
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
Drop a little bit

1532
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,391
No I can't imagine

1533
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:47,231
And this was one of the first indications of like

1534
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
Didn't work out

1535
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,047
You know if whatever

1536
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:55,167
Hotel liberal-conservative all of you

1537
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:55,935
Trump

1538
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,983
Wishful thinking

1539
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,847
I thought about this app right about this

1540
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,639
I'll explain

1541
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,663
I want to come back

1542
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,783
The new Motors

1543
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,599
Tune into this emergency broadcast if you want to live

1544
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,135
Not a joke

1545
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,439
God of this world

1546
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,351
Wishful thinking

1547
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
Yeah

1548
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:34,335
What did you start listening to

1549
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:38,687
Starting the back catalog where I was like in 2017 guys

1550
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,551
Trump is going to abandon you the moments that it's

1551
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,599
Expedient for him to f****** do so

1552
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:51,999
Building up something that's going to eventually blow up

1553
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:55,583
The giant coward

1554
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,679
Play also I know that I think

1555
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:03,007
You and I've heard Alex say the Trump is one of the greatest

1556
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,031
Christians

1557
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,055
However

1558
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:11,711
He's very religious and deeply religious

1559
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,015
Got all these types

1560
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:19,647
Actually is impressed

1561
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:23,231
He's more of an energy guy

1562
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,399
He's never been a devil worshiper

1563
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:36,543
Undercover

1564
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:48,319
You said he was a secret agent

1565
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,599
The energy

1566
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,391
You said he's been a Christian since like

1567
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,927
40 years

1568
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,487
What Trump

1569
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,375
People with jet

1570
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,935
Control border

1571
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,495
Populism

1572
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,311
Optimistic

1573
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,103
How to say no we want

1574
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,639
Evil pedophile

1575
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,919
Common Chinese zombie

1576
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,479
Trump is a false flag

1577
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,271
Tired

1578
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,063
Can tires

1579
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:23,647
Wait so tired I know that this is exhausting and it's so stupid

1580
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,671
But trust me

1581
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,231
The end of this episode is going to be so worth it

1582
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:33,887
I don't know I know that he's implying kind of like Trump is a false flag which is weird cuz

1583
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:38,239
Analyze the last years of your career than buddy boy

1584
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,823
Alex is trying to sum it up here on this episode is like

1585
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,359
Hey me a call Bubba

1586
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,895
I put too much faith in the guy

1587
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,431
You do a what do you know

1588
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,455
I got two up to

1589
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,271
Peach

1590
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,695
You see that again

1591
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,999
What's the populist movement

1592
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,535
It was powerful but

1593
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,071
I put too much help in it

1594
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,887
You didn't well go fuc yourself

1595
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,703
Get to Lighthouse

1596
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,495
As much as possible all the

1597
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,519
Vista come together

1598
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:15,872
And this is something that I feel like the right should get on board with

1599
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,664
These guys just don't

1600
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,432
Get to do this

1601
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:22,784
Propaganda Alex doesn't get to go back

1602
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:29,184
And also it would be good for there to be a real moment of reflection for people who are serious and not

1603
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:31,744
Total assholes who just happen to have

1604
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,048
More conservative ideas about the way

1605
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:34,816
Estate

1606
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:35,840
Should maybe be organized

1607
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,144
Take a moment to reflect on how

1608
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,192
What these people have done

1609
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:40,960
To your party

1610
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,752
Now we're at a point

1611
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,800
Where most right-thinking people

1612
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,824
Will not

1613
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,896
Engage with conservative ideas

1614
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:49,664
Because

1615
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,480
These people have taken over

1616
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:56,832
The premise of your party alright so it's January 21st

1617
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,600
Skiatook

1618
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:04,000
Good time for us to start getting to work on the new agenda and now we're going to talk with Mo Brooks

1619
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:07,840
Suggest two weeks ago helped orchestrate a f****** coup

1620
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:08,608
About

1621
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:14,496
Text proposal

1622
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:20,896
F*** that why in God's name would I talk about any policy issue with you if I know your secret plan is

1623
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:23,200
Overthrew the goddamn government

1624
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:25,248
Yeah and it's not fair

1625
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:30,112
For Alex to pretend that is excited about that

1626
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:35,488
You don't get to do that now it's personally mean to me

1627
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,536
I got a little bit

1628
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:42,656
Of a feeling of something trying to express something that he's not willing to express

1629
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:46,240
I might be psychoanalyzing too much but

1630
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:49,824
Pushing past boundaries in doing

1631
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,872
Really really destructive hate

1632
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,456
Predator

1633
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,504
Which you are

1634
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,784
Respectful

1635
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,136
People

1636
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,952
You're stealing people's death

1637
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,232
You're hurting

1638
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,024
The loving energy on this planet

1639
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:09,792
You're not

1640
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
Good people

1641
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,376
Your failure why you're all so scrawny

1642
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,912
Ugly fat sick

1643
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,448
Because you're losers

1644
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,544
Now you call the thing that abused you

1645
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,856
You will get so much power from the Holy Ghost

1646
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:40,256
You will be ashamed of yourself and what you were and you will not even know how to deal with it

1647
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,048
Infinitely greater than that

1648
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,888
So I think if you pay close attention to the words that Alex is saying there I

1649
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:46,912
Think you can hear that

1650
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,448
As him ranting about himself

1651
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:52,032
He's saying if you satanic losers he's yelling about herself

1652
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,848
Pathetic because they were crushed by a system and it responds

1653
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,432
They're buddying up to the very system they crushed them in hopes of getting power from

1654
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,504
God will give you unspeakable power

1655
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,832
Alex has been pretty clear in the past about how much suffering

1656
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,624
Supporting Trump has brought into his life

1657
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,416
From the financial hardships

1658
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,184
Civil lawsuit

1659
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,792
Susan way more trouble than he was before he decided to take on Trump as his Divine champion

1660
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,120
That can easily be understood is Alex being crushed by a system

1661
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:23,776
In response he's clung on for dear life hoping that system that it crushed him would give him some power in the end which now is

1662
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,312
Becoming painfully clear

1663
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,080
He's not the case

1664
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:31,456
But there's a different more important level to this s*** that I don't think Alex even understand cuz he's talkin

1665
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:36,576
In This Very episode it's super clear that Alex is working through some buyer's remorse on Trump

1666
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:40,672
And having to admit to his audience that he got too optimistic about Trump as president

1667
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,464
But this is not

1668
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:46,816
The same thing as like you or me being slightly disillusioned with some of the policy objectives

1669
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:52,704
It weren't achieved under Obama this isn't a situation where Alex just like Trump and he wasn't as good as he hoped

1670
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,032
Alex routinely said the Trump was a leader anointed by God

1671
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:59,104
God had told Alex that Trump was the way to go

1672
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:05,504
For Alex to now get soft on Trump isn't admission that he was either making all that s*** up or he's actually soft on God

1673
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:08,064
Alex doesn't mean any of the things he says

1674
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,136
The constant talk about God being on his side and his enemies being

1675
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,184
Controlled by the devil didn't mean anything

1676
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:13,952
It's all just

1677
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,512
Extremist talk to make the difference between his side

1678
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,536
The other side

1679
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,816
Impossible to ever wreck

1680
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,584
Reconcile

1681
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:23,680
I get the sense that Alex is beginning to recognize that Trump himself is a dead end

1682
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:27,008
And the price of continuing to believe that he's a god-ordained ruler

1683
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:27,776
Despite the fact

1684
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:28,800
Biden is president

1685
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:31,872
Will believe that he is required to do things like storm the capitol

1686
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:34,688
And he doesn't want to do that cuz then there's no money anymore

1687
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:37,248
Yeah it's in this is just like

1688
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,320
I wish I wish the people could see that more clearly

1689
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,368
Any audience member of Alex's

1690
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,928
The thinks that he has some kind of an actual connection

1691
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,488
To the religious ideas that he presents like

1692
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,280
You got to get over that

1693
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,816
It's not sent total

1694
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:57,472
I just heard him say you're killing people's dreams and then I was like immediately cut 20 and 4 are trying to get a job in media and five

1695
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:06,432
Infowars person that I've seen actually

1696
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,456
Make the leap

1697
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:11,808
I think so there's a guy Mikhail Phelan who

1698
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,344
For some

1699
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,624
I can't remember what Outlet

1700
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,392
What he writes for

1701
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,928
But I've seen

1702
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:19,232
Bylines from Carol Phelan

1703
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:24,096
Yeah it being pushed around by people who don't realize he used to work at Infowars

1704
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,912
I have a little bit less of the stink

1705
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:29,472
Politico

1706
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,264
I'm not sure

1707
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:34,592
But yeah it everyone else dreams crushed

1708
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:35,872
Brutal

1709
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:39,968
There's news coming out here on the 13th and end conversation starting to happen

1710
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,016
What about this this idea

1711
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:46,112
How to put up a representative Mickey Sheryl about the the

1712
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:51,232
Possibilities there was a Recon tour before that some members of Congress were

1713
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,512
We're leaving in this

1714
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,792
Really f***** up

1715
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:54,560
For Alex

1716
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,584
So he's just

1717
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,608
Decide it's not real

1718
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:01,216
Congresswoman

1719
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800
Congressman

1720
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:14,272
He was conning at

1721
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,576
That's all I

1722
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:23,232
She is said that Congress members some Congress members giving me at tours of the Capitol building to pee

1723
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,512
People on January 5th

1724
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,792
The day before the storm

1725
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:31,168
This is suspicious to her because there were no official tours being done at the moment because of covid-19

1726
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:34,240
13 weird to these people to be inside the capitol at all

1727
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:41,152
As of this recording Cheryl has joined more than 30 house members calling for an investigation into the people who were there the day prior in

1728
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:41,920
Proceed

1729
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:42,944
We'll never lot more

1730
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:47,552
As it stands right now if what you suggesting is true things may be way more f***** up

1731
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,576
Then they appear

1732
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,624
But I do want to call out

1733
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,672
Is a bit of misinformation that I think Alex

1734
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:57,024
Is combining with this and that is that there was a particular video that was

1735
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,608
Was floating around that shows Allie Alexander Alex and Nick Fuentes

1736
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,656
In what appears to be the capitol built

1737
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:09,568
People claim that this video is from the day before the storming but I've actually found that footage posted as early as November

1738
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,616
It's from when the three of them were in the Georgia

1739
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,640
The Capitol building

1740
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,176
For that stopped

1741
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:14,944
The feeling better

1742
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:19,552
Another talking about like if you let the hillbillies decide will lose the country that

1743
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:22,880
Operating videos from that day where they're all in the same year

1744
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,416
Alright same outfits right

1745
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:29,536
I think that what's going on is that video was making the rounds now it says responding to that

1746
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,120
As being what the representative Cheryl was talking about

1747
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,144
And I don't know if that's

1748
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,960
Fair yeah I think we're in a

1749
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,496
The heart

1750
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,032
The hard part of the situation

1751
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,312
Is that

1752
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,592
After the

1753
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,360
The 6th

1754
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:44,384
I just

1755
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,944
You can't put anything

1756
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,224
Beyond Reason

1757
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:52,320
You know like if you told me like one of the representatives

1758
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:55,392
Had a gun pointed to aoc's face

1759
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,184
I would be like

1760
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,464
That might be true

1761
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,256
I can't rule that out any

1762
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,560
I understand I understand that but it's

1763
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:07,168
It's critically important to not descend into the the realm of believing stuff

1764
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:12,032
It's too convenient and that you just want to 100% that's that's what I'm

1765
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:16,128
I that's what I'm saying is there unfortunately now you know a lot of that stuff

1766
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,664
You could have just been like

1767
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,224
Okay I don't have the bandwidth to investigate this

1768
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,784
There's no way that the representative

1769
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,320
Eldigan directly to her face

1770
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:27,136
And now it's like if sci-fi see that I have to

1771
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:27,904
Hugo invest

1772
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,696
Navigate to make sure

1773
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:31,488
Really could be true

1774
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,768
Which is terrifying

1775
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,536
But

1776
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:37,888
At the same time you can't believe that right you know well it's tough

1777
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,192
But I think that's also

1778
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,728
It's the burden of

1779
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:45,824
The modern information space and how you can exist in it as a

1780
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,104
Responsible

1781
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,640
Consumer information

1782
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,432
I guess it does suck but

1783
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,992
It is it's enough to drive

1784
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:53,760
Anywhere

1785
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:57,600
Between 30 and 45% of the population in St

1786
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:01,184
Using social media

1787
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:05,024
Anyway Nancy Pelosi

1788
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,584
Comments about people taking a statue

1789
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,352
You down

1790
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,120
While back

1791
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,656
She said something to the effect

1792
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,704
If people are going to do what they're going to do right

1793
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,240
And Alex

1794
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,008
Besides

1795
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,800
Play this clip and then talk about killing

1796
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:23,200
Well people are going to do with people

1797
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,760
Pelosi

1798
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,808
People

1799
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:34,976
Throwing it into the harbor

1800
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,000
And it's it's a

1801
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,792
It is I do sing

1802
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:39,840
Safety standpoint

1803
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,144
It would be a good idea

1804
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:42,912
21

1805
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:46,752
Had to taken down if they can reject appointment I don't know that

1806
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:47,776
Ignition

1807
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,056
About a Jessica

1808
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:54,176
Community

1809
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:55,968
Seriously

1810
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:01,600
Would that just old people

1811
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,368
No lady

1812
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,928
That's not at work

1813
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:07,744
You hunchback

1814
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,768
Devil worshipping

1815
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
God

1816
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,656
Vengeance is mine saith the Lord

1817
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:24,896
Products you need

1818
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,688
Nailed it

1819
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,224
Hitman

1820
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,528
James Brown with the sting

1821
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:36,160
So Alex has the Lord's like multiple times

1822
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:43,840
Of that is it sometimes you need to be gods of it

1823
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,888
Sometimes

1824
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:50,752
That's what Alex is expressing that's not what

1825
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:53,824
You saying that's literally what are you saying

1826
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,616
The intent behind it

1827
01:30:55,872 --> 01:31:00,992
Expression conveys to the initiated within the Infowars

1828
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,064
The information space

1829
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:04,832
It means

1830
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:11,232
Someone stabbed but it is interesting

1831
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,024
Like

1832
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,048
Sloth

1833
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,328
In the legal C

1834
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,352
System is that

1835
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,912
Because of the way these people speak

1836
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,216
You can't you can't just like enter

1837
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:22,752
Oh see Alex said

1838
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,032
Venture

1839
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,312
Is mine saith the Lord

1840
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,336
So that was a

1841
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,128
You know you have to be like okay

1842
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,432
Listen to 3:00

1843
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,992
No but I honestly don't think it would be that difficult

1844
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:35,296
To say like okay

1845
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,088
Vengeance is the Lord's

1846
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:39,392
Across areas

1847
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,696
It's going to get stabbed in the neck or whatever

1848
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:47,840
Multiple times frequently you've discussed how the idea that vengeance is the Lord's

1849
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:48,608
What is a riddle

1850
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:51,424
Ryan B actually what it's talking about it sometimes humans have two

1851
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,984
To step up and be the instrument of God's vengeance

1852
01:31:54,240 --> 01:32:00,384
Would you like to have a conversation about that I think you could introduce that in court and it would look pretty bad

1853
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,920
I don't know if it's legally ask

1854
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,968
He's a real assholes

1855
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,760
Assholes

1856
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:09,088
We have another gas now the baby reporter

1857
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:13,952
Junior reporter and I've got Junior I mean baby in an oversized trench coat

1858
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:17,024
In a silly hat

1859
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:17,792
He likes

1860
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:21,888
The storm

1861
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:28,800
There's a lot to be optimistic about because I'm Erica first is ascendant I think all over the world people are beginning to realize that are pulled

1862
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:31,872
Political system here in the United States is absolutely broken

1863
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:38,016
And I know that you're not a big fan of the protest I think some funny things happened Princeton somebody defecated

1864
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,296
On Chuck Schumer's.

1865
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:44,416
And that puts a smile on my face I like hearing that I like seeing that headline I think that's

1866
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:49,792
A small Win For Humanity when somebody does that you're not supposed to think that though Patrick

1867
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,840
You're supposed to think it's antifa

1868
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,376
I kinda

1869
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:57,984
Patrick is like he just

1870
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:01,568
Get the script he doesn't get how we can make this

1871
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,592
Profitable

1872
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:03,616
Yeah because

1873
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,384
Hughes

1874
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:07,456
Super into it and he's like this is a good thing

1875
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:14,368
When the Vikings Shaman and these people were presiding over Congress there were no Foreign Wars

1876
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:18,720
Okay we weren't getting any of our taxpayer dollars to Pakistan for gender studies

1877
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,840
I'm in the populist movement

1878
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,888
And people were inspired by this

1879
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:29,728
Yes it seems to have gone disastrously

1880
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,008
And I wasn't there

1881
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:37,408
And it didn't seem like there was any plan or any Rhyme or Reason to it and obviously their agitators in the crab

1882
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:40,480
Basic just the act of civil disobedience

1883
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,016
Push the message out there

1884
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:48,416
Americans are at odds with their government and that's a powerful message

1885
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,184
Notion

1886
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,208
Against the tax

1887
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:50,976
I get it

1888
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,536
Okay well I'm saying to you is

1889
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:59,936
If we're gonna launch a war it should be done differently and we played right there hands and I don't want violence this weekend

1890
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:02,240
The globalist everywhere

1891
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,776
Trying to get violent that's all I'm saying

1892
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,056
So basically

1893
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,592
Alex the Saint Patrick

1894
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,640
If we endorse

1895
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,688
This we won't get our good boy

1896
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,712
Let me know

1897
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,296
Almost like an abstract

1898
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:19,904
People standing up and storming or capitalize like

1899
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,440
We're at odds with the government

1900
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:24,000
Whatever other anti-government violence

1901
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,536
The ends up happening

1902
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:28,864
Is going to be seeing as something that we're encouraging

1903
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,912
I can't make money on that

1904
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,936
I will get

1905
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:33,216
I will end up arrested

1906
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,752
If we end up

1907
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,800
Do being seen as the

1908
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:41,408
I don't know the mouthpiece the media of an Insurgent Network

1909
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,200
We can't do that we have to

1910
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:44,736
Play it smoother Patrick

1911
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,272
YouTube ereporter

1912
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,296
Grow up

1913
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,064
You can

1914
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:52,160
But at the same time Alex said we played right into their

1915
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,696
Plan you know like

1916
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,488
Okay so yes

1917
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,072
Instigators

1918
01:34:59,328 --> 01:34:59,840
Sure

1919
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,632
But that still means that

1920
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,168
All of those people

1921
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:03,936
Did it

1922
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:10,592
And wanted to do it you wouldn't have been that trick by the neuro-linguistic programming on the bullhorn

1923
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:14,432
Tired

1924
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,712
Chris probably Q

1925
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,736
Person that

1926
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:19,552
You know all the stuff that happened

1927
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:23,392
The people who were the ones who were Milling around and taking selfies who are.

1928
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:29,536
They're all good people all things you would be horrified by what those were provocateur

1929
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,328
Absolutely stand around and take the

1930
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,120
Pictures outside of the Capitol building

1931
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,912
Good if you storm at that

1932
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:38,752
We now get to

1933
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,544
To the point that I've been waiting for

1934
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:41,824
Sense

1935
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:42,848
The day

1936
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,872
But it all went down

1937
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:49,760
Coronavirus

1938
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:51,808
Psychiatrist

1939
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,368
State Department psychological warfare

01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,160
Help.

1941
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,512
He's a real spook spoon

1942
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,096

Trauma

1947

For Alex

1948
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,128
Does not go well

1949
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:18,944
There's a lot of big swings on Steve's part but I was looking

1950
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:25,344
There's also a lot of Steve trying to hold a mirror up to Alex

1951
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:28,672
Really doesn't like the mirror

1952
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:31,488
Before you introduce is Steve he's really got I like

1953
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,280
Okay I know that you said that

1954
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:35,328
Election was a sting operation

1955
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,864
Can't really

1956
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:40,192
Still believe

1957
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:43,520
He wasn't saying that he was involved

1958
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,384
He was trying to be optimistic

1959
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,736
There was some water marshmallows

1960
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,528
System why does Alexa

1961
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:58,112
What

1962
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,672
Turn this around

1963
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:03,744
Sideways on his take on that

1964
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:04,768
So

1965
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,304

Nobody else can swing like in Paul soap

1970
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,664
Please keep in mind that Alex has been going on the warpath against

01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:40,256
Interested

2007
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:42,816
Francis

2008
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:44,608
First of his name

2009
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:50,752
Steve arrested the phone this is a thing that's

2010
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,032
It's going around in qanon

2011
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,592
Qanon conspiracy theory

2012
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,920
It's so funny when the pope tries to

2013
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,688
To do like

2014
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:02,528
Very slow incremental a good changes and he's like

2015
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,808
We got to kill him

2016
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:08,160
We just got to arrest them we got to throw them into prison forever we're going to get it update

2017
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:12,000
Okay hopefully more details

2018
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:17,120
Less believable but

2019
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:17,888
I don't know

2020
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,448
Chorizo Alex believes

2021
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,728
That on the 6th

2022
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,264
Antifa

2023
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:29,664
Antagonize the police who then got to a fight with qanon people who then stormed the capital until

2024
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,712
Groupon Schumer's desk with the false flag

2025
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,992
Very far or something

2026
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:34,528
Patriots got setup

2027
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:38,880
Supporters tried to fight them off of course they was a noble but

2028
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:44,256
Much like the 300 at Thermopylae

2029
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:46,048
The capital

2030
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,840
Steve's got another angle on this

2031
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,376
By the way

2032
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:52,960
There was no rioting in the capital

2033
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,984
1503

2034
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:56,544
People here for my town he said it was

2035
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,568
Very peaceful

2036
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,896
The police took down the barrier

2037
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:03,712
What people do Special Forces

2038
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:04,736
Operators in there

2039
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,528
Pelosi

2040
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,552
Computer

2041
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:13,952
They were just there to take care of

2042
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,792
Mr. Q guy he's just a cute guy

2043
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,328
So stupid

2044
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:20,864
So now

2045
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,424
This is where the mirror

2046
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:27,520
There's a really really fascinating thing that's going on throughout this

2047
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,544
Appearance

2048
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:31,872
And I get the feeling that it's Steve revealing

2049
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:34,176
Himself to Alex as a like

2050
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,712
A supervillain

2051
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,504
He's like

2052
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,272
Alex

2053
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:44,928
I've been using you to get these extremist talking points out and try and start a coup

2054
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:49,536
Don't you understand the vehicle

2055
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:55,168
You're the useful idiot you idiot Alex can't really hear it

2056
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:59,520
Like that

2057
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,384
Through which we were able to implement

2058
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,152
Cool

2059
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:07,712
It wasn't me

2060
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:11,296
I know what I was doing

2061
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,064
Predictive

2062
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,088
True

2063
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,648
And by the way you didn't

2064
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,208
Actual interview

2065
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:25,888
The necessary actions that have to be at

2066
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,448
That is very

2067
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:31,008
Put me in this

2068
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,032
Ask

2069
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,592
I love it I love it

2070
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:38,432
Alex do you know what sometimes I was lying to you because it's

2071
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:39,200
Part of the

2072
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,224
F****** app

2073
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:46,624
Yeah you idiot I was trying to start a military coup in this country and and

2074
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:48,928
Did it buddy

2075
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:53,792
Mission accomplished

2076
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:57,376
Of course and it seems like he's speaking real freely

2077
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:03,520
I haven't seen this since he declared himself in open prison

2078
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:07,616
2013 or whatever that was

2079
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,896
With the jobs

2080
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:11,456
Security of just being an a****** for Alex

2081
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,736
Add

2082
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,528
The complete lack of

2083
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:20,928
Actually doing anything I think he's also where you can do whatever you want

2084
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,464
And I think that he's like

2085
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,000
I think he's a little high

2086
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,024
Yeah that sounds right

2087
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,584
Do use Alex

2088
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:30,400
But he also has an explanation for why he couldn't

2089
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,680
Use other me

2090
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:38,080
He is version of it might involve

2091
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,640
Some of them are Jewish

2092
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,688
Why would I

2093
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:47,552
Expected

2094
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:53,440
The reason we never use the New York Times we didn't do the washing it

2095
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,024
Total control

2096
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:59,328
I knew about the Murdoch family

2097
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,144
58

2098
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,168
I never trust

2099
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:04,704
I didn't trust

2100
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:05,728
Family

2101
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,520
People didn't know I'm

2102
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,544
Fortunately is

2103
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,592
Murdoch's mothers and orthodox

2104
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,384
And he is at

2105
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,176
Totally corrupt individual

2106
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,272
Family who brought in

2107
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,808
Stations and eventually

2108
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,600
Another song

2109
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:23,904
So you were chosen as the

2110
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,208
The message through which we could initiate

2111
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,488
A military coup

2112
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:30,816
Wild

2113
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,352
Wild

2114
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:34,144
Goddamn

2115
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,936
Alex understandably

2116
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:38,240
Scratch and sniff and you'll find an anti so

2117
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:42,080
Steve's revealed that himself many times

2118
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,408
You could imagine

2119
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:48,224
Because Steve is saying a lot of stuff

2120
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,504
Very much contradict

2121
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,064
Everything he's been saying since the sick

2122
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:54,624
Save we've been doing this for 20 years

2123
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,648
How is it that I

2124
01:43:55,904 --> 01:44:00,256
Still don't do pretty interviews with you what the fuc why am I like this

2125
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:03,328
So you were chosen as the method

2126
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,120
Through which we could initiate

2127
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,656
A military coup

2128
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:11,264
Okay well we didn't talk about this beforehand we don't want

2129
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,312
I went

2130
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:19,712
A peaceful demonstration to show our numbers to expose election fraud look bad I don't know I don't know about all that

2131
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:20,736
That s*** is about

2132
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:28,416
F****** lunatic you did not tell me this earlier I have no idea what the f*** you're talking about I just wanted to have a bar

2133
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:36,864
Alex started this interview by saying that like Steve said that there was a watermark ballot sting

2134
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:37,888
Time it was a prediction

2135
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:38,912
Right Steve

2136
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,192
Nothing much. Still

2137
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:42,240
We Mark the computers

2138
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,008
Weimar

2139
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,800
Weimar

2140
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:49,408
Everything that was done was a sting operation nothing is changed

2141
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:50,688
And what was

2142
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:52,224
Dante was done by

2143
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:52,992
Trump

2144
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,784
Businessman who understood

2145
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,808
The degree of Coronavirus

2146
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:58,368
Among the

2147
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,648
Democrats

2148
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:01,440
This isn't just something about

2149
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,208
About the world

2150
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,488
Control of America

2151
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,512
Yes was the

2152
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,560
I should stay

2153
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:07,328
Coming in

2154
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:11,424
An ocean of the coronavirus which was not lethal

2155
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:17,312
Fauci another Catholic who was trained by Cher.

2156
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:20,128
What's going on here

2157
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:25,760
Looks like Trump

2158
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:32,416
Got Steve also appears to be quite anti-catholic

2159
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:35,488
It's so funny

2160
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,792
Every time that they're like the

2161
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:39,840
The Christian right I'm like man

2162
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:43,424
If we were gone they would be murdering each other in the streets

2163
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:47,520
It's not even anything unique about Christian

2164
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,336
Extremism or anything it's a child

2165
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,360
Any kind of

2166
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,640
Exclusive

2167
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:54,176
Group

2168
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:56,480
Group it defines Itself by exclusion

2169
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:59,296
I will eventually find new ways to exclude people

2170
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:02,624
The DNA of that kind of system

2171
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,392
Even the f***

2172
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:06,208
And Alistair magicians murdered each other so

2173
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:12,608
You'll end up like an all white ethnostate will eventually alienate people have different hair

2174
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:16,448
Call this work

2175
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,728
Continue to drive profit

2176
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:22,336
So Alex is like a man look we have a week left

2177
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,872
Until the f****** inauguration

2178
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,920
How's this going to work tell me on this one

2179
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:30,016
Quantify this for me

2180
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:32,832
How is it a successful military coup

2181
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:39,232
Buddy said I guess

2182
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:41,792
Biden gets in in 7 days

2183
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:45,120
Trump's going to get into a lot of time here

2184
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:48,192
I got 150 hours what what do you say is about to happen

2185
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,240
I'm about

2186
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:53,568
Biden's not going to be the president of the United

2187
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,896
It's going to be saying is that

2188
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:59,712
Massive arrest and what I'm saying into

2189
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,480
Baxter's

2190
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,296
That we on martial law and we have

2191
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,320
A military coup

2192
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:07,392
Qanon real baby

2193
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,672
Talk about it that's

2194
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,952
Set up a not answer

2195
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:11,232
But such a mirror

2196
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:13,792
Just Alex finally just being like

2197
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:16,096
Oh

2198
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,120
God you sound

2199
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:17,888
Crazy

2200
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:22,752
This is where I was like Alex has got to be realizing this dude is

2201
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:23,776
Like out of

2202
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:24,544
It was my idea

2203
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,592
There is no globalism

2204
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,128
Going to be involved we have

2205
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:28,896
Shutdown

2206
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:30,944
Pakistan

2207
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:33,248
Shut down part of England

2208
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,648
Listen for a minute

2209
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:42,720
Did well over a year ago

2210
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:44,512
The reason why he was arrested

2211
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:47,840
Because I'm your show I said this

2212
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,656
Corrupt and have been involved

2213
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:55,008
With terrorist organizations 20 or 30 years ago I was

2214
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:02,432
Who's the guy we see traveled around the world in last year

2215
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:07,040
Don't see anybody traveling around the world right now you don't see anybody

2216
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:10,624
What what the f***

2217
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:17,024
Got arrested a year ago but I only

2218
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,096
Man

2219
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:26,496
That is because this is exactly that moment that so many people have had you had with Alex is eventually

2220
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:28,288
It's like okay

2221
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:32,640
This guy is literally saying to my face everything I've ever believed is a lie

2222
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,688
Or controlled by him

2223
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,736
So

2224
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:39,040
I can either believe this

2225
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,320
And then I'm gone

2226
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:43,136
Or I have to stop for a second ago like

2227
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:48,256
Ono Ono

2228
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:50,048
Two of them get into a little bit of a

2229
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:52,352
The fight sure whether or not Trump

2230
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,376
Is going to stay present

2231
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:58,240
If you listen carefully at the end of this clip you can hear Steve's wife laughing in the background

2232
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:01,312
In 7 days pieczenik

2233
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:04,384
Tell us what's going to who's going to be the president what's about to happen

2234
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:07,968
7 Days let me Jones

2235
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,504
It's going to be

2236
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,808
It will not be biting

2237
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:13,856
People will be arrested

2238
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:16,160
There will be people who will be arrested

2239
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:20,000
That's what's going to happen

2240
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,048
And if I'm wrong

2241
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:25,120
Find don't put me on your show if I'm right

2242
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:25,888
What else you got

2243
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,704
You can eat

2244
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:34,080
Quite a bit background throughout this interview

2245
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:34,848
I having a ball

2246
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:35,616
Yeah

2247
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:36,640
So I think

2248
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:37,664
When Steve doesn't

2249
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,432
Like

2250
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:41,248
The fact that Alex is trying to pretend that this

2251
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,272
Incident

2252
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:43,808
On January 6th

2253
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:46,112
Was some kind of a false flag

2254
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:49,696
You have to blame the left now just own it man

2255
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:52,000
Why why even pretend anymore

2256
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,536
I love it

2257
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:55,584
Provocateur

2258
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,864
Craziness

2259
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:01,984
But you saw that you guys going

2260
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:08,128
Quiet down a bit

2261
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:12,224
You do not understand what that means

2262
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:14,272
You do not understand how

2263
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:17,088
How long we've been preparing for this

2264
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,624
Yeah they're you scolding Isla

2265
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:22,464
Four stars go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

2266
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,792
This is a little different though this is almost just like

2267
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,328
Mask off time by X

2268
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,864
Alex let's do this

2269
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,912
We hate democracy

2270
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,472
Where is time

2271
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:37,056
Little insult

2272
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:39,360
Mike David is cuz I love this clip

2273
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:42,176
The one thing that they can come to an agreement on

2274
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:44,736
What is the third martial law that's going on right now

2275
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:45,760
Alex

2276
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:49,088
So why are there black helicopters in Austin

2277
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,392
And Steve's response to it is like

2278
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:52,672
Call

2279
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:53,440
Perfect

2280
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:57,792
The one thing we are under martial law

2281
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:01,632
That's correct.

2282
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:04,704
Repeatedly you're under martial law everywhere

2283
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:09,824
The state of California over downtown Austin this morning

2284
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:15,456
You're sitting down in Austin

2285
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:17,760
Studio on you trying to sell vitamins

2286
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,040
We don't send

2287
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:20,576
Blackhawk helicopter

2288
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:30,048
Why do I see Black Hawk helicopters

2289
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,496
Series that begins balls into Alex's eyes

2290
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:40,032
They even answer

2291
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,592
Hilarious

2292
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,616
Pill

2293
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:47,200
Vitamin zero f****** drug dealer Alex that's what

2294
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:47,968
You are

2295
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:48,992
Alex is not

2296
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:52,064
He's not having a good time with this interview

2297
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,088
He thinks that he

2298
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:55,136
He's capable of having the center

2299
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:56,928
Interview and I would say he's wrong

2300
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:12,544
Supposed to have one view on here or one idea

2301
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,848
This is all influx we are under martial law

2302
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:19,456
I just think that if you're going to have interviews with people like I say should be a little bit more

2303
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,248
Well done

2304
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:26,880
You shouldn't be caught off-guard by him telling you that you have been a 30-year instrument of his

2305
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:32,768
Desire to start a military coup 20 years no free interviews 20 years

2306
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:35,328
20 years I've been doing this this happens

2307
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,864
I want every four months

2308
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:40,192
I think that it's like really

2309
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:43,520
I don't think that you know you should have blankets

2310
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:45,568
No

2311
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:48,640
Absolutely no talking to Steve or whatever

2312
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:50,688
Pressure

2313
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:52,224
Who's YouTube

2314
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,528
You should prepare

2315
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:57,344
Yeah I can't imagine

2316
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:58,624
Thinking

2317
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,392
That

2318
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:00,416
Steve is in park

2319
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:01,440
You know

2320
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:03,488
Like Steve is a loose cannon

2321
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,768
At the best of times

2322
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:07,840
I could can expect

2323
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:09,632
For the first time

2324
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:16,032
He burned Alex Slaton 2004

2325
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:21,664
Hurricane Irma

2326
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,688
So they make it back

2327
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:23,968
Okay

2328
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:26,784
Alex

2329
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:31,904
If I'm wrong I will never appear on your show again

2330
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,720
Every time one of your

2331
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:36,512
Special

2332
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,536
Super all

2333
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,888
You want that Sarah Wright

2334
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:43,168
That's correct

2335
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:45,216
Alright sweetie

2336
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,032
Okay

2337
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,080
Add

2338
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,896
This is weird to me because this implies that

2339
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:55,456
Steve wants to work at Infowars yes

2340
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,736
Why hasn't he been

2341
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,320
They just don't have the time

2342
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:04,160
Wild bet

2343
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:07,744
Maybe this is exit strategy Carino's

2344
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,840
He's going to be wrong

2345
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:14,912
That business is his retirement last episode

2346
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:20,032
Yeah he is revealing at all the magician cards

2347
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:28,736
Say bye me alright

2348
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,528
You are anointed because

2349
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:33,600
This is going to be

2350
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:35,392
The major vehicle

2351
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:37,952
Where we going to go in the next

2352
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:40,000
20 or 30 years

2353
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:44,096
This process you have to remember what is the school about

2354
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:46,144
This is a 22 paid back

2355
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,168
Chaney's

2356
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:51,520
Correction cowardness for the

2357
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,288
Afghanistan

2358
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,616
To Obama who set up the war including

2359
01:54:58,688 --> 01:55:00,480
We lost five thousand

2360
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:06,880
Alex do you understand that I have been using you to try and build up a terrorist insurrection

2361
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:09,696
Is payback against my political enemies

2362
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:14,560
Just say that

2363
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:20,960
You should do should know he's going to say something like this beforehand if you're the host of the show that stuff to roll with

2364
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:22,752
Commercial break

2365
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:25,824
Steve somebody who has too much respect

2366
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:26,848
In your universe

2367
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:31,968
For you to just be like oh f*** yourself with anything other than

2368
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:34,528
So you are saying that you have been

2369
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,552
Controlling me

2370
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:39,136
You been running a Scion running even

2371
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:41,952
Everything that I've been saying from you

2372
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:42,720
In purpose

2373
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:43,488
One-goal

2374
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:46,048
Not necessarily the truth for 20 years

2375
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:46,816
You have

2376
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,864
Harbored this Grudge

2377
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:55,008
I think

2378
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:57,824
Steve

2379
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:01,664
But

2380
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:03,200
He's also

2381
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:06,272
Apparently a failed individual in the world

2382
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,040
Show Business

2383
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:11,392
You know your heroics a couple of books with Tom Clancy sure

2384
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,928
A ways back

2385
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:15,744
I doubt it was one of his books

2386
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,048
Apparently going to be turned into a TV show

2387
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:19,584
But then

2388
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:21,888
Something in Hollywood

2389
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:24,192
Didn't go well

2390
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,752
Example just recently

2391
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:28,288
State of emergency was

2392
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:30,336
By one of the major

2393
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:32,896
Presidents of CW Network

2394
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:38,528
Person whom I've known for years and Hollywood said I want to help you out

2395
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:41,600
What happened when he found out I was involved

2396
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:46,976
What happened to all of Hollywood amount American

2397
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:47,744
Jews

2398
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,024
Daring confidence

2399
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:50,304
Ignorant

2400
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:59,776
Wow an old white man who failed in Hollywood blaming the Jews that is so rich

2401
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:07,200
Original

2402
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:12,576
Pretty hilarious that you like alright I had this screenplay

2403
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:15,136
CW loved it but then he found out I was involved in a coup

2404
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,928
All of these f****** guys

2405
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:18,464
Have a goddamn screenplay

2406
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:26,400
Ybk what are you going to be

2407
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:28,704
Be disgusted by that I thought you'd be impressed Sancho's

2408
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,520
Squares how many accuse have you been involved with her

2409
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:37,920
Realizes

2410
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:38,688
Salary

2411
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:45,088
Okay so I took dr. Steve pieczenik vet that if Trump is president

2412
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:47,648
On January 21st 2021

2413
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:50,208
The Daily Show

2414
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,792
He's not that bad

2415
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:56,352
But he's elusive

2416
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:00,192
To just go away he has to come back on Michelle doctor humiliated

2417
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,472
I'm wrong about that

2418
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:04,288
Humiliate

2419
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:07,872
To humiliate me I would say that

2420
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:09,664
There's no way that doctor

2421
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,688
Steve comes back on

2422
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:11,456
For a while

2423
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:13,504
To to be humiliated

2424
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:14,272
Because

2425
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:17,088
Alex is going to want to do a whole

2426
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:18,880
Oh I just sell f****** vitamins

2427
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:24,256
Do I what I do and you won't see him for awhile

2428
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:29,376
But also I don't think it would work in Alex's interests to humiliate him either because

2429
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:33,472
Do you know they'll be a little splash back on the infowar sure why do you even

2430
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:36,544
Talk to this guy why anything he says seriously

2431
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:41,664
F****** liar but Alex is also Petty to the point of throwing his entire life

2432
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,712
Yeah it's

2433
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:47,808
Competing forces

2434
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,344
This gave me chills

2435
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:54,208
Alex is talking about but he's trying to ask Steve a question is like Steve you're a nice guy

2436
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:56,256
Steve Esther remind him

2437
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,024
Am I

2438
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:00,864
I just

2439
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:08,544
We're going to find out the seven days in seven days are coming back on

2440
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:12,640
Absolutely but remember one thing about me

2441
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:15,968
How is a very nice guy able to

2442
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:16,992
Steak-Out

2443
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:20,320
Khmer Rouge without any weapons

2444
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,088
Able to

2445
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:24,160
Take out the Soviet Union without any weapons

2446
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:25,952
Able to take a riddle

2447
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:28,000
Noreaga was out anyway

2448
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,328
This nice guy

2449
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:32,608
Do you understand

2450
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:35,936
Hey I'm a nice guy

2451
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:39,008
I'm going to answer that riddle. I'm going to go with

2452
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:40,800
He doesn't

2453
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:43,360
Nobody but you

2454
01:59:43,616 --> 01:59:44,640
What the messages that is

2455
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:46,688
Nice guy but I'm a sociopath

2456
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:50,528
I was going to go with the message was more I didn't actually do any

2457
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:54,624
Any of those things

2458
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:55,904
Someone like Steve

2459
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:59,744
Would be able to manipulate him that's true

2460
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,048
I mean if you can get him to believe that he's done all these

2461
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,584
The things geopolitical e

2462
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,608
Like yeah

2463
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:07,680
I've been many malevolent Lee f****** with you

2464
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:08,448
The wave

2465
02:00:08,704 --> 02:00:11,008
You think I would have if I took down the soup

2466
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,032
Exactly

2467
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,824
I'm not a nice guy

2468
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:14,592
Now

2469
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:15,360
I'm an ass-whole

2470
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:17,920
Yeah I just told you that you sold vitamin

2471
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:19,200
Dickwad

2472
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:22,016
So Alex wants to know how bad it's not going to be

2473
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,040
Specific

2474
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:23,808
I would like

2475
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,344
Welearn

2476
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:26,624
Instead

2477
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:32,256
So you can't tell us how this magic going to happen to Joe Biden going to step down

2478
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,864
I just said it to you

2479
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:38,912
Separating Alex

2480
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:41,216
I sent you there will be a rest

2481
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:42,752
The Vines

2482
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:44,032
Pelosi

2483
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,824
It's going on now

2484
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,104
He will not come

2485
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,128
To the presidency

2486
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:50,688
I'll be right can we meet your cat

2487
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:51,456
Please

2488
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,600
Cute cats and 3.

2489
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:01,696
So because Steve is basically just

2490
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:04,000
Disseminating q-ship on his show

2491
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:05,792
So what's

2492
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:06,560
What's mrs.

2493
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:07,584
It's pathetic feeling like

2494
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,632
Like I don't know man would like to

2495
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:13,472
To know what her day today is like I don't know

2496
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:17,312
There's a little bit of curiosity but also I don't care

2497
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:18,592
And I like personalized

2498
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:20,384
Totally I just see them

2499
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,688
I just see them both like on the back porch

2500
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:26,784
Laughing about other f****** with Alex

2501
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:33,184
CIA Tom Clancy novel over there just burden floam

2502
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:34,208
And then they both stopped

2503
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:36,256
For one second and Steve just looked up and you just go

2504
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:38,816
Oh my God you have no idea what I'm going to tell Alex

2505
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:40,096
Tomorrow

2506
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:40,864
To be holy

2507
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:46,240
I'm going to tell him we arrested the pope a year ago tell Alex

2508
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:48,032
And she loses her s***

2509
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:50,592
Steve is a doctor

2510
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:52,128
He has a doctorate

2511
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:54,688
He thinks that that means

2512
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,528
Either I'm a genius or I just see

2513
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:01,088
Ordinary problems

2514
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:02,112
You're wrong

2515
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:06,720
And what is a doctor really do

2516
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:09,536
He saves lives tenniel

2517
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:13,376
Very carefully

2518
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:14,656
Nice guy

2519
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:20,032
It's what he may or may not be

2520
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:23,104
Low low

2521
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:25,920
Steven Singer because he's a doctor he has me right

2522
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:31,552
To give and take live some people tell you about this

2523
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:32,320
Would you become a

2524
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:34,368
My doctor Dan and the wrong

2525
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,392
Sometimes

2526
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:36,160
Things you kill

2527
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:37,440
Pleasure

2528
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,464
Or games

2529
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:42,560
Those are the reasons you become a doctor doctors

2530
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:44,352
Get the right

2531
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:46,144
So

2532
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,424
Steve

2533
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,704
But there will be arrests

2534
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,984
For the anaki race

2535
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,776
So we got a real clock on that one

2536
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:56,640
Closing, we're going to see some fireworks

2537
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:58,432
Are you not going to see

2538
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:00,736
Fireworks you going to see a lot of arrest

2539
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:03,808
It's going to be quiet you going to see martial law

2540
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:07,392
Clampdown the cities you already seeing Washington

2541
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:08,416
Clampdown

2542
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:12,000
Down in Berlin we clampdown in Pakistan

2543
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:13,280
Clampdown in Italy

2544
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:16,864
And now you will also make another prediction

2545
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:18,656
The Italian government

2546
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:20,704
24-hours

2547
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:22,496

I've had a very

2555
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:42,464
Explaining to you that I've been f******

02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:43,744
With you for decades

2557
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:47,584
Oh that's

2558
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,352
The good interview

2559
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:54,752
It is pretty good I would feel pretty confident if I was Stevie peas at the end of that one and I think Alex is so taking a

2560
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:56,288
Back at all you can do is really like

2561
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:57,568
The spider

2562
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:00,384
Mansion question what is your cats

2563
02:04:01,152 --> 02:04:01,920
TV

2564
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:04,224
Timer

2565
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:04,992
Geronimo

2566
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:14,720
What's the temperature

2567
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,024
Nona

2568
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,048
Meaning no name

2569
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,328
Cheap about 4

2570
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:23,936
Well you could nominate known it would be the first female president

2571
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:28,288
You know why

2572
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:32,640
I love you

2573
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:38,272
No I want a really had a real president

2574
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:41,088
For the first time

2575
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,112
50 years

2576
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,952
The Obamas the bidens

2577
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:49,536
None of them were real presidents

2578
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:55,424
What kind of trying to take back power in the Dynamics

2579
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:57,728
Your cat in it sort of mocking

2580
02:04:57,984 --> 02:05:00,288
The resume that Alex has given

2581
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:01,824
Steve

2582
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:02,592
It's ineffective

2583
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:03,872
It's not already empowered

2584
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:05,152
Steve way too much

2585
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:09,760
Steve doesn't give a s*** no try and make fun of Italy was going to be gone to

2586
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:16,160
Tomorrow fire-rescue yuriko

2587
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,440
Victor Pope

2588
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:23,328
Has been gone for a year I told you that even though yet you have seen the pope around

2589
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:24,352
You haven't seen any

2590
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:27,168
And this just leaves Alex in a bind

2591
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:42,784
Is it wishful thinking

2592
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:44,320
Hoping

2593
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:57,376
He's so pathetic yeah that's sad

2594
02:05:57,632 --> 02:06:01,984
He can't even operate as a sincere person because

2595
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:03,520
To attack Steve

2596
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:09,664
Raises too many questions about his own credibility off and all of the conspiracies that he's based on Steve over the years

2597
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:11,456
So he's stalking alert

2598
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:12,224
Where you at

2599
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,272
To be LOL I hope he's right

2600
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:15,552
It could happen if

2601
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:17,088
Steve is what you pay

2602
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:18,112
Pretend he is

2603
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:19,136
There's no helping

2604
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:22,976
Yeah I'm not saying these things like all baby that's nothing

2605
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:25,024
He did it and he's doing

2606
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:25,792
Exactly

2607
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:26,816
End

2608
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:29,120
You're still being used

2609
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:30,400
The fact that you

2610
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,168
How could you

2611
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:33,984
I just don't understand how you could let somebody say

2612
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:36,288
I have been using you for 20 years

2613
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:38,848
To your face and not be like then go f*** yourself

2614
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:45,248
Anyways this is kind of like the Nigerian email scam

2615
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,648
I think we just

2616
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:57,280
Hit the button in the show is over

2617
02:06:57,536 --> 02:07:03,680
After this Alex has an interview with Laura Loomer but I don't really care she's just complaining about how she had a tough time at the

2618
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:05,216
And I don't care

2619
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:06,496
It's

2620
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:09,056
Azure out especially after that

2621
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:11,104
Epic interview with

2622
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:14,176
I can't wait I can't wait to

2623
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:15,456
To see what happens

2624
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:16,992
Bike

2625
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:18,784
Not I don't think that

2626
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:19,808
You know trumps

2627
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:22,880
Sting operation is real

2628
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:25,440
Yeah I think I think the inauguration will happen

2629
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:27,488
And I just want to see how they deal with it

2630
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:28,768
I'm going to guess

2631
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:29,536
Denial

2632
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:31,584
I'm going to guess that they pretend this didn't have

2633
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:37,216
This interview didn't happen if people disappear for a month or two and then he'll come back

2634
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:38,496
With a new narrative

2635
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,264
Some sort

2636
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:45,664
Much like a pro wrestler whose character has grown weary repackaged

2637
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:47,968
New character and show back up in Hemlock

2638
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:51,040
I just don't understand see nothing that

2639
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:53,600
Confuses me maybe more than anything else now

2640
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:54,624
Is

2641
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:57,952
Seeing the events of the sick

2642
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:00,256
And how

2643
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:01,792
Trump has

2644
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:02,816
Decided

2645
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:04,096
Tupac

2646
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:07,936
Why would you want to install him as your

2647
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:09,216
Dictator

2648
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:10,496
Lego

2649
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:12,544
What do what you want to f***

2650
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:15,616
I think

2651
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:16,640
Yeah I think that's

2652
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:18,944
Steve thinks it's all like The Art of War

2653
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:20,736
Sun Tzu kind of stuff

2654
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:21,760
And so like

2655
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:25,600
Pretty popular in the Q community

2656
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:28,672
Look weak when you're around getting ready

2657
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:30,976
Expressing a little bit of that

2658
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:33,280
Add stop on the episode until like

2659
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:36,352
Trump's doing this stuff cuz that's what he's got to do to give the

2660
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:37,120
Appearances

2661
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:42,496
You can rationalize that way but that's only going to work for so long

2662
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:47,872
Yeah I mean especially considering the sheer number of times we have seen him pout

2663
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:49,408
When he doesn't get his way

2664
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:51,200
Is a whiny little titty babe

2665
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,016
So we will be back

2666
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:58,368

2667
02:08:58,624 --> 02:09:00,672

02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:07,072
We are Integra Technologies are fighting that go to bed Jordan

2669
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:10,144
Please find a local charity or bail Fund in your area to help out

2670
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:10,912

02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:23,200
Alex

2674

First in color with huge fan I love your work
