So disgusting to listen to into the Mike's

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440

That's probably how it would have sounded

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Something like that

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632

29
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,488
Surrounding the ice cream WhatsApp mini chocolate chips

30

Oh on the side

31
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:16,960
How big how big are we talking about ice cream sandwich wise are we talking about. Eyes are we talkin about the smaller one

32
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
Honestly I don't know

33
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
Know how many lot to learn about the way I parade

34
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,904
Measurements for a little bit

35
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,488

00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
Very excited

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,816
To see where this goes

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
More ice cream

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,288
I have to run into something that is abject

40
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,616
Actionable right to try some flavor of

41
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,152
Something

42
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,808
Oh no oh dear God what is this I think you do have to set aside some some

43
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
Choices better purely for that edge

44
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
Level of like

45
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
I don't know if this is going to be good

46
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,000
Of course I'm drawn to novelty

47
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,560
Absolute that will inevitably happen

48
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,120
And I might have to seek it out a little bit more than you are

49
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Another cases

50
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936

60
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,560
She left me alone with lots

61
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,448
Do you know how well I reacted whenever I opened it and they're alive not well

62
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,776

63

00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
Yeah no it's very

66
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,944
Did you let him go in the backyard

67
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,344
Lobsters you are emancipated do

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
Go to put him into the lake all the sudden

69
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
Organize Maine Lobsters in Lake Michigan Alta all year round I think they could survive the big boy

70
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,375
Really tough situation being cuz obviously

71
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
You know I'm sure you want to eat lobster

72
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
But they're alive

73
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,543
So now you have to emotionally deal with

74
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
No you made it clear up my partner's very excited cheese grew up there cold-hearted enough to take

75
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
On the inside

76
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Just to eat

77
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:44,927
You just grunting it up as you drop them into boiling water she doesn't do cry when she reads where

78
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
Where the Red Fern Grows nothing inside

79
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
Brutal

80
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,119
I wish you well in your Lobster and see what happens

81
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
How many did you get

82
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167

83
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,703
There was three I want one

84
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
Yeah well course

85
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:03,359
I would have walked in here with a lobster on my shoulder like a pirate

86
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:09,503
Jordan today

87
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
T22 that's Monday

88
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,367
That is that Wednesday

89
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
No it is mine

90
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
Feels

91
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
Close to being all right

92
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,279
As a way to

93
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
It rhymes

94
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:28,191
And so there's obviously something to it's always wrong by just a little bit the date is long

95
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
So this is

96
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,895
The obviously the day after news that broken of Alex declaring bankruptcy

97
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,735
So that people are going to

98
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,807
Be interested in Alex's response

99
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
Get ready for a lot of ads

100
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,999
Going to say that right up front there's a lot of that

101
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,887
It is funny a lot of people are like what's he going to say about his bankruptcy filings is it going to be like

Still fighting there's going to be like not the real answer is

Get ready for a good bit of that cuz if you're looking

105
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
A content

106
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Auto finder

107
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:16,063
Not not a lot of things I needed to dig into let's say

108
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,391
What do I feel like most of the time it's just going to be listen

109
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
I didn't

110
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
If I did declare bankruptcy which I'm not

111
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
Confirming my lawyers haven't said anything about that

112
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,095
What you need to know is that I'm still great

113
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
I'm still fine

114
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
Nothing to worry about

115
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,959
I need as much money as humanly possible right now though

116
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
Unrelated

117
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519

There's a little bit of a theme in a couple names

127
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,959
Okay I have to do with a happy anniversary sure

128
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
When I see these shout-out.

Whoever is sending them

130
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:48,223
They did the best they could do something special for an anniversary

131
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,855
So if you were their partners

132
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,951

Good affair

Look

140
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,903
You can't expect the two of us to really be on time

141
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
With your anniversary wishes that's just that's just not how we do things no do record of being at least

142
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
2 months behind on all birds

143
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,911
That's true that's true

144
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,727
But but see the thing is there such a

145
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,031
Trope of people forgetting their anniversary

146
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
That's true heads I just don't want to feed into the

147
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
People did a good job

148
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919

We start off here and I will say that Alex does jump into the the

152

Maine

153
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Copic

154
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
Pretty quickly

155
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,911
Yes he does bring that up fairly quickly

156
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:18,335
Explaining dead like we're all f*** Monday April 18th

157
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,663
Addition of the Alex Jones Show in the year 2022

158
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,783
And we see worldwide depression we see worldwide inflation we see planetary

159
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
Starvation Reservoir

160
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,671
Collapsing borders we see

161
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
Open pedophilia promotion

162
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
By every major Western media Outlet

163
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
Any size

164
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,423
It is just stunning unspeakable

165
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,007
Moment in human history to know that we've been turned over to evil

166
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,359
Millions of babies

167
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,991
But God is now withdrawing his protection from us and evil and Corruption

168
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,319
Is that being allowed to absolutely run rampant

169
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
I'm going to say something here

170
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
And

171
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
Boulevard

172
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
But it's just this

173
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,751
I'm not declaring bankruptcy

174
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
It's a chapter 11

175
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Reorganization

176
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
In the federal courts

177
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:31,551
Who's the total mess but it's wildly unpredictable

178
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Bankruptcy

179
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
Even a chapter 11 reorganization style bankruptcy

180
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,463
Then all civil litigation if it involved in

181
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
This is because whenever bankruptcy like

182
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Cuz represent

183
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
Typically a business will enter this kind of bankruptcy if they owe money to multiple creditors so the whole thing of civil litigation is Jenner

184
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,543
Generally an attempt to make sure that one debt the business has

185
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,359
Isn't prioritized over all the other deaths

186
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
In the people who are owed money

187
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,455
Chapter 11 reorganization

188
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
To create a plan to

189
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
To pay off all the debts while keeping

190
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Business funk

191
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
Play speaking when people do

192
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Right

193
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,975
Pretty hard to see this as a sincere move on Alex's part

194
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,375
Given the way things have gone over the last few years that stuff for me and not to read this as an attempt to postpone or entirely.

195
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
Civil cases against Infowars

196
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
But as it stands now I really don't know what

197
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Six pack from this

198
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
What what is a big break

199
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,455
News story going over our world short but honestly I kind of look at this still is a developing story and I don't know

200
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
WhatsApp

201
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
What's going to be

202
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
I mean what in his

203
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
Like background would give you

204
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
The idea that maybe this is a

205
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
The stalling tactic everything

206
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Oh okay

207
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
Any specific

208
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:48,607
From every single thing that he's done over the past three years everything okay everything everything

209
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,423
Alex is an interesting explanation for why

210
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
He's doing this

211
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Makes sense

212
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
It's a chapter 11

213
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
Reorganization

214
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
In the federal courts

215
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,943
So you can go and show them their books

216
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,807
Don't have 16 million a secret bank account

217
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,903
We haven't any secret secret

218
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
The Connecticut court

219
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
And

220
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
Successful or not

221
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
In the long-term

222
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
This will be an issue

223
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,079
For the bankruptcy Court's one way or another

224
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,431
It's just time for that.

225
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,503
That I don't

226
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
I don't have

227
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
$3000000

228
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
Less than three million dollars cash

229
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,719
We need that money about future product to be able to operate

230
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:53,375
This explanation falls on deaf ears for me because honestly if Alex wanted to open up his books to the court to prove that stuff

231
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
If you could have done that at any point

232
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
Up till now

233
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,263
You only can do that when you file bankruptcy

234
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,055
You can't just like go to the courts

235
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,639
With your books I don't think that's necessary to achieve

236
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Describe

237
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
So I kind of feel like

238
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
It's explanation

239
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,039
I just don't accept as like satisfying at all

240
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,879
Yeah but you would if you wanted to keep it all confidential we could have had it subbed

241
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
Get to the protective order that's in place for the

242
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
Please cases

243
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
So like

244
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
I think that I think that

245
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,303
That all could have been done

246
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
They could have

247
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Right on the

248
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
The court and the judge

249
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,751
What you don't know though is that it wasn't so it's it's a little bit like Hippa

250
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
Okay so until

251
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
God removed

252
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
His

253
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Protection

254
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
He couldn't show those

255
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Numbers to the cork

256
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
No texture like hippo

257
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
Alex is hungry hungry

258
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,111
Because he eats lunch on air all the time

259
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,695
Alex has a prepared state

260
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
That's very clearly like his lawyer wrote

261
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,655
But also he tries to read some of it

262
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
Stick to it.

263
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Bankruptcy

264
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:13,247
Bankruptcy

265
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,111
Alex Jones you're truly gave up alright just membership interest in the

266
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
Trusts created

267
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,327
The federal system has the tools experienced a fairly deal

268
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
Resolution of these planks

269
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
Here's what's important

270
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Uh-oh

271
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,775
Again the corporate media in the nation

272
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,335
Know that we don't have all this money

273
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,431
The plan is to try to get judgments that are giant large

274
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
So they can close our doors here

275
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
Makes me work harder

276
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Value the person

277
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,375
Is tied to your faith

278
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Add

279
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:07,007
This country and this world is in a lot of trouble and so we're all going to share

280
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
Demos that are

281
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
In the system and that are

282
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
Really destroying due process and

283
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Every major

284
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,271
Pillar of our Bill of Rights and Constitution

285
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
It's completely thrown out the window

286
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Not as mm

287
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,439
Remind me to buy cruel and unusual punishment

288
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,743
And also about like excessive bail or fines

289
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
Right I mean I think

290
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
Alex is actually violated our right

291
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
Amendment rights

292
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
No cuz it's not really a punishment

293
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,495
It is shows crawling on your roof

294
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,663
You and I could choose to not move into any point in the punishment would go at it

295
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:52,063
I think that's fine but emotionally too listening to this

296
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
But yeah I don't

297
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,415
That any of this Plies

298
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
Honestly there was just a news the broken

299
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,559
Got sanctioned like a million dollars

300
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,167
I don't think that's excessive I think this is a very

301
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Like

302
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
Based on his behavior

303
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
Probably fine

304
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,127
Probably appropriate I feel like

305
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
Human Society does kind of breakdown

306
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
In this scenario

307
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Is like

308
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,015
At a certain point

309
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,599
There can be no more benefit of the doubt given

310
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
You know

311
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
Like

312
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
If you

313
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,231
You've proven that if you give him the benefit of

314
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
The doubt he's going to exploit

315
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
So then you

316
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Stop doing

317
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,471
Still is like with this million-dollar judgment it's like what are you doing you're giving him the benefit of the doubt here

318
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
You're only charging Bliss

319
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,335
Well I think it's probably a very high fine

320
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
But it also

321
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Seems like

322
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
At this point it's like

323
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,807
Slap-on-the-wrist number

324
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:01,951
54 whatever here I'm looking at Old cases going through like

325
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,535
Let's just see the top number and I'm going to go up by at least one

326
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,119
You know think about like instances of other large civil

327
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
Litigation

328
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
People don't

329
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
Act like this

330
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
A little

331
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,575
I have to imagine that this level of obtuse

332
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Navigation

333
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
Feet dragging

334
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
And such as almost unprecedented

335
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
For most courts do whatever

336
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Totally

337
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
It's pretty impressive

338
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
So what do I

339
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Lexus

340
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:43,423
President that's what I'm thinking is my my response to this is

341
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
Alex is doing unprecedented

342
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Did things

343
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,567
But you keep giving him very precedented

344
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Sanctions in

345
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,407
I wonder I wonder if that's at

346
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
I think they might be

347
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,015
Quite large I'll agree I think they need to figure out

348
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,855
My definition of unprecedented I'm not sure I'm not sure it'll be interesting

349
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,647
To figure out more about

350
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,463
So Alex has some other things

351
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
You could describe a sanction

352
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
Against him

353
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
I'm not going to get into this today

354
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,007
Any story

355
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
For anybody in the country

356
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,687
And I talked a lot of lawyers and including some of the biggest names out there they seen these documents

357
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,503
They cannot believe this

358
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
But

359
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,391
The judge has given him a Texas case and the Connecticut case whatever

360
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
Warriors won

361
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
Remington Inn

362
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
Serious problems

363
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,959
Filed for one of three trials they have coming up

364
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Lexi like this month

365
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
That we not be able to talk at the truck

366
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Guilty

367
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,783
Didgeridoo

368
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,879
Judge usually a jury would decide

369
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,255
The First Amendment

370
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,863
Not defend yourself

371
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
This is a big story

372
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Pleasant crew

373
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
However

374
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
Some reality

375
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:27,103
Used to this bad the situation but Alex himself

376
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,407
Put himself in regarding the trial

377
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,015
Repeated abuses of the discovery process that Alex engaged

378
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:39,391
The court sanction tip after they failed to produce get another Corporal representative after the dari-ette

379
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,975
After that when they sent another representative

380
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
That didn't work out

381
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
And

382
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
Instead they

383
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
I had some issues

384
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:53,471
I mean Lucy territory we're here in Charlie Brown territory you guys keep putting that football out there and there's a

385
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Just never going to kick it

386
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,311
This made it so Alex aside wasn't able to

387
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
The demand any further discovery

388
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
From the plaintiff

389
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:04,479
If he wasn't cooperating it wasn't fair that the other side was being held to a different standard

390
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527
I think that makes some sense

391
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,647
Further and more relevantly because they had at least four opportunities to come in and

392
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
Discuss discuss

393
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,719
Failed spectacularly each time

394
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:20,095
The court ordered that if there was a factual dispute between Alex on the plane test on a number of questions

395
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
The jury was

396
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,935
Did the view the plaintiff's claim does established fact

397
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,007
His list of questions include stuff like

398
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,311
Sourcing and research for the videos described

399
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
Duplantis petition

400
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,407
The audience reach of the videos described Duplantis

401
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Position

402
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,247
Efforts made by the company to preserve potential evidence

403
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,087
And the company's business structure and relationship with other parties

404
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
Alex was given a chance to discuss this stuff in an appropriate setting but he was unwilling to cooperate with the process of now that

405
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
It's not appropriate

406
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,399
For him to like now I want to talk about it once we're at the trial

407
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,751
It is it has a little bit funny because it does feel like in court

408
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,055
We could get into a scenario where Alex is like

409
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,383
No that didn't happen and then the judges go like

410
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
That Jerry's

411
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
Instructed that it did happen

412
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:15,647
The jury is instructed that it did happen

413
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:22,048
Able to bring up the First Amendment I'm guessing that's more of an issue of it being

414
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,328
Completely irrelevant

415
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
To the case

416
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,656
He's already been found guilty in a default judgement

417
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,680
At this point

418
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
And even before that

419
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,752
First Amendment defense wouldn't really apply

420
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,848
I mean that one might as well just be like hey

421
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:39,200
We can't allow him to be an a****** who Grande sayings about the First Amendment for no reason for it

422
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,272
An hour

423
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,368
Given half a chance we're going to go right one step ahead

424
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,952
Yep so I don't believe there's anything in place

425
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
If it says he can't talk

426
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
Or can't defend himself

427
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
It's just that

428
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,400
Juno is required

429
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,728
Self on maybe some of the other question

430
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
Gyms that are listed in

431
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
Then the things that the jury is instructed to

432
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
Not accept his

433
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
Protestations

434
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
So anyway we get to supply

435
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
That is

436
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
Attached

437
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
Is endemic

438
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,720
What is happening in Civilization

439
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
And it just tears my guts out

440
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
I can tell you this

441
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,888
If we weren't so maxed out

442
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,984
These legal battles would be a lot easier

443
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
The biggest thing you can do is

444
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,616
Born by the broadcast and Powerful forces

445
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,432
Are doing everything they can and Breaking All the Rules

446
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
The devil

447
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,552
Because they need the main voices of resistance silence

448
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
I had of the next big block

449
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,416
And the valuation of currency

450
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Universal basic income

451
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
Tom and and the real

452
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
That is

453
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
Shut up and roll.

454
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,152
Please spread the word about the broadcast in realize it's so precious

455
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,944
Every guess we have and every time

456
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
Information

457
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,040
It's something that really scares the power structure

458
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
It is they know it's the truth

459
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,160
Also financially support Infowars

460
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,720
So this is just going to be setting the tone

461
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
It's going to be a lot of

462
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Yeah

463
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,864
Yeah you know I mean

464
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
On the one hand

465
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
I see him say

466
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,240
If we had more money these lawsuits

467
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
It'll be easier

468
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
Raven Lite

469
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
Designed to get as much money

470
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
Yeah I think so

471
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
And at the same time

472
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:52,832
Is it a deeper truth about America that if he did have more money these lawsuits would be a lot easier

473
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
I think

474
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
That if

475
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Most

476
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
People had more money

477
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,256
Their lawsuits would be easier to handle

478
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
For Alex

479
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
He's already got

480
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,656
Lawyers that he cycled through

481
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
I don't believe

482
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,288
He's that there's anything really about how it's gone that more money would have salt

483
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,336
I think he is

484
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Probably

485
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,664
We've done as much as he can with money

486
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
It would require enough to like

487
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Purchase Texas

488
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,904
Yeah that's beyond his audience his ability to donate

489
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,696
Venetian I think it would be able to get out of this

490
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,864
Short of that I don't know what money

491
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,704
I'll talk to you about it we'll see how it goes

492
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,752
I guess he could be imagining that

493
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,592
Goodbye the judge

494
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,432
A little bit about you and said your assessment

495
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
Mcraven attempt to get more money

496
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
It is probably accurate

497
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
Because

498
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
He's already

499
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,648
Grown quite a bit a wall

So

529
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,312
I I hear that list of products

530
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,872
There was a supply chain breakdown

531
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,688
You couldn't get these supplements already

532
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
Stuff in stock

533
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,016
Presumably shouldn't

534
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,040
Based on things I've heard

535
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,344
It does seem like that and

536
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,648
I do appreciate the idea of

537
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Up somebody list

538
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
Listening who's like

539
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
You know what

540
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:44,608
I've been dragging my feet on those water filters for a long time Brew but now that I know Alex

541
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
Is declared bankrupt

542
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:52,032
That's what I need to put my money into that fire now I need to buy a

543
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,848
School Bus size water filter

544
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
Yeah

545
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
Yeah

546
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
I don't

547
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552

553
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,384
If you haven't once thought about buying this weird upside down golden horse that I sell

554
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,784
Going off the air in 6 months like a year-and-a-half ago

00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,368
Silver coins as like war bonds

556
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
The didn't work out

557
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,024
He's trying to get everyone to buy reset Wars by saying it's the most important work he's ever done

558
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,096
Pillows with the a****** they're gray pillows

559
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,912
Feel like you've done about everything

560
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,216
Extreme called

561
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Call to action

562
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Panic button

563
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,568
And like I don't know who's left

564
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,616
The Freak Out

565
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,432
Hostage situation necessary to elevate

566
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
You know like he's got to be like

567
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,552
Hey guess what this is your grandma I've got her by the throat

568
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,088
If you don't buy a water filter

569
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
Grandma's dead

570
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,744
It isn't that what he's doing with his job like that you like this show

571
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
If you like living

572
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,352
You need this show to continue exist and so you need to

573
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,240
Grandmas in the world grandma is going to have the world going to end

574
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
So there's some

575
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Content

576
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
I guess

577
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:36,480
Emblematic of the rotting establishment that we have that's in control that look at some of these headlines

578
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
The Washington Post

579
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,368
Democracy dies in darkness

580
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,416
Says it's time

581
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,744
Present

582
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,120
Must wants to buy Twitter for free speech

583
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,704
He's a danger to the world there's another one

584
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
Real clear

585
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,312
Policy time to choosing the president

586
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
Washington Post

587
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,968
Same article you're reading the headlines

588
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,856
Year-old operate in the Washington Post it was roundly mocked and criticized so they changed the headline to it

589
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
It's time to switch

590
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
To preference

591
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Primaries

592
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:22,048
Whisper expresses the point of the the headline in the article

593
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,376
Mad about it he's pretending that's like a current

594
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
It's just annoying

595
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,472
Elon Musk wasn't trying to buy Twitter for free speech

596
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
And even if he was

597
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,568
The two-year-old op-ed that no one like

598
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
This is

599
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
Such a trivial waste

600
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,944
Yeah I remember that

601
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Headline

602
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
And I was like

603
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,040
That was from a while back

604
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
That you told me it was two years

605
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,624
Back makes me really

606
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,928
Concerned how well I can remember

607
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:55,328
It's less than 20

608
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
Something like that

609
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,144
Within a few months

610
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
Po-boy

611
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,032
Some rambling for you

612
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
And I am just here fighting

613
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
As hard as I can with everything I've got

614
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,760
As long as possible

615
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,856
Until she finds it sold again and stands up peacefully

616
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,584
All the promise

617
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
Working

618
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
They backed off some

619
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
But now they're setting up

620
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,712
Proposition

621
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
You can't avoid

622
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
This corruption

623
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,416
RockAuto

624
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,952
It's not going to go away

625
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,536
I am very honored and blessed we've been on the air 28 years

626
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
Together

627
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,864
Mistakes

628
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
Overall

629
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,168
The world the better

630
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,032
More insightful as time goes on

631
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
Really

632
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,128
The good brand sold

633
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,456
Great brand Soul God gave you and all the listeners

634
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
All the guests of this family

635
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,576
Tell your folks

636
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
You're the only thing

637
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
Mark Warner

638
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
And I'm in your corner

639
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,960
Nope it's Word of Mouth to make sure this broadcast gets through the sensors

640
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
Chinese money

641
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
Bat signal here

642
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,688
The Alamo

643
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,576
Please send reinforcements to stay here

644
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,112
Salmo didn't work out well

645
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:58,464
Yeah and like the Alamo he's somewhere where nobody wants him to be and he's

646
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
Really being a dick about

647
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
Long time ago like

648
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,656
He seems to just be dead set on

649
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,216
Kind of trying to live out that Ark

650
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,032
But like

651
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,824
Siren of the bat signal

652
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,616
This doesn't seem to be working

653
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
Batman's not coming

654
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
No

655
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,456
Why you called The Joker

656
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
I mean

657
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,576
Because he is the Joker that's right

658
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,256
I'm so depressed lately do you know who's in town

659
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,328
Doctor I am the Joker

660
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
Yeah I think

661
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
I feel like this metaphor

662
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,520
Because if you call the bat signal is not going to bring you

663
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
You money

664
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
First

665
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
I mean

666
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,384
If you're doing the same thing

667
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:53,248
You're not going to necessarily get a better action or response out of this true

668
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,624
You know what raising the bat signal does gives you a little bit of eight increased cash flow

669
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
Maybe it's got to be diminishing returns

670
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Studio

671
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,744
Like you're just squeezing the same people

672
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,816
Yeah that's what I mean like we said there's no reason that

673
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,888
A new call-to-action withdraw in a new

674
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Audience

675
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,936
Dubai

676
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,264
Scare the people who are already inclined to buy most likely

677
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,848
Seems that way to me I don't obviously know how is internal

678
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,944
Stuff works I don't know I don't know if this does actually bring me to Costco

679
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,784
Oversight eventually transito sucking dry

680
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:34,208
The colors that you know you hear they're like yeah you know about your products and some more because of it

681
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,048
People who are already in the revenue stream

682
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,096
Maybe we would like well I'll get some more toothpaste

683
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,168
Yeah I was going to wait until a couple of weeks

684
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,216
Weeks to buy more toothpaste but now I've got

685
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
4tube

686
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,824
Better buy all of it though cuz Alex can't get s*** anymore probably

687
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,408
I want to be strong persevere

688
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
And the biggest way you can do that right now

689
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,112
Goodbye going to infowarsstore.com and getting things you already need

690
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:07,232
I shouldn't be selling all the stuff for on sale because here's that here here's a predicament

691
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,328
I'm spending almost all the money

692
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,632
Infrastructure

693
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
And legal and

694
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,984
And then we have to buy

695
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,520
Product going forward

696
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:24,896
Prices are going up to 25

697
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:30,784
We got that money work please let you do it for no money down and 25 and 31

698
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
Product

699
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,512
Books to films

700
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,072
The t-shirts

701
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
Jerrod office stock

702
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,192
467 months no problem

703
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
But then I

704
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
And add

705
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
Do the show

706
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
On on on a shoestring

707
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:01,248
Available

708
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,552
Huge but not as effective

709
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
I don't want

710
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,232
The years

711
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,048
And never gone infowarsstore.com

712
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
Boats

713
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,888
Are the reason that the broadcast is still here

714
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
Summoning

715
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,008
Powerful people

716
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,824
And so many great, people it's just a measurable

717
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
What this family

718
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,200
So much but

719
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,992
Most important

720
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,088
When the strike without your permission

721
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
It's excessive

722
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,976
I think he's describing a bad business model

723
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
I always

724
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:48,864
What is people won't give me Supply like a

725
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,656
Stuff on credit anymore

726
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,984
Probably because I'm being sued into bankruptcy

727
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,056
Has to be an element of it

728
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:03,456
Credit it's very unlikely I'll get that money back I remember when I worked accounts receivable

729
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:12,160
Situations where you have to re-evaluate if someone's going to be on a net 30 schedule for paying for

730
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
Spell 40

731
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
If you need payment on

732
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,512
Delivery Adelaide

733
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
It says

734
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:24,192
It's something that happens with all company probably offered

735
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:29,824
Some automatically ordinarily

736
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,848
Strange the movie

737
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
I think Alex

738
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,944
It's probably a little frustrated by that

739
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
But also I

740
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,040
Here is this like I have enough to go for 6 more months

741
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,088
Pretty consistently whenever used

742
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
It desperate times

743
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,928
Seems like that's just kind of a line that he has

744
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:49,024
Roosevelt Lake

745
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,096
I don't know how much that reflect any kind of reality

746
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:56,192
I don't trust that calendars

747
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
It's been

748
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,520
180 days

749
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
Since I've said we have six months

750
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,152
The down and he's like I'll write 0 days

751
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,224
I don't know it just seems like it's his

752
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
It's just a

753
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Cliche

754
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
But he has

755
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
Trope

756
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
But

757
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
Sound good

758
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:24,352
Six months away Comics used the other day

759
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:28,448
What two years ago six months ago I ate yesterday what's the other day

760
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
Free

761
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,336
I don't necessarily believe any of us to pick

762
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
His

763
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,176
Israel situation kind of silly

764
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
Completely tell everybody you're busy

765
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,016
He does that a bunch

766
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,576
Wonder if it is actually

767
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:48,928
Got to be such a bad

768
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
Definitely not what you'd want to invest

769
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
So

770
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,096
Here's where Alex gets a little bit threatening with the audio

771
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,888
It's about whether or not they should give you money

772
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,448
I need a gas station right now

773
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
Odyssey

774
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
From you

775
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,872
But you want to support

776
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,200
But you really want me

777
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
Give

778
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,696
It's a free will universe

779
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,352
I just get out as I say so

780
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,912
Go to infowarsstore.com right now don't weigh

781
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,240
Alex Jones

782
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
That's like

783
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,568
A more immature version of Jim Bakker

784
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:43,968
I like your big girl be like we need a sign that you want us to expand

785
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Weather Shack

786
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Outback

787
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,832
Did do something in hold our potatoes in or whatever

788
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:53,440
The adding of the or maybe I should quit

789
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,560
Oh yeah

790
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:04,704
I'm writing a sequel to Field of Dreams called field of b******* and it's just an angry man hearing a

791
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
Voice in the Sky Go

792
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
Studio

793
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,336
If you tear it down they'll go away

794
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:19,296
You can go away I'll leave you alone

795
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:25,696
About something entirely different than they are

796
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,744
They still write articles

797
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
Everyday

798
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,656
I'm evil and none of us exist

799
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:40,032
We're going to destroy you

800
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
We're thinking write an article

801
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
Human

802
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,504
Nowhere for your body

803
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,832
People go well I better not criticize it

804
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:58,208
I mean

805
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
No one suing him for those things

806
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Because

807
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,864
I wound up serving

808
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
To death all over

809
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,216
Suing him for talking about a new world order

810
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:13,824
So one world government

811
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,224
Talking about just a new world order or One World Government we wouldn't be in this scenario at all no

812
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,760
Biomass

813
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:26,880
It seems like you just talked about Hillary being a demon forever

814
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:31,488
Nobody would be lying about Soro no problem totally find legally

815
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
The problem

816
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:36,096
The denying the defamation intentional infliction

817
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,632
It's another five emotional

818
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,960
The Straz Center misidentifying Marcel font

819
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,432
Action Bowling in a civil court

820
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:56,064
Not talking about the New World Order let me let me just try this real quick then

821
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
Future

822
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
Government

823
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
Quo

824
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
Got any

825
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,208
I have a lawsuit

826
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,024
Deserve

827
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,424
Alex is right I didn't even mean I did not know that you had to do it

828
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,824
Just like something came over me almost like a demon possessed me

829
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,872
So look Alex doesn't talk about himself

830
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,152
He says

831
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
At 90%

832
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,736
To talk about himself for a really long time

833
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,344
Give the number out and I'm going to take your calls today on the war

834
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,672
On the new covid lockdown

835
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,256
Tommy how you're dealing with inflation

836
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,328
I really don't want to sit here and

837
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,400
You know bore you would pour Alex Jones what's happening to me but

838
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,448
Intelius

839
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,008
Start the clock

840
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,568
Big famous law firms

841
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,616
And they don't believe

842
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,919
The rulings in the things being done in Connecticut

843
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Texas

844
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
And

845
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,087
The proposal for the trial coming up in that we can ask

846
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,903
Jury selection next week

847
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
In Texas

848
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,487
One of three lawsuits that got

849
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,511
Against me here

850
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,559
Brooklyn

851
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,447
We are not allowed to raise the 1st Amendment or any defenses or talk

852
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,591
The jury told I'm guilty

853
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,871
We can't respond

854
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
So I said okay

855
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,207
Show

856
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,767
They wanted to post me there's a party

857
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,303
Insurance companies in

858
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
Jayceon dies

859
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,031
Sunday silly

860
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
Deposition

861
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:04,575
And then one of the other Warriors will just reschedule

862
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,391
But I try to reschedule

863
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,399
Oh my God

864
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,959
You're so this money

865
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,519
Twenty-five Thousand Miles the next day

866
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,175
They treat me like I'm Daddy Warbucks

867
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,503
Howard Hughes

868
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,831
I just bathed in Gold like Scrooge McDuck

869
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,975
All just completely insane

870
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,839
Everybody else

871
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,167
Shocked that you don't want to talk about

872
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,495
Yourself

873
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,543
It's very much real sincere that he does

874
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,591
Until

875
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,871
Based on what he said

876
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
It makes

877
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,991
Can feel deeply uncomfortable with two kind of like get into this frankly as lawyers

878
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,319
Have given him the advice Eddie.

879
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,391
I bought a little bit of a made a whole thing for him

880
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,207
And it's clear that he just doesn't want to talk about

881
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,255
Admirable

882
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:23,679
Yeah you know who Alex treats like Lex Luthor and pedophiles put together

883
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,727
Anybody who disagrees with

884
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:30,591
Particularly members of the lgbtq community

885
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,919
Care too much about his feelings about how he's being treated

886
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,223
I'm so sorry.

887
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
Books

888
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,319
Scrooge McDuck

889
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,623
Ed's I was there

890
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,415
Real relatable references

891
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:49,535
Girl modern you know it's a lot like wow

892
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,607
I'm in the Spruce Goose was how many years ago

893
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:59,775
Dixie House like 2 years ago couple months attitude it one way or the other you're alright now I remember it

894
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:04,639
So Alex thinks that the people suing him have

895
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
Ulterior motive

896
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,247
To see it happening

897
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,807
And watch it going on so I'm trying to

898
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:21,023
Dishware under federal court trustee not lying about

899
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
Again

900
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,727
The judge is coming her hair and prepping

901
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:34,335
Making money off me

902
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,615
Wall climbing

903
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,919
True

904
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:43,295
Order to sit there like a monkey

905
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,623
But then allowed to talk

906
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
Taco Bell

907
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,023
The First Amendment or house

908
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,263
TV

909
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,823
Trials going to be the dead birds

910
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
Sketch

911
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,871
Yeah

912
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,455
Yeah

913
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,783
Still not talking

914
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,319
Hates talking about

915
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:21,951
Yeah he's been complaining with the judges combing her hair

916
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
For the media

917
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
And all I did

918
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,303
Was

919
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
Obfuscate

920
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,143
Probably in a criminally fraudulent manner

921
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
For multiple years

922
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:35,263
I don't understand why he wouldn't think that this would be something

923
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,823
That media would be interested in

924
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,383
I mean he's a media company

925
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:47,039
The big one very public a****** Behavior

926
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,367
Together with the most a****** a****** president there's ever been

927
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
Yeah

928
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:56,767
I think it's so you got understand that

929
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,095
So Alex has done some ads

930
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
This episode

931
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,167
Quite a bit haha I've not included all those

932
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,703
Automatic

933
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
There's a lot okay for pets

934
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,287
Alright then he really swings for the fan

935
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,175
Let me get into as well

936
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
Alma DeSantis run

937
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,503
A lot more but

938
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,831
Let me go ahead and go to do this

939
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,879
I'm going to take this live on air

940
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:26,207
24 minute and we can run

941
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,791
Bearing all the shows

942
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:36,447
Operate in the future. Beyond his own show you just record say format add to play other

943
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:43,103
Paradise

944
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,687
Any other show

945
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,551
90.5 on The Simpsons is Bart.

946
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:55,391
Just stopped and he's like I'm going to record a Butterfinger at real quick to the camera

947
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,975
A Wolf Blitzer

948
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:06,143
We have some good news coming up next segment with

949
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,215
Even stelter wouldn't do this

950
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,031
So here's some of that good news

951
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,591
It's about old

952
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:17,407
Great positive

953
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:21,247
Does Santa's blastpro infanticide late-term abortions

954
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,087
Florida State Journal passing laws or have passed laws

955
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
More than 10 states

956
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,951
Trimester abortions that is a

957
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,743
Very very good

958
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:35,071
But that doesn't ban late-term abortions

959
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
After 50

960
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,631
18 weeks which is right around the cost

961
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,911
The first and second timer

962
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
Masters

963
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,519
How is presenting this is DeSantis Banning late-term third-trimester abortion

964
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,591
Because he wants the audience to see this Extreme Action

965
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,639
Is just a minor good first step

966
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,455
That way they can still feel like there's so much I need to fight

967
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
Wait for it

968
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,551
Gimkit extra life any opposition to DeSantis action

969
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,343
His people overreacting

970
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,367
And it's

971
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
The Cheap Trick

972
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,415
Dan sucks

973
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,743
Hey you know

974
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,767
You know you're good

975
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,327
You know you're on the right path

976
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,119
Whenever you

977
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,143
Andrew buddy

978
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
Have to

979
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
Constantly lie to

980
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
The people who support

981
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,519
In order to get your

982
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,543
Evil bulshit pass

983
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
That's how good

984
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,127
It's um

985
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
Wow

986
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
It's okay

987
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,967
America would do it

988
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,527
Pitbull boy

989
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,343
So I can get many years ago Jordan

990
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,159
Let me tell you a tale

991
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
Deerslayer

992
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:41,119
Four score

993
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,703
Situation I don't remember where it was

994
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,495
Repack maybe Joe that the

995
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,519
Seem right

996
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
I don't know anyway

997
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,591
This was a time when

998
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,895
Alex and Rodger Stone decided

999
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
To go crash

1000
00:49:54,175 --> 00:50:00,319
A recording of the Young Turk was talking to Jimmy.

1001
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,599
Spit on at

1002
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,159
It was a big to-do

1003
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,695
Alex velt assaulted

1004
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:10,815
It was so sad. I can't remember either way Jimmy Dore spit on somebody

1005
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:16,191
Isn't it ironic how far we've come

1006
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,775
No Alex is playing at Jimmy Dore clip

1007
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,711
MSNBC

1008
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
Advisor in it

1009
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
Analyst

1010
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,343
Explaining what's really

1011
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,623
Going on

1012
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
Ukraine

1013
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,767
They almost have a heart attack

1014
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,351
When this gas is on

1015
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,959
Morning Joe a psycho Joe and Mika Brzezinski the war criminals

1016
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,263
When the truth is

1017
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,335
Jeffrey Sachs

1018
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,151
Very difficult

1019
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:10,975
Who is this

1020
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:14,559
And listen to what he says

1021
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,631
Congratulations are due to Jimmy Dore forgetting

1022
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,679
The Alex Jones nod of approval

1023
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:24,031
He's clearly doing some really solid work and should be super proud of the people who want to associate with him

1024
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,823
A few points here though

1025
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,919
The first is that this clip is not a morning Joe clip talking about the war in Ukraine

1026
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:33,503
It's actually clip from April 2018 talking about Syria

1027
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,087
But it's also a 2018 clip from Jimmy Dore

1028
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,159
Jimmy doesn't think it's talking about Ukraine Alex is making

1029
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,207
That all about this okay

1030
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,255
The Palestine question Jeffrey Sachs

1031
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:49,119
Is not a newcomer to MSNBC or even to Morning Joe as Jimmy's trying to imply

1032
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,143
And he didn't

1033
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:55,263
He's been on the show since this clip in all that nonsense is just Jimmy trying to create the

1034
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,567
Perception that opposing opinions aren't allowed

1035
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,359
On media platforms that he doesn't

1036
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:05,759
In reality the clip Jimmy is playing along with saxes other appearances which Jimmy's pretending I don't exist

1037
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
Ori strong

1038
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,343
Counterpoint to the entire premise that dissenting opinion

1039
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
And aren't allowed in

1040
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,135
The mainstream media

1041
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:15,999
Disagrees with the idea of insisting on Assad's removal from Power while the prevailing

1042
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,023
An opinion on the panel

1043
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,559
His little socks should be removed

1044
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,351
And he's free to speak his position

1045
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,143
Any wasn't blacklisted after work

1046
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:28,799
Anyway Jimmy and Alex both suck even one second to look into Jeffrey Sachs is resume

1047
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:33,151
Define that he's involved with a bunch of organizations that Alex believes that the New World Order

1048
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,991
Like the UN in the World Health Organization in the World Bank in the oec

1049
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
CD

1050
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:41,087
This is an important point to not bring up also because

1051
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:46,975
It would illustrate that there were differing opinions on world issues even among people Alex would call the globalist

1052
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:52,351
And that makes those narratives really impossible to rationalize they just completely fall under their own weight once

1053
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:56,191
It's seeing that this isn't the unipolar group where everybody

1054
00:52:56,447 --> 00:53:02,591
Has exactly the same ideas and works like otamatone to achieve the goals of the devil because then whenever you

1055
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,663
Murdered them you be like I owe these are people

1056
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,199
So

1057
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,247
Another gotcha moments

1058
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,783
About Joe Biden

1059
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,087
You know where the last one was pretty strong

1060
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:19,487
It was powerful prosecution misspeaking a lot of Support over there

1061
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
Here's a club

1062
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:26,655
Indicative

1063
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,983
Instructs confused Joe deleva crowd

1064
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,543
After

1065
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,711
And you can laugh at this but this was done

1066
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,527
Covid-19

1067
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,063
The Elise

1068
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,855
Their puppet does here's a video

1069
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:53,279
Southlawn thank you and happy happy Easter

1070
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,863
Alright

1071
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,911
You can hear say wave

1072
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
Who cares

1073
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,007
I don't think is a big deal at all

1074
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:09,151
Not remember Trump looking directly at a solar eclipse during his Easter Fest

1075
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
No there's nothing weird about that

1076
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
He just looked

1077
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:19,903
I look directly at it do you know why because he was so great not even the sun can hurt his eyes

1078
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,927
In terms of a

1079
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:26,559
Call Calabria head on that one

1080
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,351
I don't know

1081
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
Cares

1082
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,167
How do I access more threats

1083
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,191
About the money issue

1084
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,007
This doesn't affect me

1085
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,591
It's affecting use the courts to become this out of

1086
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
Control

1087
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,383
Dribbles do stuff

1088
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
Like to show

1089
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,991
And we need your support

1090
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,527
Whatever because money

1091
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,063
Is the big thing that can

1092
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,855
Fix this at stand up to this

1093
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,879
Ensure

1094
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:54,975
Other things are able to be done in the future matter what but maxed out like I am

1095
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:01,119
Sure will

1096
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,911
A delicious don't support me

1097
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:07,007
Then then then then that's what God wants

1098
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:09,055
Always providing

1099
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,919
Lawyers

1100
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:14,943
So

1101
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
You know just

1102
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:19,295
Absolutely did MIT than that is God's plan

1103
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,831
I'm supposed to stay on air

1104
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,391
But made a lot of money

1105
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:26,207
This is an interesting texture Eliza

1106
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,023
If you don't give me money that's proof

1107
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,071
Play God doesn't want me to be on here

1108
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,631
Your actions can determine God's will

1109
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:37,727
I mean what else can I say but jolo's

1110
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,519
Steam come on down

1111
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,311
I think it's a little clunkier

1112
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,103
Well I mean that

1113
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,735
To go without saying

1114
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,271
Aplomb and panache

1115
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,343
Showmanship better at

1116
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,463
EBay have a helicopter

1117
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,607
You know last year when that

1118
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,887
Texas head ice all over

1119
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,191
And Osteen doesn't have a tag

1120
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:12,543
So that's 12

1121
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:15,615
So just bored I need money s***

1122
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,711
With the accounting

1123
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:24,831
The DNA Fork plus antibodies ultimate turmeric formula

1124
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,391
Any activity X3 in the coffee all of it

1125
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,927
Pictures of money

1126
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,695
To run

1127
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,303
And implode

1128
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,631
Weather

1129
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,775
I am in between a rock and a hard place

1130
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,823
Money right

1131
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,871
Water in frozen ocean

1132
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,991
Oysters

1133
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,207
Infowarsstore.com

1134
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,255
Secure high-tech beautiful sight

1135
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,303
And buy some Ultra

1136
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,351
UT shirt

1137
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,215
Whatever

1138
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,495
We can

1139
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,543
Absolutely win and dominate

1140
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
Almost destroyed

1141
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:30,879
I don't have millions much what's going to dollars

1142
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,647
That's it

1143
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,743
Narrative Trump is all over

1144
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,583
I guess we're not totally against

1145
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,119
Is he hasn't gone bad

1146
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:45,727
I guess also Alex saying that he's not worth anything bacon

1147
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,079
Course sort of weary cast that

1148
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,383
A billion

1149
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,687
Apparently

1150
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,711
Billion dollars

1151
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,271
It's been a rough go for 3 billion dollars

1152
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,831
Is still a shitload of money

1153
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
Wow

1154
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,415
Are the 20 billion Maybe

1155
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,951
Man

1156
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,487
Surprised

1157
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,535
We don't have like literal found

1158
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,583
Like I'm surprised he doesn't

1159
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,607
Turn around

1160
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
And you see

1161
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
Before

1162
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,679
D-list conservative

1163
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,447
Celebrity

1164
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,471
Please Manning

1165
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,775
Old timey rotary phone just like

1166
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:26,175
You're ready to take your call but you throwing it to like a choir of

1167
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:31,039
Employees children

1168
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:31,807
Yeah

1169
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,367
Rob do-doing

1170
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:40,767
Talent show great probably as something that we still get close-up Magic

1171
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:47,167
One last talent show to save the rec center from the evil billionaire

1172
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:52,031
Goddamn dignity to do something like that that's what Alex needs help to

1173
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,847
No cuz he needs to be a shout

1174
00:58:55,103 --> 00:59:00,735
It means to be a show car wash also do the like

1175
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:06,623
Cuz what else is down there like save Infowars are thongs or whatever era as the dumbest shows

1176
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:11,999
But longer over and over something that you need

1177
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:18,143
Try and jump a car over Snake River Canyon

1178
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:21,215
Alex Russo like David Blaine.

1179
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,519
If we don't get this money

1180
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,591
I will know God has abandoned me

1181
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,871
Because I will be dumb

1182
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:34,271
I'm sending this text I will be

1183
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,831
Bring in a see-through tube

1184
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,599
For a week

1185
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:42,207
People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones

1186
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,487
And now we're going to prove it

1187
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,535
I just think something like that would be

1188
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
FIFA

1189
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,839
Fantastic it be better than this

1190
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:50,655
Because of excessive noise

1191
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,495
Said the relative term

1192
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,287
Does take some calls

1193
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:00,383
And man this first caller has an idea to save Infowars

1194
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,919
And

1195
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:02,943
Let's hear it boy

1196
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,015
Alexandra Daddario

1197
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:10,111
But also he starts with saving for Save the World which is a

1198
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:13,183
Prince2 Heroes save the Cheerleader Save the World

1199
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,255
Which was that what hero Nakamura I thought

1200
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:20,607
Sylar

1201
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,375
In order to

1202
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:27,775
Anyway you have told me about heroes over the years

1203
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,567
Who was called the Haitian

1204
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:33,919
He could mitigate people Powers when he was around them

1205
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,223
Love you buddy

1206
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,015
And come up with any

1207
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,063
This color is a bad idea

1208
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,367
For Alex

1209
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,951
I'll talk to Bob in Ohio Bob welcome

1210
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,535
Welcome

1211
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,351
Unless I ran a TV station

1212
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,631
NBC affiliate

1213
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,679
The better part of a decade recently

1214
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,495
But I know exactly what you're doing wrong

1215
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,359
Okay

1216
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,639
I believe what we need is

1217
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
Reseller

1218
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,479
Infowars.com

1219
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,415
What do you think of that

1220
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,511
What's the weather

1221
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:56,863
Music 7-Eleven

1222
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:02,495
Fundamental problem with this idea

1223
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,103
Do you not realize that they already do

1224
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:11,967
And it's a lot cheaper than the s*** that I sell I put a different name on

1225
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,527
Alex

1226
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,063
It's like his response

1227
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,855
Obviously is

1228
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:24,511
Appropriate already if anyone have interest

1229
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,303
I mean

1230
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,351
God

1231
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,679
Half a chance already be in every store

1232
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,959
Not love

1233
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:36,543
His f****** mad men ass prepared pitch

1234
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,871
You used to be a treat sir

1235
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,663
But now you are a bush

1236
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:46,527
How do we get back to the tree of Liberty is anybody's keeping a list

1237
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:50,367
The Shrubbery of Truth is up there with the

1238
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:53,439
The Piranhas of news

1239
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,255
The Piranhas of Liberty

1240
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,047
A boy

1241
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:01,887
I love that

1242
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:05,215
So I don't call Ortez that Alex should get more sales

1243
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,031
I agree

1244
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
Alex

1245
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,591
Does not take this well

1246
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,663
Brakes are still hanging in there

1247
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,431
After

1248
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,479
All the crap that's going on right now

1249
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,647
It's so I just want to stay

1250
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,439
I just ordered some

1251
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,975
Stuff from the store and I was looking back

1252
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:27,999
History

1253
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,535
And I made an order

1254
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,839
There's another one around about a year ago

1255
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,119
And

1256
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,399
There's been

1257
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,495
The whole entire

1258
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,543
Website has done

1259
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,567
In about a year

1260
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,359
That's ridiculous

1261
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,663
There's so many people

1262
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,711
600000 orders

1263
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,759
Only come out your guys store

1264
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,575
How many people are watching this and stuff

1265
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,599
Is absurd

1266
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,207
Blankets

1267
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:06,399
And nobody takes this stuff seriously so we'll just go off the air

1268
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,615
So much nicer about it

1269
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,663
Hey brother we're in this together

1270
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,711
Zeroed me against the world

1271
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,807
F*** it don't take me seriously I'm going to die alone I don't even give a s***

1272
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,879
GoNoodle

1273
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,415
That guy was

1274
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:30,719
Stocking it was order number

1275
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,023
Guest based on order number

1276
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,047
Hundred thousand

1277
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
Medipass

1278
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,887
But yeah man

1279
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,423
That's not a good headspace

1280
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,775
I expect better from the shrub of Truth

1281
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,311
I mean

1282
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:51,711
I hope one day it gets the water of responsibility

1283
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:57,087
It is uprooted by the construction company of

1284
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,415
That seems like a perfect metaphor

1285
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,951
Alex

1286
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:06,815
Gets here to point where he's like I don't want to take any more calls about me

1287
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,839
Stop it

1288
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,679
A lot of people pick their noses from metamorphosis of corrupt

1289
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,751
Wonderful things

1290
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:33,439
I want to talk about Russia

1291
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,975
Because it just

1292
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,655
Storytime

1293
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:45,727
Virtual offices

1294
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:50,079
Bio weapons being relation Force modulation

1295
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,127
Then America's done

1296
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:55,455
And my job was to be here to expose what was happening

1297
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:59,807
Spiritual choice

1298
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,903
That is when

1299
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,719
You want to meet us in the fight against the New World Order

1300
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,743
We need your support

1301
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,607
Turn it into complaining

1302
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,287
My God

1303
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
Stupid outbursts

1304
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:27,711
Like what kind of calls did I like to expect to get when he's not the first hour-and-a-half initial basically just ranting about doom and how the world was a

1305
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,015
Whether or not

1306
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:35,903
Theme of the show and that's what I was getting mad at himself for not being able to do any other show than that

1307
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
It's

1308
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,975
We what do you expect

1309
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,535
This is what you do you complain all the

1310
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,351
The time no callers calling in with like

1311
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,631
Want to talk about this

1312
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,911
Situation York

1313
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,935
Complaining about

1314
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,703
Right right

1315
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:53,055
You didn't know s*** you didn't spend the last half-hour talking about Ukraine

1316
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,615
And then when you went to calls

1317
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,895
Everybody was talk

1318
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,919
Talking about you right

1319
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:03,807
You spent the last half-hour talking about you and then you were like I'm going to go to Kohl's what do you think people are going to call in about

1320
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
It's a

1321
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,135
It's a call-in show

1322
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,743
Why would somebody call in and be like

1323
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:15,327
Hey I know you got bankruptcy or whatever but

1324
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:18,143
I have a raccoon that's

1325
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:18,911
It's loose in my

1326
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,447
Baytown and I think

1327
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,775
That the mare is secretly working for that raccoon

1328
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,543
What do we do

1329
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:32,223
That raccoon sounds like a problem but not as big as the problems I have now we're in trouble again

1330
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:37,855
Just turn it into lake house like you know the raccoon is really like the court

1331
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,623
Call APS

1332
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:44,767
I don't want to take calls but in Forza want to take calls but other things that I will make about me

1333
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,535
Cool

1334
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:52,447
Liberty I have particularly with this is the way that it sort of blaming the audience

1335
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,775
For calling in on the topic

1336
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,311
But he's clearly

1337
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,359
Rambling about 4

1338
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:03,455
In the same way that he's making

1339
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,247
His fault if he doesn't make enough money

1340
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:09,343
That's another abusive

1341
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
Go to work

1342
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,391
You don't give me money

1343
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:17,535
They're not maybe you don't want to show the kind of you I know I hate that I'm not a capitalist but even capital is don't lie

1344
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,071
Like work by their rules like

1345
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,631
Your shity business so you go out of business

1346
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,911
This man it's not their fault

1347
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,215
This is clearly a shity business

1348
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,495
Everything

1349
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,775
Alex's said about a bottle

1350
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:31,359
That he follows

1351
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,663
Collapsed already on E Bayonne

1352
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,711
So yeah you had a good run

1353
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,503
Silas is tired of

1354
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,295
Asking everybody for money

1355
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:42,879
How much energy it takes

1356
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
It's got to be exhaust

1357
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
Nothing to do it as much

1358
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:45,951
Psychically

1359
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,743
I'm just sick of sitting up her ass

1360
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,143
The small percentage of the products would be in the

1361
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,935
Situation

1362
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:56,959
But

1363
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,263
We have great products

1364
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,799
Infowarsstore.com

1365
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,991
Publix

1366
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,903
Complaining

1367
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,047
I'm sick of doing this

1368
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,375
I'll sit back and watch this

1369
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,239
In five years

1370
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,823
Just so hard to do this everyday and I even harder

1371
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,943
This man

1372
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
We'll be right back

1373
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:50,975
Weird I'm not continually rich I will watch all of you die in front of

1374
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,255
Give me with Noah

1375
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:58,655
And it will be yeah I will feel no guilt you didn't give me enough money there's also

1376
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,983
An underlying sort of supposition there that

1377
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,775
Alex believes

1378
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:07,615
That his show is the thing that's holding back the world burning

1379
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,151
He's the damn

1380
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,175
Yeah

1381
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,455
That's wild

1382
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,735
Can you imagine

1383
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,271
Feeling that important

1384
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,063
No

1385
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:20,927
Well actually periods of time in my life

1386
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,231
100%

1387
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:27,839
Very important under the sway of a powerful mental illness

1388
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:31,423
Amazing this

1389
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
Yeah

1390
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:34,751
But for it to be a consistent belief that you

1391
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,543
Do you know without shame

1392
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,823
Express on Youree

1393
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,847
Worldwide Bronco

1394
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,383
Right right right

1395
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,943
I want it all

1396
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,479
Little f***** I wouldn't do it

1397
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:49,855
That would be my advice I also wouldn't say that if I don't get enough money from you

1398
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,135
I'll watch all of you.

1399
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:54,463
I wouldn't say that

1400
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,999
Just let that one go

1401
01:10:56,255 --> 01:11:02,399
I think Alex probably has a me to try and cover all possible bases in terms of like an owl

1402
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:05,727
Am I going to f*** with people enough to get them to send me money

1403
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:08,543
Maybe that's one way right but I mean

1404
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:12,639
Radio show that is essentially a pretty

1405
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,919
Textron racket for fear

1406
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:18,783
It all like he comes to your home and he's like I be terrible if you weren't afraid of some

1407
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,807
Something for 5 minutes

1408
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:20,831
Just saying

1409
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:24,671
Lakewood

1410
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:28,255
It'd be terrible can you imagine if you weren't afraid of your neighbors

1411
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,047
Yep yep

1412
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:36,191
So are we one last clip here and it's the third hour is Alex interviewing

1413
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,983
Judge Andrew Napolitano

1414
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
And I don't care

1415
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,543
Wow is he falling

1416
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:47,455
All right ladies and gentlemen Judge Andrew Napolitano author researcher judge good friend

1417
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,527
Remind philosopher smart person

1418
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:54,111
For the rest of the week

1419
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:58,463
He wants to get into the ongoing investigation what came out about

1420
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,047
CIA

1421
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,839
He wants to get into

1422
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:07,935
Elon Musk and what's going on

1423
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:13,311
The Durham investigations are no such proof and Alex isn't Vindicated and anyway

1424
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:19,967
Where is the Durham s*** is really just a right-wing media machine and March a federal judge chastised

1425
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:26,367
Including unnecessary information the fuel the fire storm and right-wing circles about supposed spying on former president

1426
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,927
Donald Trump in a routine filing that he made

1427
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:34,047
This is kind of a purpose of the investigation and Alexandra politano are playing their role

1428
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:37,375
Kohl's in the whole front right if I can't imagine carrying any less

1429
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,935
About something then what Judge Napolitano has

1430
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,471
To say about Elon Musk drink

1431
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,543
The what is what

1432
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,567
But why is life

1433
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,895
Those things that I never thought I would hear

1434
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:51,199
Judge Napolitano on

1435
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,991
Elon Musk buying Twitter

1436
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:59,391
Yeah I mean you're saying how far he's fallen but like napolatanos been on Alex's show for a long time

1437
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,695
Fox News guy he was

1438
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:03,231
But no heat

1439
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:10,143
Goes back quite a ways actually super regularly but

1440
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,423
Infowars

1441
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
Maybe even

1442
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
Since like

1443
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,495
Tea party date

1444
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,567
If you have or ever word judge

1445
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,151
And you go on Infowars you should be immediately disbarred

1446
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,967
I don't know if

1447
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:25,759
Napolitano is practicing

1448
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:32,415
What about Judge Mills Lane

1449
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,695
Judge Judy

1450
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,463
No.she's

1451
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,743
Punch and Judy

1452
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,815
Judy tenuta

1453
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,631
Judy Gold

1454
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,935
I'm out of duties

1455
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:48,799
Yeah I mean look at the interviews not

1456
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,639
Alexander politano boring me

1457
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:57,247
That like

1458
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,551
This

1459
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,319
Just

1460
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:03,647
This long rambling about nothing and Howard the Duck

1461
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:06,207
Things are at that I need money

1462
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:09,791
If you don't give me money with them maybe you don't want my show to exist

1463
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,583
Who's the oldest bulshit

1464
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,375
I think

1465
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,399
Sincerely

1466
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,191
A little bit more respect

1467
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
For Alex

1468
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,287
He thinks

1469
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,847
And that is like Colonel Travis

1470
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,407
Right going down with the Alamo

1471
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,175
Like

1472
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,223
Colonel Travis

1473
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,759
Go down

1474
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,551
Like complaining

1475
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,599
About the Alamo the whole time

1476
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,647
I don't know that

1477
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:36,671
Well

1478
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:39,743
Whenever they were all in the Alamo he was like

1479
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:43,839
God this hurts my back they're all out there probably

1480
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,423
Lemoore the myth of it

1481
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,495
Apologize version of it isn't like

1482
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,031
Santa Ana shows up

1483
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:56,383
And he's got one favorite is no one came to help

1484
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,663
You know like

1485
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,735
There is a Dignity of quiet Dignity of

1486
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:04,575
Being in the situation where you're in this lawsuit and maybe you feel

1487
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:09,695
Lil Jon Dirty by it but your job is to be this broadcaster who brings

1488
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:15,071
The truth the Shrubbery of Truth joy and you bring the information to the people

1489
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,607
So get on your show

1490
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,399
And do your job

1491
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,703
So you're going through all this trouble

1492
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:25,823
Right I think that there is a dignity that that Alex is clearly incapable of

1493
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,359
Right-of-way bodying

1494
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,895
I think that's

1495
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,175
Probably

1496
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,479
Predictable

1497
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,503
So I think that makes

1498
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,807
Exmark and Bill the knights who say nee though

1499
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,575
So that's pretty

1500
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,879
Yep

1501
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,159
I'm trying to think of who I could be

1502
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,207
Being that

1503
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:45,023
Because this shows you continually getting yours arms

1504
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,839
Bike shops on the guy who makes the horse noises

1505
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,423
OK Google black guy

1506
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,727
Alex is Sir Robin that naturally

1507
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:57,311
I didn't watch that

1508
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:02,175
Anyway

1509
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:07,807
I figured maybe people were excited expecting kind of a breakdown so

1510
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,599
Because response is far more

1511
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,367
Logistical

1512
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,415
Emotional outbursts

1513
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,487
Hello there are little periods of emotional outbursts but no like

1514
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,767
Storming off the set

1515
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:21,119
It's kind of like I need money cuz you need mine

1516
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,655
Yeah I mean there's

1517
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,959
It's the most honest two shows been in a while

1518
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,239
Yeah

1519
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,543
There's a definite

1520
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,823
Sensitive

1521
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:32,383
Clarity

1522
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:36,479
Anybody or I will not do this anymore

1523
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,063
No matter what

1524
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,391
You know things go really bad I'll just have to fire everybody but I'll still go

1525
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,159
Keep going

1526
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:44,927
Not a chance

1527
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,487
Without the trappings of the like

1528
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
The status symbols

1529
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,071
Studio that the wealth

1530
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,631
Such he would absolutely not be doing

1531
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,447
No on equal footing with the rest of the

1532
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,215
Severe

1533
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:04,639
Didn't have a studio that look like CNN and 50 employees or whatever in the

1534
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:09,759
Ability to play up his relationships with all sorts of other people who are more

1535
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,831
Mainstream and legitimate

1536
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:18,207
Does Tucker Carlson going to care about interview the podcast

1537
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,839
Is Pakistan could be allowed on Apple

1538
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,375
No that's respect

1539
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:31,263
Jordan card for him

1540
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,799
Epson WhatsApp what the what is

1541
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:35,871
His butt

1542
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:45,343
A happy beginning

1543
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,391
Into the dreamy creamy summer

1544
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,951
Dreamy creamy

1545
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,255
