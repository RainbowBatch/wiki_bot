00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Money

5
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,136

6
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Just a little bit about

7
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,584
Alex Jones

8
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,888
Jordan Jordan

9
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,912
What's up

10
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,544
About today

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
Black lives matter it's

12
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
Also I only work for like the four hours I'm outside of my apartment otherwise Mister Rogers sweater.

13
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:37,280
Out of the house is equivalent to the course of the week so

14
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,216
A baby announcement that I was going to declare my pet

15
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
Give this big reveal and I hope

16
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
Public

17
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,976
I'll be worth a lot more excited given me suggestion

18
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
When I said I was talking

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
Appreciate everybody

20
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
What ended up becoming

21
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
The plan

22
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,800
Is very much an offshoot of somebody suggestion

23
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,152
Can cockroaches hissing cockroaches

24
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
And it bounced around my head a bit

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Absolutely

26
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
I don't want that cockroaches

27
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,392
I have a huge cockroaches there

28
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
Not interested

29
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
Not come on face your fears

30
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:43,072
I'm not afraid of dumb I just don't care for it

31
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,216
I've had it

32
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
And so I decided like

33
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
Praying mantis

34
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
Pretty cool

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,176
Fairly cool I like the idea of maybe having a mantis

36
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,272
I decided maybe that's

37
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
And then I thought of the

38
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
The pain name

39
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,160
This house phone

40
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,816
So I

41
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,888
Mantis yet but that is

42
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448

49
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,368
I started reading it

50
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,648

Genuinely like so much

53
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,888
Voice is so wildly like it does all kinds of s***

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Even though I've spent

55
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:57,312
Literally the past 15 years on a microphone talking back to that unlike

56
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712

57
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248

The show that I have barely any notes

67
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519

00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,503
Best present

199
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,879
You called this an attack

200
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,975
An accident

201
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,047
It seemed like it based on the explosion I met with

202
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
Some of our great generals

203
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
I just seem to feel that

204
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
It was just was not

205
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
A

206
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
Some kind of a

207
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Menu

208
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
Explosion type of

209
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
This was a

210
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:12,479
Seems to be according to them they would know better than I would but they seemed to think it was a attack

211
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
It was a bomb of some

212
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
Comes out and tells you it's a bomb

213
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Before

214
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Intelligence

215
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
Declassify whatever he wants

216
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Q-47

217
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
The president can

218
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
What we did we the people elect

219
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Someone

220
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
Spade card play

221
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
Is that

222
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
Like the president doesn't have that power

223
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,991
President can do whatever he wants as long as we don't impeaching it's up to us

224
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,319
We the people's Congress believe what he's done is wrong

225
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
And we can prove it was

226
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
He represents We the People

227
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
Wait we wait wait

228
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
So Frost Nixon style momento

229
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Unless he gets in

230
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,079
We There You Go that was

231
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
Well yeah but that weekend convicted Congressman decided

232
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:22,367
Appreciate him saying we the people that view of Civic

233
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Authoritarian

234
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Just honest

235
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,815
And Alex's he's got a really interesting position on this he's decided to spend it was probably Israel

236
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
Grill

237
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,983
He's basing that on comments netanyahu's made in the past about Hezbollah

238
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,567
Having like stations in missiles in Lebanon

239
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,151
Bind it with Trump talking

240
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,735
Can see it and now you started if you jump his declassifying that is real

241
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
I'm a huge fan of just making up things and then declassify responsible

242
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,607
It's it's irresponsible conjecture on Alex's

243
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,167
Is Bart hands

244
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Kind of gross

245
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
Underground area super

246
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:14,079
So there's not a lot going on but I found compelling

247
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,431
Start rambling a little bit about

248
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,271
He's seen a video of someone getting stabbed

249
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,903
If I understand the video that he's talking about correctly it was

250
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,999
Trump supporter type stabbing a left-wing

251
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
Percent

252
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
Said that Lebanon

253
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:43,519
Israel

254
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,359
Video

255
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Should stab people

256
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
All you got to do with it

257
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Fox is everything

258
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Everything is speed

259
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Just like

260
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,711
That's what you do these to get off

261
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
Yeah quite a bit

262
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
Present quite a bit

263
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,607
You want to kill somebody you go straight for the gyro

264
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:45,727
I am jagras in a little bit

265
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,127
You pretty quick

266
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,711
But it was only when I was defending myself

267
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,551
Okay you know what I was younger I used to take karate

268
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,671
There were always the older guys in the locker room

269
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,023
Who are all these karate guys but in a white nationalist karate guys

270
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
Big Burly tattoos

271
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,351
Sure and they would always

272
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
Talk s*** about how best to

273
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
And your leg

274
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,543
That's what I hear from Alex because I was there and even as like a nine-year-old pitam like

275
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,359
You guys are full of s*** you know like that kind of

276
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,431
I don't understand why

277
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,503
Alex would do this sort of thing on a show

278
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Like

279
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
Every now and again that you have to take

280
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:38,719
Step back and recognize that he tries to Pretend This is news

281
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,143
No I mean if you're covering a new story of someone getting stabbed protester something

282
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,983
I don't know why you would editorialize the best way to ship people

283
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,055
And like get their guts out leave you alone

284
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
Like I don't I don't know why

285
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,895
Filter report

286
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,711
Shooting isn't going to be like now

287
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,807
Just so you know the best what you're going to want to do is focus on hitting Center Mass

288
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,879
You think that the headshot is going to do the job quicker

289
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:12,767
You're going to miss the video game

290
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,351
80%

291
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:21,215
Outright

292
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
But instead

293
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
Is he put the outer core

294
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
That you better fucken hope

295
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,199
That his listeners don't respond to

296
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
We really should call

297
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
Recalled

298
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
Call Brittany

299
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
He's not living on the top

300
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Thrown out of there

301
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Cuz he's not

302
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
Globalist

303
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,279
Alex

304
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,839
Best way to write a check

305
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
End up going

306
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,007
2y where is the mayor of Austin

307
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,823
Send lives because they don't have a good track record of

308
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,127
Peaceful normal demonstration

309
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,479
Make a scene let's I mean let's say something does happen

310
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
I mean look

311
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:44,159
Quite honestly now

312
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,023
For him he should not be encouraging people to go to the home

313
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
Specific people

314
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,631
Bad

315
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
Break-ins at the first floor

316
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,983
And make a scene every Friday and Saturday night

317
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:03,615
Then we'll recall him I don't even think it's a great ideas for people who are trying to

318
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
Has like sodas are responsible

319
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
Protest

320
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
Places to be like

321
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,855
We go places and make a scene

322
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
I don't I don't know

323
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,208
Productive targeted action probably make

324
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Yeah yeah

325
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,072
I don't know anyway I think it's a bad escalation

326
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,120
Refinement

327
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
Alex's

328
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:32,288
He's he's been talking a bit about Civil Disobedience lately in a way that I feel like he doesn't know what it mean

329
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Yeah

330
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,896
Civil disobedience is that the one

331
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,456
Well

332
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Okay well

333
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,272
Alex

334
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
Gibbster talking

335
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
About

336
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,416
There are people who have the opinion that there should be

337
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
Police defunding

338
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
And such

339
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,792
His position on it is that

340
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
They want to take over the

341
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,632
The police in order to create their own

342
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Gestapo

343
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,520
And specifically he has this to say about ilhan Omar

344
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:08,384
Andy says the chief police in order to create around sodas

345
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
SS

346
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:14,784
Sure is obviously the conversation two people are having makes total sense

347
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,648
He can't have this point or make this

348
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Position without

349
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
Getting

350
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,000
Very explicitly races

351
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,840
Ilhan Omar

352
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,264
Because that woman can't build a civilization

353
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
The minute

354
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,640
Flavors

355
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,048
Why does how does someone's brain work this way

356
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
Tobago

357
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
Complex

358
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
Tapestry of nonsense

359
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,960
I don't understand

360
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,264
What kind of racism you're really going

361
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:13,920
Civilization

362
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:20,320
That's fine if I'm incapable

363
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:25,952
Back there that I don't know what that means

364
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:32,352
I guess we'll be saying is that she's not capable or able to be in a leadership position

365
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,960
Mission of some sort because she's from Somalia

366
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:42,336
What are you saying is that everyone who's not

367
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:47,712
Pirate stock

368
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,320
I don't even I don't understand

369
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
Like Pirates

370
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
Yeah

371
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Stock

372
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:02,560
Knowing nothing about her but the color of her skin and I am I

373
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,168
Refugee

374
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,240
Adventure pissing all over everybody

375
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
Trump supporter or something

376
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
How do you know what

377
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
Doc

378
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Someone come

379
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,968
Just got that in the past

380
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
The cheese lighter-skinned that he would

381
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:28,160
Expect her to be be from Africa is also complex yet

382
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:33,536
Ugly

383
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
Hellboy

384
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
Alright

385
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
We're doing great we're at

386
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,032
Navigate to Greg

387
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:48,384

Dick

389
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,736
So

390
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
PS

391
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
I didn't really take off

392
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
It's just that

393
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,328
I'll go out the street

394
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
I'll just physically go out there

395
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,016
OK Google

396
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,320
Civilization

397
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
But really you watched

398
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,440
The public getting into their own enslavement

399
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
And all the lazy neurotic

400
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,536
People unable to get anything done

401
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,072
And it just makes me wonder man

402
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,168
God just kill us all

403
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,216
Willow

404
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,592
I should just leave

405
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
You suck

406
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,272
You are just turning into a

407
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,576
More of violent minded

408
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Like

409
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,136
Doomsday preacher type

410
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:09,792
It's just like a bunch of people I don't give a s***

411
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
Cherry wine

412
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
Oh maybe I'll go out into the street myself disappears for me

413
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
Because you just like

414
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
Maybe I should just go out

415
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Go to park

416
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
Springs without

417
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
Getting a test

418
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,832
Okay

419
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,416
Some sort of Civic civil disobedience

420
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
Vine

421
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Whatever

422
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,792
I don't think it's a good idea you know you're doing what you do

423
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
But then he's like

424
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:51,008
Yeah hey Aaron I read these dumb headlines and I rant about the

425
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,056
I'm not doing business

426
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,920
I need more attention

427
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,504
Go to Barton Springs to break into something

428
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,576
I'm going to go to the W yellow

429
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:10,976
You're right they don't it's like yourself to the door

430
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:17,376
You can still get in the other would like the security guard is like I can take those off for you

431
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,776
Meanwhile come on you don't even know how to do it right you're just a nuisance like he gets into the creek

432
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
F****** fine just go

433
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,920
I don't know what the situation is Barton Springs

434
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:34,784
It's more of a local issue then I care about

435
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:39,648
But yeah I mean like if you wants to like I don't know changing self to the fence apart

436
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:46,048
Springdale for it some sort of Civil Disobedience some sort of a way to raise awareness that he wants to swim with

437
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
Never do it

438
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:54,752
Supposed to be so manly and strong and powerful and then you just keep whining about stuff you could literally

439
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:59,360
Do at the drop of a hat say I'm going to do this

440
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,176
Don't whine about something that you could

441
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:07,808
I mean we all know that when you say that you're going to do something you end up not doing it

442
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,856
Because your brain is Trick yourself into thinking

443
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,904
You've already know now Alex

444
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,000
He's already taken

445
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,496
This is just like I'm not getting enough attention I need to ask

446
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Attention

447
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,384
And here's the thing I've been going through with this telescope

448
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
4 years ago

449
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,832
Say their name we hit the button

450
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,512
I'm going to stay there

451
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,072
Again we go through the second

452
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,864
And we are going to defeat this

453
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,192
This one thing

454
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
The part I hate is the connecting with

455
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
Hello

456
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,128
We're going to do this right now

457
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
I love Carlos is a longtime regular caller

458
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
Stop bitching to be a whiny ass

459
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
Joann

460
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,448
Go ahead

461
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,824
Carlos has got to feel good about that

462
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,128
And it's all because

463
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,456
Recognize

464
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:48,160
Explain the situation to all of the colors when they call in and get put on home

465
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,232
Here's another one

466
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
To do at 8

467
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,424
Everything is exactly as Alex says

468
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,472
She says the name

469
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
They don't hear their name

470
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
Or whatever

471
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
Jordan

472
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,432
How's it going what's going on with you

473
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
I didn't hear the

474
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:19,392
No I said Jordan

475
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,976
The character is waiting for the

476
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
Changes that could be made that are so

477
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,584
F****** simple that would solve this problem

478
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
Upgrade your phone system

479
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,192
So you're telling me

480
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,264
Not solving this problem

481
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,592
It's like somebody who is like

482
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
I don't know

483
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:47,296
With an easily I have a headache and you just complained for an entire day to take an aspirin

484
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
It's

485
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,368
This is comical to me

486
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
Hit it makes him so bad

487
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,232
So he's been on the he's been using this phone Sis

488
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
4 years

489
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
Conceivably guy

490
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
He has had this problem

491
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
4 years

492
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
And just now

493
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
On air

494
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
He's coming up with

495
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
The solution for

496
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Right

497
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,312
And no point in time did we ever have a head backstage

498
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,384
Conversations lyrics

499
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,736
Sorry sorry that

500
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,552
BMO picture

501
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
What you see on Ayers what's going on

502
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
Okay

503
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,768
Apologize

504
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
There is

505
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,480
To his audience it is what he

506
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,528
He thinks his authenticity is

507
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,088
Like so deeply emotionally manipulative

508
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Yeah

509
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,672
I think that there's a certain amount of the audience

510
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:01,024
Probably feels held captive by his like his outbursts

511
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Sure

512
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,168
Sure it's like I mean it it's like having an alcoholic dad

513
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,984
You're you're on constant high alert like

514
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,264
Waiting for that

515
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,568
That little moment that's going to set him off

516
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,872
You're almost paralyzed until he does

517
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
Right

518
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
If you take

519
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,064
Those outbursts as being about something grander the devil or the global

520
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,088
To my ex

521
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
Wife is suing

522
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:34,048
Saying that my mouthwash is Magic if it's not

523
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:38,144
Sandy Hook I can't get that taste

524
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
Like if you

525
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
If you

526
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,264
Take those outbursts that are about like

527
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,664
At the consequences of Alex's actions that are eating at him use my phone system

528
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
Did you take those outbursts

529
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,040
Change them and Elevate them to being like

530
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
No

531
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,136
Alex is actually mad because the devil's out to get him

532
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
God

533
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
It's just

534
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
I don't know it's

535
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,304
Mysterious ways

536
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,864
But the devil only deals with bones

537
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,424
That is something

538
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
That's why you know

539
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,752
You lose service

540
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
If you're in the base

541
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
I just I just think it's

542
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,336
It's very wrong

543
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,432
The way Alex behaves himself

544
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,504
Better romanticizing

545
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,808
In order to avoid EX

546
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Sleep dealing with him

547
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
You know it's just

548
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
It's easier to be like all it's the

549
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
The devil and it's easier for people to believe it

550
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
The devil because if he starts

551
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,048
What's the deal with real-world problems on the

552
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,608
The show that's a real bummer for everybody

553
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,144
It's not a conspiracy

554
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,704
It's literally you you're going to get

555
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
Olivia

556
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,336
No like that's less romantic

557
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,384
Coming to kill you

558
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,944
Exactly recognizes

559
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Cell

560
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:02,368
If it does you need to buy water filtration system so I can pay my legal fees for things I like

561
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,648
Do you about in the past

562
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:11,328
I'm starting to use I feel statements at the advice of my therapist

563
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:15,936
I feel like you're going to need to buy this magic toothpaste otherwise I can't afford to pay my therapist

564
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
Right

565
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:21,568
Please

566
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
Like really ramping up

567
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,920
Alex does

568
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
Shouldn't be violin

569
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
People

570
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,016
So you know

571
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,088
We just gone too far

572
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,368
We've gone too far

573
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
Are saying

574
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
Kill kill

575
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
Kill kill

576
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424
Kill kill

577
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,032
Weather tomorrow

578
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,824
Slowly

579
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
I guess it's not

580
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,176
Offensive violence ever

581
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
No I mean

582
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
Bill Gates

583
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
Is coming but a while

584
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
With a weapon

585
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
Yeah so

586
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,696
I don't understand how that could be anymore you'll know when the

587
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
Time is right

588
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
Constantly is doing that

589
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
And every

590
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:19,424
Zane insult part of my body is saying kill

591
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
Kill.

592
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Repetition

593
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:28,384
Normalizing be sorts of feelings that someone listening might have just f***** up

594
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,040
Outlook

595
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
Tank

596
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:41,952
Alright a lot of people want to shake

597
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,280
You got to slap that's in the movie

598
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,168
Text to Carlos is a long time caller

599
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
Who sucks

600
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,496
Man's boring not going with Daddy that

601
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:59,360
Sharp instead we jump forward to caller who explain to Alex that

602
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,944
Finding Infowars was a Divine thing

603
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:08,320
What's on my mind first of all I just want to listen to know the reason why I started listening to you

604
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
A few years back

605
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
67 years ago

606
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
Was that

607
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,720
The Holy Ghost led me to you

608
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,560
And the message was when I was the first words that I have her come out your mouth

609
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,144
Was that of the golden life was a avatar

610
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,448
And this is what I always known all my life

611
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
I always try to

612
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,824
Understanding that the Holy Ghost through the rest of the work

613
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,616
So I just want to listen to the no

614
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
That's the reason why

615
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
Why I listen to

616
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
I'll let you buy the Holy Ghost so I know I'm in the right place

617
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
This is such

618
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,856
Zealotry or not good

619
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,672
Longest Yard

620
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,024
Is Big Tent Revival ISM if everybody's arm

621
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:54,400
I sort of touched on this earlier but like this is just a violin

622
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
Jim Bakker

623
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,568
Listening to these two episodes like I really experienced

624
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,104
Far more of like

625
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,384
This is

626
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:08,224
Like Loki transitioned

627
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,552
Complete religious zealotry tips

628
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,880
It's it's so much more that then

629
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
How do I

630
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:21,024
Another call

631
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,400
Maybe a little bit anti-technology

632
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,728
I'd like you to go ahead and throw away our still

633
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,544
We don't need him get our landlines

634
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
Go ahead

635
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
Get rid of

636
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,224
Computers we don't need those won't go back home

637
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,040
Isn't for you having your

638
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,904
Play some yoga classes to understand the more angry they make you

639
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,440
The more they control

640
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:55,072
You're all over the place

641
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
You spell yogurt

642
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,032
Disgusting

643
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
You think clear

644
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
Stress

645
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
When you realize

646
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,064
I agree with you but one reason we've been effect

647
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
You know I mean

648
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,256
The end is revealing too much

649
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
Is that he can't relax

650
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,680
Can't do anything like that because

651
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
Anger in the false

652
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,984
Performances

653
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,776
Of rage and all of it

654
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,104
Really makes him a

655
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
Attractive to anybody

656
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,248
His career the yelling rants

657
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:51,392
But you wouldn't be anywhere yellow Piers Morgan and you didn't see

658
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:56,000
I can just like this is what I call his career is Galveston and he knows that

659
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,560
It's like it's like a

660
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:02,656
It's so sad it's like a comic who's been doing it it's like a road a,

661
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
Been doing it for 20 years

662
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
Always wears the same

663
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,520
Because he opens

664
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
With a bit about the

665
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,128
Eunos palsy

666
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,248
A bit about it

667
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,112
I think the better version of this what you're saying is it's like

668
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,392
The comic 2

669
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:28,256
Can't stop drinking because they think the drinking is important to their stage persona

670
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:33,888
Cuz it's destructive anger and all this is destructive

671
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,424
And he

672
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
Feels like

673
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
Is no place

674
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,032
Without it

675
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,360
Comic they can usually I'm a lot of people

676
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
Find sobriety

677
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
Still be just as creative as they were

678
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
He's dead right

679
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,784
Not the guys wearing the shirt they don't have that car

680
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
That's probably start

681
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,536
Not at all he doesn't have an edge any other way like

682
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:06,400
It's not what's going to rely on their so dumb and pointless

683
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,936
Based on nothing

684
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,752
That they only make it based on performance

685
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,824
Attracted to anybody

686
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
It's like a badge

687
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
Joke that a good comic

688
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:22,016
I can sell because this just gets by on Katie Holmes

689
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:26,368
You take a step back and think about what the conversation

690
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:30,208
Justin if he's mad angry about something

691
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,512
Must be real

692
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,328
Cuz there's no way

693
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,984
Fired up

694
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,128
The manipulation comes into it

695
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,712
Edison Shores

696
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
Purple penguins or whatever the f***

697
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,392
Anyway

698
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
Leave your problems

699
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
Because

700
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,328
He has no reason to exist otherwise

701
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,400
So you get another car here

702
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
Man

703
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
This is fun

704
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:18,848
Do you remember episode back I was just talking to a guy named Larry gaiters

705
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
Did not seem

706
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
Maybe some

707
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,392
Topiary

708
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
So

709
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:38,048
He is not on this episode heard

710
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
Larry gaiters on another podcast

711
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,496
Ono Ono

712
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:54,431
Awesome

713
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,455
Go with the doctor

714
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,015
And he was talking about his nana

715
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,831
Everybody

716
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,439
That's going to be communicating with Wi-Fi Towers everything installed hydrogel

717
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,767
He was breaking down that hydrogel

718
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,303
Translated in Latin

719
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,839
Charlotte rampling

720
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
To Lucifer

721
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:18,495
DNA and turned into a luciferian

722
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
Outrageous

723
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,663
I don't even know where to begin or end

724
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,735
But that I love that scam still work

725
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,759
Backgrounds

726
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,343
That Groove still work work work work for like

727
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,183
You're as bad as a teen

728
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:43,327
Fine French sounds like this it doesn't matter too

729
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,959
It might be a little bit more difficult for people to

730
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,983
Google

731
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,311
Wow

732
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Go to

733
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,711
If you go to the literally Translate

734
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
Elusive

735
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,015
Verdad

736
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:09,183
Actually he's right

737
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,791
We go to the 6

738
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:21,215
And trying to install Melania Trump as a

739
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
Liberty at

740
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
At all

741
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,079
But I think Melania is hot

742
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,919
Dark Shadow ruler

743
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,735
Alex might be getting in getting on board

744
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,295
Trump knows the answer

745
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
The fighting was satanic

746
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,671
All things are possible

747
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,207
Through Christ

748
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
Just want to leave

749
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
All things

750
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,239
So it is just because Melania said something vaguely religious

751
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,775
You're sounding in a speech

752
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,151
How is this not speak erotic sounding

753
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,431
Do you have no one else

754
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,391
She said not to bully people

755
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,023
I think she's good enough for me

756
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,071
I don't have

757
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
Drew

758
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:27,263
It's because of it cuz it was media's overlooking her

759
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:34,175
I don't I don't know I don't know I'm just mad

760
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:40,063
It's this Fantastical let's just let's just pick up to be honest I can explain

761
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,343
Some of this trees

762
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,391
Okay it's because

763
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,207
She comes from a communist country

764
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,303
And that's the reason that Steve pieczenik has built up his idea that she knows

765
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,839
What to do in the circle

766
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
Come stances and stuff

767
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,935
Is because we're facing a communist uprising

768
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,495
And she knows communism from the inside

769
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,799
There's some elements of that

770
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
Wow yeah

771
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,639
Wow

772
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,687
It's just a lot of

773
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,247
I would even argue

774
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Million

775
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
The people

776
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
True

777
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:17,183
And anyway so any one of them are also qualified

778
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,511
Apparently

779
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
Alex

780
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:27,935
We were bringing pretty used to at this point I'm saying that the news is so big that he can't

781
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
Skip to it

782
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,567
August 6th episode do

783
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,103
This evolve

784
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,943
The news is so incredible so important so over-the-top

785
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,783
All of it today

786
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,367
Every single scrap of this info

787
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:53,023
He's over well right but the news is so big that now he has to go

788
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,215
Is on his own interesting evolution is almost like watching

789
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:20,415
It makes sense now because it's a nonsensical none of it

790
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,791
Does make sense to say I'm overwhelmed

791
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,327
Because there's so much

792
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,119
Do I have to get all of it

793
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,935
Is a coherent statement

794
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,727
Congratulate

795
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:41,151
Solo

796
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
Awesome

797
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
So honestly

798
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:47,807
Everybody was reeling from the news

799
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
Letitia James

800
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,927
The New York attorney general came out

801
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,863
Press conference on the 6th at 10:30 Central Time sure was a major

802
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,423
National Bank

803
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,239
That's a bear

804
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,519
The NRA

805
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,079
Wayne LaPierre until the other leadership

806
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,103
For self-dealing

807
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,223
I'm not entirely sure

808
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
As of yet

809
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,879
Allegations of mismanagement money that was

810
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,927
Supposedly charitable

811
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,791
There was some cheating going on let's see if she can prove it

812
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,327
Nobody's like

813
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,471
They're innocent of the charges they're just like I don't know if

814
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,239
F*** it up

815
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
Probably

816
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,567
Somehow or another

817
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:46,431
She has to respond to this cuz it just before you went on air

818
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,991
And I don't think his defense is good

819
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:54,367
We have Letitia James the woman under Cuomo's that ordered and threatened to arrest

820
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,695
Kwame resume current operators and managers

821
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
Not

822
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,095
Covid-19 positive patients who have

823
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,631
Other things like pneumonia

824
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
Monstrous woman

825
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,287
More than 10,000

826
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
What

827
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,175
He is now suing the NRA

828
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,831
Pierre had dinner event

829
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,463
Yeah that's bad

830
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,095
When the Democrats and its hole criminal group

831
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,679
Patterson

832
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,703
So his defense

833
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,871
Yeah well it doesn't have anything to do with what the NRA did or didn't do

834
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,919
Alex is super lucky because

835
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:53,503
Letitia James is not an unknown person on his show

836
00:48:54,015 --> 00:49:00,159
She's the New York attorney general who sent a cease-and-desist letter to him and Jim Bakker

837
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:06,559
Weird silver product yeah about that for a couple months now

838
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,399
Thousands of people

839
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
Almost

840
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
Begging her

841
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
Suzuha

842
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,079
There is a sense that I get that he's almost disappointed that it's the NRA and not him

843
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,431
Well as defense of the NRA

844
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,455
Other people commit crimes

845
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,735
So I guess

846
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:29,599
Yeah whatever

847
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,159
I understand

848
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:36,767
Misrepresenting a little bit of the chief complaints about

849
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,559
Business management

850
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
Of money

851
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,399
Little bit my little cares

852
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:51,615
Their Twitter account was down for a short. Of time because

853
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,383
Pizza bulshit

854
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,199
Twitter suspends Trump

855
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:03,903
Almost

856
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Covid-19

857
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,071
False positive

858
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,703
According to a July 30th report released by The American Academy of Pediatrics

859
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,239
6 using state-level data

860
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:23,871
330 1982 children a tested positive for covid-19

861
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,431
Approximately 8.8% of total

862
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,575
2669 of them required hospitalization and at that point 86 children

863
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,599
Been killed due to the virus

864
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:38,975
These numbers don't mean anything to Alex you can just say they were secretly all in car accidents

865
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,559
It is a lower rate of general population

866
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:49,215
That's just say that you're totally fine with these children dying

867
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:52,287
Being hospitalized

868
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,359
Who may be in higher-risk categories

869
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,431
Now Alex says no children died

870
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:01,247
And the only evidence

871
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,807
Massachusetts data

872
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:07,391
No what no children

873
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,231
So there's a zero there any keeps Massachusetts

874
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Okay

875
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
What about Arizona

876
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,815
Arizona

877
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,863
Not zero they don't keep numbers

878
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,887
Is it

879
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:23,519
Report

880
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:27,103
Except for the ones in Massachusetts Pacific

881
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,551
Arizona

882
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,343
Dicey

883
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,367
This is some b*******

884
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:43,999
Campaign

885
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:44,767
Saying goodbye

886
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,559
Kids are basically immune

887
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:50,655
And so they lock the account

888
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,007
I mean I don't know I don't I don't see that as being

889
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,287
Some kind of a horrible

890
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,567
Abusive Twitter

891
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,615
Authorities are

892
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,639
Knauer's

893
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,687
Yep Alex says

894
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
What's up

895
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:13,695
I know that you are averse to Alex saying I've got a big juicy

896
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:20,095
Appreciate

897
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,119
No

898
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
Give me a little

899
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,959
Caviar caviar

900
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:31,615
Saban

901
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
It's a mistake

902
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,247
Weather going to cut it

903
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527
Massive

904
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,319
49000

905
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,159
Sabattus rod

906
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,471
Someone being like this

907
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:04,895
This isn't as good or as luxurious

908
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663
One caveat

909
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:11,551
It's from Derek

910
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,367
So yeah I would say that the caviar caveat

911
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,951
Almost be like hey this sounds good

912
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:24,607
So in that sense Alex's correct

913
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:33,055
Oversight

914
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,079
Covid-19

915
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:39,199
Theoretically recovered and then died encountered it covid-19 mortality number

916
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:46,111
No one's entirely sure how many of these erroneous death so I could be in the pile but the estimates that I saw being thrown around appear to be

917
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,903
Around 1,000 to 4000

918
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Which represents

919
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,487
Between 3 to 10% of the death toll

920
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,815
This is an important issue to iron out because the more precise and

921
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,375
Specific data is the more useful it is

922
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,911
For helping people making form

923
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,679
Decision

924
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,727
I saw this

925
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:08,127
Disgusted like this was a fine counting that they had initially

926
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,151
His pass

927
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:12,223
We are at a point where there's just an oversight

928
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
Statistics

929
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,087
It turns out that there's a big gap in it

930
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,623
Anyway this was

931
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:22,463
Miss you specifically Public Health England

932
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,303
Which reflected Edisto over-40 1749

933
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
How many Massachusetts

934
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
0

935
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:31,167
From an article about this in the Daily Mail

936
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,959
The office of national statistics

937
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,263
6 which is not effective

938
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,639
Has confirmed at least 50 1596 people have died in England and Wales

939
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,431
Up to July 24th

940
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,479
The office of national statistics

941
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,527
6 is far more reputable source

942
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,087
Tire number

943
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,671
I do not use the same faulty counted Methodist Public Health England

944
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:57,791
I was much of a big

945
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,071
For Alex

946
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,911
Also there's no reason to extrapolate this outside

947
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,959
Statistics released by public health in

948
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,263
Like this has no bearing on anything

949
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,055
Outside

950
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,847
Implicate

951
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,871
U.s. number

952
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,919
It doesn't implicate

953
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:17,247
Yeah it's it's an unfair bad faith

954
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,295
Absolutely

955
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,111
So

956
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:29,279
What's more complaints about Letitia James General and into some

957
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,839
What is going on

958
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,679
Coronavirus restrictions killing 10,000 children

959
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
Vermont

960
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,567
Millions more

961
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,663
That's okay

962
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,551
So she can do whatever she wants

963
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
That's why

964
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,119
Okay

965
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,959
Did we

966
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:12,799
Has it always been this way that the blood is

967
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:16,895
Like the heart J do like he says black is not

968
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,431
Black he said

969
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,455
Oh she's

970
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,783
Like it was like the black the blood

971
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,319
Is it a hard blow

972
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,879
I don't do it with Alex

973
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:33,535
Maybe you know there's a thing there and there's a subtext that really means

974
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,583
The 60s

975
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,447
I'd be tossing

976
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:45,311
Yeah yeah or is it later on today

977
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:54,271
You know the numbers of people who are entering start

978
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:02,463
Yes

979
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,231
Un

980
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,535
You know what they're putting that information out for

981
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,559
Courage

982
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,583
People to donate

983
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,423
To help people in these circumstances

984
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,519
Like Alex's solution

985
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:21,919
Everyone go back to work or whatever

986
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,759
Not her

987
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:30,879
It is Alex cares about this at all this is an acute problem

988
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,159
Be solved by

989
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,463
Everyone go back to work and things will work out

990
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:37,791
You need to be if you taking this seriously

991
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,815
Trying to

992
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,351
Solicit donations

993
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119

Developing world food programs

995
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,959
You should be

996
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,311
You know

997
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,615
Resources the People Gas

999
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,991
Dumb two-faced bunny to the two people

1000
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,039
He doesn't care

1001
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,319
He in the right

1002
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,111
Are obsessed with

1003
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,159
Whining about problems

1004
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,439
That they are actively

1005
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,463
Trying to subvert

1006
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,231
Solutions

1007
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:12,351
Like that's what they want to do. Maybe I'll just go do this

1008
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,423
Oh you thinking about that what about this well okay

1009
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:21,823
How do you solve this if you want to worry about me

1010
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,943
Favorite politician of all time wanted to get rid of all foreign aid

1011
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,551
Released an ad about Joe Biden

1012
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,951
Not even

1013
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:41,023
There was a part there's a picture of him

1014
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,327
Microphone

1015
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,751
His face

1016
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,567
There's also a

1017
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,591
He's alone

1018
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:57,407
Him sitting on the ground

1019
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:03,807
And like a basement next to a chair out of the picture

1020
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:11,487
That is cartoonish evil that is really funny

1021
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:19,679
Most people

1022
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
At that point

1023
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:27,359
Just like CGI in some hair and be like see he's lying

1024
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:30,943
I'm a gunsmith

1025
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,759
Pointing out every time there are people trying to get elected

1026
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:38,111
Never get anything done

1027
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,159
It's probably about time for America

1028
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,255
Decides

1029
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
Just going to lie about

1030
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,095
Now this lying app

1031
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,143
Joe Biden

1032
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,727
Social distancing

1033
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:02,431
He said bigger rallies in that skill

1034
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,711
Hiding

1035
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,743
Yeah

1036
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:19,071
Basically is Gary a lot of water in that way

1037
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:24,447
Trump

1038
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,471
Basically

1039
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:32,383
Which is the picture of Biden in the basement

1040
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,711
Is a living room

1041
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:38,271
He's trying to complete that

1042
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:42,111
The social distance rally where there weren't that many people there by.

1043
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,671
Yeah it's so you just lying about it

1044
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,695
It is amazing

1045
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,023
Skip back to being racist about

1046
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,327
Black women in electric

1047
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,863
Position

1048
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,887
What's matter

1049
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,007
George Soros

1050
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,543
He's not even an American

1051
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,103
He's a dude rounded up his fellow Jews

1052
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
Set them off to

1053
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,199
That was the happiest time is life

1054
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,247
Exhilarating

1055
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,783
Cold

1056
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:14,879
Probably

1057
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,183
That on Fox News

1058
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:24,095
Letitia James

1059
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,167
All these all these crazy people

1060
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,959
Lightfoot

1061
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,519
Gordon

1062
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,615
Why is it all black women

1063
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,639
Soros is running

1064
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,455
Cuz then you can't attack them

1065
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
I feel like

1066
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,503
Wow

1067
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:48,671
You can't do the thing that I've spent the last

1068
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,951
Hour-and-a-half

1069
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,631
This is based on faulty premise

1070
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,423
It's like a lot of people have

1071
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,727
Pretty harsh criticism about Lori Lightfoot

1072
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:05,823
Remember Jhene Aiko

1073
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:16,063
Alex has this perception that invalidate

1074
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,367
Any black person in leadership position

1075
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,647
Because it's like

1076
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:23,999
Soros installed

1077
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,559
Meanwhile I think there's a lot of people were pretty

1078
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095
Solid living evidence

1079
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,375
You can have

1080
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,703
Complaints and criticisms about

1081
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:37,823
Elected leaders regardless

1082
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,359
Just that is race

1083
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,127
List of Alex

1084
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,663
And also silly

1085
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,943
This is a silly show

1086
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:49,343
This is a child is a racist f****** child just trying to get into a televangelist

1087
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,367
Yeah

1088
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
Nonsense

1089
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,927
Incredibly violent

1090
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
Scrap yeah

1091
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
Because

1092
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,583
I want to say that I

1093
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,607
Google find common ground

1094
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:01,631
On something

1095
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,679
I would never work with him on any

1096
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,727
Can find a point of agreement

1097
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,287
Maybe

1098
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:12,383
Explain everything is over

1099
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,199
I was trying to go to bed early last night

1100
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,503
Clock

1101
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,063
Trouble sleeping

1102
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:25,183
I should just stop there be like he and I can find, and bring you guys have trouble sleeping

1103
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:31,327
Because I knew when I saw the headline what was her saying I read it and others

1104
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,191
Roll out

1105
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,847
Where they are now

1106
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,431
We will wear mask

1107
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:49,247
Home

1108
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,551

Coronavirus

1116
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:12,799
Call Total mental illness

1117
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:20,991
Talk about a recent episode

Verifiable right

1122
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,119
Cuz it's stupid and meaningless

1123
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:42,495
But I want to get this Olive Branch to Alex

1124
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,543
I would say that if

1125
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
Everybody

1126
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,615
Regardless of political party

1127
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
Wanted to make

Coding like an Amazon Alexa at your home

Yeah yeah

Anython

1135

Mandatory

1136
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:12,703
Like a cell phone I understand

1137
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,983
There's a lot of

1138
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,031
Privacy issues that I told her pretty

1139
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,055
Messed up

1140
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,103
Have to have a cell phone

1141
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,407
It makes things more convenient

1142
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,687
To make a choice

1143
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,991
The same thing is true about these household assistant

1144
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:31,647
There are some concerns that they're listening advertisements

1145
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:34,719
Because of it you make a choice whether or not you want to have

1146
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:37,791
Your house right with the convenience that they offer

1147
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,095
If it pivoted to

1148
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:43,679
By law you have to have one of these in your house

1149
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:47,007
I would I would say that vine

1150
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:55,967
I will say there's only one thing that I would allow the government

1151
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,015
Sweatpants should be out

1152
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:05,183
Okay Publix

1153
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:11,583
No I mean all sweatpants because we came out

1154
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:21,311
The Temptation is too strong

1155
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:27,199
I believe I believe in Liberty to the point where I believe that human should ever write

1156
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,479
To choose whether or not

1157
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:33,087
They can be trusted to wear sweats

1158
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,391
Control yourself

1159
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,207
Responsible sweatpants

1160
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:44,607
20% of people don't even think of it is real

1161
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,399
Ministration of sweatpants

1162
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,847
But you know if you register your sweatpants are just going to leave the confiscation

1163
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:59,455
True

1164
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,271
Almost as an intellectual exercise.

1165
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:06,111
To be like I should be super charitable to Alex and be like

1166
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,951
Empty potential world where are Amazon Alexa's or

1167
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
You know like

1168
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,535
Such a household robot

1169
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:26,335
Are you saying that this incredible infinite power might be abused

1170
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:31,455
Yeah you have to go to in order to

1171
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479
Client agreed

1172
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:38,879
So Alex is begging

1173
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,671
4 coverage

1174
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,279
Is that

1175
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,351
He's just basically repeating things

1176
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:51,679
The Jesse Lee Peterson said on the show when he was a guest

1177
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:55,007
Rap about the leaders of black lives matter

1178
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:55,775
He's calling them

1179
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,799
Lesbian

1180
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,615
Which is exactly what Jesse said

1181
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
Mirroring

1182
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,919
The previous day's gas

1183
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:07,039
Negative articles about me please

1184
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,159
Heard about your black women

1185
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,999
Lesbian

1186
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:27,263
Themselves and hate Men in Black

1187
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,735
Please

1188
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,759
Yeah no kidding

1189
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:41,855
Use hear the music

1190
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:47,743
To me that it's just desperate begging for attention is like

1191
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,047
You can't even commit to being as homophobic

1192
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:50,815
Is Jessie

1193
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:55,167
Like Jesse Lee Peterson hates gay people stuff like

1194
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,215
Hey

1195
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:01,567
Is black lives matter is run by big fat black lesbian

1196
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:07,967
He will follow that up with being like and they're going to hell yeah

1197
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:12,063
To be like a social libertarian type or whatever whatever

1198
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,623
Because I'm a very deep level Alex knows

1199
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,391
Those position

1200
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,927
Kids are not defensible

1201
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,207
For himself

1202
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:20,767
But he has

1203
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,607
Do you hear that

1204
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:29,983
Please write about me please I'll say offensive things

1205
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:35,359
This is the problem now and the reason why

1206
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:39,967
Wow I do think it is very newsworthy the trends analysis taken

1207
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:45,087
Familiarizing his audience with the language

1208
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,903
Boogaloo murder

1209
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,439
No

1210
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,487
Perhaps

1211
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,767
Yeah

1212
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,191
The self

1213
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:08,895
Sacrifice of jowls

1214
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,687
And stuff and also just

1215
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:14,527
Violence is Worthy

1216
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,551
Bring it up

1217
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,343
It also has the effect

1218
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,135
Reinforcing

1219
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,767
Negative attention that Alex

1220
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:31,167
And these platforms that have reach outside of

1221
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,495
Niche market

1222
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,919
Black lives matter leaders in La Kaldi's

1223
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,967
All these black people

1224
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,039
The power Just dare because Soros

1225
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:50,367
Realizes that they can't be

1226
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
Alright

1227
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,975
I'm desperately trying to get someone to call you a racist

1228
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,815
We are here for that we have.

1229
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,119
And there's always

1230
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,143
Leads to ask

1231
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
Escalation there's no way

1232
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:06,239
You know you you say the same s*** for long enough

1233
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,591
You got to what's the next

1234
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,151
Things that I can go yeah

1235
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,687
It has to be an escalation

1236
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:21,343
For something so far out of my neighbors

1237
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,159
No one's going to resist

1238
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:30,559
Chatterbait

1239
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,119
Is self-destructive

1240
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,679
This is self-destructive to

1241
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,471
Parsley because what you're describing

1242
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,007
Whenever

1243
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,287
It's kind of like

1244
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,871
Structuring a comedy show with your headliner first

1245
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,967
Wrestling show in the first

1246
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:56,415
Because then what is going to happen

1247
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,207
You know and

1248
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:01,279
If in the opening acts your

1249
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,559
Murder

1250
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:06,911
Is the only thing

1251
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,935
Attention now

1252
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:11,007
Is talk of murder in kamikaze.

1253
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,055
Good luck with me

1254
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:18,943
Headline his audience for 25 years in the

1255
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,223
It's going to wind up with him

1256
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,527
Flaming it out in auto-erotic

1257
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,295
Asphyxiation

1258
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,855
That's the only way this goes store

1259
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:31,743
Call Ray story

1260
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,511
It just makes it

1261
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:35,583
Very clear that he does not care what you doing

1262
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,863
Because he supports

1263
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,631
D'Angelo

1264
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,983
A was paid $5 a year he wasn't

1265
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,847
They were flying around the country

1266
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,615
You can

1267
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:52,223
You got 10 people flying it's about the same price to get a little private jet commercial

1268
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,015
Is it

1269
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,111
Results

1270
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:03,231
The second America

1271
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:05,791
Justify the means

1272
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:08,095
It's kind of more like that

1273
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,631
Which is crazy

1274
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,423
Which is crazy to me

1275
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,447
Why because

1276
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,983
Wouldn't you be serious

1277
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,543
These people are giving God

1278
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,591
Advocacy a bad man I would be

1279
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:23,967
Curious not just not least of which because if I'm donating money to them to find out that it

1280
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:25,247
It's not going to

1281
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:31,647
Bring the Second Amendment and said going towards him having a lavish bulshit likes

1282
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,439
Added him

1283
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,255
The guy but you're

1284
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
You f*****

1285
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,047
Get the f*** out

1286
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,935
Because then everybody

1287
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,239
Held captive

1288
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,007
By Griffin

1289
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,543
And they like

1290
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,871
Profitable

1291
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,175
I know but Zachary bro

1292
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:54,943
Walmer

1293
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:59,807
So I think Alex is also taking this a little bit personal

1294
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:03,903
Because so much of his identity is wrapped up in Gunstock

1295
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,951
And then also

1296
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,231
Kind of looks like a dick

1297
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:10,559
Because he was against the NRA for a really long time

1298
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:15,167
For the preservation of gun ownership

1299
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:17,727
Like either real Outlets

1300
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:22,079
It's some point you started to change because I get an RA is good now

1301
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:24,383
Ted Nugent on the board and TED talks to me

1302
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,919
Oliver North

1303
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,199
Was it that

1304
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,759
Obit

1305
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,039
How to change

1306
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,879
Pro-nra

1307
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,903
When he could have just

1308
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,999
I like the harder stuff

1309
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,535
He went mainstream

1310
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,559
He's sold out cuz he

1311
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,839
He's friends with Ted Nugent

1312
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,399
And now he's going to like having to be like

1313
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:52,799
Career Alex is just like whatever it was that I said 10 years ago the opposite

1314
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,591
That is true now and I have no reason

1315
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,919
He's kind of like a guy who had a stock

1316
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,711
That was doing s***

1317
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,575
You sold it

1318
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:10,975
Before would have a giant market place right now

1319
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:20,703
Project this is this fantasy of these m************ everybody

1320
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:25,823
For Trump you idiot

1321
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:26,847
Voice

1322
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,407
On the right but also like

1323
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,967
Hey this is too much

1324
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:35,039
Yeah

1325
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,319
If you would have just

1326
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,879
Like kept with the

1327
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,927
F****** assholes

1328
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:46,559
Got no no politician should ever be trusted yet left and right is a lie

1329
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,607
He'd be cleaning up yet

1330
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,655
In the any disaffect

1331
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,679
Did community

1332
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:55,263
It's the same thing that is easy

1333
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,311
You're at the place now where you're like

1334
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,615
Nothing

1335
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:04,479
Other than she's the wife of trump but

1336
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
Trump himself

1337
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:12,671
You don't have it you're he's defenseless to this type of b*******

1338
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,231
To be fair

1339
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,279
Kind of getting the timeline a little out of order

1340
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,351
Like brought to this

1341
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,119
If you hadn't

1342
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
Already

1343
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:26,495
Normalized all of Trumps.

1344
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,311
I'm just saying that it's part of the same magical thinking

1345
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:34,431
Omnicef is just an escalation of the exact same thought process the escalation

1346
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,991
Possibly only necessitated by

1347
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:42,623
Kind of business to begin with

1348
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,439
It requires that isolation

1349
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:49,791
And if you never Escalade you just keep it in like Ron Paul could have saved us

1350
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:50,815
Like

1351
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,351
Great

1352
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,887
Great what an idiot

1353
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,543
Conspiracy about this

1354
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,823
That is not good

1355
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,127
10 million dollars

1356
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,735
I almost defeated the globalist

1357
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,015
Italian

1358
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:15,135
We're going to lose everything if we don't start word-of-mouth

1359
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,607
I am not rolling over

1360
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,143
Like being an RA

1361
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,167
Yeah

1362
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,727
Say when they

1363
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,079
My lawyers have said is okay

1364
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,759
Operation

1365
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,343
Notice when they did that

1366
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,135
Brought

1367
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:53,535
Little bloodthirsty monster Nazi collaborator

1368
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,583
Minion

1369
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,351
Collaborator

1370
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:58,911
Vicious

1371
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:04,287
First-time callers on this subject

1372
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:08,127
Got the Gauls Alex's saying

1373
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:14,527
Is that the NRA TV because they were trying to placate Letitia James

1374
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,575
And I don't I don't

1375
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,599
I know about this

1376
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,903
Can we hold big dinners for people

1377
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,975
Can we ride around on private James

1378
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:27,071
How about the embezzlement

1379
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:33,727
Transferring money from the charity to my personal account without

1380
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:38,079
To get rid of Dana Loesch is show

1381
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:44,479
Placate the globalist really wash

1382
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:47,039
Nashotah Ono

1383
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:51,391
It's all I hope you learn

1384
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,719
So I just want

1385
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,487
To get sued

1386
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,023
Is he

1387
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:03,167
Laundering money for the NRA TV

1388
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,983
That's money from the NRA

1389
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,799
What is the TV network

1390
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,847
TV network

1391
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,895
TV net worth

1392
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,039
Google

1393
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,575
They're Big Stan

1394
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,583
50

1395
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,351
DNC

1396
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,375
Funded lawsuit

1397
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,679
And investigations against. Including Letitia James

1398
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,591
What am I going to talk about the embezzlement

1399
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,431
The murderer

1400
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:01,791
Cut off by the brake there

1401
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,839
I just feel like that

1402
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,935
I interpret that

1403
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:10,751
Alex to talk about

1404
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:14,336
And that's his

1405
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,128
Accuse a lawyer of

1406
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:20,992
Murder podcast

1407
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,528
No I didn't do that

1408
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:25,344
Save the New York attorney general

1409
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,392
Josef Mengele

1410
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:33,280
The people and directly make accusations of murder because reaction

1411
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,632
That's what I hear anyway because all the stuff

1412
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,400
Esoro

1413
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,448
DMC back lawsuit

1414
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
Bulshit

1415
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:44,544
I feel like someone gave him some advice there was like

1416
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,312
Coolatta

1417
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,336
That's because this

1418
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:49,664
This is where there's a line that you could actually get in trouble today

1419
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:54,272
She know about the law like a you-know-what Soros

1420
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,552
She's probably too busy

1421
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,368
Doesn't want to get in the mud with you Letitia James

1422
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,392
Has given you a seat

1423
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:01,952
Desist letter about your IRA

1424
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,768
There might be some kind of an action.

1425
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,048
Could be taken against you

1426
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:08,352
Yeah she has indicated

1427
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,376
A willingness

1428
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,144
The tangle

1429
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:13,728
And I think Alex wants to

1430
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:14,496
That sounds about

1431
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:21,152
Because I think I was already

1432
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,456
Take this ship National

1433
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:26,784
Alex has some advice

1434
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,552
The NRA

1435
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,856
Run ads about

1436
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,904
Letitia James

1437
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,720
If they roll over

1438
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,024
I need to go

1439
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:42,656
Not going to do that I think they should do

1440
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:51,104
Standard right-wing advice there is a conversation

1441
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,128
About 6

1442
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:56,992
So make the conversation about why

1443
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,296
F****** address the things the conversation

1444
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:05,696
No conversation

1445
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:09,792
She has murdered basic human decency

1446
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:16,192
By daring to attack literally NRA

1447
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:18,240
She murdered everyone

1448
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,544
So Alex at the end of this episode

1449
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,080
For the third hour

1450
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,616
The Gaston

1451
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,944
Matt Bracken

1452
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,224
Enemies

1453
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,760
Takes over quick

1454
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:32,576
Gaston for the 3rd hour

1455
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,368
Can blew me away

1456
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,376
What

1457
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,656
I got my own money

1458
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,216
You have a show

1459
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,736
Boston Fish

1460
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,296
I don't want to put

1461
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,856
This is the big one

1462
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:09,184
Give a f*** about you catching up with an old buddy

1463
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:15,840
This isn't like Marin sitting in the the garage shooting the s*** with commentary

1464
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,888
Haven't seen you in awhile just thought I'd put

1465
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,912
You on TV

1466
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:19,936
Alex

1467
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:25,568
I kind of say this is embarrassing is not the big leagues anymore than

1468
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:29,408
This is not the big league fight like

1469
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,456
I got

1470
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:33,248
Big Time cast

1471
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
Old friend

1472
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,368
Yeah

1473
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,416
He's also a pastor

1474
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,000
So Alex gets some calls

1475
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:46,304
For getting to this a friend of his

1476
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,608
Barrel shorthand

1477
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,496
This caller seems to not understand what the issue is with the NRA situation

1478
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,336
Make sense wouldn't get it

1479
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,872
Charlie on business

1480
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:00,896
How can I

1481
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,688
Privately owned business

1482
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,736
All your flying around on

1483
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:09,088
Tax exempt

1484
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:14,720
Political views and your gas Second Amendment

1485
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,256
That's not the problem

1486
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,536
Caller is

1487
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,560
Expressing like

1488
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:20,096
The

1489
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,192
Probably

1490
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,240
Privately owned company

1491
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:30,080
Right now they don't have to pay taxes because they're too private

1492
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:35,968
You might not understand the problem

1493
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,784
I'm first of all educating his audience about the issues

1494
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,832
About making them

1495
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,648
Recognize when they don't understand something baby

1496
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,416
You should look into it

1497
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,440
Why

1498
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:47,488
Is the New York attorney general

1499
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,816
That's a question that I didn't

1500
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,144
The answer is

1501
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:54,912
Right right

1502
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:59,008
Did the answer of like everything that attacks

1503
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,824
Someone who believes the same stuff is us is false

1504
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,104
Everything is false

1505
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:06,176
Because that answer is so deeply embedded

1506
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,456
I guess it doesn't matter

1507
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:10,528
Everybody has every car block

1508
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,552
Ignore

1509
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,576
Everything

1510
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,112
Has anybody on the right

1511
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:14,880
Ever done it

1512
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:20,000
No has anybody on the left

1513
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:25,888
Is does this mean that whatever it is that the right does to the left

1514
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,912
It is just

1515
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,680
Defied

1516
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:32,288
In order to stop them from doing the thing that doesn't work

1517
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,336
So

1518
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:37,408
John Rex

1519
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,944
I don't know

1520
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,832
It turns out I didn't know that

1521
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,368
Rex

1522
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,904
Is not a fan

1523
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,184
Of Donald Trump

1524
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:52,000
He got to go out and vote on November 4th

1525
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,840
Post midterm post 2018

1526
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:03,776
Right right quick from everything I understand I don't know when his birthday is

1527
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:07,616
Before November

1528
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,688
I don't know

1529
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
Anyway

1530
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,528
Despise Trump

1531
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,320
How much does much is lapis do

1532
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:19,136
Did this is me this is my coming-out story

1533
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:21,184
To you about my opinions of trump

1534
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,976
In 2016

1535
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,000
I worship

1536
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:24,768
The guy

1537
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:29,376
I thought you was going to just come in and win Forest wall things he promised

1538
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,424
I need to trade at son about 95

1539
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,728
5% of things that he said

1540
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,080
Biggest supporters always biggest

1541
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,640
Everyone got him elected in 2016

1542
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,688
Populist movement

1543
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,968
That put him in office

1544
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:49,088
Do you want those people just get smacked aside so we could be friends with the bigwigs

1545
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:54,720
Stop getting

1546
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,744
Right you're boring me

1547
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,792
We got to give him one more chance

1548
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,192
Option

1549
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:07,008
Wow

1550
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,616
What a Sad lesser of two evils argument that's not good

1551
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:16,992
Develop political position

1552
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:23,648
Adored Trump in the same way that you just

1553
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,952
Kind of repeating alecsi stuff now

1554
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:26,720
Maybe that's

1555
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,792
What's going on I don't really respect this as a unique position

1556
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,352
Do you know who

1557
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,120
He sounds

1558
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,144
Who's that

1559
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,424
Owen Shroyer

1560
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,728
He does not sound like Alex Jones

1561
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:42,080
Have you got the same bolt pattern

1562
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:45,664
His age I probably be more likely to watch

1563
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,432
War room

1564
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:49,760
I would hang out myself

1565
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:54,368
Absolutely

1566
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:01,792
I'm going to say that right now

1567
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,632
Attorney General James

1568
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,912

01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,496
This is

1571
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,776
Silly

1572
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,056
First of all because

1573
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
Who cares

1574
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,616
Second because

1575
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:20,736
Hey hey you're trying to sell

1576
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:23,040

There were people at large block

1586
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:08,352
Obama built a f****** chain restaurants in the swamps of evil

1587
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:11,424

Feel any of this

1601
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,016
You're just trying to make your dad proud

1602
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:01,856
Shut the f****** your pastor who shot heroin into eyeball

1603

1604
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,160
Story about

That's so

1609
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,120
Sad

1610
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:16,192

1611
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:19,008

Anyway

1613
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
No

1614
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,104
There's a little bit more Rec

1615
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:23,872
It's making his ark

1616
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:25,152
Lesser of two evils

1617
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,176
Trump

1618
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,712
Lied to us

1619
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:30,016
He may have betrayed us on a lot of things

1620
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,576
I think honestly in a second term

1621
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,368
He can turn around

1622
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,696
He doesn't have to listen

1623
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,512
If he decides

1624
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:44,096

1698
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:29,888
Because of significant

1699
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:33,216
All together to where we are today

1700
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:35,776
He has Alex

1701
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:41,408
He has Alex's old bullhorn original I don't know which one is which

1702
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,688
Or anything

1703
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:45,248
Is this is one that

1704
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:51,392
That is the one that Alex

1705
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:54,208
This guy bought

1706
01:34:54,464 --> 01:35:00,608
God dammit auctioning off

1707
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,656
Right

1708
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:05,216
I could I remember the Alex

1709
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:06,240
Oxygen

1710
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:10,080
Yeah

1711
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:12,384
Is it it didn't work because it got

1712
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:21,088
Piece of History

1713
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:24,928
I mean unless there are multiple pressures that have been

1714
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:25,696
Dammit

1715
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:33,376
I don't know man do you think

1716
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,912
70 Rainey crashes around

1717
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,448
And if he wants to give them to the

1718
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:40,032
Like if he's trying to date a woman he cuts the car and he's like

1719
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,336
Tyranny Crusher one baby

1720
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:46,176
I think there's two possibilities

1721
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,712
Baked auctioning It Off

1722
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:51,040
Possible and then gave it to his old

1723
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:54,112
Barrel run this body

1724
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,416
Darrell rundus has tyranny crush your money

1725
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:01,024
He seems like the kind of guy who might have bought Tirico

1726
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:06,912
And I turns out

1727
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,192
Is a zealot

1728
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:10,240
Olivia gold

1729
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,520
I'd rather you be hot or cold

1730
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,288
Call Jesus

1731
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,336
Lazy Christian

1732
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,384
Literally sick to his stomach

1733
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,664
I'm here today

1734
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,968
What kind of a cold action account

1735
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,992
The challenge

1736
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,528
Michaela

1737
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,832
To get up and to get out and just

1738
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:27,136
Freedom n okay

1739
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:31,488
Covid-19

1740
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:35,072
And we're asking all these other things

1741
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,400
Hope you're really sound like

1742
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:44,288
You should be hot statistically it's all alive put up against the rest of them

1743
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:47,104
The world

1744
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:49,152
So this guy

1745
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:53,760
If you are

1746
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,208
Every joke

1747
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:03,232
About

1748
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,280
Seventy-two virgins

1749
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:11,680
Whatever you complained immediately following 9/11 of life

1750
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:14,240
Take it all f****** backyard

1751
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:17,824
Seventy-two virgins loving Christian b******* a******

1752
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:20,384
F*** you it's okay to die

1753
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:23,200
With God I mean if it's

1754
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:25,248
If it's a personal decision

1755
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,064
I don't know how much I'm going to

1756
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:31,648
It's the same problem

1757
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:38,048
That you had with like let's say a terrorist attack other people

1758
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,072
Not an issue

1759
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:39,840
You getting

1760
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:47,520
Sure I can spread the disease but I personally don't want to wear a mask

1761
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,288
So it's

1762
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:53,408
It's cuz I'm right with God so if I even if I do die

1763
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,968
Sure baby I'm spreading around to a few

1764
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,552
It's fallacious

1765
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:05,952
Because his argument is that the worst thing that can happen

1766
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:10,048
Worst thing that can happen is hundreds of thousands of people could die

1767
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:14,912
The worst thing that can happen as a result of you not consider yourself a part of an intricate

1768
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,448
System of interconnect

1769
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,216
Did people

1770
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:22,592
Is that you end up through your negligence or your combative miss or whatever

1771
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,360
You're like

1772
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:26,944
Blase

1773
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:32,064
You could kill people around you and you can you could be partially responsible for

1774
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,600
The death of your loved one

1775
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,392
Strangers

1776
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:37,184
All sorts of things

1777
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,976
There's so much worse than just

1778
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,000
You dying

1779
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:40,768
Yes

1780
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:43,328
Like this is tunnelvisions stuff

1781
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,864
It's predicated on

1782
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,448
Just religious messaging and it have I couldn't scary

1783
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:51,008
I don't understand how people don't get through this

1784
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,032
Concept of like

1785
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:53,312
Look I can't

1786
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,336
Scroll

1787
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,104
Other people

1788
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:57,664
Possible

1789
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:00,736
You know I can get the I can get the virus

1790
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:06,112
I'm a human being I can wear a mask I can do all of this stuff but

1791
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:07,648
Life is fucken unpredictable

1792
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:11,744
The only problem though is

1793
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,024
If I do know that

1794
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,560
In fact

1795
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,096
And I don't

1796
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,376
Do and I don't

1797
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:19,424
Quarantine and I don't do anything and

1798
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,192
And I spread it

1799
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:24,800
Directly to only one person or 100 people and one of them dies

1800
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:27,104
I don't see any possible way that I'm not

1801
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:27,872
Personally responsible

1802
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:31,200
Do you know what I'm saying

1803
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,808
Abilities very murky

1804
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:41,952
Put it but I had one choice to to not go outside you know

1805
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:44,768
The choice you have

1806
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,072
A little bit of culpability

1807
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:50,144
Going to be how you can live with that on your conscience

1808
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,936
Yeah yeah

1809
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:52,960
Doesn't care

1810
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,728
Don't give a s***

1811
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:55,008
And I want to say this

1812
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:55,776
Who the f***

1813
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,336
Is Darryl Ruckus

1814
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:04,736
Bastard in America's Best Inn

1815
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:09,600
Conversation

1816
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:10,624
Well

1817
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,416
There is one claim to saying that

1818
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,440
But he has

1819
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,120
Dot-com

1820
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,104
We could stop

1821
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:31,872
The Antichrist

1822
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,224
That's what the Bible says

1823
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:41,088
Okay Alex

1824
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,648
He also said

1825
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,672
Darrell rundus

1826
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,208
Runs butterflyers

1827
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:49,536
I was like what the f*** is this

1828
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:50,816
Looked into this

1829
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,352
What day is it

1830
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,888
This is a compass

1831
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,656
Right

1832
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,680
And what they do

1833
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:58,496
Okay they sell like

1834
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:01,312
Write a birthday card for somebody

1835
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,848
What's in the shape of butterfly

1836
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:05,152
Enough. Here's where it gets bent

1837
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,432
So it's

1838
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:12,832
There's two parts of it that are connected by a little in the middle

1839
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,624
Axel or whatever

1840
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,648
There's a rubber band

1841
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,696
Right until you spin it

1842
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,720
You twisted

1843
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:21,792
Alright

1844
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:25,632
And then you give someone the book

1845
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:27,936
Fly flies out

1846
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:32,288
That's kind of fun yeah I mean I guess

1847
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:40,736
I guess it I guess that's better than the peanut brittle

1848
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:47,136
What's wrong terrible idea

1849
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:50,464
His nihilistic murder lust is bad

1850
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:57,120
Butterflies is not bad

1851
01:41:57,376 --> 01:42:03,520
Want to buy one I think someone gave me one and it flew out of a book

1852
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,592
What is a novelty

1853
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:11,200
Like it's a novelty product that you could easily see being sold

1854
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:13,248
You know seasonal stores Vic

1855
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:14,272
Business

1856
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:16,064
All the time

1857
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,880
Sure what the f*** ever

1858
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:23,232
Can't imagine this is a billion dollar idea

1859
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,792
I don't know look anyways I think it's great

1860
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,096
Sure

1861
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:33,728
Makes me wonder if maybe this is broker

1862
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,592
Whether it is or not doesn't matter to me because

1863
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,872
The content is atrocious

1864
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,432
And if

1865
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:43,712
Trump doesn't get elected

1866
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:44,736
Emtime

1867
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:47,040
This country

1868
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:47,808
Is on

1869
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:48,576
Tipping Point

1870
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:52,672
If you won't get up wake up wise up rise up right now

1871
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,000
It's just like it was

1872
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:58,304
Belshazzar

1873
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,840
When he called in Daniel

1874
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:02,656
Benny asked him to interpret this riding that was on the wall

1875
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:05,472
It was the hand of God writing on the wall scene

1876
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,496
You

1877
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,288
Sing for me

1878
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,568
You taking all that your

1879
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,848
Father

1880
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,896
And all that he had done for me

1881
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,432
And you squandered it

1882
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:15,712
Do you not worship

1883
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,480
Miles Inn

1884
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,648
The enemies in your gay

1885
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:26,464
He died

1886
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,768
What's going to happen to this country

1887
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,328
We do not get Donald Trump elected again

1888
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,216
It's not

1889
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,752
Who votes that counts

1890
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:39,520
What

1891
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:42,592
No

1892
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,968
501 c 3

1893
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:55,136
Silly never talked really about how stupid goddess

1894
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,928
Like God isn't easy

1895
01:43:57,184 --> 01:44:03,328
That's not how you solve that problem conception of God

1896
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,376
The Bible's conception is a dumb guy

1897
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:07,424
If you're bringing that to the text

1898
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,728
Administrator

1899
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:15,872

F****** over and time s*** going on

1903
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:31,744
This is just like a guy who couldn't get booked on Jim Bakker

1904
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:33,792
But this is just a guy who isn't

1905
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:36,608
Good enough to make the Major Leagues

1906
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,888
Alex's

1907
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:39,936
Apparently another platform

1908
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:42,496
Cookie

1909
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:45,312
End times people who make money off of weird products

1910
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,848
Man go for a Lea

1911
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,128
Just go for a lien

1912
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:55,296
We look we can't deal with Kerry Cassidy anymore maybe we don't need to switch it up maybe Alex needs to switch it up

1913
01:44:55,552 --> 01:45:00,672
Some this is just

1914
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:01,440
Straight up

1915
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:04,512
Violent Jim Bakker

1916
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:05,792
Listen to this s***

1917
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:08,096
I think what's wrong with them

1918
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,376
Christian or even American

1919
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:10,912
Ready to meet their maker

People to do your soul on fire for God you love the Lord know the Buy

1922
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,312
What's the secret

1923
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,152
Read the Bible

1924
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,992
Another believer

1925
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,952
Babe I realized

1926
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:37,536
Meeting your maker to all throughout scripture you see

1927
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:39,328
Jesus gives about

1928
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:44,704
For these days you don't have to be afraid you don't have

1929
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:57,248
You guys talk about

1930
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,344
A little too much

1931
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:05,184
I don't know man

1932
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,976
Really popular these days

1933
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:13,120
Really popular we used to only have like a hundred people

1934
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:15,168
Country

1935
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,728
Yeah this this is this is scary

1936
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,544
And it also gets scarier

1937
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,312
Darrell

1938
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:22,080
Rundus

1939
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:28,224
I'm not sitting on the product product seems fine

1940
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,296
As he reveals more of his

1941
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:33,600
Flood

1942
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:34,624
Band

1943
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:41,024
Alex's talking about like a weird skull like a crocodile

1944
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,608
Jungwirth guy

1945
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,192
You need that studying on this in

1946
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:51,520
Recently recently

1947
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:52,544
Ago

1948
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:03,296
The answer to the

1949
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:06,368
I think you just watch a Jurassic Park

1950
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:07,904
Yeah

1951
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,488
Spencer Lee fine

1952
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,072
Jurassic Park

1953
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,120
So Alex

1954
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:18,400
Here's this and he's like

1955
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:19,424
Look

1956
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:21,984
I don't want invalidated

1957
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,032
I think you're saying but I also really

1958
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:24,800
You don't want to

1959
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:27,616
Commit to younger

1960
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,384
I can't

1961
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:35,808
Christian

1962
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,344
Revising the universe

1963
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,464
That our universe is held in power bi something 5

1964
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:51,168
Stimulation

1965
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:57,568
It's fake

1966
01:47:57,824 --> 01:48:03,968
Lucifer

1967
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:08,320
Warriors

1968
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:16,768
Discern

1969
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:21,632
Do your research

1970
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:24,960
So it was in the news

1971
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:27,008
What just happened

1972
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:32,896
Open the portal in the demons

1973
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:36,480
Snoozapalooza Newsmax

1974
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:43,136
A religion is boiled down to we can open a dimensional portal something evil comes out

1975
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:49,536
Invalidate Hazel religion

1976
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:50,560
You also have

1977
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,864
Turtles are real

1978
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:56,448
No I mean you're saying that they could create a portal there

1979
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:58,496
Collider

1980
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:01,056
Acolyte

1981
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:05,664
How is it that science can open those if your f****** God is weak

1982
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,712
Jordan I don't think you heard me

1983
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:08,480
Summit

1984
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:14,368
It was not in the news

1985
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,696
Something something evil came out in

1986
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,984
Subway Rogers like

1987
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,288
Photo

1988
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:41,504
What does various mean

1989
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,600
Trump president

1990
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:48,928
Wow

1991
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:56,352
Flippant like totally portal

1992
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:57,888
All right look

1993
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:03,520
I can't do the younger of stuff

1994
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:05,568
Yeah I've also

1995
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:07,616
What Alex is saying

1996
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,920
Suggest to me

1997
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:12,480
Then if this is a simulation

1998
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:13,760
His religion

1999
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:16,320
Boobies transform into

2000
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:18,624
Supporting the simulation

2001
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:35,264
I feel like for someone who talks about the Matrix all the time

2002
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:40,384
Okay so is the Bible

2003
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:44,992
Dissimulation

2004
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:46,784
So doesn't that make the

2005
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,552
Bible meaning

2006
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:49,600
Bye

2007
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:00,608
I'm fun to say

2008
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:04,704
Mostly because I like

2009
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,752
Short

2010
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:08,288
The contempt is drippy

2011
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,824
Daryl run

2012
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:14,176
Buddy

2013
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:23,904
His perceived enemies who were also Alex's animes

2014
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,440
Theodore Seaman

2015
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:27,744
Straight

2016
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:30,816
All the power

2017
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:32,352
A politician the elitist

2018
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:36,960
Power now

2019
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:38,496
So therefore they stack

2020
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:40,288
Those children that's why their pedophile

2021
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:44,896
That's why

2022
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,944
Empowered

2023
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:50,272
The saddest YouTube bloodline

2024
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,576
Isn't that what you

2025
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,368
Him today though

2026
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:58,208
Think about it

2027
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:00,000
Very impersonal

2028
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:01,536
Anyway

2029
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:04,096
He believes that there the United States

2030
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:07,680
The mystery of Babylon

2031
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:11,008
Scripture

2032
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,056
He kind of

2033
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,848
Is a little bit of a

2034
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:18,432
Pre-trib Rapture guy

2035
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:21,504
Which should be a gigantic problem

2036
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:25,856
Big 4

2037
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:30,464
Yeah I'm sure he's basically the globe

2038
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,280
Honestly

2039
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:35,584
I believe it mystery Babylon

2040
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:36,864
Is America

2041
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,656
I believe that's what John saw it

2042
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:40,960
Was revealing asteroid

2043
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:42,752
I could be anything you live there

2044
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:47,872
So to speak

2045
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:49,920
Salvation

2046
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,712
Will skate

2047
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:53,760
Tribulation

2048
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:54,784
But the rapper

2049
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:56,832
The time is coming

2050
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,112
One could argue

2051
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:58,880
Nebraska

2052
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:01,184
Tribulation

2053
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,048
Turbos who died for

2054
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:08,608
Lettering price

2055
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:11,680
Linda.

2056
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,008
Leaving world

2057
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:16,544
What series is going to die

2058
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:23,200
Jesus rules for 1000

2059
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,528
When's the raft

2060
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:28,576
Wait

2061
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:33,440
Rivers will be spared whatever this awful thing

2062
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:35,488
Is that what the tribulation is

2063
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:37,024
Tribulation is a

2064
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:39,840
Tribulation is like

2065
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:44,960
It's more like administrative cleaning

2066
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:49,312
Like they're they're downsizing

2067
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:51,104
Right you know it's not the Wrath

2068
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:56,992
It's not you it's me comes when

2069
01:53:57,248 --> 01:54:00,832
The dragons are outer what open

2070
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:09,536
This dude just straight-up like apocalypse is here and diagonal

2071
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,816
This is this is

2072
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:14,144
Like even for Alex this is a bit this is Ludacris

2073
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:15,680
A bit much

2074
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:21,056
Call Will almost all of them eventually you're going to be

2075
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:24,384
Escape

2076
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,920
Most of those people

2077
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:30,016
People get saved a lot of people are going to realize they missed the bus

2078
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:30,784
Literally

2079
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:36,672
7 years ago

2080
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:37,696
Deal with it

2081
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:41,536
Not being able to buy or sell without

2082
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,328
Taking the market

2083
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:44,864
Can have to barter

2084
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:47,936
Stand firm to the end of we saved and then

2085
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,728
Come back and set up

2086
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:53,056
Things will be great again

2087
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:56,128
Some reason

2088
01:54:58,944 --> 01:54:59,968
And he starts

2089
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,040
Gemini

2090
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:04,320
All the rest of those

2091
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:07,904
Byron

2092
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:12,512
Trailed off a little bit

2093
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:25,056
East 1000 years but Dunlap in the mirror

2094
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:28,640
How's the seven years of tribulation

2095
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,736
Nobody visits

2096
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:33,504
Okay

2097
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,040
Going to start up

2098
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:39,392
Alright so let's say I don't want to do this

2099
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:45,792
The Antichrist imagine in this scenario

2100
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:46,560
Brightwell

2101
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:49,632
One last clip

2102
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:54,752
Talking a little bit about his younger years here

2103
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,776
I don't

2104
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:58,080
Make this timeline make sense

2105
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:58,848
Sanctum

2106
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,384
No no

2107
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:02,944
Christian but I was about I was about

2108
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:04,992
17

2109
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,296
Koala koala

2110
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:12,672
Consciously

2111
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:24,448
Evil

2112
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:39,040
Or maybe me

2113
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:41,088
Example

2114
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:46,976
Nitpick

2115
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:54,144
I don't understand

2116
01:56:57,472 --> 01:57:01,568
Exactly

2117
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:07,456
Darrell rundas picker

2118
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:13,856
Is that according to Alex has been aware of all of the

2119
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:15,136
These evil plans

2120
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,160
Globalist

2121
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:18,208
At the young age because of his parents

2122
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:23,584
Skip to this stuff and I

2123
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,120
Conspiracy at 12

2124
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:30,496
And it opened up his buying to how the globalists work

2125
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:31,264
Plans

2126
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:34,592
The men

2127
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:39,200
Apparently he's a subconscious Satanist it's 17

2128
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:42,016
Yeah it's just doesn't make sense his backstory

2129
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:45,344
Too convoluted for for any of it to make sense

2130
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:47,648
Because of just like these dumb

2131
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:51,488
Stories of lichen

2132
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:56,352
I had a big picture but then I saw everything

2133
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:58,912
You can retcon whatever you want. Send

2134
01:57:59,424 --> 01:57:59,936
Bulshit

2135
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:01,216
Susan Powter

2136
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:01,984
Control

2137
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,008
Fox up

2138
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:03,776
Person

2139
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:09,920
Got obsessed with ideas about the New World Order probably started dreaming about it thought it was a mission from God

2140
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:16,832
At least his backstory

2141
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:21,184
He's killing it

2142
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,464
Is made up backstory

2143
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:23,744
And his real backs

2144
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:27,072
Alex is real backstory sucks just as much as made of

2145
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:33,984
NOAA B picking is one thing

2146
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:38,592
Maybe I'm taking it a little bit more personally than I need to go like nip picking is one thing

2147
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:42,176
When I when I hear Alex tell these stories like

2148
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:44,736
IPI did ascend

2149
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:49,088
That you have unresolved issues that are maybe motivated

2150
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:50,880
And it's kind

2151
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,744
You as a human as opposed to a

2152
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,840
Psychic who talks to God all the time like you want you live at

2153
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:01,120
That's not

2154
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:07,264
Assessing analyzing taking Alex's words in context

2155
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:10,592
Nitpicking would be me saying hey Daryl

2156
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:12,384
Really

2157
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:16,992
People who were in the tribulation literally and metaphorically

2158
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:18,528
The boat which means

2159
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:20,064
There's a literal

2160
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:23,904
Right

2161
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:27,744
Newsmax

2162
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:32,864
Yeah

2163
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:33,632
Dick

2164
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,704
Wild Christian

2165
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,496
Zealot

2166
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:44,896
Is apparently friends

2167
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:45,664
Horn

2168
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,712
And selling butterflies

2169
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,808
Suck this noise

2170
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,624
What is stupid

2171
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:59,232
Yeah it's to be a real

2172
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,768
Real weird

2173
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:06,656
. of time

2174
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:07,936
I think we have to

2175
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:09,984
You know I feel I feel like

2176
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,032
It's really a mess

2177
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:15,360
And sometimes you know there's import

2178
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:19,200
Sometimes

2179
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:21,504
Yeah you would

2180
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:26,368
It's hard to comprehend of an episode we do where it's like

2181
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:29,696
Lebanon and Beirut

2182
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:30,464
Right

2183
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,488
Conspiracy

2184
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:37,888
I'm going to make up that it was Israel

2185
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:41,216
Specifically Massachusetts which I assume means of the world

2186
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:42,752
And then also

2187
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,688
Dumb dumb

2188
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:52,992
F****** a******

2189
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:59,392
Alright we're back button

2190
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:10,400
Your area

2191
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:19,360
Holding

2192
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:24,480
Alex
