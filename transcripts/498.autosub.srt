1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan 5 sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge babe I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,280
A little bit about

6
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
Alex Jones

7
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,656
Jordan Jordan

8
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,704
My bright spot

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,056
Continuation from last time the Brite Spot

10
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,040
So much better on the switch

11
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:32,416
Then it was on the Wii U I believe that it was the Wii U that they Pikmin 3 originally came out on

12
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
And you know what the

13
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,768
Controller for the Wii U was that like handheld thing

14
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
The only reason that I've never had a destroyed Mesa

15
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
Was not the best

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Wait

17
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
Experience

18
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,336
Improve, switch

19
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
What's the

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
Lock on

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,432
Throw Pikmin.

22
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
It's better

23
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
It's much better I enjoy it

24
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Good love it

25
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
Little Pikmin running around

26
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:05,184
There's little alien there's something to do with the yellow one

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,072
Can withstand electricity and they are lighter they have lighter bones or something I guess you can throw them farther

28
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
Way high up in the air

29
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
You can throw a yellow Pikmin

30
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
I get that one of your bones

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
Can't do it now

32
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
All the reservoir a beer

33
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
The blue ones

34
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Can go in water

35
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,848
Okay the red ones are related to fire

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
And

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,944
The blind to see a pattern the black ones are made of Rock

38
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
So they can break

39
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Glass smoking alright

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Like Shack

41
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,088
Text through a backboard

42
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
Ones are really light

43
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
So they can fly

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Sure

45
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
And then the yellow until I there also

46
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
I don't know

47
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,168
There's something about the white ones being able

48
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
Anyway what's your bright spot

49
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,480
There is one thing that Alex and I do share and that is

50
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,272
Blood hence love of Star War

51
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
And

52
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Swell and blood

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,904
However you would like

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
The Mandalorian

55
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
Season 2

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
So I have

57
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:18,400
Return to my Star Wars Universe into memes we're desperately longed to be

58
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,776
Baby Yoda hell yeah baby Yoda

59
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,848
He is not aged today to Baby to Yoda

60
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,480
That sounds great I know maybe there was Bubba

61
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:38,624
OSHA I haven't seen any of that show but I've probably catch up

62
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
What's great at some point

63
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Start with

64
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
Episode 1

65
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Venus

66
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
I'll bet the other list of like

67
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:53,728
It's probably about a mile long by now never watch it

68
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
Space westerns are gray never want Cowboy Bebop written all over it I will never watch it until someone else

69
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
Suggested and then I'll be like it now

70
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,344
Stopwatch app

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,904
Tell me and media.

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
Jordan today we are coming off a bit of a hangover and high from the

73
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,911
Rogan Experience

74
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
Little too much

75
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
To Rogan to experience

76
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,359
Cindy and today what we're doing is we are back in the past looking at November

77
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
4/7 twenty-six

78
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,431
16

79
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
Alright I'm fine

80
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,575
The reason that I decided to do this was

81
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Is that

82
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,719
You know we're recording this and you know there's going to be released on Monday the day before the election

83
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,047
Here in 2020

84
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,143
Okay I think that there is very little value to talk

85
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,471
Going about whatever Alex is talking about

86
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
Real people

87
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,103
We got it sure anything's

88
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
You know he's covering

89
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,967
Oscar every Gator talking about it would kind of be like playing in

90
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
Sensationalism

91
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,831
Even if we're pushing back on it and I just don't I don't have

92
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:19,231
Time or the energy or the stomach for it, and we'll get to what Alex was doing right before the 20th

93
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
20 election

94
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,119
Right after once it's happened and in in that spirit

95
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,935
I don't think that we can have an episode on Wednesday

96
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
That covers

97
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
This stuff

98
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Now well pasa

99
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
No I just think because of the timing of everything and so our Wednesday episode will be on Friday this week or second episode of Beyond Friday week

100
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,967
I believe the plan eventually to go to

101
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:46,367
Maybe I'm not sure we'll see but be at the ability to put out a

102
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
Good middle of the week episode

103
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
How is light

104
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
What could

105
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:55,327
Possibly what could anybody want to listen to us talk about when the election hasn't happened at Alex

106
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
Monday

107
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,959
Day after the most

108
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,751
Day of maybe the world

109
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
We're like

110
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
Alex said this before the election

111
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,735
I'd like to be able to discuss it with a little bit of hindsight in a little bit of information so we will be doing that

112
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,111
And today like I said we're on November 7th we on our last episode from 26

113
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,903
16 we went looked at November 4th

114
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,695
Through 6 2016

115
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:27,071
And Alex was in a weird state where it was all pretty thin it was all

116
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
I hate Hillary

117
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
Hillary sucks

118
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
Despondent

119
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
Yeah yeah

120
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,799
It did not feel to me listening to it that he was planning

121
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
On Trump win

122
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,407
This was not a you did not scream 1776 2.0

123
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,455
Screaming

124
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,295
Trump was going to win I think you could just repeat like just Thomas Jefferson fake quotes for

125
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
4 hours straight

126
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:53,439
I would say that my assessment was that you know he didn't

127
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
The Trump couldn't

128
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
I Was preparing

129
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,071
For the most likely outcome would Hillary win

130
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
Like all of us yes

131
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:06,495
And then he came back

132
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,055
Back in the evening sure cuz they're in the middle of a 50

133
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
Due to our lives broadcast

134
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,199
Forget that business on that Jordan let's take a moment to say thank you

135
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,271
Some folks who signed up for himself

I'm off to meet Emmaus put moss in my mouth thank you so much you are now policy walk

137
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,231

139
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,327
Dan is there a war on Western Civilization

140
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
You are now a policy walk

141
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
I'm a policy wonk

142
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,263
That person requested that I

143
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Thought I had a stroke

144
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,103
Is that very much

145
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,455
Next Erica's hunky husband Ian thank you so much right now if I was wrong

146
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
Husband

147
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,623
Milo B thank you so much

148
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,951
I'm a policy wonk

149
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,079
They're listening everything and the childlike store

150
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,759
Or what you could do is take

151
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
That's generous.

152
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,367
Get it into a lovely little

153
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Bishop

154
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
I put it in a little tiny egg

155
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
Maybe

156
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
If you are fighting a large

157
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,815
Beast you might need the assistance of that generous

158
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
Exit 88 might need to open up

159
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
Open needs to use some Force powers

160
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
And then once you've

161
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,287
Defeated the large Beast with in this metaphor I guess we're going to call selfishness

162
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
Then you've defeated it with the

163
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:52,479
The force powers of generosity and you take that to a local bail fund or charity Dan cuz this is spoiler for a Mandalorian

164
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
Okay

165
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,159
I got a message from Plantiva and

166
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
Enjoy plant update

167
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999
So I wanted to actually use this as an opportunity

168
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Need to give

169
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
AR partials

170
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
In the mailbag

171
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,167
Okay because we're going to talk about this person

172
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
Actual package

173
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,591
Later but I wanted to give a special shout-out to Duncan

174
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
Who along with

175
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
Also sent

176
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
Template

177
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,527
Is that Actuarial tables yeah it's like a template

178
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:31,135
For plant maintenance all you can keep track of like watering pass

179
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
Moisture pH

180
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,255
All kinds of things sure and so I have actually

181
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
Made pages

182
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,703
All of my plants

183
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,799
Bathroom and clock in and clock out

184
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,383
It was a little bit of disorder with how I've been treating the plan

185
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,247

He hit that f****** real hard every time we heard him swear in the past I've always been like this

00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703

00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:01,503
Good stuff here we start on the 7th is in Alex's actual show during the day and he's really

208
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
Excited about the

209
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,135
Well let's hear how I tell you to say that you could cut the

210
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,743
But it's absolutely true

211
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
I've never felt so

212
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Such suspense

213
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
In my life

214
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,655
Quite frankly not even when I was about to see my wife have R4

215
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Child

216
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
That's

217
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
Osun fortunate

218
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
Okay that's

219
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Ugly

220
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:34,015
This 2016-elections boar exciting than Rex's birth of a man

221
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Rex

222
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
Rex he is not your friend

223
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
Don't seem very good

224
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
For Family Values

225
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,231
So in this next whip Alex's talking about the state of election

226
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
As it turns out according to him

227
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
Trump's already won

228
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Hillary win

229
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
She's cheating

230
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,447
Which is exactly what he said now

231
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,519
Yeah she has varied if

232
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,895
Trump has already won the election whether they steal it from him whether he wins in a landslide the other shows

233
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
That's where it's going

234
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Because

235
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,039
He has introduced americanism not globalism

236
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
To the world

237
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
He has

238
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
Brought out 1776

239
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,719
This is a guy saying the Trump is already won

240
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,279
Because of the things that he's brought into

241
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Conversation

242
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,399
This is a moral victory that we are speaking of

243
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
Not a literal

244
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,495
Let's and democracy forever victory that we're about to

245
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
Pictures of rationalization

246
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
It appears

247
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
So at this point

248
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:35,455
Anthony gucciardi comes into Studio

249
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,527
Cuz he doesn't work there anymore and I think he doesn't like Alec

250
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Anymore

251
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Sort of

252
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Health blogger

253
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Maybe

254
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,279
Mini Mike Adams but who actually worked at Infowars

255
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
You talk a lot about like these supplement line

256
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
However

257
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
He's on for a

258
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Them today

259
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,103
Do Infowars now 172 rank 172 in the United States that means of all the billions of websites in the

260
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,711
World you can imagine all of them out there Infowars is 172

261
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,783
The 172nd

262
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
Google is only about twenty percent

263
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Traffic

264
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,231
So just talkin about

265
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:25,631
To be a really important election I think there's somebody named Trump or is it somebody I think it's Bill running again

266
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
Can they do that anyways

267
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
We are

268
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Doing

269
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Great

270
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,055
It sucks it's a lot of that is a lot of that

271
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:38,175
This is pretty much all over the place in this interview part of it I think it's probably because Anthony gucciardi boring a s***

272
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
But

273
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Give It Up

274
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
For the MVP

275
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
Of the season

276
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,343
Season's coming to a close

277
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
2016

278
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:51,999
Was that another was the MVP in 45

279
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
50 okay well

280
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
That's fair that's fair

281
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Everybody knows

282
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,631
But that is retrospectively that is decay

283
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
26

284
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
16 guy

285
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,239
Who will not be the MVP in 2020

286
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
Human Revolution

287
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Against

288
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,615
What's the number one most valuable player isn't Nigel farage

289
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
Is it Donald Trump

290
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
It isn't Alex Jones

291
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
You're getting it

292
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
You showed up first unit the longest

293
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
You brought to the big story

294
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,135
You broke the mainstream media's control

295
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
I don't care Hadley steal it but that doesn't matter

296
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,607
I've looked at it that's even better

297
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
See

298
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,215
Wow tone very different than 20

299
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,031
Oh man let him see what I can profit off that

300
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Yep

301
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
No man yeah

302
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,735
We were also bright-eyed and bushy-tailed back then thinking that Alex

303
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Who's going to lose

304
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,111
He was going to lose

305
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:56,511
This is where you belong and then Alex winds and even he didn't know what to do with yeah it's a real tragedy it's almost

306
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,631
I meant like a Greek

307
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:08,031
Yes it is very much a illiterate illiterate or perspective

308
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,615
It's almost like the be careful what you wish for

309
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
Keep all over the play

310
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,503
Play the album the real polls

311
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,575
As we know which are very different than the poll polls

312
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
The pole that he has

313
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
3rd numbers for Trump

314
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Internal

315
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,023
I don't want it I'll just tell you

316
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
And show him the entire time

317
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
30 points ahead of her in New York

318
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
Here's the problem

319
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,215
Republican

320
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,591
So if you keep like getting about he's a son of New York

321
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
New York

322
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
People

323
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
New York

00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
New York by 8

325
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Large Marge

326

59

327
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
Yeah that was

328
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:59,743
Not good no he did not come close in New York even though he is a Native Son of New York

329
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,095
All of the stuff

330
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
I hated for the things

331
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,679
Not not super popular

332
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
But you know

333
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
Yahoo super popular

334
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
Volkswagen Jetta

335
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
Again we just showed you the Comcast number

336
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
They don't track everything

337
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
Play shows in 107

338
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Show me something of the World Wide Web

339
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,575
Yeah that's okay it's about people understanding

340
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
What jokes they are

341
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,415
Are the big Ivory Towers

342
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
Mexican Kingpin

343
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
Chinese

344
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
The Chinese government

345
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
Announce their buying

346
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
All 6 Hollywood

00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,807
And how do you cook you shut up you know you're covering up for blow up

348
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
Hollywood

00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,439
Major producers

350
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
We're sitting there

351
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,935
Because I'm talk about the Real World MTV for idiots

352
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
When you know about this is when you go to the big dinner

353
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
If when you have dinner with 3-star General

354
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,407
What you literally

00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Conspiracy theorists

356
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
How the real world works

357
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,855
I told you ten years ago for the Chinese in the Muslims be

358
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
Now it's official

359
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Now it's official

360
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
Now it's official

361
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,767
Now it's official.

362
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,935
You can tell Alex's little bit amped up

363
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:48,799
Little bit little bit all over the place all over the place little bit

364
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,615
He's f***** up

365
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,919
Here's what happens in his mind

366
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,503
The globalists go to somebody like Ron Howard and then I got to run

367
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
I know you don't want to do this

368
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,111
But you're going to have to have breakfast with Alex Jones in order to drink

369
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Convince him to help

370
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,951
Let's kill everybody you're going to have to do it he's had

371
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
What's with everybody else

372
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:12,863
It's your turn Ron Howard Grazer had a dinner with him last week

373
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,519
Look I know you don't want to do it but he has dinner with 3-star generals he knows what the only person who won't ask

374
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,335
We talked with Nicolas Cage and that's cuz I don't know

375
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,663
He's too busy in his pyramid that he built or whatever

376
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
Mausoleum for when he

377
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,479
Excuse me

378
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,527
I don't know if you've heard

379
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,927
About this yet but Alex is traffic is way up I heard

380
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,511
We are

381
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Okay

382
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:47,679
This first half-hour the show is almost entirely Alex and Anthony gucciardi bragging about how popular Infowars

383
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
8 bizarre it's

384
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:54,079
Completely out of place for how someone might want to spend their time on the day before the election

385
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Alex sounds

386
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
F****** spawn

387
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
Honestly if I did

388
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,783
Know that this was the day before the election I would have turned this off

389
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
It's so master

390
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:08,159
Praetorian almost nothing to say about the beginning of this show

391
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
It's a desert it's a

392
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
Hazard of contact

393
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Jesus

394
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Ironic

395
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
He was doing so well when Trump

396
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
A campaign

397
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,191
From 172 in the US

398
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
To not allow

399
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
Allowed on the list

400
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,895
Yeah it's pretty it's pretty wild

401
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Swing Flash

402
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
Hey

403
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,527
Alex

404
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
Is pretty

405
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343
Peeved about that people

406
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Hello Miss

407
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
Interpret Trump's comments

408
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
It's about next

409
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
African American

410
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,511
This one's where he wants them all day

411
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
Fiesta in Santa Maria

412
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
And

413
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Alex

414
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
You know Keith Whitley

415
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
Trump because he said thing

416
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,263
The people have misinterpreted I don't think so

417
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Nope

418
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
That's why I have such a

419
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,615
Donald Trump

420
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
You know Mexico

421
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,991
Let America great people who are working people

422
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
In a really good people but I'll tell you

423
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,367
A lot of criminals are coming across and they let him come across

424
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,231
And you know this

425
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,911
Yeah Mexico lot of bad people lot of criminals

426
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
What they do

427
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:36,735
Criminal down here we don't go home

428
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
Where you run

429
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,807
Around the Mexico tradition

430
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
That's not true

431
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,623
I was going to say that's a snow.

432
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
True

433
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,023
Mexico would not have a

434
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,375
The Mexico that allows Rd

435
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,703
It doesn't have

436
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,287
Extradition treaty that we do definitely have

437
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Yeah that's

438
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
I wonder if Alex

439
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,199
For real or if you just lost track of ascend

440
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
I think that

441
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
That's probably

442
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
Yeah I might as well just end

443
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,879
Like that I think it's like I've seen movies little bit like that

444
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,416
Pig11 extradition

445
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,512
Previous listen to Outlaw country

446
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:25,376
All you have to do is get to the Border

447
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,360
Weight is Pancho and Lefty that's all Alex knows about laws

448
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Anyway

449
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
Alex has done

450
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
A straw poll

451
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
Grassroots

452
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:47,904
98% in favor of trump it's a really wild number he's found all the Democrats

453
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Don't like Hillary

454
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,792
Every Democrat

455
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
My mom has friends are Democrats last longer

456
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Democrats

457
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
And I get like this

458
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,520
Play Thrice relations all rest of it in the bank

459
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
These women were just hugging me

460
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
My mom had a

461
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
The only party

462
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,760
Cookout

463
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,904
The same age as Hillary Clinton won up looks like Hillary Clinton

464
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
What up looks like her

465
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,512
I mean if you look like Hillary Clinton that you don't like Hillary Clinton

466
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
Clearly means that

467
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Evereve

468
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:33,472
That's it obviously she's not a popular candidate people who look like her don't even want her that I'm not certain

469
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,640
No I think I think Alex might just be seeing Hillary Clinton

470
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:47,552
We already know that he thinks of it demons yell at him in the grocery store that's true he may be haunted by

471
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
Hillary Clinton by the

472
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
From The Ring I guess

473
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
So

474
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
Sing there though is that like

475
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,768
These people aren't so much saying the Trump is great they're saying that

476
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
Hillary is bad

477
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
It's still like the

478
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,656
There's some positive talk about Trump

479
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
Episode

480
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,984
Can't deny that at all but

481
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
The focus is

482
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
Very much still do

483
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
Just like she sucks

484
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
She looking

485
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,176
It's hard to remember but there was a time

486
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
Whenever people in

487
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Coral Cove

488
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
Polite Society didn't

489
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,064
Actively an outwardly say

490
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,856
I would prefer non-white

491
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,880
People to be set

492
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
Second-class

493
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,440
Trump got elected

494
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,232
And we went from Alex and like

495
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,584
I hate Hillary and Donald Trump says some things that I've been misinterpreted

496
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,912
Beforeitsnews like

497
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,288
There are subtle differences

498
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
So

499
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,992
I don't know what do you think about the national

500
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,040
Racist

501
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,904
I was going to go with what is it 4th versus super race I was going to go with power

502
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,208
No I was not

503
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,512
Can I get a termite on the Star-Spangled Banner

504
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,792
During the Pledge of Allegiance

505
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
Extensive what people done for that

506
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,936
And why was under attack and why was still in Port

507
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
Now I know

508
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,592
Now I know why they want to pull America down with it

509
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,152
Testing ground of all the GMO in all the plays and all the garbage

510
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Because they hate

511
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
His folks diplomas can't come

512
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
The system

513
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
We're announcing

514
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,832
Once

515
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:29,184
Once a year the total absolute biggest sale

516
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
Across-the-board

517
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,768
That is a nice

518
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,072
Nice Jones Ian.

519
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
I was pretty impressed

520
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,168
You know what we've been out of

521
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:44,032
2015 for so long

522
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
In our art

523
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,920
So I've kind of forgotten how good is that pivots used

524
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,456
To be or that one wasn't

525
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,040
Please tell surprising

526
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:01,952
That was just a smooth it was like it was meant to be there but instead it made my brain hurt

527
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:06,816
We have different opinions on it I don't think it was that smooth but I think we agree it was

528
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
Way out of nowhere

529
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,912
So Alex has a big narrative bushing

530
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,216
That is dated Barack Obama

531
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
Had told

532
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
Someone

533
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
Speech

534
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:22,176
Q&A session

535
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,992
About it

536
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,296
No snitch

537
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
Don't remember that

538
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:34,976
Gladwell Alex plays the clip of it here and I think you I think you can pretty easily sauce out what the

539
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
Here is Obama

540
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,632
Agreeing that we won't go after you illegals to vote

541
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,472
Dreamers undocumented

542
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,080
Are fearful

543
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
Immigration

544
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,736
Do they come for my family and Deportes

545
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,064
And the reason is

546
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
When you vote

547
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
And

548
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:09,536
It's not a situation where the hell are transferred over

549
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,840
And people started investigating a server

550
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,656
You can tell that he's responding to her

551
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
When you vote

552
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
You are

553
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
Because you can't you can't register

554
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:24,640
If you don't have the required that

555
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,456
Exactly equals Obama hearing request

556
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
About should everybody vote being like

557
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:33,856
Yeah come on

558
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,928
Yeah

559
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,584
Be concerned that this person was bringing up is that there are people who may have

560
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,632
Concerns about

561
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
Targeted

562
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
Oh no

563
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,056
No I would definitely trust the America

564
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,128
And that's one of the ways

565
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,408
Voter disenfranchisement

566
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,736
Immigration

567
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,784
Folks

568
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
People mites

569
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
Be intimidated away from Gone

570
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
It's the definition

571
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
Terrorism

572
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,744
I mean the idea is to go in

573
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
Terrify a popular

574
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
And then spread that

575
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
Terror throughout

576
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
Everybody in the entire

577
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,192
Country in order to influence people politically

578
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,240
Isis a terrorist organization

579
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
Alex

580
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,872
On a recent episode from 2020 that we heard we heard about him

581
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,920
Starting up a voter fraud

582
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,968
Email address okay

583
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
Infowars.com

584
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
Smart people

585
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,552
Send tips

586
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Still yeah

587
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,368
Hey guess what he did that in 2016 to

588
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,696
Voted infowars.com report what's happening with the vote

589
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,232
It's flooding in

590
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
Dead people illegal

591
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,864
The presidents on TV Stanky Leg you can vote

592
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
So yeah

593
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:54,240
Email may have been active the whole time

594
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,288
Possibly

595
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,848
Deactivated then restarted them both

596
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,176
It's now I want to hear 2012

597
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:08,576
2208 fuckingo on back how long is that envelope if I email address been there probably just

598
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,392
2016

599
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
Episode

600
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:19,328
Now he actually has an interview with Larry Nichols that I found no clips from work worthwhile it's so boring

601
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,400
Right before the election Larry David

602
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
Can't come up with s***

603
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,752
Which god dammit

604
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,080
Everybody

605
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
That's true

606
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
So another Gaston here

607
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,808
Probably doesn't want to be associated with now

608
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
Tutu Messi

609
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:48,768
Maybe but it's someone who he decided to have on on the day before the election in 2016

610
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,608
Will there be unrest are they going to steal at Disneyland side for Trump

611
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,192
I want to get his take on all of this Stefan molyneux

612
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,752
I mean can you feel the energy my friend

613
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,568
I got to tell you Alex that I've never been

614
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
Sports fans

615
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,664
Sports but getting pulled into this election cycle

616
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
And being so

617
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,736
Interested in the outcome

618
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,528
It's kind of like watching a football game

619
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
Where the winning team gets

620
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,600
Through Western Civilization for the neck

621
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,928
Next 1000 years so

622
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,560
Do you guys believe that since Trump won he gets to rule Western syphilis

623
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
A boy

624
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:31,008
Little boy I don't think I want a self-declared white nationalist. Yes

625
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
4000 years

626
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,848
The van is not self-declared that yet you haven't been to Portland

627
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
This point he was still just

628
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:41,504
Painfully obvious

629
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:49,696
Okay buddy

630
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
Cool

631
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,560
Stephon really does not waste any time

632
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
Getting pretty

633
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,144
Pretty crypto with his racism

634
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,448
If the if the Democrats

635
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:05,824
Let's get in there going to legalize across all the illegal immigrants

636
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,616
And they will be unbeatable

637
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
That's the test

638
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
Stickley 4

639
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
Pretty much ever

640
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,272
So you know this is all just the demographic replacement demographic shift

641
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,320
Kind of argument that says mint

642
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,880
Strike Up fear in the American

643
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,184
I like how normal code for white

644
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,512
Localized it is for people on the right to just be like

645
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,584
Yeah if everybody voted we lose every time

646
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,144
So we don't do that

647
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,544
And everybody just goes along with literally no chance that we could

648
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,920
Ever win over a voting Bloc

649
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
Not appeal

650
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,224
We've whipped

651
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
The media so bad

652
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,088
Did they just go and this is part of our system

653
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,928
Spell it's imagine that this large group of immigrants

654
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
That's at where to come in work

655
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:59,840
To be in franchise Bill. People are naturalized in Madison County

656
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,424
Why do you think that your side with

657
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,704
We better policies

658
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,008
We never said we have better power

659
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:13,408
What they do say that why do why would they think that these people would be in

660
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
Incapable of

661
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:19,552
You know what I think I would like to vote with Stephane his dumb ideas

662
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,856
Is Jared Kushner let us know it's because they don't want to

663
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,416
That's the problem with the rest of us

664
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
But we don't want it

665
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,768
I would say we were born with millions of dollars

666
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
Is that also help

667
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,608
Yeah I believe that

668
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
50 left

669
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,704
The Democrats are the ones who are really real

670
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
I like to hear

671
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:44,384
You know this as well as I do I'm sure but it may be new to your to recording sound

672
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,432
Don't care about minorities

673
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
They Don't Care About Women

674
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
People want

675
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,576
Equality for the races that can they're good people want equality for the

676
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,856
For the gender for this axis

677
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,416
I see what they do is they say what we care about black

678
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,512
How much do they care about Clarence Thomas or Herman Cain or other black

679
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,864
Are Republicans generally trying to destroy and Samir in Andorra

680
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,680
How much do they care about some of the amazing women

681
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,776
Who were on the right

682
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,080
Yeah it's not about it it's it's

683
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,896
It's trying to take our natural care and concern for

684
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,712
Equality between the races and the generous and turning it against us

685
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
That's so dumb

686
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
Like

687
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,880
Is argument is the real you say you like me but what about Clarence Thomas

688
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:33,280
Okay well then I'll just turn that around you say you like women what about Hillary Clinton like

689
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:39,680
I mean did you think that your aversion to Hillary Clinton might be based on a disagreement with her policy

690
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,752
Okay well I don't like Clarence Thomas's beliefs

691
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,288
I okay

692
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:52,736
Philosopher Kings I've got to that also proves how

693
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
Not right

694
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,784
Or misogyny

695
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
Honest I am

696
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,600
Damn I hate white nationalist

697
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,136
Of all Races

698
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
Genders

699
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
Creed's Orbach

700
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,256
Backgrounds you can make it simpler than that.

701
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:10,656
His is flawed reasoning is much simpler

702
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,216
He believes that

703
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Democrats

704
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
Right

705
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
They're addicts

706
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
Power

707
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
Power off

708
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Doesn't sound like

709
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,664
It seems like

710
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,992
I think the key thing to understand for me about the left Alex

711
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,552
Is that that it's impossible to really fandom

712
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Their motives

713
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,880
And their imaginations without understanding

714
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
They're addicts to power

715
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,512
And if you've ever known somebody and I hope you haven't but if you have ever known somebody in your life

716
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,816
Who's the real addicts whether it's the sex

717
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,376
Gambling or drugs or alcohol

718
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
They will do anything

719
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,448
To get there drug

720
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:48,288
Have choice they will step over bodies they will destroy their lives they will lose their saving

721
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
Their marriage that relationship

722
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:54,944
The children

723
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
They steal everything

724
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,016
Cool

725
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,064
They are I will argue

726
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
Let those

727
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,880
2 will do everything possible

728
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,160
To keep people

729
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,208
That they want to be hold captive

730
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,512
From actually listening to anyone on the

731
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,328
No point in time are they like

732
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,144
Talk to them and listen to what they say

733
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Doesn't matter

734
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,264
What's really going on is there a different Power

735
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,360
Sure it sounds nice to be a good person

736
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:32,576
Interview I would say but Alex is more regularly

737
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Until now when

738
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,904
It's way too messy to have Stefan molyneux

739
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
Good idea

740
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,256
Start talk about phrenology or so

741
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:44,096
It's really racist

742
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
She's just gone.

743
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,544
Really racist races

744
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
Awesome

745
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,896
Bucket love

746
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:02,528
Alex and the two of them sort of having an agreement that this is a lichen

747
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Exciting Sports

748
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
But they don't really like sports

749
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
Alex

750
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
Complaints about sports

751
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Batman

752
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
Not watch Eyeworks

753
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,048
Lackadaisical not care

754
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
They want us

755
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,632
Politically and culturally involved

756
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,424
And put it on a prosthesis

757
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,704
Of Spore

758
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,312
That's like having sex with a blow-up doll folks getting real

759
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,616
Not against 439 but I played fourth but

760
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,920
You're not watching family-oriented yourself at the Joe

761
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,200
Roman do

762
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,760
Business in life in your family in

763
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,576
Your house in order that's where you have all this wargaming and

764
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
Knowing

765
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
Not you know what

766
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
Size jock

767
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
Some guy wears no that's in the NFL you like

768
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,072
You know men slapping each other on the bus and he's fine he won't do that no private time

769
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,376
That's not our religion is what I'm getting at

770
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,704
He's trying to make like liking Sports

771
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
It's kind of

772
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
Like

773
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
Something you can gay Bash

774
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,920
That's interesting that's very weird

775
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
But I find it so in

776
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,016
Interesting how many almost certainly

777
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
Roll tide

778
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
Listen to

779
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,952
I'm pretty sure the football Bixby

780
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
I don't think

781
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,304
Anybody who's into like sabermetrics

782
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,328
Statistics

783
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,888
Send Mike fantasy football I don't think that

784
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:27,776
Jockstrap size is a one of the things that they track

785
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,800
Foot size

786
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,848
I don't know if they've got

787
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,896
Contradicts yet but I think we're coming

788
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,480
I used to collect basketball cards and I don't feel like these are the sort of

789
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,040
Sports fans are into

790
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:45,440
What style are we all do how good big dick Johnson was complaining

791
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,488
Slapping asses in congratulations

792
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,840
Kind of happy you doing Hockey Night playlist

793
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,888
Did Tim Allen do that

794
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
So

795
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,520
Like I said the real tone here is very much like Hillary's probably

796
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:03,616
Steal the election but and what are you going to do

797
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,432
Point now

798
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,248
Where people are into politics they're awake they're involved

799
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,064
And Donald Trump was just that magic little

800
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
Little sprinkle

801
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,696
In this whole recipe that is just exploding

802
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
So don't freak out of a Steeler

803
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,352
Wentworth game that with some former Navy Seals other folks tomorrow

804
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,936
Don't freak out if they steal the election there's going to be more

805
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
Patriots

806
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,032
The globalist chicken

807
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,872
Sure sure you know if Hillary gets in rest easy my friend

808
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
The Fight Continues

809
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:42,784
Not she will open up a Chasm of hell and demons will spawn forthwith

810
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,880
It took so little time for everyone

811
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,672
I'm like Hey look

812
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,720
Sometimes the Democrats to Alexa

813
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
We're going to get through it till like

814
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,328
Biden's we're going to win by a mile no like

815
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:01,216
You know what's outrageous about it too is that like

816
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,264
He hates Hillary Clinton

817
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,056
Like for decades

818
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,336
Decades

819
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
Built-in mic

820
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:11,200
Real hatred of Joe Biden I know that he didn't like Obama

821
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
Super poke

822
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Gaston by.

823
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:22,720
It'll be the end of the world when Biden is running and it's be like Hillary my twin what you going to do

824
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,792
When Hillary gets its Justin

825
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,584
I'm just so mad all the

826
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,656
Estranged

827
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,032
But I think I think again like if you look at it from a really cynical perspective it's because

828
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
At this point

829
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,592
I don't think

830
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
Did Alex's

831
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,896
Completely lost his mind

832
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,736
Prophet

833
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
If Hillary wins hika

834
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,320
Can profit off it and that's why I'm a maybe

835
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Even better if they

836
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
They steal it

837
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
Cuz he can profit off that yep

838
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
I think that he thought

839
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,744
Pretty good profit off drop but I think he has but I think a T-Rex

840
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Recognizes it

841
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,584
You can't go back now

842
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
If Biden wins

843
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,656
There's no way to keep

844
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
You Beautiful War going

845
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,264
You got to go to Walmart Infowars over that

846
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,288
So part of it is gone

847
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
Yeah

848
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,872
Trump winning is the only way that his racket

849
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
Joey is another guest

850
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
It's not Larry Nichols

851
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,088
But it is someone else

852
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,136
I don't know where I don't know where the f***

853
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
This dude is anymore

854
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,952
You certainly not around

855
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,512
The guy from fastball

856
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,304
No he's a hippie

857
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,608
He's a chiropractor

858
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,680
Oh boy.

859
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,776
Now remember we had in the past we had nasal mist vaccines but this year

860
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,872
They're recommending only injectable why is that

861
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:47,456
There's two different vaccines that hardly bypasses the immune system

862
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,248
Dangerous this year

863
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,784
A high-dose shot

864
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,832
For older people now remember

865
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,624
No special just

866
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,744
Kermit bad guy

867
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,048
Logan's Run carousel

868
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:07,168
The group

869
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,728
We are going to need those old

870
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:16,128
People to avoid getting flu shots so they can sacrifice themselves while going towards lighter

871
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,224
Yeah

872
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,856
This is all been going on during the election nobody even knows about this

873
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,904
I'm breaking this for the first time

874
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
Because I think it's so important

875
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,512
This is mark my words one of the worst

876
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,840
Lucy's in will create the most damage

877
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:42,240
Never in the history of the world and I'm not saying that to scare people it's definitely there but I mean

878
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,544
Take your shot at

879
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,896
According to the CDC the 2016 2017 flu season was slightly worse

880
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
Spend the 20

881
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
5220

882
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
16 Season

883
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,272
But much milder than the two previous Seasons as well as

884
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,808
The 2017 to 2018

885
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,624
I have marked doctor groups words

886
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:03,232
And what do you know a chiropractor is Sensational prediction was inaccurate water shot

887
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:09,120
Wild wow he would have some sort of insight that other doctors who would maybe study these types of

888
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
Things for their entire lives are out

889
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:14,496
You know as an outsider could really shake things up but I think it's just

890
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,544
These Chiropractic

891
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,616
Some good advice for you

892
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:26,016
Don't get the flu shot do not do your research before you get the flu shot this year

893
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:29,856
Take it and get your coffin ready

894
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,648
Libra

895
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
Yep so don't

896
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,696
Get a flu shot

897
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,256
Trauma Chiropractic Group

898
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,912
That might be good advice strictly advise not to get a flu shot coming

899
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,704
From Doctor group

900
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,520
So ol all liberals

901
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,800
Against Hillary

Sure

903
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,360
According to Alex

904
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:56,735
Well that distinction wasn't really real to Alex at this point

905
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:01,087
Show all Liberals are against Hillary and did the reason that it be bad if

906
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,623
She got in his really interesting

907

Same here

908
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,719
Every real liberal like Julian Assange Bev Harris

909
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
You name it

910
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,327
Jill Stein is against Hillary and say

911
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,375
He wants World War 3 because she does

912
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,911
Terrible decisions

913
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,263
He cannot be challenged she must have her wait you can't do that with China and Russia

914
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:24,127
Weiwei isn't that wow plotting that offer literally 141

915
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:29,503
Exactly what your office around

916
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,903
Oh my God she wants to

917
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,183
What a terrible person

918
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Grave

919
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
Wow

920
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,815
Wow this is hard to go into the past and hear the exact same s***

921
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,607
Wrong

922
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,887
It's really interesting

923
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,911
Superman

924
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
It's shocked

925
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
Blair

926
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,287
Vienna way

927
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:57,151
What what I could never have predicted based on the last

928
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,175
Last 4 years

929
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,455
Of this show

930
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,759
I'm listening to so much Alex

931
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,831
Is it you go back to the day before the election

932
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:10,463
Hey Alex would be like so lackadaisical just go to like B deal at what you going to do

933
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,743
Yeah

934
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
It isn't

935
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,863
It isn't it was screaming it's just not

936
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,727
It's another day for him

937
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,519
Infuriated

938
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
Isn't it amazing how

939
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,847
Spectrum me a f******

940
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,663
That's how stable Obama

941
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
The f****** country

942
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,735
That's how stable it was

943
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,015
It's not good

944
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
By no stretch

945
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,367
Stable is s*** to the point where Alex is like

946
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:42,719
You're focused a little action what I got to do Maryville

947
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,999
So at this point

948
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,327
Decided he's going to really swing and start fake cry

949
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,935
I can get lost hiking and kayaking and

950
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,471
Painting and cooking

951
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,287
IFit great cook-off man I love

952
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:00,383
Thanks for checking on her casseroles

953
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,991
I just so easily working hours days, cook food Hangout

954
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,783
My kids I want you so bad

955
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,575
There's bad people coming out to my kid

956
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,303
Computer laptop

957
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,399
Cuz I'm sad it's crying cuz I feel extremely vile

958
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
Alright

959
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,359
Annoy

960
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:36,223
Need him to backup

961
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,015
He keeps saying that he likes painting

962
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:45,439
Dino Alex on social media

963
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
No response

964
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,071
At press time we have no proof I think it's b*******

965
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,655
I think it's a thing that he thinks would make him sound so f******

966
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:58,239
Culture interesting

967
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,519
I have diverse interests

968
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:03,103
I'm sure you do

969
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,919
Rambling about how the man

970
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,711
Globalist

971
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,991
As Farmers ourselves

972
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:12,831
Yeah

973
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,879
They don't want what

974
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,415
Thomas Jefferson wrote about yeoman

975
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,183
Farmers

976
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,743
Hard-working smart

977
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,279
People that are confident and good

978
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:27,167
Farinelli read history the globalist are so scared of farmers

979
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,959
Poor farmers are family

980
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
Their men their women

981
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,263
Self-sufficient

982
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
Thomas

983
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,567
And called the little things

984
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,359
Strong

985
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,479
I don't want you to be a farmer they want you to be out of their control

986
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
Like Thomas Jeff

987
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:48,159
I'm not going to belabor this we're running specials right now

988
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
Sorry

989
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,719
A little boy

990
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,327
Real good

991
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,399
Out of nowhere

992
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,191
I don't want you to be farmers in South

993
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:05,823
Division 5 Mi whatever it was

994
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,151
That's what he just said I forgot where I was going

995
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,711
Sodus Point

996
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,527
Decides to get into his history with abortion

997
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,087
As we know we've heard him talk about the

998
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,439
And I probably would have just ignored it cuz it's rehashing a topic but

999
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:26,303
He spends quite a while on it

1000
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
Salacious

1001
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
I would say if it's

1002
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,423
Stefan molyneux Zoe fancies himself a philosopher

1003
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,191
Versailles

1004
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
Basic reasoning and logic

1005
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,287
Tissues cuz he's actually very stupid yes

1006
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,127
Alex is getting into a very interesting

1007
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
Ethical

1008
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
Distinction

1009
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,479
But I would like to talk about after this clip

1010
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:50,111
Because what he proposes as an ethical system I believe is unsustainable in the real world

1011
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,951
If you've paid for abortions you were lied to her to know what's happening

1012
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,999
Cuz as long as you admit

1013
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,815
I should have done that for birth control I was told I would lie

1014
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,143
I forget myself I forgive

1015
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:08,031
You know what I did say the baby please forgive me and him will God forgive me and just freeze

1016
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,591
Not if it comes to human soccer

1017
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
When you dip

1018
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,455
Later when you learn about it your heart

1019
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,735
By the Holy Spirit

1020
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,527
And you don't do anything about it

1021
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,319
Then you're committed that evil eye look

1022
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
I'm somebody

1023
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,743
Pedro Garcia born

1024
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:33,631
My dad was like 16 he's i'll scrounge around here to get money and stuff he's like son you need to

1025
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,471
If I want to get married if you want you to be you stop killing my grandkids

1026
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,799
My resolve 16

1027
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,591
Abortion

1028
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:48,735
That's f***** up but like I don't think that getting reproductive

1029
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Healthcare is

1030
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,319
I don't think there's any ethical problem with

1031
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,855
With abortion or anything like that

1032
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
All above board

1033
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
Allowing

1034
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
To just like

1035
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,767
Play with the ideas Alex

1036
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,327
If there is an act

1037
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,423
That is

1038
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,727
Totally fine to do

1039
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,311
Then later can become

1040
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,847
A human sacrifice

1041
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,919
You have a very ethical dilemma because

1042
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:21,247
The act itself can't be wrong if doing it

1043
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,271
Is not wrong

1044
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:27,391
You believe it to be wrong right only wrong once you have

1045
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,671
Decided it's wrong

1046
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
And

1047
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,303
Deny that it's wrong that sounds like the system of

1048
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:38,655
I think I would call it a malignant narcissistic psychopath

1049
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,679
It's it's

1050
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,495
It's nihilistic

1051
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,543
Because we act itself

1052
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,103
It has to be morally completely neutral

1053
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,943
There can be no ethical implications to it

1054
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,223
Wrong

1055
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,807
Denny's your eventual feelings about it right

1056
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,951
I would argue that it's actually a very normal thing for a religious people especially born-again ones

1057
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,719
2

1058
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,023
Partially harshly judge everyone who commits

1059
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
It's the sins that they are

1060
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
Absolutely free

1061
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:12,703
Yeah and what about this what about the possibility that

1062
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,519
I mean God forbid you die

1063
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
Before

1064
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,079
You make up your box

1065
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:22,687
Ono then you're not from Africa me what is the What is the

1066
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,271
Subway

1067
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,831
Purgatory any put it in the Bible that we all know about

1068
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:33,695
It's it's just strange it's strange to have this sort of ethical

1069
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:35,999
Hunting

1070
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:41,375
I guess you don't like I think that's a good way of putting it because it is literally going to ball down the road

1071
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,399
Kill the person

1072
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,191
I feel fine right now

1073
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,727
I'll deal with this when it

1074
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,287
I'll deal with this when the time is right

1075
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,591
A bit much when the Holy Spirit

1076
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,175
Alex's saying that like when he was 16 is Dad was

1077
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
Confronting about this

1078
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,551
My resolve 16 start looking at Mary payflex a divorce

1079
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,647
So don't you stop killing the Grinch

1080
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,511
I promised myself I would never do that again and I

1081
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,423
That is not true

1082
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,823
I know there were several more abortions between 16 and when you got married

1083
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,663
Alex

1084
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,991
He said he had

1085
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,831
5e paperwise

1086
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,903
That he's paid for

1087
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,487
No that's not to shame or say anything wrong with

1088
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,535
It's just Alex you're being mean

1089
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,095
Consistent something is not right about these

1090
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:44,863
Stories

1091
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,775
And I care so deeply about the fact that he says everyone who has an abortion

1092
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,079
I agree but also

1093
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,895
Part of me wonders if it's all made up

1094
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,175
Because it does

1095
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:04,575
Really fit into that same sort of story is the youth pastor who wants to lie to you about that wild days stuff

1096
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,623
I do kind of have that feeling

1097
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,183
The way that everything is so inconsistent

1098
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,511
The details are are just all over the place

1099
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,815
I don't know if I even believed any of it

1100
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,095
That's fair

1101
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,399
It sounds like something like it the same way that I was like

1102
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,191
I went to Satanic rituals

1103
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:20,959
No you didn't

1104
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:25,311
Yeah that's true it's more likely that he's like

1105
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,847
There is something true

1106
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:31,455
Brandi's riffing off of that there's a there's a kernel of something somewhere

1107
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,991
Have the story down

1108
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,599
It's delivered the same way every single time like a stand-up set

1109
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,903
You know is there they know they're they

1110
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,439
Travel around they do there

1111
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:44,255
The youth pastor do you Pastor will have like

1112
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,559
Taking a hit off a joint one time

1113
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,351
And then turn that into

1114
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,143
3 years old

1115
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,959
Opium death anywhere right

1116
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,495
Do anything I was just

1117
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,775
So happy

1118
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,543
Lay it on the

1119
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,359
So there's a decent chance that like

1120
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,151
The reality visit Alex

1121
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,175
At 1

1122
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:05,247
Not that he paid for it and now it's turned

1123
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,783
But he feels around that is true

1124
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
Didn't

1125
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
Whatever it is it's

1126
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,367
Just it just that it's Max

1127
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,135
To me of life

1128
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
Just unresolved

1129
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
Feeling when I don't even think

1130
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,511
I think it's just

1131
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,047
Bulshit that possible

1132
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,119
Anyway Alex leaves after rambling about to

1133
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,399
Stouffer Wild

1134
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,727
Very much not a show that I would have

1135
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,519
Expected to be the day before the election

1136
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,567
Pretty thin

1137
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:33,151
How many abortions you pay for

1138
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,503
David Knight takes over

1139
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:42,879
52 hour live election broadcast that has begun we're now an hour number

1140
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,183
Of that 52-hour broadcast

1141
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,743
I just asked Leah guys the booth I said.

1142
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,511
What time

1143
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,071
Special right now because we have to find this operation post

1144
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,119
Basically said pretty much everything

1145
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:59,007
Keep on selling Grandpa

1146
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,335
David Knight saying stick with me for 52 hours

1147
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,615
Who's my true nightmare

1148
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,431
Weather going to be

1149
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,479
I'll be here with you 450

1150
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
T2 hours

1151
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:12,575
I will say that I could not listen to the toll fee

1152
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,367
There was a part of me that felt like

1153
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:21,023
I do it no you are not going to do it circumstances dictated that I could do it

1154
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,327
Alex shows back up in the evening

1155
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,119
He came in for one reason

1156
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,655
Jessie J

1157
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,935
A mother top

1158
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,519
Reality TV stars ever with gun shows and car shows motorcycle shows

1159
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,799
I don't James like 6

1160
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
And

1161
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,383
Been friends for a while

1162
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,431
He's working

1163
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,295
Like 5 years ago

1164
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
The Patriot

1165
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,439
Call Matt p

1166
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,231
I'm ready to come on the show man

1167
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,767
So let's do it okay

1168
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,583
The evening of the day before the

1169
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,143
Noted domestic abuser

1170
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,423
Jesse James

1171
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,983
Alex is on

1172
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,007
Again

1173
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,799
Mostly because Jesse James has

1174
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,591
Agreed to be on the show and

1175
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,639
So I got to interview this celebrity

1176
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,943
But also

1177
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:11,967
Rodger

1178
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,735
Stone

1179
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,271
W to call Lynn

1180
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:17,343
Sure no

1181
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,159
Jesse's not there yet he's on his way to that

1182
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,207
Rodger calls in and

1183
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,743
He has kind of a

1184
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,767
Trump might win

1185
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,559
Kind of feeling sure

1186
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,607
Very much not like

1187
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,631
What a f****** loser

1188
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,167
Yeah

1189
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,191
But you also

1190
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,727
If you need evidence

1191
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,775
It's that Rodger stone is on the payroll

1192
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,055
On November 7th

1193
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,335
2016

1194
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,615
I present you with this

1195
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,431
What is the real state of this and now

1196
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,711
Central Time

1197
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,271
3 hours and 47 minutes out

1198
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,391
Let me say that

1199
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,231
And you just pay me to say this shooting

1200
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,607
If it were not for brains

1201
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
Horse right now

1202
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,679
I would be completely.

1203
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,983
Unfunctional it really use you

1204
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,823
Mental Clarity in the Boost of energy when you just got

1205
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,847
Evil little more

1206
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
Amazing

1207
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
Amazing

1208
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,479
Rodger you're on the team

1209
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:22,111
You're either fishing for a job or you've already been hired

1210
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:28,255
Add a little more

1211
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,047
Boulger

1212
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,679
So in this conversation with the two of them have I get a very strong sense

1213
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,959
Alex

1214
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,983
Preparing for a loss

1215
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:41,567
Trump wins though as as as Macklemore mix

1216
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,103
The biggest a Puget Sound

1217
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:44,895
Shock

1218
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,919
But regard

1219
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
It looks like

1220
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,711
Polly had to me

1221
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
I want other folks

1222
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,831
Regardless it's a huge victory that globalism

1223
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,111
Is on its heels

1224
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,671
Nationalism is rising

1225
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
This whole movement

1226
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,487
And taking us light

1227
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Ears

1228
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,815
In the future in our fight against the NWA

1229
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:07,423
So even if he loses we made so much progress

1230
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,471
Girl feel good about that

1231
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,263
We can take this as a win

1232
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,103
We're light years ahead of where we were against the New World Order

1233
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,639
In a way

1234
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,199
Kind of does make sense though

1235
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,479
Alex to be

1236
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,271
Freaking out so hard now in

1237
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,295
In comparison to 20

1238
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,575
16 because this must

1239
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,879
Like in 2016 this was like

1240
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,439
Oh wow we got Trump but obviously Hillary's

1241
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
Everybody

1242
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,487
It was like obviously Hillary's

1243
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,815
So now

1244
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,119
It is kind of a situation where they like

1245
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,655
Are insane I got in

1246
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,983
There's no way this is ever going to happen again

1247
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,567
Everybody saw what happens when insane guys in

1248
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,639
We got to keep them in there or they're going to keep us away as

1249
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,663
Fastest possible

1250
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,223
What kind of makes sense in a way

1251
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,271
It does seem like

1252
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
We've got a

1253
00:56:55,295 --> 00:57:00,415
Keep the engineer's away or else they'll plug up the holes

1254
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951
Yeah

1255
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,767
I don't I don't know how to make sense of it other than like

1256
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:07,583
I just don't think that Alex

1257
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
Easy guy not win

1258
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,679
They love they love Ron Paul he never wins

1259
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:14,751
You're not worried about that I assumed if Ron Paul a Dever one

1260
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,055
And then it destroyed democracy he be like

1261
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,103
We got to do everything we can

1262
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,687
Rompope never winning again man

1263
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:27,551
It would have played out way differently if Ron Paul had one

1264
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,111
I guess we would have been baby

1265
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,135
Cuba

1266
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,439
Alex

1267
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,743
Preoccupied with something

1268
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:39,583
And that is Gary Johnson's running mate

1269
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,399
Had some positive comments about Hillary

1270
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,679
For sure and

1271
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,751
So Alex now wants Rodger to denounce

1272
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,799
Gary Johnson

1273
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:55,199
Rodger

1274
00:57:55,455 --> 00:58:00,575
Rodger and Gary Johnson or past Associates

1275
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,111
Donald Trump

1276
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,719
The Liberals the Democrat

1277
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,023
Sand

1278
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,375
Weld openly doing

1279
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,447
I think you said the name of the Republic

1280
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,239
The human right classy

1281
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,847
But I know you were the head of a campaign for a while

1282
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,639
Last time Gary Johnson

1283
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
Was wondering

1284
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,199
Toy transporter libertarian

1285
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:33,343
Maybe the man from civilization nuclear war made for the planet

1286
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:37,439
Play the clip and ask you about Gary Johnson

1287
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:48,447
Hey will you do now to

1288
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:55,615
How did Gary Johnson will be proud to take credit like that so Alex keeps pushing on Rodger

1289
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,383
Musically

1290
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,919
F*** it did outside

1291
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
This Rihanna

1292
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,479
Don't want

1293
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,271
I mean

1294
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,599
About the

1295
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,623
Silly to

1296
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,415
I'm really glad you asked

1297
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
For you

1298
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,095
Perfection in Greek

1299
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
Gary Johnson

1300
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,959
Johnson's record as governor of New Mexico

1301
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,567
Everybody

1302
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,335
Okay

1303
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
Germania

1304
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,687
Alright

1305
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,711
All right call it down

1306
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:38,367
I'm Rodger goddamn Stone

1307
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,927
Find me diplomatic before I say something awful

1308
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,511
Do you understand I am going to s*** on him

1309
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,327
Okay I am a s*** head in a top hat

1310
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,399
I get away with the s*** had already because I wear a top at

1311
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:54,239
I could sit on his face right now he'll hire me in 4 years

1312
00:59:54,495 --> 01:00:00,639
Some Rodger goddamn yeah that is the other thing I get the sense like Rodger thinks that he's going to be employable on the other side of this and

1313
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:08,319
Yes Gary Johnson is a good man his record as a

1314
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:11,135
Working I definitely don't plan on going to

1315
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
Jail

1316
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,559
They have this story that we heard on the

1317
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,583
Last 22

1318
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,399
16 episode The Anthony Weiner's laptop

1319
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,679
Yeah man

1320
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,727
It's remarkable to me how eggs

1321
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:30,079
Exactly the same this is with Hunter Biden's laptop

1322
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,871
To the point where even

1323
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,431
The same person is pushing the story

1324
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,711
I'm told

1325
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,247
I have told

1326
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,551
Former mayor Rudy Giuliani the thief

1327
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,319
Files

1328
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,647
Solid evidence

1329
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,791
Security essentially in some cases

1330
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,071
Blackmail files

1331
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,631
There are government

1332
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
Documents

1333
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
Forwarded

1334
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,495
There are all kinds of

1335
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:04,127
Again the same words that I'd heard from other police sources

1336
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,199
Cafeteria

1337
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,223
Pay for play

1338
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Corruption

1339
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:13,087
Sexual exploitation of children again

1340
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:18,207
Extraordinary

1341
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,767
Commence pertaining to the

1342
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,047
Foundation

1343
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,583
It's all just like rerun

1344
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,399
Yeah it's just the it's just the same thing

1345
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:32,287
How is that is that must be why Rudy was so mad when everybody was saw that story where like

1346
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:39,455
We've done this before nobody really felt that they knew exactly when we've done this before but we are all like

1347
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
We've seen this ship

1348
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,015
Before this is exact

1349
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,295
Believe it it's exactly

1350
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:49,695
Rudy Giuliani has a little bit of

1351
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,975
Livermore exciting backs

1352
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,999
Yeah that's true

1353
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,559
Yeah I mean it's it's

1354
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,631
You know you forget about little

1355
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,679
Details about

1356
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:02,751
Everything is so crazy and there's so much

1357
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:07,103
Spaghetti being thrown against the wall over and over and over again

1358
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,127
Throughout

1359
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,175
Do you know the 2016 election

1360
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,991
No they said it never has that you forget like

1361
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:17,087
I have Deja Vu always because we did this exact thing

1362
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,367
She's a

1363
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:21,951
So at this point Jesse James is still on his way to

1364
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:26,047
Studio Springs in Lee Ann McAdoo

1365
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,327
And Joby

1366
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,143
Both you are not there anymore

1367
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:33,215
Who have a really important

1368
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:33,983
Purpose

1369
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,287
Just thought of Facebook mention

1370
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,567
Speaking of that

1371
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,335
You know what

1372
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
By the time I left

1373
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,151
50000

1374
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,175
And if we did that

1375
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,455
The topic was on

1376
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:46,783
The Clinton Foundation because it's one of the top trending things on Facebook

1377
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
Right now

1378
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,831
Messy Leanne

1379
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,855
Bragging about traffic

1380
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,487
It's a preoccupation

1381
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,511
Is such

1382
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,047
A goddamn hubris

1383
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,863
Schleich

1384
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,911
Resignation

1385
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,495
We're going to be on top forever

1386
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,031
Now Trump's probably not going to win

1387
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,359
It's outrageous

1388
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,383
The level

1389
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,431
Cut out

1390
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,711
All the time

1391
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
The day just

1392
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:19,039
Ramble about there traffic

1393
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:19,807
Assassin

1394
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,623
Just like we've destroyed CNN

1395
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,207
Droid the mainstream media wear on top

1396
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,559
Yeah it is be like we're going to live forever that someone says right before they

1397
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,351
Wow off of roof brutal

1398
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:37,727
So in this next play I believe he's talkin

1399
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,055
To Jesse James in the middle of introducing him

1400
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,359
But Alex has his timeline

1401
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,127
Just a tiny bit

1402
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,919
I never liked

1403
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,687
Like the Democrats

1404
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,479
Republicans don't deliver on what

1405
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,295
Trump

1406
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,367
I mean I don't from like grudgingly

1407
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,415
Supporting a meter and a half ago to like

1408
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,951
Show route

1409
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:00,511
That I supported this guy

1410
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,047
The stamina the work

1411
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:02,815
The attacks

1412
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,863
A year-and-a-half prior to this

1413
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
Would have been

1414
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,447
May 2015

1415
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,471
By that point

1416
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,751
Alex did not say

1417
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,799
Support him immediately

1418
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:17,151
Nope little bit if he there he did not really

1419
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,199
Support Trump until the end

1420
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,479
15

1421
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,527
Search Jesse James

1422
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,831
You know I think this is a little bit

1423
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,111
A little bit iffy

1424
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,647
I think that he's very

1425
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
Dumb

1426
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:30,207
In terms of some of the things he

1427
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:33,535
She says this might you might be able to take this is racist

1428
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,303
Also

1429
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,887
I grew up in the hood man I was born in Lynnwood and grew up in

1430
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:42,239
Southgate Long Beach and I was like man to be cool to have a Brothers president you know that's what we need

1431
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:46,079
You know we needed Billy Dee Williams to come in and Lex

1432
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,383
This was going to be like you know we needed that

1433
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,175
Instead we got

1434
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,711
And then everybody realize like

1435
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,991
Oh wait he's a

1436
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,271
College professor

1437
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
And it's like

1438
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,575
College Prep

1439
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,623
Super so great at what they do

1440
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,391
How come they're not

1441
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,415
Billionaire

1442
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,231
Haha yeah man

1443
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,791
Haha

1444
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:12,959
Are you I think you can probably debate whether or not it's like a he's not the right kind of black person

1445
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,495
The Urkel car

1446
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:20,895
Remember Billy Pilgrim.

1447
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,919
You need to watch Star Wars again

1448
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:25,759
No he didn't

1449
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,807
Although that would be great

1450
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,135
I would say for me

1451
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,439
I don't I don't

1452
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,279
I don't think I could take anyone seriously

1453
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:42,143
If they were like if teachers are so great why are they billionaires I would I would throw that I would throw that

1454
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,703
I want to throw that I find that statement

1455
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,983
To be a little bit.

1456
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,263
I mean in credit

1457
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:52,383
I mean I could answer him seriously it's like we can protect this is Siri

1458
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,663
Please make sure

1459
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,687
That would be a good person

1460
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,991
Some people I have no desire to

1461
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
To be billionaires

1462
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,831
And some people instead of being validated

1463
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,599
Strictly by the

1464
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,135
Accumulation of money

1465
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:08,255
Find that living the life where you and Rich other people's lives and

1466
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
Caton

1467
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
I helped a guy then

1468
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,071
Next Generation

1469
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
Through

1470
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,399
Educational hurdles response

1471
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,935
You're a dirty f******

1472
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,959
Tommy

1473
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:24,383
I want to be a billionaire but now you're good I've been chastised

1474
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:28,223
That's all it takes so apparently I think Jesse doesn't like tea

1475
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,271
Teachers teachers

1476
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,295
Cuz they can't do it

1477
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:37,695
Every every college professor when I was in college they're all disgruntled they all feel like everything stacked against them

1478
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,463

1479
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
I don't know

1480
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,047
According to biography.com

1481
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:47,423
Jesse graduated high school in 1987 and enrolled at Riverside Community College

1482
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,495
Jori played on the football team and dreamed of somehow making the leap

1483
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,543
From small school ball to NFL

1484
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,615
However following two injury-plagued seasons

1485
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,639

Demon dropped out of school

1487
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,967
Swimming like look

1488
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,991
There's no shame in going

01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,551
Community colleges of June ologist but like

01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,831

Don't pretend that you like

1492
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,647

Darryl matlick

1495
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,375
Don't pretend that you have

1496
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:21,471
Full view of the subject

1497
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,495

Two years probably mostly play football

1499
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,079
Who didn't work out

1500
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
When you dropped out

1501
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,383
Like you didn't have

1502
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,919
A full college experience

1503
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
Do you know Jesus

1504
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479

01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:33,759
Alright

1506
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,551
If your view of

1507
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,087
College professor

1508
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,623
At a community college

1509
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Spell community

1510
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,951
Is that they are all

1511
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,791
Everybody's against us and all that stuff

1512
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,327
Did it ever occur to you

1513
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,631
To stop for one second and think

1514
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,935
I wonder if everyone's against

1515
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,727
And the answer to that is he

1516
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,775
Everyone is against them

1517
01:07:56,031 --> 01:08:00,127
And somehow they still go to work to teach your dumbass

1518
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,943
Who doesn't care because you're playing Juco

1519
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,783
So screw you I've met a lot more professors

1520
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,551
Then Jessie had

1521
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,831
You're my life

1522
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,391
And I will give it to him the most pretty grumpy

1523
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,159
But

1524
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:14,719
If you know things you're grumpy

1525
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,511
That's just the truth

1526
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,047
Is there Grumpy in a fun way

1527
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,839
Anyway

1528
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:24,959
I would save this next clip of Jesse does not pass

1529
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
The smell test

1530
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,263
I'm like an aunt

1531
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,031
Inure

1532
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,335
Of humans and I have the best BS

1533
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,151
Whatever I can do

1534
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:36,223
Can I can I can meet someone and like

1535
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,039
Know whether they're full of s*** or not

1536
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,575
I don't know I don't know man

1537
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,343
I don't know if that's

1538
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:42,879
Exactly what you

1539
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,159
You say right before you get

1540
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,951
Conned by somebody named Alex

1541
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,999
Jones

1542
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,279
To the media and a lot of

1543
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,303
Stuff that

1544
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,607
The most notable for in the pub

1545
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:57,471
Lead me to believe you may not have a good BS detector is off

1546
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:01,823
The chart that that's why I trust Trump whenever he says literally everything

1547
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,615
Maybe not

1548
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:06,431
So you can tell Alex's voices a little bit weird there

1549
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,479
There's a tone change

1550
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,527
What it is I think you just

1551
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
Crashed

1552
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,623
Really tired

1553
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,719
In the middle of the interview too weird

Entirety

1558
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,935
At some point in the middle of it

1559
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:32,543
Feels different yeah yeah that sounds like when the drugs run out

1560
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,871
So anyway this is the this is a clip

1561
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,895

Towards the end of the night

01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,911
Late into the evening

And I wait I think that they probably are glad this happened at a point where to be

1610
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,823
Be very hard for someone to

1611
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:42,847
Find it

1612
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:46,431
Or remember that this happened on the day before the election in 26

1613
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
16

1614
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,599
You get a story about a

1615
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:59,999
The former Comet Pizza employee who is how we got to take okay

1616
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,023
In the brainwashed

1617
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,047
A fashion

1618
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:06,399
Well folks we have found some

1619
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,703

01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,567

Steak dinner

1627
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:23,551
It appears though I'm we have some

1628
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,343
Symbolism being used here with

1629
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,623
Pizza and cheese

1630
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,439
And it may be linked to a child pedophilia

1631
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,975
It does look

1632
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,255
Look as though

1633
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,559
David Brock has a connection with this

1634
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,143
To place owner and at the Obamas are well aware of it

1635

01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:48,895
Late in the evening then whenever the pizzagate comes out

1637
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,175
The pizza guy comes

1638
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,223
You might have heard that

1639
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:58,623
Producer is like we got a guy who's

1640
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,927
Let's go to is that

1641
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:04,255
Beards and who knows a former employee of kind of pizza

1642
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,327
Yeah that's right

1643
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
Quite a bit

1644
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,727
And that we found that a.m.

1645
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,263
Is a gentleman by the name of

1646
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,031
Call Town

1647
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,567
That was actually

1648
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,847
Did he work there

1649
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:22,431
That kind of pizza for about a year-and-a-half and he was going to

1650
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,711
For pedophilia

1651
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:25,247
What was his name again

1652
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:27,807
Joe poletown is a prank name

1653
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,135
That's how I was being used by posters on Fortune

1654
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,183
Okay so you can find archived

1655
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:35,231
Threads where people are laughing at Owen

1656
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,791
As this episode is happening because

1657
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,095
Poletown is a reference to pull

1658
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,143
The pool board on 4chan

1659
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:46,239
At least that is the sense that I got from looking through their comments

1660
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,263
Hilarious

1661
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:50,591

Kind of gets

1666
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,575
Sad

1667
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,111
When Owen

1668
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:05,439
Response to this guy giving him this Intel like this

1669
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:09,279

1671
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,887
Different

1672
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,655
Employee

1673
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191

1674
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,727
Find online

1675
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:18,751
Are we Crossing

1676
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,287
Information with

1677
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,079
Database

1678
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,359
Call Town

1679
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:25,151
As actually involved

01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,991
Well I just want to I just want to

1681
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,783
Give you a round of applause because

1682
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,319
This is the time

1683
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,647
Of effort it takes from We the People Folk

1684
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:36,927
Okay again

1685
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,303
I'm sorry I did the FBI call into that show and give us this Intel

1686
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:45,631
Did the Washington Police Department call in and give us his until no

1687
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,703
Owen is applauding this guy for pranking

1688
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:55,103
I wonder if they had Jesse James there I'm sure he would have seen right through this prank

1689
01:14:55,359 --> 01:15:00,735
Bulshit

1690
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:07,135
It's almost like he's stressing the name it's almost like he can't stop getting that name out

1691
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,927
It's almost like a

1692
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,719
Beginning every sentence with meow

1693
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,767
And if I were

1694
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:13,791
I don't know

1695
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:18,399
Someone is working at an actual news Outlet I wouldn't let someone accuse now

1696
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,775
No backup and he no follow-up Kia

1697
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:24,799
Clap

1698
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,871
Immediate Round of Applause standing ovation

1699
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:34,271
Do any caller who says anything I want if you don't want to run the risk of somebody you know slandering

1700
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:37,855
A private citizen on your show did you wouldn't

1701
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,391
Owens instinct

1702
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,415
They're so terrible

1703
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,439
They're just the worst

1704
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,231
I'll tell you why Maggie's not there any

1705
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,511
She asked

1706
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,815
Where did you get this information from

1707
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:53,215
That is the end of her career

1708
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,495
You are going to need 25

1709
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,055
Yeah she she was cleaning out her desk when she

1710
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,079
He finished that question

1711
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,127
So I mean like look dude

1712
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,431
The reality is ons getting pranked

1713
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,711
By 4chan

1714
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,015
Fine I mean I guess

1715
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,063
It is what it is

1716
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,087
It's Infowars

1717
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:12,671
You know it's not like you told people to go to Comet Ping Pong

1718
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,743
Has the New York Police Department raided this place

1719
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,559
Has the FBI

1720
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
Raider this place

1721
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:22,143
Has anyone investigated, Pizza

1722
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,471
Is there anybody planning on investigating, Pizza

1723
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,287
Does anybody even know what time it is

1724
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,335
On the American people

1725
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,615
Don't do anything illegal

1726
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,895

Don't do anything illegal today

I am calling on the America

1738
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:15,135
Can people get to the bottom of it

1739
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:22,047
Questions in a row doing something we will later pretend

01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:24,863
He did not do happened

01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,911

I will give him that

1743
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,495
This is how you

1744
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,775
Get involved in this fight

1745
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,079
This is how you change will think about that

1746
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
Think about you

1747
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,151
You're sitting at your couch

1748
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:41,247
The Monday night its 1 here central time you're sitting on your couch you know

1749
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,039
You watching Infowars maybe your

01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,831
Enjoying

01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,647
Corner something some chocolate you're just sitting down

1752
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,207
Well maybe tomorrow you go to Comet Pizza

1753
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,999
And you capture video footage

1754
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,535
That changes the world

1755
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:54,815
Okay

1756
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,095
That

1757
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,375
Is how

1758
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,655
You make it impact folks

1759
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,935
You get off your Duff

1760
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,471
You go out

1761
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,263
You make some

1762
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,031
Action happen

1763
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,567
It look for some answers

1764
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,615
That's how you change the world

1765
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,639
You

1766
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,919
Get off your Duff

1767
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,943
And go down

1768
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,735
Comet Ping Pong Pizza

1769
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,015
Change the world

1770
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:16,319
I would not want that recording

1771
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:25,535
On record the world you know that I said that that would be bad

1772
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,815
So here's the thing

1773
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:31,167
Games that tell you find by looking at the day before the election of 2016

1774
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,959
I'm still not convinced

1775
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,983
Alex was convinced

1776
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:39,103
It's drop was going to wear through I don't think you wanted Trump to win

1777
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:42,687
Did he was a violent it be aware of

1778
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:43,455
The motto

1779
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,735
Ization benefits

1780
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,783
I'm possibilities if Hillary won

1781
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:51,647
Freak out

1782
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:55,487
It's going really well in that case

1783
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:59,071
Mmm Yeah as the night wore on Owen Shroyer

1784
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:01,631
Decided to get deep into pizzagate and tell everyone to

1785
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,703
Why you don't do this

1786
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,495
These marathons you can't

1787
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,519
These guys

1788
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:12,895
Have a completely controlled area of time that they will not say the worst

1789
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,663
Thing that they can

1790
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,943
Can say

1791
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,991
Just once you let him go on past that

1792
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:23,391
It gets wild early in his career at this point to

1793
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:30,303
Need to get this f***** up this is the end

1794
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,583
Infowars is

1795
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,607
Maggie's

1796
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:33,375
Fire

1797
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,007
Because she obviously asked

1798
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:39,775
The question

1799
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,055
Hey

1800
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,687
F******

1801
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:52,575
Straight up go there and back

1802
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,111
Number two

1803
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:59,999
Alright think we can see how that works this is also something

1804
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,303
You know it's kind of difficult to know

1805
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,839
How much is real how much

1806
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:07,167
The sense that I get sure but from listening to this

1807
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,447
Feels like Alec

1808
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,471
And Rodger

1809
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,495
Are both

1810
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
It's kind of like

1811
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,592
And then like Joe Biggs

1812
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,872
And Owen

1813
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,152
Feel like real believe

1814
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,480
Do you like Charlie actually convicted

1815
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,504
On this path

1816
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:27,392
I totally have no idea what's going on with very ambivalent about the whole

1817
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,160
At all

1818
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,952
Question which I'm proud of

1819
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,768
For tonight's too boring to figure out what he's up to

1820
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,840
Yeah this is weird

1821
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:38,144
But I think it was much more productive and much more

1822
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,936
More pleasant to look at then

1823
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,960
Intuit Ryan

1824
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:42,496
Get something about the present day

1825
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,568
Yeah there's another out of context dropped

1826
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,336
Just for fun

1827
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:50,176
Walking the dogs around here and I'm like the son of a b****

1828
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,248
What

1829
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,296
This guy

1830
01:20:56,832 --> 01:21:02,976
It gets angry when he's walking the dog is getting a he is a real Dumber level got a relationship with.

1831
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,792
He's got to yell at someone when he's out walking the dogs we didn't punch it

1832
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,376
Unreal

1833
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:13,728
Everyone out there I hope you're doing well and for our us walks

1834
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
I hope you folks

1835
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,520
Stay safe

1836
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,824
Yeah this is your election

1837
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,104
I will be back

1838
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,384
At the end of the week

1839
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:25,760
Bonus on Wednesday just to have some

1840
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,528
To put out but

1841
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,624
I just I really don't believe that we would have something productive

1842
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,672
