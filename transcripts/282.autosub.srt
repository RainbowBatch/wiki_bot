Go to give everyone a fair warning

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,448
Sing about the

6
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,240

Recover an episode of Alex's

9
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:13,568
The show that has

10
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,592
A lot of growth

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
Metallica

12
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:17,920
To say about

13
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,944
Child abuse

14
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
A lot of anti LG

15
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
Expressing

16
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,320
And if any of those things

17
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:25,856
That you were here

18
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,136
About I wanted

19
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
It's not Blind Side

20
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
I know Alex says

21
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,256
All sorts of horrible things

22
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,048
Pretty much any episode that we listen to but

23
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
Some of it today

24
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,864
Gross

25
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,704
You know you deserve to know what your

I guess

28
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,032
Take care

29
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,872
Controlling

30
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
Alex

31
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,696
Alex Jones

32
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:08,352
When was the last time you watch WrestleMania actually just

33
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
Skywatchtv

34
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,448
WhatsApp apps

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,752
You're a very nice time watch

36
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
Please

37
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,336
WrestleMania

38
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:27,040
I'd like to give a shout out to a couple of my favorite moments from the show

39
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,584
The Daniel Bryan was going to retain build

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
There was such a weird

41
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,960
Racial overtone to the building

42
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
People like

43
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
You don't become

44
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:52,128
Champion and stuff like that he lost

45
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
The weirdest

46
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
Storytelling message

47
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,832
I wouldn't put it past the WWE

48
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:07,232
I wouldn't

49
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512
Potential

50
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,608
Absent

51
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
I expected it

52
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
But I did not expect

53
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,312
Okay his whole character is that he comes out with his guitar

54
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,384
And the beginning of his run

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
You were come out and sing songs making fun of the city that he was in

56
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,416
For a bit and then people started to like him

57
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
So people started to like him he started to turn into a good

58
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
Good guy for a bit

59
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,448
The people who write the show couldn't figure it out and he's back to being a bad guy whatever

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,520
His segment

61
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:58,176
So what is he had a video there was pre-recorded video of himself playing piano and drums

62
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,112
Different videos interact with them

63
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,024
I think he's in the Ring The Ring playing guitar

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,352
Along with himself on drums and piano

65
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,168
It's so bizarre Lisa real

66
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
Wrestling has 80,000 people in Eureka

67
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:34,784
It was I loved it so much I thought it was

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,856
Absurd that the WWE

69
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
And then he got interrupted by John Cena

70
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,512
It was not to announce the musical

71
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
He was the Doctor of Thuganomics

72
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,616
Before before he was all about that like military and saluting

73
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:04,224
And stuff like that his character was he was a battle rapper

74
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
Exact

75
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
You recorded an album actually good songs on it

76
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
Batman is really good song party turn me around on my way

77
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
It comes out as the Doctor of Thuganomics characters

78
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
He's back in his old character it's fan

79
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,359
He comes out as a battle rap lines but he says to Elias

80
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,687
Leaves

81
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
I thought it was well-executed

82
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
Enjoy the hell out of it

83
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903

84
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,143

85
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:00,543

00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823

00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,895

Special wrestling

89
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,087
When I was 11 or 12

90
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,159
Even then I never would have expected a full-on music

91
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,255
That's amazing yeah it was great

92
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,303
And the fact that it was supposed to real

93
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839

94
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:29,983

The show episode

123
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:27,231
Ever getting anything that looks like Alex my body which was the struggle to figure out

124
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Microphone

125
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
No it's not specific enough

126
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,959
Today we are going over April 4th I was Thursday last week

127
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
We went different directions.

128
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
I was thinking of

129
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
Beam cam

130
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,831
You're talking about.

131
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,487
I told you that I didn't have time to get to the 5th and I didn't

132
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
I also didn't want to

133
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
For some reason

134
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Become very clear

135
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,727
Maybe we'll just devour Towing episode

136
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,871
Alex is in LA

137
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
All the Project Camelot stuff stinks

138
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,503
I watched an episode of Dave daubenmire like what am I even doing

139
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:26,623
Insulting a terrible show

140
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,951
So

141
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
See the moment of realization that you're at

142
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
You're what like 13 minutes

143
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
You're looking

144
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,751

145
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,567

You still doing plus I tried to make sure everyone's in the f****** Skype hang out or whatever

148
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,855
Very bad.

149
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
I realize like I was just wanted us to go

150
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Episode

151
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,631
I was just going to go over the part that people wanted us to talk about then

152
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Discover something else

153
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
Coming around on Cuban

154
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
I think people are kind of missing a little bit of the forest for the trees

155
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,807
She was going on in this episode then Alex

156
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Sort of

157
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Embrace

158
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,207
Thank you Ann.

159
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,303
I would have respect that

160
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,351
A little bit cuz I would be enterprising

161
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,495
Yeah it's

162
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
No no

163
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,591
Before Alex gets what he has

164
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,735
Say about you in on the rest of the episode talking about something that I

165
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
To go over

166
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
But we got it

167
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Fanza

168
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,111
You'll get why

Disguise themselves as clowns

175
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847

They heavily had their identities used multiple aliases

188
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,391
Massresistance was able to track them and find out their real identity

189
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,487

193
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,919
That's good to know ahead of time because I

194
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,735
Could end up leaving first of all people getting hurt

195
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
And second of all tube

196
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Possible author

197
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Study of Isaiah

198
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
Is that he doesn't know the details

199
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Adidas bacon

200
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
Stuff up to feed his narrative

201
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,607
Princess one of the people that talk about

202
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
I've committed their crimes at the agency

203
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,007
Concealed and possibly know what actually happened tonight

204
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
Probation

205
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Which seems like

206
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Not

207
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
Punishment

208
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
You'd get from the crime that I

209
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
Details of it and Alex can't either

210
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
Anita can the people that he's getting this information from

211
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
He's making a lot of assumption

212
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
In order to make his listeners

213
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
That's f***** up

214
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
Beyond that this is not the way I would have chosen to start this episode but I can only really follow Alex respond to whatever he throws in

215
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,495
In this case we see that he chose to lead off with talking to Real gross

216
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
About to drag queen Story Hour

217
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,127
Play major role in this broadcast from the 5th

218
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
April

219
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Friday

220
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
Honestly I turn the song like I told you my first nothing else to do

221
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
So here we are

222
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
What are the reasons

223
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
This is particularly off-putting is because

224
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Just make

225
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
Things up

226
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,071
He's twisting of manipulating a turtle of reality into something

227
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
Horrendously bigoted

228
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:58,751
Two drag queens associated with the Houston Story Hour the Houston drag queen Story Hour off

229
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
Have been revealed to be

230
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
Announces take this information

231
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
Commit a horrible composition fallacy

232
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,991
Anarcute that all of the Queens are there pedophiles and they're out to get you

233
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,367
Their number issues here just about any of this stuff

234
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Nothing I'm going to say

235
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,255
This episode at all is defending the idea of letting sex offenders be around

236
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
An unnecessary risk

237
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,423
And definitely is inappropriate

238
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
That is not what I'm taking issue with year at all

239
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Sincerely am

240
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,127
Mike has zero to do with drag queen Story Hour

241
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,687
It has everything to do with Houston

242
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,855
Drag queen Story Hour is not a National Organization with a corporate structure where the crew in each city has the same on different dates

243
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
Psych2go

244
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:51,487
There's a there's a central organization with independent

245
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Cities around the world

246
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:58,399
There's a page on the website where you can reach out and start your own satellite chapter if you want like a pretty easy process

247
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,471
In March when the first sex offender was discovered

248
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
The Houston Public Library released

249
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
The statement of the news

250
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
About this

251
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,223
In our review of our process and up this participant we discovered that we failed to complete a background check is required by our own

252
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Guidelines

253
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,039
We deeply regret this oversight and the

254
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
Make calls or customer

255
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
We realized

256
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,463
Running background checks on people who apply to run event

257
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,511
Is the responsibility of the venue

258
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:29,631
As of clearly discussed on the drag queen story hours website on the page about starting your own chapter

259
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:34,751
Call Ashley public libraries are schools may require a formal background

260
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
Check as this is awesome

261
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
For anyone working with children

262
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,383
That said we hope this is applied to everyone

263
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
We don't think drag performer should be

264
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,015
Be singled out for special as we have every right to participate fully in our community

265
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
So their position. It is

266
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,975
For everyone and we are apart of

267
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
So cool

268
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
This is the story

269
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,375
It's not a story of drag queens being sex offenders a pedophile

270
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,703
It's a story about inappropriate levels of screening an oversight

271
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
Specifically in the Houston Public Library

272
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,127
The Second Sex Offender that was just recently discovered and Alex's responding to

273
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,943
Clip also was involved in

274
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Houston Public Library

275
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
So that's my position

276
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
Is Alex and his ilk wanna complain about this complaint about is the Houston library not following their own person

277
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
That is it

278
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
That's the story

279
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
Plain and simple

280
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
It's so disgusting

281
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
And I

282
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
I feel the same way about it

283
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Not the same

284
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
In terms of

285
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
The way

286
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Used

287
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Feel like it

288
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
So similar to

289
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
A good guy

290
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
With a gun action

291
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,247
Protected Harbor

292
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Is that right

293
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
That you hear all the time

294
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Sure one time

295
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
Great I get it

296
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
You're going to try and pay

297
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
Painted as though this is what everybody

298
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
Can grow

299
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Of course

300
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Because there

301
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
And when you get a

302
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
Do large enough number of

303
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
It's going to have

304
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
There's going to be a certain

305
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
Percentage of a group

306
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
To have

307
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
People who are offenders

308
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
Yeah

309
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
You could do the same

310
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,855
For librarians or teachers are coaches

311
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,463
Absolutely

312
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
4

313
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,047
Is it a problem

314
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
For Sophie

315
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,679
That's what you want to do I don't know the stats on it but that very well may be the case

316
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:46,079
The other issue is that like the actual drag queen Story Hour organization

317
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
Know who all of the people who are poor

318
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
Participating in the events are

319
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,759
We're in communication with the person who's organizing like let's say

320
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Dusty Attic

321
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,111
Rabbit or whatever and then that person subcontracts out

322
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,415
The responsibility of finding people to

323
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
To be involved

324
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:05,279
In terms of oversight

325
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,607
It's not a problem with the event

326
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
Itself it's a problem with

327
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
Houston

328
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Houston has a problem

329
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
To paraphrase Tom Hanks

330
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,591
Another issue here is that the information Alex

331
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,151
Cuz working with is all coming from a group called

332
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,735
Which the splc list of anti-lgbt

333
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Everybody

334
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,783
Until there's good reason

335
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:32,415
The group was founded in 1995 under the name parents right Coalition of parents rights coalition

336
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,231
Resistance in 2000

337
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
When I roll

338
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
Nicole government became clear

339
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,167
The word mass in their name is short for

340
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
And in 2003 the Massachusetts

341
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,799
Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage should be permitted

342
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
And then Governor Mitt Romney was reluctant

343
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,639
Start a fight over the issue

344
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
Which really pissed off homophobe

345
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
Like this group

346
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Bathroom sets

347
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
Who's all equal rights

348
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Expression of governmental

349
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,415
Massresistance passing themselves off as proof family as a group

350
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,487
But if you scratch beneath the surface at all or just look at the surface

351
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,327
It's super clear that all they really give a s*** about it

352
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Meteorites

353
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
And access to abortion

354
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:20,287
Bi-State supports conversion therapy which they call reparatives therapy

355
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,479
Which is the same complaint that they have about straight

356
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,599
Their president Brian has a weird habit of comparing

357
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,647
Support lgbtq rights to Nazis

358
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,463
Like when he said he wanted lgbtq activists

359
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Destroyed

360
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
Because they quote

361
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,839
The concentration camps if they could

362
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:49,983
Or when I don't know about that much more

363
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
Benign

364
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
The matter

365
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
Do the Jews in 1930s

366
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
40

367
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,991
The Christians now

368
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:06,367
These people are a bunch of assholes

369
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
I don't know his bills are like

370
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:17,119
Also in October 2008 48 year-old Michael Alessio an employee of massresistance

371
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,447
Trouble for creeping around outside West Middle School in Andover Mass

372
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,495
The truth and taking pictures of stood

373
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,567
I'll reach you from Andover Eagle-Tribune

374
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
This is actually kind of

375
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
I mean it's not cuz it's kind of creepy

376
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,527
If there's anything that's pretty funny on this episode is going to be played

377
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:39,391
Please set the incident happened at West Middle as students

378
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,279
School has parents watched alivio parked his car got out and began taking many pictures of the school in the students

379
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,607
Police received a flood of 911 calls from parents

380
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
I'm suing the school called

381
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,495
A gym teacher tried to talk to Olivia who fled toward the high school police said

382
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
When police call him

383
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:02,687
West Middle School

384
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,247
Almost

385
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
Whatever

386
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:12,671
Okay so he fled please call him believe you said he was taking pictures for a documentary and he would

387
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,487
If you would not elaborate on it

388
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,047
Lieutenant

389
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,655
Olivia was ordered to leave the area because police had no reason to detain him further

390
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
Erratically

391
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:32,383
After yards on 8th Street

392
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
Closing is he ran police set

393
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,991
Get removed several items

394
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:43,391
Before officers finally caught him on North Main Street

395
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,535
Quote he was not completely naked

396
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Clarify

397
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:57,215
So this guy who's working for bass resistance their argument on it there was like a gay-straight Alliance

398
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,799
Meeting it was happening at the high school

399
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:05,151
I still think your buddy

400
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:14,879
Great guys what are you doing this is my

401
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:19,744
At least he has that he has no reason to be at the middle school

402
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
That's the other part of it

403
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Yeah

404
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
That's weird

405
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Bipoc

406
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:32,288
I don't know I don't know what is

407
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,848
Can possibly know except for

408
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,944
Beyond

409
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,504
2018 post on their own webs

410
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,832
Their own website

411
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Resist

412
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
Some kind of admits to being alive

413
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Quotes

414
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:56,096
Our side concocted the bathroom safety male Predator argument as a way to avoid uncomfortable

415
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,656
Lgbtq ideology

416
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,960
I'm still fire up people's emotions

417
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Pittsburgh

418
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:10,688
To just save the evil shoot you're doing it's not real we just wanted to

419
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,040
Avoid these

420
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:21,440
We wanted to avoid but still play with people's emotions bulshit the demonized bunch of people in really

421
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
Got a lot of people hurt

422
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,304
And I made people feel like

423
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,144
Non-human things coming out in 86

424
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Just being like

425
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,752
Hey guys this whole Welfare Queen I baited up

426
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,288
Roman Reigns

427
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Bulshit you may notice

428
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
This is like the day after the

429
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
I'm sorry what sort of a breakdown of like

430
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,480
Can we do better what

431
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:48,320
And I don't know why they put it on the website

432
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,488
Kind of doing a pretty similar thing here as it relates to the drag queen Story Hour

433
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Speed now I did

434
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,656
Uncomfortable murdered

435
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
To do it for me

436
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:10,848
And I didn't have a conversation about that

437
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,712
The kind of dicks were behind the reporting that Alex is operating off

438
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,296
You know we have a guy who ran away from school

439
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,720
Organization

440
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:33,888
Well it does appear that there are two sex offenders who were involved in a drag queen Story Hour

441
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
That is not good

442
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
There's also no justification

443
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
For demonizing the LGB

444
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
Community are drag queens with that information

445
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
Which is that Alex is going

446
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
Proceed to do throughout the

447
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
This entire episode

448
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,248
As we know that highlighting Tupac

449
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
Seeing people like Alex never really matters

450
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:55,648
He's doing is identical he accuses the left of doing today

451
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
Bloody murder but how you can't blame all gun owner

452
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Which indicates

453
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
But you understand that it's not right to

454
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,936
Group therapy

455
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,984
He knows what he's doing is b*******

456
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
Doesn't

457
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
Because it creates

458
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,336
Emotional appeal to get his audience to hate

459
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
Screw that he wants them

460
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
For his own

461
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
That's what that brings up

462
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
With what the actual

463
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,112
We can't have a conversation

464
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
About

465
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,184
Lee's Dragon

466
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,024
Angry whenever you start calling people names

467
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
So what we're going to do

468
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
That's going to give us a

469
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,936
Foot-in-the-door to call everybody

470
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,496
Let's put it up on her website

471
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
Link to master

472
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
Regret

473
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,872
Going to be fun

474
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
We can

475
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
For Alex

476
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,296
Talking about qanon towards the end of the episode

477
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
Is important

478
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
Recognized

479
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
Proper context

480
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,208
Pedophiles a slippery slope

481
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
To believing in Kiawah

482
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
Miss reports

483
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:13,472
And they're organized out of New York City directed in England

484
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
France

485
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,032
Belgium Sweden

486
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
They are

487
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,712
By convicted murderer

488
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
They are commanded

489
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:31,136
By Sinister individuals you cannot make this up

490
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:37,280
Their Facebook and Twitter pages when they're together a party they look like women

491
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,352
But when they go out it's in full

492
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,632
Disguise

493
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,448
He's just talking about like a drag

494
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
High performance outside

495
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,824
I have multiple aliases

496
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,408
Yes they have drag names

497
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,784
It's not like some sort of a nefarious thing to hide your identity

498
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,552
As much as it is

499
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
A persona

500
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,368
Or whatever

501
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:09,024
Wrong about the the run out of New York

502
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
Because it was based

503
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
Originally

504
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
San Francisco

505
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,448
Actual

506
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Group

507
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
That runs

508
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,824
The operation

509
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
Edwin about that

510
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
But

511
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:30,016
I'm not sure where he's getting this information about the story our being convicted murderers

512
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,928
I'm like to dig into where he could possibly be getting that information from

513
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,464
Open where are you

514
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
I think that he

515
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
He thinks that Michael Alig

516
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,544
The guy from Party Monster you know that the guy that movie is based on

517
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
He thinks that he's behind all of the

518
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,408
Okay I don't see any evidence of that

519
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
I don't know that's one possibility

520
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:10,720
I like that you know everybody's got to diversify their portfolio

521
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,584
Call correctly Alec. Manslaughter

522
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,656
For that was a murderer murderer

523
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,704
Resume let's

524
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,288
The only other possibility I can come up with

525
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,128
Is he's referring to a September 2018 blog entry on Christian Post

526
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
The story hours

527
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,296
The blog post includes discussion of Ho Chi mochi

528
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,112
A drag queen who described their Persona as quote

529
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,672
Your resident killer clown from outer space

530
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:47,328
This is also covered all over right-wing media including post

531
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,448
This person whose Persona is it killer clown from outer space

532
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,752
Literally

533
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
Killer Klowns from Outer Space is

534
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Persona

535
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
They're not having

536
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,016
James Bond

537
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:11,136
Yeah I mean if you believe they're killing you also have to believe they're from outer space so

538
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,952
I can find

539
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
Like it was

540
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
You wanted to be fed more

541
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,584
8 Souls

542
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,984
I can find no other indication other than the Michael Alex

543
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,056
Don't think the other connection I can make in my mind

544
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,384
Even progressively anti-lgbt

545
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
Groups

546
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
There's a convicted murderer

547
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
Who's commanding the drag queen Story Hour

548
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:43,136
If I were the people organizing these events I might consider suing Alex for what if we get another case of

549
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,976
Yeah because he needs to defend

550
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
That's a claim

551
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,560
That's that's something that is not okay

552
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:01,312
Situation

553
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,616
Investigation turns into harassment

554
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,200
Galaxy might be doing this to yourself again

555
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,016
If at a certain point

556
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
Start sending out

557
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,320
Two people who should

558
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,136
Through lots of heavy breathing

559
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:19,744
In terms of people getting a little bit about the story hours though I submit

560
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
Do you Pat Robertson

561
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:27,168
He got on his show not too far backyard the 700 Club and he decried the mainstreaming of the lgbtq

562
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:30,240
Community comparing it to what happened in Sodom and Gomorrah

563
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,312
This was the original crime that led to the destruction

564
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,920
Sodom and Gomorrah in ground

565
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:42,528
It's not just a library that's going to be in trouble it's the whole population

566
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Judgment

567
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:48,160
Robertson when almonds

568
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,440
But they're reading books

569
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
The children

570
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,792
Official version of inclusive diversity

571
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,816
Give me a break

572
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,376
If you read the Bible there were a couple cities

573
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,656
Where are they actually

574
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,472
The men tried to have sex with a male figure

575
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,752
God destroyed those City

576
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,800
So Pat Robertson

577
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,640
Started insisting that this will bring destruction to all of us if we allow it to

578
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,456
If you think about it that justifies

579
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
Hurting these people or

580
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
Running

581
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
Killing them

582
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,440
Father

583
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
Tells the mob to

584
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
Rape his two daughters

585
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:30,912
If I remember correctly you remember that part

586
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
You got arrested back in

587
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,104
February for showing up to the freed Montrose Library with a gun

588
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
In an attempt to stop

589
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,920
The drag queen Story Hour

590
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,712
Attempts to stop it

591
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:48,832
He was a self-described trump supporter and claimed he was being arrested after he had to

592
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,672
I got arrested and you said it was because

593
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,744
Live stream

594
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,536
Can you hold a gun

595
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,608
Open the air

596
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,656
He did you add a concealed carry permit

597
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,472
So it's just a

598
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:10,080
Is it a real weirdo

599
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,128
As a police spokesman explained

600
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:16,224
He was previously banned from filming children at the library

601
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,016
Has been known to cause disturbance

602
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
Several officers had to escort him out

603
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:25,696
So he's up at Middle School

604
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:29,536
It seems like a bit of a creep himself

605
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
Library

606
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,120
Another

607
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:41,056
Words or learn from my two-year investigation down these roads

608
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,640
Allergic to reading

609
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,176
Eddie Pickett

610
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,760
Might be bringing attention to library and I could see that

611
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,904
Alex

612
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
Remember last episode

613
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,792
Kind of seemed to be imagining himself as of Christ

614
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:07,680
For a second

615
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
Just cosmology

616
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,848
I want you to remember that Alex likes to say that he's only in

617
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Interested in

618
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,920
Non-offensive violence

619
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,736
When someone bites them back

620
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,784
This matches that that world

621
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
Dodge

622
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
God has instruments

623
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
Start a list

624
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,752
It's a riddle

625
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,080
Not only for kids you got strung up while you're done

626
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,664
We're going to terrorize

627
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
Like

628
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,016
Because you

629
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,344
Deserve what you've done to these children be done to you

630
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,624
That's Christian

631
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,256
We're hunting you

632
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,816
You're not hunting us we're coming for you

633
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,400
We're looking for you

634
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
We're hunting you

635
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
We're seeking you

636
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,360
I think you figure that out now haven't you

637
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,920
All your threats all your crap

638
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,184
It's hilarious

639
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
In killing people

640
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Hilarious

641
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,352
If what you want to chill

642
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:45,984
Cliff especially parts of it we're hunting you all that sort of

643
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,520
We're going to terrorize

644
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,568
Lyncourt

645
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:57,760
I know that I'm starting to listen to Alex Jones in the present-day especially through the prism of History

646
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:03,648
Like I've already become detached from the precedent

647
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,720
I wonder how this will sound like

648
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,000
All those clips are like

649
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:13,888
Like real bad present-day Alex

650
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,728
Dysplasia

651
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
Shooting

652
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
Somebody or something like that

653
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
Lakeland

654
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Terrible

655
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,920
Possible outcome

656
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,224
You hear him saying stuff like this

657
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,040
You do understand how houses

658
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
This process works

659
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
Or is Alex or like today

660
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,440
Do you know the kernels of

661
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,536
Like what is what is the role of

662
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
Like the radio host

663
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
In Rwanda in 1990s

664
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,656
Early night

665
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:51,776
The people who were like

666
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,360
You know that this is how the process works

667
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,896
These people who are in

668
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
Encourage

669
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
Quote unquote

670
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
The illusion of a lone wolf

671
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
Do sorts

672
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,296
Alex has a Rolex

673
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,624
I remember growing up reading the Bible

674
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,440
Turn the other cheek

675
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
Forgive even those who

676
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,912
The thing that most people leave out of

677
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
Unless you really feel like I

678
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
I told you that I want

679
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
Gather up

680
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,432
There's read text

681
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,784
Then said this is a riddle

682
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:42,208
It was this this was also in The Hobbit I believe there was The Riddles in the dark is my real

683
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,232
Where's my real

684
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
What is bloated

685
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:49,120
Drunk claims to be exacting Vengeance for the Lord

686
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,704
Steve Bannon

687
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:00,896
So if Alex is in the middle of reading a list of like news articles

688
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,432
About

689
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,968
Get out

690
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
It's just

691
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,552
Describing to Muslim

692
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,624
Atlanta news

693
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Don't point out

694
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
That the people who committed

695
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
These crimes are Muslim

696
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:18,048
That I take particular issue with which we will discuss

697
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
A couple seconds

698
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
My mom's

699
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:35,968
Even here there from that

700
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,552
The article that Alex is referencing as hiding the fact

701
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,344
The perpetrators of this crime

702
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,648
Is actually one of the articles that we went over

703
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,464
When we were discussing the reality of the group

704
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,328
How to play around the world

705
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,864
Well Alex is correct

706
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,960
The headline doesn't identify the gang members this woman was victimized by as Muslim

707
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
That fact has brought up in the six

708
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,288
Sentence of the article

709
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,336
Is mentioned repeatedly throughout

710
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,920
The only conceivable way for someone to think that they were covering up the

711
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
The fact that these

712
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,504
Particular criminals were Muslim

713
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,552
Would be too literally not even

714
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,088
Try to read the article

715
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,136
They just assumed that headlines are all that

716
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:20,000
Now it Bears repeating that this article was written by a survivor of one of the

717
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
These games

718
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,304
Her perspective is being

719
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,352
Respected by how Alex is using this article

720
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
Quotes

721
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
In Mainland Europe

722
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,728
Conflict surrounding immigrants and refugees

723
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,288
Has been fueled by stories of women being raped by migrant

724
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,592
People have been calling for violent attacks

725
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
Anymore

726
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
Declared war on his

727
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
If anything

728
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,528
Ryzen 80 Muslim hate will probably make groomers stronger their conviction

729
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,832
The drive ordinary young Muslim men

730
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,880
Toward fundamentalism grooming gang

731
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
And terrorism

732
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:52,000
The Survivor even directly discusses Alex's good buddy Tommy Robinson

733
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,792
His bigoted group the English Defence

734
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,936
Quotes for Tommy Robinson and his followers to focus on an entire religion interpretation

735
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,240
Of some scriptures by some people

736
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
Is unhelpful to Save-A-Lot

737
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,640
Most grooming gang survivors I know absolutely condemn anti-islamic

738
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,200
And we're uncomfortable with English Defence League protest

739
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,272
We certainly don't want random attacks on all Muslims

740
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,576
You can't cure harm with more harm

741
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,392
How to pretending to be standing up for Victor

742
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,720
Louie's Prime

743
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,744
The entirety of Islam

744
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
And the way he's doing it is

745
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
Particularly

746
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
I mean really think about the

747
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,936
What he's doing is taking the first-hand account of a survivor of the crime

748
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,216
He's so upset about

749
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,264
Lying about it by pretending to that account

750
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,568
Cow covers up the fact that the perpetrators were Muslim

751
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
Then arrives at a

752
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:43,968
Conclusion that isn't direct opposition to what the writer a survivor of this crime advocate

753
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
PS4

754
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,040
This is an abusive level of non journalism

755
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,368
And just so clearly indicative of what he's all about

756
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,024
It's impressive in its cruelty and inhumanity

757
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:04,192
Cuz he's he's taking her account and just say f*** it I don't care what you actually say

758
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,216
Use you as a prop

759
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,752
Well that's because she's

760
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,920
Because they're mustard

761
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
It's because they wrote

762
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,784
Violent Islamic

763
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:27,744
Here we enter the. Of the show where Alex is going to just start rambling about how

764
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,304
Azar

765
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,400
This will go on for a while you'll get interrupted by having a guest

766
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,192
It was a terrible

767
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Confirm everything I can

768
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,776
Until

769
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,056
Taste of things to come

770
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:45,408
Tennessee shocking footage

771
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,200
Give him a roses

772
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,272
Red roses

773
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,368
Raptor box

774
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,696
I have can I have puppies

775
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,792
It's all coming up ladies and gentlemen

776
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:08,448
Children

777
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,264
You forgot they're from outer space

778
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,616
Liberalism

779
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,176
Oh yeah

780
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,832
Infowars.com

781
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:39,936
It's pretty gross

782
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:46,336
That's for family grows that the content of the advertising or separate

783
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,736
Can forth between the human voice like

784
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
Because back

785
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
And for

786
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,088
That's crazy

787
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:03,488
Exactly the same voice uses rally and stuff like that

788
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
Material

789
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,632
He's like a road dog who has a s*** axe

790
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,936
It reminds me of

791
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:20,640
If I'm getting a correct later too old

792
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,920
Combination of

793
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,968
Very real disgusting

794
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760
I thought

795
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,064
Being surrounded by this

796
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
Ironic

797
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,904
Look at how much fun

798
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
Like listen to those fake laugh

799
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
S*** like that

800
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
If you heard that was the first

801
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,328
If that was the first

802
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,376
Clips of Alex is that you

803
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,680
It wouldn't surprise me at all if you were like

804
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
He's just being a

805
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,568
He's he's doing this

806
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,616
You guys are just overreacting

807
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,384
Cuz you're all

808
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,223
Maybe because of that

809
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
Play come on

810
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
Yeah

811
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:05,183
Yeah supposed to be funny

812
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
I don't think

813
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
Maybe it's just because I

814
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,167
This is funny.

815
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,751
Our alliances B at Wrestlemania

816
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
I don't know

817
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,103
Not much else about it

818
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,663
Consistently

819
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
Because you do not laugh

820
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
Whatsoever

821
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
My jokes are

822
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,551
Terrible smile

823
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,207
Question like do do some people have such bad sense of humor

824
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,487
That they think that's funny

825
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:46,143
Must be a possibility but I don't think I think it's supposed to be for comedy I don't think it's worth

826
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,167
Perfect I think it's for

827
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:49,471
Like like directly demonized

828
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,079
He's trying to make that the argument between people

829
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:58,943
What does a snarl

830
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,783
Beat it into the ground

831
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
Not a joke

832
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,671
It's

833
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
But what you don't know

834
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,767
It's not over there the demon

835
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,559
They're also a pedophile

836
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,863
To take assault

837
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,263
Army pedophiles

838
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,591
Other supporters rushing is clown

839
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:33,247
Would you want to know about it what you want to stand up against

840
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:39,135
Would you like one

841
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:47,071
People showing world they're willing to do whatever it takes

842
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,631
Father Lucifer to give them power

843
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:54,239
Probably dodged another defamation lawsuit by just saying Local Houston

844
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,567
The news and that's saying what

845
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,103
Detect the only thing

846
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,943
Comes close to approximating that is articles that people have

847
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
About the idea of

848
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,207
And awareness in contact with people of different Lifestyles different

849
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,999
Different races

850
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,303
Different heaven

851
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
To not have

852
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
Whatever

853
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,471
Take over in your mind

854
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,495
You can't have

855
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,311
Take let's say just on a very simple level

856
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,127
You can't fix it all

857
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,175
Construction workers are stupid

858
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,223
If when you're younger you mean

859
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,039
Construction workers who were nice then thoughtful

860
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,367
And kind have a positive Association

861
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,183
With the construction workers

862
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,743
Victor stereotypes won't be able to Panda

863
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:53,119
That's the argument of kitten while they're young

864
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
Is ever been used

865
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,679
Not in terms of like

866
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
You got a

867
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,543
Spread around their experiences

868
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
So they don't turn in

869
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,103
Horrible

870
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,967
Bixby

871
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,503
Stewart's original

872
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
So whatever

873
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
Don't

874
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:12,831
I don't

875
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
Can't be

876
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
That obviously

877
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:22,047
People killed because what you are doing is

878
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,119
Waco Thibodeau book in episode

879
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
People

880
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,447
An army of clowns raping kids

881
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
They don't have

882
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,711
Is well if Aaron Army

883
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
Make our own Army

884
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,271
Bright

885
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,807
A preemptive strike because

886
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
Lauv

887
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,351
But yes that is exactly the messages trying to put out

888
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,911
Not realize that that's going

889
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,007
Kill doesn't care that's his place in this game

890
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,871
Courthouse

891
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:12,223
But does every possible in order to inspire violence

892
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,503
Out of people listening

893
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
Toward the group that

894
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,295
Target

895
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,087
Is without Jones

896
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:21,183
This role is it reach its natural conclusion at the end of this episode

897
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,975
And it's profoundly f***** up

898
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,767
And way worse than anything that has two

899
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
To do with you or not

900
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
Well I mean

901
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,607
Qanon has the potential to be

902
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:33,471
That's okay with you

903
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
Isaac is secondary

904
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,055
To what he's trying to do to me

905
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,151
And he's doing it with the help of this group massresistance

906
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,711
And so at this point Alex has

907
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
Since on

908
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,135
There in Massachusetts

909
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Stretch

910
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,255
Massachusetts

911
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,047
But have since grown

912
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,143
National

913
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,447
Notably Nigeria

914
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,799
Has a foothold massresistance influence

915
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
Gay

916
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,407
I meant over there

917
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,943
Hellboy

918
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,247
So Alex has Tracy Shannon

919
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,855
And her first

920
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,951
I would say that the interview where she argues

921
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
I think

922
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,999
I think witches are doing

923
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,559
Is that the First Amendment does not protect

924
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
That drag

925
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:44,895
Adult sexual sexual

926
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,943
Bunch of man dressed up like demon clown

927
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:58,463
That's right that's right that's not what it's supposed to be Forex

928
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:01,791
Disagree with the

929
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,583
The speech or whatever

930
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,119
As it's not of course

931
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,143
The First Amendment doesn't

932
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,167
Protect

933
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
People

934
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,263
Anal sex offenders being around children

935
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
Of course not

936
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,823
That's not what anyone would argue

937
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
But

938
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,687
The only thing that you can really be responding to his like I don't agree with this

939
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
The First Amendment doesn't

940
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,271
Apply here because I find it objectionable

941
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,343
Is she wants to open that box then of course

942
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,879
Good luck ever having a

943
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
The only thing

944
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,071
React react

945
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
They're always like

946
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,143
The First Amendment doesn't protect this

947
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,167
The First Amendment does

948
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,007
Before we even start with any of those arguments

949
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,031
Before you start doing this

950
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
In

951
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,079
Single serve

952
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,383
If the right-wing wants to f******

953
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
Put down

954
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:53,247
A goddamn list of what the First Amendment they think protects and doesn't

955
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,807
Might be interested and we can have a conversation

956
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,599
Blind items

957
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
That

958
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
Realize how

959
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
Hypocritical

960
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
And stupid they are

961
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,303
Someecards

962
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,655
I would I would I would love that it's really stupid

963
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,959
Taken at 8

964
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:13,983
Core

965
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:20,383
What she saying is that the First Amendment doesn't allow people to wear clothes that I disagree with them wearing

966
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:27,551
Where is Tulum

967
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,111
Others would hate so you are going to

968
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,183
Bring the force of the government into legislating

969
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,511
Articles of clothing that are appropriate for people to wear

970
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,815
And I don't think that

971
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,095
Should be allowed to wear pants

972
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,983
Concerned about that

973
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,007
Side effects

974
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,311
Queen Story Hour

975
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:53,151
Begin with just drag it out to

976
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,175
To drag King

977
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:59,295
But like yeah

978
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,831
You're going to

979
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:05,695
Is create I don't know a brutally repressed his authority

980
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:12,095
That has authority over things

981
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,823
People from lewdness of any and all these horribly against unless it's the Tyranny that upholds his bigoted

982
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,127
And the positions that he wants to

983
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:24,895
Siberian Forest

984
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,943
Which is the status quo

985
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,247
White male supremacist

986
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,271
Sex

987
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,807
Hegemony

988
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,575
It's just for the kid

989
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:37,951
Look at them

990
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,719
They're allowed

991
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
Blued

992
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:49,471
What's next

993
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:58,943
Behind type

994
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:04,319
Raymond if you grow their hair out so no one's confused

995
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,111
Also pink

996
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,463
Color

997
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,999
Oh no

998
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
Oh man

999
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:19,679
Going on is the Shannon

1000
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,959
What is involved in here

1001
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,007
Cheese

1002
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
Associate

1003
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
One of the people whose work

1004
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,479
Which is in this case

1005
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,783
I guess from everything I can tell

1006
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,647
I guess that what she did is okay in some ways

1007
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:46,047
Because because what she did is she uncovered the failing of the Houston library system

1008
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
So if

1009
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,119
She wanted to take this information that you found

1010
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,959
A demands that the Houston library system do a better job

1011
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,519
Actually do the things that are in their protocols

1012
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
To begin with

1013
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
To do

1014
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,359
I mean like that is

1015
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,407
Okay

1016
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,431
It's not okay

1017
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,199
Suzanne

1018
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,015
Take this and use it to haul quad

1019
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,295
I guess

1020
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
Attack

1021
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,111
A group of people

1022
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:14,975
Composition fallacy where these people representative

1023
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,279
Encourage

1024
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,583
Almost vigilante

1025
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,863
Like

1026
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,911
Because for example is being used

1027
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,679
Used as like

1028
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,495
We all need to be digging into all of these people

1029
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,567
And stuff like that

1030
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,871
So she's kind of discussing some of that

1031
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
Alex wants to

1032
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,527
Mother

1033
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,807
Grandmother's doing in

1034
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,647
Unless you're supporting Isis show critical supporting you

1035
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,487
I want to talk to you about putting you in charge of operation

1036
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:52,351
Because I don't have that much money but I got enough money I think to bring down a couple hundred of these guys

1037
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,143
Which

1038
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,727
Yeah coming after you again that's going to play well later

1039
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,871
Corollary for me would be somebody who

1040
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,407
A picture of a

1041
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,175
Cop with it

1042
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
Uniform offense

1043
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,295
Right and so you report that

1044
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,599
But that doesn't mean that I think

1045
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,159
Down every

1046
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,535
Every single cop the whole point is that they're so screenings

1047
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,583
System it's not really that

1048
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
Screening system

1049
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,887
Should be

1050
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:32,287
Define failing

1051
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:40,735
And you got the problem that you ostensibly are upset about

1052
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,319
And if you don't focus on the things that can actually make a difference

1053
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:49,439
It does reveal that you don't actually care about the thing that you're presenting is Karen about

1054
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,487
What you care about is attacking a group

1055
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,767
That's what you care about

1056
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,071
This is another situation

1057
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
What are

1058
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,631
What do you think

1059
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,679
The world looks like

1060
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,215
Massresistance

1061
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,031
What is the world looks like

1062
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,823
If you'd if you do whatever you

1063
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,919
Call lgbtq people in camp Camp

1064
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:17,343
Absolutely open it's wonderful because

1065
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,623
Cuz then they'll be able to

1066
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:25,023
Wonderful Christian Society once they get outside

1067
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
Be clean

1068
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:33,215
Productive neighboring countries that are animist

1069
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:38,591
Will be declared war on those countries

1070
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:44,735
Absolutely allowed them to waste their land

1071
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,599
Pretty quickly once

1072
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,183
You think about whatever they would do if they could

1073
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:59,839
It's not it's not all Christian people

1074
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
Against

1075
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,447
The specific behavior

1076
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
So just to be clear on that list

1077
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,543
We fall into

1078
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
The Trap of

1079
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079

This lady is representative of 99%

1081
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,855
To remind people listening

1082
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,647
Fall into those

1083
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,927

1084
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,999

1085
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,791
A whole different

1086
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,815
Different

1087
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,887
And they should probably keep their clothes on if they're running away from

1088
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,911
Middle School at hopefully

1090
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:37,983
They would

Is literally say it Alex

1092
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,831
Both believe

1093
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,855
That LGB

1094
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:58,719
Leaders from both house but from what I know about pedophiles

1095
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,255
They're there their feet

1096
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,071
Stop

1097
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,095
Going after show

1098
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,079
Especially down here and use

1099
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:20,479
Terraces attitude that you can't even scrutinize I think that applies to all of lgbtq community

1100
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
All of them

1101
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,535
Right

1102
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,863
Lgbtq

1103
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:43,263
We know what he's talking about

1104
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,311
Tri-community

1105
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,359
Which seems to apply do you think it is

1106
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,383
Subsection of it

1107
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,663
So that's great

1108
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:54,527
It's great really shows the card so what she thinks she's working

1109
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,879
Which is why this ostensibly okay thing

1110
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,647
Which is

1111
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,695
Doing the oversight Houston

1112
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,743
Library system failed to do

1113
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
Turn zinc

1114
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
Credibly bad

1115
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,839
Because your motivation is not

1116
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,631
Fixing the holes in a system

1117
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,911
Or or

1118
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,447
Doing secondary check

1119
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,727
Or whatever

1120
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,799
What you're interested in is is demonizing

1121
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
People in the LG

1122
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,895
And that's the

1123
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,943
You're going to go

1124
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
We're going to be f***** up

1125
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
As we already

1126
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,063
She's allowing herself to be

1127
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,343
She probably thrilled to

1128
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
I'll be doing it

1129
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
Alex

1130
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,743
To do his

1131
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
Is

1132
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:40,607
Inspirational terrorism basically

1133
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,383
Maybe

1134
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,175
Demonizing the entire LGB

1135
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,735
B2q Community pedophile

1136
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
She could

1137
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:01,855
Yeah I probably get into Pilates

1138
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,255
I'm doing these classes

1139
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,023
But they're free

1140
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,495
People afford it

1141
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,615
Tracy Shannon is a member of this math resist

1142
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,687
It's been particularly involved

1143
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,967
What's the drag queen Story Hour

1144
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,759
In October 2018

1145
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,575
She probably lost you trying to get all these three hours.

1146
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,879
Violated The Establishment Clause

1147
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,927
That lawsuit

1148
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,975
Dismiss

1149
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
Whatever

1150
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:49,215
Progress in the legal system it appears that you switched tactics

1151
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,751
Decided

1152
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,543
Into the realm of propaganda

1153
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:58,431
Twitter account before she got involved at this Hospital

1154
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:02,527
Tweeting out everything that's in line with the meat that media Spears narrative

1155
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,367
Interesting Lee she seems to retweet almost everything Charlie Kirk Twitter

1156
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,159
Which is an impressive level of

1157
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:13,535
I was going to dig in and try and find out more about her but after seeing this little glimpse

1158
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:18,911
Remembering that she's involved in the group it literally admitted on their own website that they makes it up

1159
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
Community

1160
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:25,567
I realize there wasn't much of a point looking into her more we kind of already know whatever 2 weeks to know here

1161
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,359
We don't know her

1162
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,383
Yeah

1163
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Alex

1164
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,967

1166
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,295
And their mayor in specific

1167
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:44,255
Thank you we can use it here and everywhere

1168
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:55,263
Bison Odyssey more ways than one form I-90 from enforcement

1169
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,055
Well imma stop right there

01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,943
Do everything basically

1171
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,735
Everything basically

1172
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,759
What

1173
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,087
Sylvester Turner the mayor of Houston

1174
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,111
I guess

1175
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,975
Applying at Sylvester Turner

1176
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,255
Tina's compromise

1177
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:18,815
Story hours

1178
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,863
In the lgbtq community in general

1179
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,679
In order to make this claim he brings up a 27

1180
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,751
Super Bowl in RG Stadium

1181
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,055
There's a little Scandal around that's

1182
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,615
Super Bowl as your funds from the

1183
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,639
Up from Houston

1184
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,431
Tri-Cities tourism board

1185
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:37,247
To pay for himself and 16 guests to attend the game

1186
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,063
However that story was reported by Houston's

1187
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,087
ABC affiliate

1188
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,623
Currently a month after the Superbowl

1189
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,927
So not sure how that could be used to blackmail him

1190
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:48,255
That's just like a like a

1191
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,535
Get out

1192
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,303
It came out

1193
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
PayPal

1194
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:58,495
Rationalize

1195
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,519
These people got tickets

1196
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,335
Are just order something people like that's malfeasance

1197
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,103
Music

1198
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,383
They were moved along

1199
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:08,991
I think it's standard fare government corruption I'm not boring I'm not for it

1200
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,271
But it's not enough

1201
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,575
That's the corruption where we're like

1202
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:18,975
You're a scam you know what we're 50/50 on doing it ourselves if we had the

1203
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
I'm not ignoring it

1204
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:24,607
If I lived in Houston I might be more upset about it but it's not

1205
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,143
To make the argument that he

1206
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,679
If your piece of evidence

1207
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,959
Vicky's

1208
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,751

1209
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,871
Ashley

1210
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:42,015
I have my suspicions that what Alex is really doing here is trying to attack the sincerity

1211
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,087
Official who's changed their position on LGBT

1212
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:45,855
Tissues

1213
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:50,719
In 2005 Turner voted against allowing gay and lesbian people from being Foster

1214
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,279
The 2002 band

1215
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
Same-sex marriage

1216
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:59,423
As recently as 2013 he quote voted against the proposal to gather statistics

1217
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,703
On bullying Institute

1218
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,983
Incident

1219
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,799
Based on sexual orientation and gender identity

1220
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,103
Which is part of what got him 8

1221
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,383
Equality text

1222
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,943
However he's since changed his to

1223
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,759
Passover 2015

1224
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,039
Equality

1225
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,343
Asbury vocal Advocate about

1226
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,623
Supporting complete koala

1227
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:22,463
When

1228
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:30,143
It's not most Americans called over the last 10 years on lgbtq

1229
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,959
People evolve what we want people to do

1230
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,847
Uncle reading maybe than 2015 he was running for mayor

1231
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,919
Where is before he been a state representative

1232
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,503
Your tenure whose position was far less vulnerable to having shity position

1233
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:50,879
Might be a little bit of a cynical explanation for it

1234
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,159
What are the case

1235
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:57,023
Alex can't allow the possibility to exist that someone was anti-lgbt

1236
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:01,375
Then learn more about the issues talk to people most affected by those positions

1237
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,679
And then decided to change their ideas

1238
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,447
And their position

1239
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,751
That's threatening to his world

1240
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:11,871
He has to introduce the idea that anyone who comes around

1241
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,407
Supporting LGBT

1242
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,943
Is most likely being black man

1243
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,991
It's a really dumb idea

1244
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:21,343
But one that's low-key far more dangerous and Insidious than it might first

1245
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,879
Like that

1246
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,415
You can probably breathe fast

1247
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:29,279
Compromised or whatever

1248
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:31,583
Is the fact that he changed his position

1249
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,655
These issues

1250
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,191
It's from the idea that you

1251
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:36,959
You can't

1252
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,263
The idea that you could listen

1253
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,823
Make you feel differently

1254
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,871
I said it's because their brain

1255
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:48,735
Or their blackmail.

1256
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,807
Listening to

1257
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:57,951
Instead you just replace that idea with no no this guy

1258
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,487
Is blackmailed

1259
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:06,399
It's weird you know over and over and over again to be a state representative

1260
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:09,471
And he was really anti-gay

1261
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,495
When he started talking

1262
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,591
Did try to talk

1263
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:18,431
Nevermind

1264
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,223
Now and I don't have to

1265
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:20,991
Just think about it

1266
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:21,759
Everett

1267
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:25,599
You might be kind of that idea

1268
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,903
You might be asking a little bit of

1269
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,671
Like how does this

1270
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
Is blackmail

1271
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
Ception work

1272
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,255
Like what is Alex actually talk

1273
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,791
What's the pipeline

1274
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,327
A black male

1275
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:40,959
Squaw Valley

1276
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,239
If this is Ludacris

1277
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:48,639
Iraq

1278
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
Battles

1279
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,735
The avatar

1280
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:54,783
Research

1281
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,647
He's describing gay people

1282
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,695
It's especially people were at the club

1283
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,719
Yeah

1284
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,583
From all of those drugs they're not even there

1285
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,119
There are a vessel for this entity

1286
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,655
See this demon entity

1287
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:16,287
To come enter them his research has shown that

1288
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:19,615
By the lgbtq community

1289
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
Takes thousands of

1290
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,271
I would assume

1291
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,063
In order to become

1292
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,879
Dartford

1293
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,903
Only makes sense

1294
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,207
If you accept

1295
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:34,975
Horribly

1296
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,767
From owed overdosing

1297
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:43,167
And then implanted themselves in their bodies why Alex doesn't like walking

1298
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,983
Because you said that the gate part was

1299
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
Because of the demon

1300
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:53,663
Is dumb

1301
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,431
I'm not sure

1302
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,063
I don't know anymore

1303
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,599
This is after Alex

1304
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:05,951
It has played a clip of the Party Box

1305
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:12,607
That's what he's operating on yeah I think he's using some of those

1306
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,423
Those ideas

1307
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:20,543
To inform all of this. Cuz he did drugs

1308
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,871
I don't know about you.

1309
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:30,015
We have the conception that these people do all this

1310
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:32,575
Play becomes empty

1311
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,159
There their they're

1312
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:38,463
Cool kids

1313
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:42,047
I'm telling you folks

1314
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,007
And their arms above above above above

1315
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:59,967
Do you want we want access to children

1316
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:02,015
Zaxby's

1317
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:02,783
What is going on

1318
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:07,903
They're a bunch of people

1319
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,695
Become demon possessed

1320
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,231
These demons want

1321
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:15,583
So they blackmailed by the mayor's have to go along with it

1322
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,863
And they demand access

1323
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
People's children

1324
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:21,983
Drag queen Story Hour

1325
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
Not real

1326
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:32,735
It's Alex imagining

1327
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,807
In his even in his own telling

1328
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,367
Lgbtq people are the victim

1329
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,135
Demons

1330
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,183
They're not

1331
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:44,767
Alex is fine with that probably

1332
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,327
Nan demon eyes in Camp

1333
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,519
Ecstasy out of people's hands

1334
01:07:55,775 --> 01:08:00,383
Maybe you just really wants a favor of drugs is illegal

1335
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,431
Thea's

1336
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,503
Ecards

1337
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:08,831
Close

1338
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:14,207
It's all an appropriate even if we didn't find a pedophile

1339
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:19,583
We don't children do not have a job to validate

1340
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,911
Adult choices

1341
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:28,543
Intuit

1342
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,567
You showed

1343
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:33,407
Far too much of your hand when you said even if we didn't find

1344
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:36,223
Any

1345
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,039
Then this would still be bad no because

1346
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:44,415
The story that you're telling is about the sex offenders trying to make the point

1347
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,255
Be f****** furious about this

1348
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,279
Second

1349
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:54,143
These drag queen story hours are not about validating these people choices

1350
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,191
Or Lifestyles or identities

1351
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:56,959
Through children

1352
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,751
What it is about

1353
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,775
Tation of

1354
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:02,335
People of different identities different

1355
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,431
The kids

1356
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,199
CNBC

1357
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,223
People and not

1358
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,503
Thinking that they are so

1359
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,271
Something crazy

1360
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,575
Some sort of Boo Radley entity

1361
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,623
To be afraid of and run pass

1362
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,439
That's what a thing it is not about

1363
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,207
Those people

1364
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,231
Is about

1365
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:19,999
Children

1366
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,047
Not develop into being

1367
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,863
What they are

1368
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,887
Furious about

1369
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,447
Disability

1370
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,727
Turn on clothes

1371
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,031
And reading dr. Seuss to children

1372
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,847
Right when you boil it down that's what's going on

1373
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,151
It's not representative

1374
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,455
Free it's only representative

1375
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,247
Because of your opposition

1376
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:44,063
Right lgbtq

1377
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,623
Marginalized

1378
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,159
This would be nothing

1379
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,535
It's just telling a story

1380
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,815
Only

1381
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,607
Thing that's indicative of you

1382
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,631
Angry about this

1383
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,423
Is that they are already

1384
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:01,983
Yes

1385
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,263
That's what's going on

1386
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:08,895
Maintain the status quo that existed before

1387
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:15,295
Which is these people are invisible they dump public

1388
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,319
With scorn

1389
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,343
And derision

1390
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,487
I might

1391
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,303
I might be inclined in this direction

1392
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,327
Should be

1393
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,887
Be ashamed of it and

1394
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,471
Themselves and commit suicide

1395
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:37,055
Or we'll yell at them and then they'll pretend that we tried to

1396
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,615
What she's literally saying

1397
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,919
I don't care if anybody is a sex

1398
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:44,223
The only reason I investigated

1399
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,759
Was because I was already

1400
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,575
GoNoodle

1401
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:53,439
That we found a sex without sound

1402
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:59,839
The only reason I was looking into it at all it's cuz I needed more ammunition for court throughout my

1403
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
This is bad

1404
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:05,983
Alex

1405
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,263
For the dark

1406
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,847
This is not good this is a short clip

1407
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,383
But it's addictive

1408
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,663
Of what's coming up

1409
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,455
This is it really f***** up

1410
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:18,271
Drunk on the blood of children

1411
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,951
Fuchsia

1412
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,791
I can't make the faces they make it yourself demonic

1413
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,935
Let me have time with your children now

1414
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,751
Give me your children

1415
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:47,455
Call you racist

1416
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:53,087
I don't know what happened but if

1417
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,879
In the show is where I think Alex

1418
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,903
Really was like

1419
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:56,927
I'm going for it

1420
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:05,631
I've already said a bunch of horrible stuff

1421
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:12,031
Plays over my head

1422
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:18,431
I'm going to be as gross as I possibly can be

1423
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:22,015
Blood libel ideas drunk on the blood of our children

1424
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,575
This is classical anti-Semitism whether or not it's

1425
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,599
Directed towards

1426
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,135
People who are Jewish

1427
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,183
He's still the same ideas

1428
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
Used to be Menards

1429
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:32,255
Jewish people for

1430
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,631
Conception of the bad guys

1431
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,167
Which isn't good

1432
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:42,495
Here's where Alex

1433
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,263
Explain

1434
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:46,335
What he thinks the drag queen story hours are

1435
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,103
4

1436
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,687
Because he believes it's not about literacy and

1437
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,455
Acceptance

1438
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,247
People seeing each other as people

1439
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,015
That sort of thing

1440
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:54,783
No.

1441
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,319
It serves a role

1442
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:05,023
Not really might be resistance that something far worse

1443
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,815
That's okay.

1444
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,935
He's talking about one of the sex offenders in Houston

1445
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:15,775
That's

1446
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,311
Winfield

1447
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,895
A demon posing as a woman

1448
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,199
A woman against life that nurtures baby

1449
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,735
That was for babies

1450
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:29,087
The inner hell it's been rested

1451
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,951
Have you been I see you there

1452
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,975
Joplin tornado

1453
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:39,839
Is that in the Bible

1454
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:44,191
Adult men will stand against

1455
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,287
And one of the men watching the show stand before God

1456
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:49,823
Godzilla

1457
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,807
Because you wouldn't protect

1458
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,575
Children

1459
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,671
Trump pedophile dressed like clowns

1460
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,847
Tangles your children truck

1461
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:30,783
I want your children not to run with are the disguises

1462
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,551
Phantom

1463
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:35,391
Far even storytimes

1464
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,671
Learn to stop

1465
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,231
Grab.

1466
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:42,815
Yard cuz the kids moms asleep inside

1467
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,095
She worked two shifts

1468
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:48,447
Now bye-bye

1469
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,639
Open 2 a.m.

1470
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,407
It

1471
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,199
Pennywise fantasy

1472
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
I

1473
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:00,991
Cannot

1474
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,527
How funny it is

1475
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,319
I feel bad for that Mom haven't worked

1476
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,087
To shift

1477
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:07,647
Struggling economy

1478
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:13,791
You got a rapper

1479
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:19,167
The equation

1480
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:23,263
If you want up to heaven and God was pissed off he was like

1481
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,823
I do not know you

1482
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:32,735
Dresses when you get down there

1483
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:36,319
Conception he believes that the idea of this drag queen story time

1484
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,087
Our

1485
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:39,135
Is in order to make

1486
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:42,975
Kids not afraid of the people who are going to throw them in Van

1487
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,255
Later which is

1488
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,279
F***** up

1489
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,071
That is so f***** up

1490
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,167
I mean cuz it's just the way of repurposing what it really is

1491
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,751
The idea of acceptance

1492
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,311
Embracing

1493
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,335
People

1494
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,127
And making

1495
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:00,895
Sinister

1496
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,687
Which I guess is kind of what he does all the

1497
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:05,247
But it's

1498
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,807
It's so easy

1499
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,135
I ordered the connection between reality and his why

1500
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,159
Are so easy

1501
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,183
He defeated it's just

1502
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:16,255
It's so f***** up

1503
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:19,071
Two demonic ideas in the idea that they're only

1504
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Are your kids

1505
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,607
To be kidnapped

1506
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:25,471
How else are you supposed to respond to it like you said earlier in the episode then like

1507
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,751
We have to stop

1508
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:30,079
Obviously this woman for massresistance

1509
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,103
Ancestry

1510
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,663
She tried to do it through the court system

1511
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,759
What are you doing

1512
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,527
You got to do

1513
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,831
Stop

1514
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,159
Well that

1515
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:47,743
I didn't realize so I thought they were

1516
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,047
Like a preemptive

1517
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,327
Before they hurt

1518
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,911
They're actually saying that

1519
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,191
Reading itself

1520
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:00,031
Call Alex

1521
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,079
Might also

1522
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,127
I'm not going to love them in necessarily

1523
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
Because there

1524
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,943
So they still think it's a

1525
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,735
Defensive stray

1526
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:14,879
How is the grooming these children

1527
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:18,975
To be picked up in Vans later

1528
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:23,327
Get it in your head and it is not

1529
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,351
No

1530
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:28,959
It is what I would describe as absolutely

1531
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,543
Performing

1532
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,823
But also

1533
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:34,591
Does not like

1534
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:39,455
This is there's there's something that he's tapping into that is deep-seated within him

1535
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,991
Incredibly gross

1536
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,807
There's some blood Lively ideas in here to again

1537
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:46,111
But this is just absolutely livid

1538
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:51,743
Is a good pal

1539
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:56,351
Doesn't like President Trump doesn't like me

1540
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:03,519
Wait he's your friend and we can ride all day

1541
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,407
Torture your children

1542
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,711
Big fats

1543
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,575
The finger

1544
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:19,135
Not the name of the

1545
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,695
Epic Lounge

1546
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,255
Sit on my lap

1547
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,863
Georgie it's a Freewheel universe

1548
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,423
Stark

1549
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,191

1551
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,359

Enrich

1561
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,103
These statements suck off your child

1562
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,175
It's so much better than just giving a cancer because

1563
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:17,503
You're the parents are there with a child's dying from cancer from the vaccine

1564
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,831
I still have love it's just on special

1565
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,903
Domino's dungeons all along

1566
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:27,999
All the guys in clown outfits pullback with draft

1567
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,815
Looking for Russian dressing

1568
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,119
5 and abused

1569
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,031
Rip's that child

1570
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,847
Gut

1571
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:49,247
The blood off of y'all

1572
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,039
Coffee

1573
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,855
And then Dracula's women come in

1574
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,135
Pornstars

1575
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:59,231
Sexy women want to live forever, they just eat little pieces

1576
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,511
Sarms

1577
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,624
I'm not entirely sure what blumenthal's

1578
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,440
Involvement

1579
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:32,768
New York

1580
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,096
And there's the sort of the abortion

1581
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,888
Conversation going on there

1582
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,168
So I think that might be what

1583
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:39,936
Is relating that to

1584
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,960
That's f***** up

1585
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:42,752
Cuz I mean we're already in

1586
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,776
Situation where Alex

1587
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,080
I made these really Target

1588
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,360
Like

1589
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,896
I really hope nothing happens

1590
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:01,440
And believe them for sustenance

1591
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:03,744
Dracula

1592
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,024
Pieces and

1593
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,864
Blumenthal is their leader

1594
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,472
Alternate universe

1595
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:16,288
He is the single greatest trauma filmmaker

1596
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,688
He really got into The Narrative of it

1597
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:28,576
If he made that into a movie I bet

1598
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:31,136
I mean that was the plot of Manos the hands

1599
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,416
The Fate right I don't remember

1600
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,280
That's really

1601
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,608
Is incredibly

1602
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,376
Incredibly bad

1603
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,192
It's gross

1604
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,288
April laughably expensive

1605
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,128
It really

1606
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,944
What I'm more interested in

1607
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,736
I'm less interested

1608
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,440
Weird

1609
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:06,976
Assertive

1610
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,792
Fantasies about demons around every corner

1611
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:12,096
Inability or unwillingness

1612
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:16,704
Understand about it

1613
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:23,360
Which was I believe in full name of the the book right though the movie

1614
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:27,200
Registered in the real world effect

1615
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,552
When Alex starts taking call

1616
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,088
Here is a collar

1617
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,136
Who it is

1618
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:38,208
Starts off his call by talking about

1619
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,232
Now they're all criminals

1620
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,256
So we'll see where this

1621
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,024
What the f***

1622
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,352
Why is the left show a live Criminal

1623
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:51,776
And I think

1624
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,800
Shutdown

1625
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,336
A worldwide

1626
01:22:54,592 --> 01:23:00,736
Call Lindsay along probably criminal anthropologist

1627
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,296
Slaves

1628
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,512
Before you and I were on a planet and now it's coming to an end

1629
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:16,864
Try not

1630
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,680
What else to do or not going to be employable

1631
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:23,008
Guys Express

1632
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,568
Criminal operation the Democrats

1633
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,592
They're afraid that Trump

1634
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,616
Was going to blow that off

1635
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:30,688
Write this is an interesting idea and it'll come into play later

1636
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,736
Trump has finally taken down the nights

1637
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:36,064
Templar perhaps but just call

1638
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:36,832
After this

1639
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:41,440
They get into talking about the drag queen Story Hour and he had some thoughts about it

1640
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:47,328
Mike down for the cowboy that that doesn't

1641
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:51,680
This is also listen to Alex.

1642
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,448
Push back

1643
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,472
Against his ideas

1644
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,264
That is very important

1645
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,544
To Alex playing

1646
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,360
His role as the inspirer of terrorism

1647
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,640
While keeping his own hands

1648
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,016
Well

1649
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:12,672
Play the police in my eyes I'm being a cop

1650
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:15,232
Go to the school and Grandpa drag queen

1651
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:18,048
The parking lot and then disposal

1652
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:24,960
If you're in that school your kitten has not stopping it I should have the legal right to go in there and and then put you down

1653
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,056
Well bottom line for going to run their plates

1654
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:32,640
We're going to get them God bless you done

1655
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:37,504
He doesn't say how dare you you're at you have now on my show twice

1656
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,576
In two sentences

1657
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,392
You should have the legal right to murder these

1658
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:49,792
These people because you disagree with their lifestyle with her identity however you want to frame it whatever

1659
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:53,120
This guy

1660
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:59,520
He believes that he should be able to go in there drag them in the parking lot

1661
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,288
Kill them

1662
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,056
Where did he say

1663
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,592
I don't remember

1664
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,920
I'm like something that should be reported

1665
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,200
He should definitely not

1666
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,992
Yeah

1667
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:14,624
Barry Lee Alex has a

1668
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,160
F****** responsibility

1669
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,720
To be like

1670
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:22,560
He has a responsibility to say

1671
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:27,168
Absolutely not you do not have the right to kill people just because you disagree with them

1672
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,192
But you can't

1673
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:32,800
Because earlier in the show he said that they want to prepare your kids to be thrown in vans

1674
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,336
Ever going to drink their blood

1675
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,616
Beast on their flight right

1676
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:38,688
That's what I think can't exist in a moderate world

1677
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,712
It can't exist

1678
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,736
In a place where

1679
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:43,296
What your prescribing what you're advocating is

1680
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:47,904
Let's follow the process and make sure that the library is actually going

1681
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,440
Through with the background checks that there's

1682
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:53,792
Supposed to be going through so we can make sure that whatever potential

1683
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,328
Or whatever potential

1684
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,864
Possible

1685
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,400
Damage is mitigated

1686
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,424
Because

1687
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:03,776
Lick these people like the Houston library also put out a statement that was a

1688
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,824
We f***** up

1689
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,640
And all that stuff we didn't follow our own process

1690
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:10,688
But in that same statement

1691
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:15,040
We already have in place whenever there's anything that has to do with kids

1692
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,320
Any event with children

1693
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:22,720
Nobody's left alone with children ever already there were no complaints about any of these people

1694
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:29,120
Incident but we're not using that as like a way to say we didn't do it

1695
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,912
Have other safeguards in place

1696
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:35,520
Deep the conversation that Alex is having

1697
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,800
Cannot involve

1698
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,592
The correct conversation

1699
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:41,408
It can only inspire people like this guy

1700
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,456
To feel entitled

1701
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,480
To murder

1702
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:48,832
I think the same issue is occurring

1703
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:51,392
Whatever Precinct

1704
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,416
He's working for

1705
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:57,792
But the former cop

1706
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,584
Open place to keep these people

1707
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:04,704
Yeah I don't I don't

1708
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:09,056
They didn't go well I think there's an entirely also possible world is not really a cop and just

1709
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:13,664
Even Alex Jones caller so whatever

1710
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,248
Without consequence

1711
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,296
What should have

1712
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,600
Is I should be allowed to murder

1713
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:25,440
Because somebody read a story to my kids while wearing a dress

1714
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,976
Written into law that it's fine

1715
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:37,472
Yeah that would get on wieldy real fast

1716
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,152
Quite seriously throughout this episode

1717
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,944
Is putting a world

1718
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,224
The ideas

1719
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,272
The rhetoric that he uses

1720
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,320
One of the reasons is because it is

1721
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,600
Exists with that

1722
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,624
This

1723
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,696
Caller ID being on the show is not a surprise

1724
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:02,304
Now the caller expressing ideas like that is exactly what you would expect

1725
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,840
People who internalize

1726
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,400
To hear

1727
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,424
From what you saying

1728
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:10,752
So whenever you are saying earlier in the episode

1729
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:17,152
When you hear this stuff how can you not think you should kill these people because they are going to only your heart and your children

1730
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:20,736
White wait until they actually do the thing that you're afraid of

1731
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,016
You are cuz bending

1732
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:22,784
F******

1733
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,576
Child

1734
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:28,928
Why would you wait for that to happen you need to protect your child

1735
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,584
Kiryu making a leap

1736
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:38,656
That is inappropriate

1737
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,192
Because all we have to do is go

1738
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:43,008
Get to the end of the episode when Alex takes calls from his listeners

1739
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,312
Hear them having that exact same thought

1740
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,848
But not being afraid of

1741
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:49,920
That thought it's the right thing to do

1742
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:50,688
So

1743
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,736
Whatever that what I'm saying is

1744
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:54,784
This is just the worst

1745
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:04,256
Think if somebody called into was like

1746
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:10,400
Whenever he went you know what when trans people here that kind of rhetoric from somebody

1747
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:13,472
They should have every legal right to go and kill that person

1748
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,520
Send that caused the end result of his

1749
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,056
Behavior and his language

1750
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:21,664
Is going to be the murderer indii

1751
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,968
Community

1752
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,016
It's only right for them to get murdered

1753
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,296
The loss of recognized

1754
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:31,648
We wouldn't accept that if we had called

1755
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:37,280
If we took calls until Monday to call in with that we probably hang up on that but then spend 20 minutes

1756
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:43,680
Disgusting

1757
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:50,336
You have to recognize that that's a symptom of a major problem problem is something that you ever respond

1758
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,360
Ability to deal with

1759
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:55,456
Because you are putting out the ideas into the world that's making people think

1760
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,248
Do you have a

1761
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,528
Flight responsibility

1762
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,552
I believe

1763
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,600
To take a step back

1764
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,904
And have a bit of an educational

1765
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,440
Where do you like guys

1766
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:07,232
Things have gotten a little bit out of hand

1767
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:13,376
I know I said they were drinking blood

1768
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:16,960
But we live in a civilized society and if somebody's drinking blood

1769
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,496
You can't just go around

1770
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:21,568
It's almost like a thing where you got to be like guys this is getting out of hand

1771
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:27,200
Why you can't take whiteout

1772
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:30,528
Yeah of course I'm very afraid

1773
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,112
The idea that someone's going to hurt one of these

1774
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,136
People or kill them

1775
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:37,184
Are any of these stories hours

1776
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,464
Is

1777
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,744
We have a

1778
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,280
Clear example here

1779
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,328
Of someone thinking it's okay to

1780
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,376
Express that auto radio show

1781
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:47,168
Audit National radio show

1782
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:49,728
Discourse is so toxic

1783
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,008
So dangerous

1784
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,336
Even pushes back again

1785
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,408
It's not like he comes back from break he's like

1786
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:04,064
Wow that caller said something it's just allowed to exist

1787
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,088
Something that isn't

1788
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:05,856
Taboo

1789
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:08,416
It's not something that is beyond the line

1790
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:13,792
Yeah I'm so the idea that someone might think like that

1791
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:14,816
It seems

1792
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:16,864
Stay within the realm of possibility to me

1793
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,656
And it does happen

1794
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,192
I do hope it Alex

1795
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,216
Gets sued again

1796
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:26,080
Like I know that when we started the show 2 years ago I very

1797
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,640
Asbury insisted about the idea

1798
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,920
IFixit Alex

1799
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:33,248
Is that good

1800
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,016
Oh boy

1801
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:36,064
Hey that is changed

1802
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:36,832
I do think you

1803
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:40,160
You still was on the right side of it years ago

1804
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,208
Any longer

1805
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,768
Gino

1806
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,560
We know that hate crimes have

1807
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,328
Risen

1808
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,096
Dad

1809
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:50,144
If not exponentially

1810
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,472
Trump

1811
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,496
Fieldstone

1812
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,800
Energizing excited that it's almost

1813
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,872
Possible and more

1814
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,200
They were going to see a

1815
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,040
Real assault

1816
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:10,112
It feels that way we can't predict

1817
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,136
The future it doesn't

1818
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:11,904
Themes

1819
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:12,672
Rough

1820
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,440
It seems rough

1821
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,000
Call

1822
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:20,096
He brought up earlier that there's a thousand criminal record

1823
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:29,568
I guess it's the globalist whatever

1824
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:34,432
What do they call themselves the Jacobins

1825
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:41,856
Alex is stupid ideas of liberalism from from

1826
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:43,136
It's even

1827
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,976
I don't really care to engage with that

1828
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,256
I only think it's important

1829
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,536
It is another.

1830
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,560
It's a teaser

1831
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:54,144
You hear that sort of an idea to like

1832
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,680
It turns out he's into qanon

1833
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,728
After he brings up qanon

1834
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,008
Lisa Alex

1835
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,056
To clarify his position

1836
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:05,152
F*** you in. This is the same guy who said that

1837
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,432
If you should be able to shoot

1838
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:11,296
Aquino said a reading at the library because he disagrees with them

1839
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,320
You shouldn't be

1840
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:15,648
It is a surprise

1841
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,928
Wearing clothes

1842
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,512
Read not a surprise if that's what his idea is expressed by somebody

1843
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:21,280
Qanon

1844
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:23,328
Also not a surprise Alex

1845
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,608
Changed his tune

1846
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,544
Look like they're scared by like that

1847
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,568
I like that

1848
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,392
Manipulated

1849
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:50,464
By somebody close to me that I've learned was bad

1850
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,488
The key was bad

1851
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:59,168
Because what they said about

1852
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,848
It's tough to eat crow

1853
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:11,968
The issue here is I think what are you saying is Kursi

1854
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:19,136
Because he was super into qanon

1855
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:19,904
He was

1856
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,720
Decoding all the messages and stuff like that is writing a book

1857
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:25,792
About the event

1858
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,608
Started saving throw courses bullets

1859
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:34,240
There's a whole lot there

1860
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,520
And I think that Alex's

1861
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,568
Referring to that

1862
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:45,504
Bono

1863
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:47,808
You didn't know that there is

1864
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,832
Multiple cues

1865
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:52,928
Or something I don't know I don't know if there are but this is Alex's

1866
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:54,208
To be able to

1867
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:54,976
Except

1868
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,792
The bigger picture of qanon

1869
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:00,864
Still

1870
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:06,752
He disagrees with her is inconvenient for him

1871
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,520
Absolutely

1872
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:13,920
Suspect is really more of a marketing Ploy than anything else

1873
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:14,688
You're saying absolute

1874
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,016
Yeah you know I'm going to stay

1875
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,296
Exactly

1876
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,832
Before

1877
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,648
Tribute certain things to keep

1878
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:24,928
Whenever I want to

1879
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:27,232
And then caller can call in and say something

1880
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:34,912
But I think Alex also is probably signaling on snow in some ways that he's come to a point where you realize it

1881
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:40,800
There's a very real possibility that the qanon audience is bigger than his

1882
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,384
I don't know exactly cuz that's all

1883
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,688
That's all

1884
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,992
To eat crow but he hasn't figured out how to do it yet

1885
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:51,296
So we can assume that that's forthcoming at some point

1886
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:57,952
They'll do a big message about his exact position on Kiawah.

1887
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,864
As it is now I think there's some dangerous possibilities with this

1888
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:07,680
Like the idea of that and Alex

1889
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,704
Working in

1890
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,752
Concert more than they have been

1891
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:13,824
Could be f***** up

1892
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,848
It could lead to

1893
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,896
That's a pretty dangerous

1894
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:21,760
But we have to see how it plays out at this point I really don't think there's much to go on

1895
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:22,528
Because it is

1896
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:27,904
He's blaming Steve pieczenik or Kursi

1897
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,464
And now saying you going to

1898
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:31,744
Clarified later

1899
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,512
I don't know

1900
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,304
But

1901
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,352
A personal level cuz if we

1902
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,632
But then secondary

1903
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,656
Because now I got a f****** looking

1904
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,424
Qanon

1905
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:43,008
I don't want to do that

1906
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:49,152
Alex is out

1907
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,736
I'm going to have to go over

1908
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,720
When we know more we'll talk

1909
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:03,744
But

1910
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,024
Here's the interesting thing

1911
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:09,120
A little bit about what Alex used to say about qanon

1912
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,912
I have a little bit of

1913
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,448
Sort of Refresher

1914
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:16,800
Will recall 2018 on Christmas Eve

1915
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,848
Studio

1916
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:25,504
And you told the world that you told Rodger Stone

1917
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:32,928
Christmas Eve is hilarious

1918
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:34,464
If we go back to the Christmas Eve

1919
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:37,024
Prior Alex also got into Studio

1920
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,304
Edit message

1921
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,072
For the world

1922
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,424
But I am coming to the office

1923
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:45,984
Scream

1924
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,032
This emergency transmission on YouTube

1925
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:48,800
Facebook

1926
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:50,592
Facebook

1927
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,616
Because

1928
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,456
If this doesn't get made

1929
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,224
Attention

1930
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:57,760
This doesn't

1931
01:37:59,296 --> 01:37:59,808
Psyche

1932
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,600
Globalist have a

1933
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,624
Decent chance

1934
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,648
Killing present

1935
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,440
In the next two weeks

1936
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:06,720
And

1937
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,048
The necessary emergency alerts

1938
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:11,584
The Obamacare

1939
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:14,400
Really

1940
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,592
Now

1941
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,872
Your minds

1942
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,688
Never really spoken of

1943
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,224
Qanon

1944
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,016
Q anonymous

1945
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:34,624
What's going on

1946
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,392
Separately

1947
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,416
White House

1948
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:41,536
Fox News

1949
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,304
Forces

1950
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,632
He brings it up to be like

1951
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,264
Is is

1952
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,288
You know

1953
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:53,824
Whack It Whack

1954
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,616
Like at the real sources

1955
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:58,176
In this this next flight from that Christmas

1956
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:58,944
Steve show

1957
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,992
He brings up that you do cuz

1958
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:01,760
Started his

1959
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:02,528
The storm

1960
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:05,344
Before the storm

1961
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,624
The storm is coming

1962
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,440
Riders on the Storm Alex literally says that he

1963
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,208
He is the storm

1964
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:12,000
The storm is real

1965
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,024
It's called America

1966
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,096
Collecting

1967
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,144
Fulfilling promise

1968
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,008
So he's

1969
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,544
Making himself

1970
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,080
What the people who are listening

1971
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,872
Qanon are actually talk

1972
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,664
We are what you're talkin

1973
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:35,040
We are the change you want to see in the world with your piddly online qanon

1974
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:36,832
And the reason

1975
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,880
That he was on that tip

1976
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,928
And the reason that he was sort of dismissive

1977
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:43,488
Of Cuban on is because

1978
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,280
He is trying to push

1979
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:51,936
He's fake intelligent source as the real qanon and it's not taking off

1980
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,544
Pageant

1981
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,592
Could you play this radio drama

1982
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:04,736
Where's that came out and talked to him and got taken in by the FBI talk to Alex

1983
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:09,344
Depleted Morocco

1984
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,160
I meant Zach disappeared cuz the narrative didn't work out

1985
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,184
And I'm guessing exact

1986
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,464
Just kind of got tired of

1987
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:18,304
Play news role for Alex whatever whatever you was doing this is LARP

1988
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,352
Yeah that he was doing just didn't work

1989
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:23,424
So amazing that they thought it had a chance

1990
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,984
I don't understand why can't I think we're worth it

1991
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:26,752
Like I said

1992
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,568
Let's think about conspiracies

1993
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,360
Who are they going to go with

1994
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,152
As far as a conspiracy

1995
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,688
Qanon

1996
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:41,600
Zach

1997
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:42,368
Viq

1998
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,392
But yeah

1999
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:45,184
Also Alex other times building

2000
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,232
I'm not entirely sure

2001
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,144
So

2002
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,704
Alex was mad that

2003
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,008
Zach was not as popular as qanon

2004
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:02,848
And I believe that probably one of the main things that he had against

2005
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:03,616
Qanon

2006
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:06,432
Is that he had his own version of it that he was trying to push

2007
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:11,040
And that it wasn't as popular

2008
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:11,808
Yep it is

2009
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:16,160
But it's not

2010
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:18,976
Absurdist next question

2011
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,000
Expresses that was

2012
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,280
That his hopes

2013
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,560
Is not as popular as the other one

2014
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:28,192
Ears on the show ended

2015
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,824
Against some little comment about

2016
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,872
Qanon gets a million

2017
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:36,896
That's great

2018
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,760
This guy's known to us who he is

2019
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,576
His boy his face

2020
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,856
We talked to him

2021
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:47,904
He's onto gives us to stop exclusively

2022
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,864
Which implies that the other one is

2023
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,168
BBQ in all that is

2024
01:41:59,424 --> 01:41:59,936
Qanon

2025
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:00,704
Is fake

2026
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,984
Zach is the real ship

2027
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:05,056
Most of like what Alex

2028
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:08,384
Positions have been about qanon over the course

2029
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,408
Of his

2030
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,688
Against

2031
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,456
Is

2032
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,992
Zach is the real thing

2033
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,576
Let's get my Revenue stream involved here

2034
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:22,720
Disappeared and he experiences some of the feelings

2035
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,792
Zach is real

2036
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:29,632
Even though he's not

2037
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,704
In forged millions of Jews

2038
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,176
The reason that I bring that back up

2039
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:45,760
Is to show just a little bit

2040
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,040
Year in couple months

2041
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:49,600
What's your position

2042
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:52,160
Official editorial position

2043
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:53,696
Qanon

2044
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:55,488
I was

2045
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,864
So back in Trump

2046
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,144
Mobbed-up

2047
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,192
No

2048
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:06,752
Similar trajectory

2049
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:07,520
I thought you meant

2050
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,848
Because

2051
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,640
After Alex is made this point

2052
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,176
To the caller

2053
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,528
There's a good version of it

2054
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:21,088
No I got LED astray by people I trusted

2055
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:23,648
He tries to bring Zach back into the

2056
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,416
Proceedings

2057
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:26,208
He claims that he's on the phone

2058
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,512
But he never gets to him

2059
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,304
Because I don't think he actually was

2060
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,352
Let's go ahead

2061
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,888
Zach

2062
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,424
Looks like you just hung up

2063
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:41,056
So let's go ahead and talk to Grant in Iowa

2064
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,080
Sure

2065
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,616
Does not call back in

2066
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:45,408
And I don't think Zach was on the phone

2067
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,432
I think that Alex

2068
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,200
I was just trying

2069
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:52,064
To reintroduce the idea that had this guy who was his Realty went on

2070
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,112
People's memories

2071
01:43:54,368 --> 01:44:00,512
Cuz even right before he goes to him on the phone earlier just a little bit earlier he had said

2072
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,304
Indian called in like 3 or 4 months

2073
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,864
Yeah why hasn't he called

2074
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:11,264
Dropkick narrative

2075
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,288
Is real

2076
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:16,896
My Realty or not

2077
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:20,736
So there's some angles being played it might be a part of why you haven't figured out how to eat

2078
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:22,784
Kroger

2079
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:26,624
Position

2080
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:31,744
I'm interested to see where it develops but honestly I have no idea because Alex is now in Los Angeles

2081
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:35,072
That is making the tour through all of the death-squad podcast

2082
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:38,656
Going through

2083
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,704
Christ

2084
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,472
Doing

2085
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:46,080
Sales on Joey Diaz is coming up there at least

2086
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,360
Turn it down.

2087
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:49,664
Play this out

2088
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,688
Diminishing

2089
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:54,528
Quickly

2090
01:44:55,040 --> 01:45:01,184
So I'm not interested in any of those might listen to it but I'm not I don't have much interest

2091
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:05,280
I was doing an episode where he gets yelled at by Joey's cast

2092
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:12,448
I guess until

2093
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:16,544
I might bite the bullet and go ahead and do that but I'm not interested in it

2094
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:20,896
Message

2095
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:22,432
Something is important

2096
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,712
Point out because

2097
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:25,504
A lot of the stuff is stuff

2098
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,528
Seen before

2099
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:29,600
I cranked transphobia anti-lgbt

2100
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:33,184
Messaging the conflation of cross-dressing

2101
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,464
Queen

2102
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,768
Performance

2103
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,304
Folk

2104
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,120
That's horrible

2105
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:43,168
Rhetoric pushed out into the world

2106
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,192
Before but

2107
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:45,216
Bead Direct

2108
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,752
List of how much of this is

2109
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,032
He's trying to get people hurt

2110
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:53,152
And then the caller calling intake I should be able to kill these people

2111
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:55,968
I think is a new level of

2112
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,528
Demonstrable Danger

2113
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:02,112
Is perpetuating putting into the world

2114
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,136
Disgusting for that

2115
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:05,696
And then no one would have let us get away with not

2116
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:08,256
Talkin about Alex

2117
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:10,304
But it's such a small part of this episode

2118
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:13,376
Like it could in the future turn out

2119
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,400
To be something major

2120
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:16,704
Turtle of Alex

2121
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,240
Pivoting some narratives and

2122
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,776
And that being his new Direct

2123
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:22,336
Where we go one we go all done

2124
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:32,064
This could be a small blip and it just be a marketing Ploy on his part in some way to tap into a fertile Market

2125
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:34,112
That he feels he doesn't have access to

2126
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,136
Wolfie on that

2127
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:35,904
Yeah

2128
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,696
But what's up for debate

2129
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,464
Is how

2130
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:42,816
Dangerous the rhetoric of you putting out these David the drag queen Story Hour

2131
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:45,888
Our stuff is as a reminder

2132
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:46,912
None of this

2133
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:51,520
Is an anyway supporting or defending those two individuals

2134
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:52,800
Who are sex offenders

2135
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:56,384
Who are involved in the drag queen Story Hour

2136
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:57,920
That is that

2137
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:59,712
And a failure of oversight

2138
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,992
That is all that is

2139
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:03,296
They are not indicative of

2140
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,064
The group as

2141
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:07,136
I I really appreciate doing this

2142
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:09,184
Because it is

2143
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:13,024
I think I think it's really important to keep this in front of our face

2144
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,560
Citizen in front of his many faces

2145
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:18,912
Because there would be there is an absolutely

2146
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,216
YouTube like well we already know how he feels about

2147
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:24,544
We don't even need to we don't even need to talk about it

2148
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,824
Because everybody already know

2149
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:27,872
Really important

2150
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,920
Coming back up

2151
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:31,712
Just so you're always can

2152
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:33,760
Confronted with the reality of what

2153
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:37,856
People are saying about the LG

2154
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,208
Like you've heard him say

2155
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,744
Demons

2156
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,072
Such an ugly

2157
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:50,656
We've never never really see that be soaked

2158
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,424
Yearly

2159
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,264
Justifying violence

2160
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,312
Answer that does

2161
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,360
That does Mark a very serious escalation

2162
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,920
And I think that

2163
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,688
Could

2164
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:06,272
Is the basis of a lawsuit no matter what happen

2165
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:07,808
Something bad happened

2166
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,368
Very serious lawsuit

2167
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,440
Copper for

2168
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,464
Letohatchee

2169
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:18,048
We've reached the end of this and

2170
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:19,584
The back on Friday

2171
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,144
