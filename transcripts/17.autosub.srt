1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,280
I'm a policy wonk

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:07,168
And to give you a little bit of an introduction before we get into this episode

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,984
Tell you what's going on here

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,568
What's going on is Jordan

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,872
He's way too successful at stand-up comedy

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,432
And I have therapy one night this week so we could

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,224
Could not find the time to record

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,528
Luckily for you and for all of us

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,856
I have this episode that I'm going to release today that I recorded

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
Pikachu back

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,184
With my friends a very funny comedian

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
And

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,024
I'm excited to be able to release

14
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,304
For you

15
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,376
I'd give you a little bit of context recorded this episode

16
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
A little while

17
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
And I did not

18
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,216
The time to

19
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,520
Release the episode and

20
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,824
In the meantime like right after

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,872
Justin and I recorded this episode

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
When I was about to release it

23
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
We needed

24
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:55,040
Emergency episodes

25
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,064
It had to be done

26
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,880
You know how it is

27
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,208
There's a forward momentum in a natural narrative that sort of Taken

28
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,000
The shape with Alex Jones Is Life

29
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
You know we can

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,352
Marches forward sometimes things

31
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
The cop by the wayside but

32
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm glad we have this opportunity

33
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
2

34
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,032
Double back a little bit was cuz I think this episode was great

35
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,080
And I think you're going to really enjoy it

36
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,128
Hilarious

37
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Tastic

38
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,712
Episode of a couple things

39
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
I wanted to

40
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
Get off my chest

41
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
First

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,368
Is a very exciting announcement that I'm not going to make now

43
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
What's Jordan does get back

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464
We have very exciting enough

45
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
Do I give you

46
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
And I look forward

47
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
To telling you about that I don't know why I'm

48
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
Teasing it now but

49
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Who cares

50
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
I wanted to take a moment

51
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
To acknowledge

52
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,544
That may have been a little bit off

53
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
In my interpretation

54
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Of the last

55
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,896
Whip from the February twenty

56
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
Ford SHO

57
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,480
Where are listen back to it and number of time

58
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
Mostly out of insecurity and

59
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
I fear that I had

60
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Misinterpreted

61
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
I think I might

62
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,648
I think it's entirely possible that my analysis

63
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
This was off

64
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
I'd literally off

65
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
But spiritually

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
I was not wrong

67
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
What he says is still horrible

68
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
What he says is absolutely

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
Indefensible

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
You should never

71
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
Ever encourage people on Twitter

72
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,728
To harass

73
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
Anybody

74
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,288
Especially about someone else's

75
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,592
Children so

76
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
The context of that is

77
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,432
Absolutely unacceptable

78
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
Inexcusable Behavior

79
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
But

80
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,296
I am big enough man to recognize

81
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
And publicly admit

82
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,112
That I might have gotten

83
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
Some of the

84
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
Particulars about what he was saying

85
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Slightly off

86
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
To my credit

87
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
He does swallow some syllables

88
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
Pretty Solid Ground I think

89
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,288
Feel better now that I've got that off my chest

90
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
But

91
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Oh well who cares

92
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
I am going to feel better here in about my

93
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
Because I've got this episode

94
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
To share with you

95
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
I hope you do enjoy it

96
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,296
Again just thank you to everybody who's been getting on board

97
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,368
We really appreciate everybody listening tweeting out

98
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,464
Stormy night here in Chicago

99
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
And I've

100
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,280
Waiting to do laundry all night

101
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
Someone's been hogging the laundry machine

102
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
Only thing that makes me feel better about the fact

103
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,936
That I have to go to work

104
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
Tomorrow in dirty clothes

105
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,824
Is the fact that I know that you guys are going to be out there enjoying this episode

106
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
And that means a lot

107
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
Here we go

108
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
Let's get to the episode but you know until

109
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
Jordan gets back

110
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
And we are we

111
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
We meet again

112
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
F****** policy walk

113
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,792
Alexandra Thurston color

114
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,352
Everybody

115
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
Sitting here in the studio with the replacement Jordan

116
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
Very much ready to

117
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,968
Take a journey through a day in the life of Alex Jones listen to a bunch of

118
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
This particular episode

119
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
But you were telling me before we started recording

120
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
You have you've dabbled

121
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
In the world

122
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
Trips to the battlefield of the Infowars

123
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
College

124
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,607
Sure

00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
W years

126
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
Which was like a great time to be radicalized

127
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,031
Did you like young you have feelings

128
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
Make a difference you're definitely right

129
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,639
Yes you are so right you know everything

130
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
And you're not Bounce It All by jadedness

131
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,599
Or self-consciousness of your ideas are young enough wasn't real to you

132
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Perfect

133
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903

00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Either way

136
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
And then I had one buddy

137

141
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,287

You don't keep up with it

164
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:11,199
I strongly recommend that you don't

165
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,783
Don't think I told you the last time I really got into a big was like

166
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
Recently was like yesterday

167
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
Joe Rogan

168
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Sure

169
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,231
That's kind of like required lesson

170
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,559
Yeah I was I was listen to Joe Rogan

171
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Unlike I have that his

172
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
Always be a funnel

173
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
Yeah

174
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:36,287
With Rogan but if you see Alex Jones on Rogan you got Alyssa

175
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
And I'm glad

176
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,639
We did we did a huge breakdown of that

177
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
How much of a drunk

178
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,503
Idiot Alex

179
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,343
So hot did you watch the video okay

180
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,927
Utopian like I take these headphones off and he's like slick at his hair by yourself

181
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
Things you don't know is actually Alex

182
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
No matter what

183
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
What temperature is it

184
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Studio

185
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
Has a crazy

186
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Eartip

187
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
Okay you're in a really weird way compulsively

188
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,263
Headphone stuff I think was actually his ear itching

189
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
Okay

190
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,359
I've done some research into what causes ear itching

191
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
End

192
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,479
Nothing definitive yet

193
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,271
I have to be

194
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,903
It's got to be all psychological

195
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,487
What is a signature product that we are almost certain Isabel

196
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,327
What is this thing is it are you a force

197
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
What what's the metals for some metal

198
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,543
Silver

199
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
A couple of advertising

200
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
A product here as we go along

201
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,967
Today we're going over with the event

202
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,527
Of February 7th

203
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
On the Alex Jones program

204
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
He starts the show out

205
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
With a little bit of

206
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
Showing of his Humanity

207
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
Okay there's a there's been a death in the family

208
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
And you take a little moment

209
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
The show 20

210
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
To honor that

211
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
And then quickly

212
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
Take it into a weird

213
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:16,895
Crashing through the lies and disinformation is Alex Jones

214
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:23,295
Information

215
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,927
Today the breakdown

216
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,511
Taking place against corporations

217
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,119
A out-of-control oppressive

218
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
Technocracy

219
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
I think that's all

220
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:03,743
Mother was almost

221
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,583
Weather

222
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
I want to pause for a second

223
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,215
You know I would never make fun of someone for

224
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
Giving it up for the relative and

225
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
I feel very

226
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Sad for his loss

227
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
I mean that very sincerely

228
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,943
I'd I'm not making a joke of this at all

229
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,039
Sorry for your loss

230
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,391
She had breast cancer for about 6 years

231
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
That's not the butt

232
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
There was

233
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,607
Just bad timing on my

234
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,031
Six seven years ago decided to not be operated on

235
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,103
And that she would just go home and God was ready for

236
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,711
Almost 93 years of age last night

237
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
Where's our word Savior Jesus Christ

238
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
Love so much and you taught me so much

239
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,327
For the 30 year old woman

240
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
Call Schatz

241
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,215
But my mother was four years old and

242
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Brother was

243
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
That

244
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,895
Paralyzer almost killed her and took her

245
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
And then I think about the sv40 cancer viruses that were vaccine as well

246
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,439
How they soft kill my grandmother

247
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
Yep it's vaccine method

248
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,423
Turning into an anti-vaxxer

249
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Cool

250
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
I mean

251
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,199
If their plan is to kill everyone in there

252
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
Early 90s

253
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,575
60 years after taking a bath

254
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:09,695
Three more planning on 6

255
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:15,327
3XL Sophie

256
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
Again I don't want to block

257
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,935
The death of Alex Jones's

258
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
Cuz getting that

259
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
Missouri

260
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
I don't know what

261
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Seem

262
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,919
Is going to paralyze you for a couple years and then

263
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
You're fine

264
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
I meant give you cancer

265
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Decades

266
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,807
After I don't know I don't

267
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,343
I don't think that's

268
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
I think

269
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
BBQ

270
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,975
Pinkity possibly attributing coincidence

271
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
Or something

272
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,095
He's attributing nefariousness to Quinn

273
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
You know something that just happened

274
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Like

275
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
104

276
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,311
Sure so you can literally just be like

277
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
You could just take someone's death

278
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
Which is a guarantee

279
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
Well that's

280
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
I was just being alive

281
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,303
I would like a I wish I'd done some research on this number in front of me is how many people live

282
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
I'm sure it's a shockingly low percentage

283
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
No I think is like the average

284
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Like 70

285
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,287
Sixers my bad yeah

286
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
After that

287
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
It's like

288
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
Huge

289
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:37,759
Zips down very quickly how many people who have been soft killed

290
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
Live

291
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
That's

292
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,391
Genius vernacular acrobat

293
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
He's perfect at that sort of thing

294
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,655
Yeah I have the dirty.

295
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Kill

296
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,751
It's just like cuz it getting

297
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
It's just one of those things where it's like

298
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,151
You know like you could you be like what people are getting vaccines and not dying

299
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
The soft kill

300
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,759
Yeah

301
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
Disprove that

302
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
Everything is on

303
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Disprovable

304
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
Oh man what could be

305
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
Do you think

306
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
But he can take this

307
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,519
This eulogy for his grandma that turns into an anti-vaccination message

308
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,335
Triple Lindy

309
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
And somehow involved

310
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,223
Fly products the Oklahoma City bombing being fake

311
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
Near-death experiences

312
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,343
You can work both of those in

313
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,415
Hoping that he does cuz I don't want to be right

314
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,999
Because to me then it's just fanfol Maasai don't want it to turn ugly into

315
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
Iodine

316
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
You said

317
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
Early 1950s

318
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,079
In the early years old

319
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,455
Military

320
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,015
As well

321
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:21,183
I just think about how magic it is to have

322
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,999
Progeny into the future and I'll be one of their ancestors

323
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
I just want to deliver

324
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
I really can't say no my favorite was the meaning of them

325
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
But it's it's

326
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,551
No one asked to do on your political

327
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,599
Globalist program

328
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Which of your grandparents is your favorite

329
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
Well you know what

330
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,791
Cuz he wants off killed

331
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887
And I hope spiritually

332
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,703
Resonates the plane

333
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
Would God

334
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,591
Has Fallen

335
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
She was very very few days ago

336
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,551
Conscious talking about

337
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
So she believed she was already in heaven

338
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
Marine Corps sniper in veteran helicopter pilot investigator best-selling author

339
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:51,039
And he died from cancer

340
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:03,583
God

341
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
That same

342
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,911
Near death or death

343
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Experience

344
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
Just know there's a lot going on in this world

345
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:17,407
But I just want to know that I love her and I appreciate it and I can still feel her presence now so I can feel

346
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
My first grandparents went Jerry Jones my dad dad

347
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,063
6 years old

348
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,463
I will carry them forward with me I hope my children will carry force my energy in my spirit

349
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:35,327
Genetics and so let's just all think about our fallen grandparents

350
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,399
Of course our parents and everyone would love

351
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
But you know

352
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
Is beyond

353
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:56,831
So I think that would be a great opening segment if he cut out about 2 minutes in the middle and that last

354
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,135
Fart

355
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,487
If you wanted to just jump on the show and talk about his grandma great but do you know

356
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
I don't I don't

357
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Can I get on board

358
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
You politicizing the death of a 93 year old

359
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
It's so much

360
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
Yeah it's dance

361
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Yeah yeah

362
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,823
You know we can't really

363
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
I made a mistake

364
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,063
In the same way that he made a mistake over the show that has well

365
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,927
Never want to do that

366
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
Some like real polish

367
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
Okay let's bring it on

368
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,047
This is he doesn't bring up his grandma again for the rest

369
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
The show

370
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
So we're fine

371
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
This is

372
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,703
About people being

373
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Mickey

374
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
Forgotten government

375
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
And

376
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
The mediator

377
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,151
Trying to be full of s***

378
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
First off

379
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,039
There's a

380
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Trump

381
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,999
And pretend that he's discredit

382
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,847
Trump has agree with their overwhelming Lee document

383
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
Trump is his own person

384
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
Because I don't want to sit here and make

385
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,255
But everyday I see scores of these articles

386
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,399
But the media is covering up terrorist attacks

387
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
The Washington Post

388
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
For myself Paul Watson

389
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:59,967
Countless others but they only show screenshots you can't go see it for yourself screenshot

390
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
We go show

391
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,135
Where police seized the FBI

392
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,815
Is Trump has troll the media

393
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,631
We spoke at Central Command Florida yesterday

394
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
Headquarters

395
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:22,239
Because he knows they'll bring all this out

396
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,567
Also I want to tell you that deposit any point

397
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
Okay if you have any thoughts

398
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
Feel free to jump in

399
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,199
This this is insane

400
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Cuz

401
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
I mean

402
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,343
The argument could be made that the headline Infowars is behind

403
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
The stuff you saying

404
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
They kind of

405
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,463
That they support the same thing the trumped-up

406
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,767
Not necessarily the Trump got it from them

407
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
The other is that

408
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
That was some shameful s***

409
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,615
Go over that list

410
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,919
They misspelled San Bernardino

411
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,479
Oh no he misspelled the word attacker

412
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,319
27 * 3

413
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,111
I'm in a bunch of the bunch

414
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,903
Almost all of it was cover

415
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
5

416
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Mainstream media

417
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,791
DS maybe Undercover

418
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,095
Where do I sign on fatality knife attack

419
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Yeah that's

420
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,943
I don't know man that's weird it's like

421
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,271
Yeah it's like you said it's I don't know

422
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
Armenia's just like the normal media

423
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
In terms of like the 24-hour news

424
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,535
Yeah like there is shady s*** going on

425
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
In the government

426
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,351
Like there's not enough

427
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,911
For you to have hours of programming

428
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
Deyana

429
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,751
No that's true so you're going to have to be like grass

430
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
A straw

431
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,335
He's going to fill 4 hours a day

432
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
Does salmon temp

433
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,687
Like so

434
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
F******

435
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
How is this about Oakland

436
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:17,696
Everything that happens has to be about something

437
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:23,072
In the narrative this comes up

438
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
We think that you and everybody else was

439
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
Suggested that

440
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
Is being way too generous

441
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
I don't think

442
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
He blocks out

443
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
What time at all

444
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,616
Is essentially a ring

445
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
Yeah

446
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,968
That's for sure

447
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Alright

448
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,296
I've got to fill 15 minutes here you like

449
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Buckeye got to

450
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
Advil 4 hours

451
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
Everyday

452
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,904
Every single day

453
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,488
But I mean

454
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
Future of

455
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
Information

456
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
And whether we turn the

457
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,168
I mean that's his issue right is it's like

458
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,984
If someone is genuinely like heck

459
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
I want to give a voice

460
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,080
Independent Mail

461
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
Right

462
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Great

463
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,712
Those things like hardly ever exist

464
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,016
Cuz for them to exist they have to be like

465
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,904
What they cover is accurate what they're covering is important

466
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
Blah blah blah

467
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
Sure

468
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:26,304
You could argue that like maybe they don't cover avmc because of like corporate interest

469
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,352
Sir because of some other interest that's like

470
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,656
Dubious or just money

471
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
Yeah

472
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,728
That's what he positions

473
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
I'm just being honest

474
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
Spotify

475
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,384
Your your message is

476
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
Conspiracy

477
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:45,504
So you have to fit everything into that box and its global

478
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
Yeah everything has to be about.

479
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,904
We've documented at least

480
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
Totally

481
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
Tons of Lies throughout just

482
00:22:55,488 --> 00:23:00,864
10 episodes of the show we've done so far that really like Justin

483
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,168
Encapsulated for me was from something from back

484
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Play Jones watch

485
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:09,056
Or regular like believer like I always

486
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,104
Was like okay but still fun

487
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,664
So it's not like I was ever like

488
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
Escaped

489
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:21,088
The church

490
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,648
Story about

491
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Like

492
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
Is basa

493
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,096
Is the it's the gay shrimp story shrimp story I do not remember

494
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
Chemicals into this

495
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
River

496
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,936
Turning the shrimp

497
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
Gay

498
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,568
And returning an actual shrimp shrimp In this River

499
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Well here's the thing

500
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,920
Is it based of real science

501
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,712
Pesticides

502
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
Runoff into the Stream

503
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
They have

504
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,576
Do you want to call it

505
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,904
Estrogenic qualities and they

506
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,232
And so much so that these small species only like a shrimp

507
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,304
Flip their species female

508
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,888
A female so they can't reproduce

509
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:12,032
Okay about in like biology classes in college about

510
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
Pesticides

511
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,640
Getting on like unreported their damages and it's

512
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,944
Causing these problems and it could be causing

513
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
2

514
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
Uptick

515
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,504
Can breast cancer

516
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,392
Bring me a real kind of issue that is alarming in an undercover

517
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
Undercover

518
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
But he turns it into

519
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,768
It's turning the shrimp gay

520
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,560
Course and they're doing

521
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Because they wanted

522
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
Experiment

523
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Turn Oscar

524
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:43,776
So then we don't reproduce

525
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,312
To keep population down

526
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
Antenna

527
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:52,736
Trim population to like whatever their number

528
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,440
First of all

529
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
You're so

530
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:09,120
That's what it's that's what makes him worse to me almost doesn't feel like I want to get back to this but I don't want to interrupt you but I have to go

531
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,192
Equip about this on Today Show

532
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
About to get shrimp

533
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Kind of

534
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,272
I don't care

535
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:41,120
What is this being force-fed 25 year old kids about what about sex

536
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
So yeah

537
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,288
Even just in passing on this show he brings up his idea that there is

538
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,848
Something being introduced to try and turn us gay

539
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Yeah

540
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,944
It's weird to in like that's the other thing that's like

541
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,016
Not troubling but just like a shame

542
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
Because lights

543
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
He doesn't seem

544
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
Hateful

545
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
Percent

546
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,672
Globalist

547
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,208
Yeah that's true

548
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:12,096
Hateful towards them but like I've read articles to about like mm

549
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,656
About like other media Elites

550
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
Pushing

551
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,240
Trans issues because they want to like

552
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,800
Destroy gender lines again

553
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,616
I confuse the working-class article

554
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,968
I mean online

555
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,928
They always take the whole paragraph to be like

556
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
If you are trans

557
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,280
That's fine there's nothing wrong with you

558
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,840
I recognize that as a real

559
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Like

560
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,704
I'm just saying that

561
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:54,336
They're using that they're exploiting that real identity that deserve to be protected to like her

562
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:59,200
It's nice to see that their craziness is at least coming from

563
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:05,600
A place where I think that's even being way too generous

564
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:12,000
I didn't read the articles on the Vigilant Citizen

565
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:17,376
What is the time now

566
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
With this clip Alex

567
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,408
Is is is

568
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
There's a

569
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:37,344
It's basically

570
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,904
I don't care

571
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,696
I mean you are a victim

572
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:46,048
Your identity is because you had something done to you and I

573
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
I pity you because of your

574
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Your you're

575
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
Okay

576
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,008
Dude it's

577
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:59,104
I agree it's not good

578
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,456
It's just like in the world we live in it's just like you know it could be worse

579
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,784
Oh you know like that there's politician

580
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,832
Like like people that make the laws

581
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,648
They're much more openly hateful

582
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
Then him

583
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:17,024
So that's why it's like when they say awful s*** like that it's nice to know that like

584
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,656
They're better than even some of the people we've elected in terms of

585
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
What time to be like

586
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
Look

587
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,776
You're just a victim I don't hate you

588
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
Hateful in a way

589
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,128
What is the kinder

590
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:37,760
Soccer

591
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Great deal of time

592
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,368
Accusing Michelle Obama of being a transgender person

593
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,560
He pretends he's just joking about it

594
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
Other time

595
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
Very serious

596
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,192
Like what

597
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,008
What you doing

598
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,896
Came out as trans then it would be

599
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,016
Greeted the presidency and the office of the

600
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,296
The First Lady by

601
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,856
Secretly having a trans woman be in there

602
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
That's a man that's a

603
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,464
The first man so basically his ideas like

604
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
She doesn't have to say it

605
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
We just

606
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,864
We understand it and so the agenda gets out without it being like it

607
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,936
Eventually we'll go and then the joke's on us

608
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
We've been tricked

609
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,752
This whole time

610
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
It's it's insane

611
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,848
It's it's

612
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Let's be honest

613
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,200
Yeah I mean it's transphobic and it's homophobic

614
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,760
It's it's all that it just like

615
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Itches

616
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,832
These people

617
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,880
These people are so

618
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,720
In a world of such

619
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,584
I don't know emotional state

620
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
Baby will be easy for the hunter beets

621
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
Outwardly hateful

622
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,520
Always at least take a step back

623
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:08,896
Optimistic

624
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,968
No I don't I was going to say I have more respect for Michael Savage

625
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
But I don't

626
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,040
Who's that

627
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Even more hate

628
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,136
People radio personality

629
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,208
Is awful

630
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
He is just outwardly

631
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
That they're part of a

632
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
Agenda

633
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,216
I think what he would say is there mentally ill

634
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,688
Kind of yeah looking now

635
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,224
No no no no no

636
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
Yeah maybe

637
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
You spent at least a decade in a bottle

638
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
Let's get back into Alex

639
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,440
This clip is going to start with the

640
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Him touching

641
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,768
Baseball news

642
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,560
Supervillain George Soros

643
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
Antonio some more stuff

644
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
Say about that how Trump is really

645
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:12,896
When you stop somebody you can't answer

646
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,224
I want to stop really quick I don't think that it's true that

647
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Google where they're coming

648
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Exaggeration

649
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,136
Okay but also I don't think it's as nefarious as Alex think

650
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:26,720
When he says the people were told not to say that things are Islamic

651
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
Terror

652
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,024
I think that's probably due

653
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,072
I think you got to know the fact

654
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
Before you make pronouncements

655
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
That's first of all

656
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
I don't think it

657
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,984
Do we gain anything by

658
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,544
Attaching Islam

659
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,176
To terrorism and say that explicitly

660
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Weren't staying Islamic anymore

661
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
Because they didn't want to like

662
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,832
Destroy possible allies they could have in the

663
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
The Middle East by like

664
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,416
Yeah because one you're trying to like

665
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
That was like

666
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
Area is

667
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
If you help us we won't

668
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
You say that word

669
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,912
Well when you start using Islamic Terror the compound word

670
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,216
Gets connected to

671
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Did the terror

672
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
When is the noun

673
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
And it is certain point it

674
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,824
It becomes

675
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
You know like a soft kill

676
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
Becomes

677
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
And

678
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
Counterproductive

679
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,856
If you use that term aggressively to label everything

680
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,672
Then you're going to end up with

681
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,720
At least the appearances of a holy war

682
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,768
You're going to end up

683
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
Two people who walk

684
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
Vietnam

685
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,864
Boosie like I do they hate Islam

686
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144
Ain't that

687
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
Really bad

688
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
That's very bad

689
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,520
Who's the only people in whose interests that serve

690
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,312
Are people who actually want a holy war

691
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,848
And that ain't enough

692
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
No

693
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
I don't think

694
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
No I don't think

695
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:56,064
Does he ever touch on that at all

696
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,136
Funny you should ask I have a clip about what he thinks about Islam

697
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,672
Turn into Comics Unleashed

698
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:05,280
But like I said

699
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
Okay

700
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,032
And when you stop somebody you can't ask

701
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,616
Weather coming from cell phone

702
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,784
Places that are warzone

703
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:41,888
They can ask

704
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:58,528
Perfect size that route but you can MRSA

705
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,880
Violation of the First Amendment

706
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:07,488
When you sworn allegiance to a murderous military desktop

707
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
Necessarily

708
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,424
He's really saying those things about Islam as a whole

709
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,472
Yeah but I don't think he's doing

710
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,544
Nearly good enough job of being specific about what

711
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,640
Also true if you're not paying attention and you're listening to that you're dumb

712
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:29,248
That's kind of one of the messages are going to take away from it that Islam is a military death

713
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,856
I guess I just I never really heard him talk about

714
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,136
Jesus as much

715
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,488
In this episode when you talk about his grandma

716
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,792
I knew he was Christian

717
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
But I thought he was

718
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
A little more secular but

719
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
No

720
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
Praise on it

721
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,728
I didn't know that like I said I'm a little out of touch

722
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
So far off

723
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
Is weird deep end

724
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,200
Appraise on air

725
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,736
But he also has this

726
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,552
Weird version of Christianity that he's into

727
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,904
Like he was talking about how I

728
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
Exposed Oklahoma City

729
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
He got up

730
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
To the Pearly Gates

731
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,584
Let's get them back

732
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Weird

733
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Mystical element

734
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
Version

735
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:23,520
Christianity like I said it's like it if I were talking about with

736
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
With

737
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
Like that

738
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,848
Gay and trans

739
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Thing where it's like

740
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:32,480
Clip the old lady clip in the dying on the operating table

741
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
Basically like the way he talked about like

742
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,000
Well other people in other cultures have the same vision so it must mean something

743
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,048
What's my keys

744
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,936
Somewhat inclusive in a universal truth that can be kind of

745
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,216
Interpreted

746
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:59,616
Culturally

747
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,408
Wondering is that what it is

748
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,248
Most people that are bad Christian

749
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,320
Forever

750
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,624
Don't really like other religion

751
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,672
Yeah cuz there's a predisposition

752
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:19,072
Like I'm right so they're wrong team sports wondering if he is one of those questions or if he's more just

753
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,096
It's like I think

754
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,912
He feels the same way about other religions that he does about the gays

755
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,704
And the terms of like

756
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,776
It's cool you're fine

757
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,336
It's cool there that that's worth

758
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
He has underlying

759
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
Horribly bigoted

760
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
The demonic

761
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
Colt

762
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
Leaders

I've gotten this

764
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,320
T-Mobile

765
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,368
It is devilish evil

766
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,976
She has on a number of occasions

767
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
NSAID

768
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
Much more

769
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
Inflammatory thing

770
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,608
Don't work in this episode 2

771
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
We won't listen

772
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
No religion that is

773
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Killing other

774
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
Alright

775
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
Cool

776
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
Let's not wrestle with the Old Testament

777
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,016
Medalla

778
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:14,880
And the other thing I ate it Bears repeating and I don't I don't think I have a clip of it

779
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Best Buy

780
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,208
To this day he still is not recognized

781
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
The shooter in

782
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
Quebec

783
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,304
The guy who shot up the mop

784
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,864
He's not recognizing that it wasn't

785
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:31,776
Okay

786
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,080
I don't know if they ever arrested him

787
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,896
Yeah I lost track of that story but that was the only suspect

788
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:42,016
Like they had fun

789
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
I thought they arrested

790
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,856
It's so funny

791
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
What you

792
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,904
Believe

793
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,976
Your brain kind of just goes on autopilot cuz I was like

794
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:56,608
The arrest of that guy knows definitely the guy but then as we talked but you know what I also did tune out of this

795
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,400
Story and didn't really see how it concluded

796
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,960
Suspect charged with murder in Quebec

797
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
Quebec mosque

798
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,336
Terror attack

799
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,152
Because we heard he was arrested

800
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,760
Quebec City

801
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
Who was formally charged with

802
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,600
Counts of first-degree murder on Monday evening

803
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,392
One day after the massacre of the

804
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
The killed six

805
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
One day later

806
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,512
That was pretty quick

807
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,304
The suspect was identified

808
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,608
Twenty-seven-year-old Alexandra Bissonnet

809
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
Student nearby Louisville University

810
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,728
Bissonnette was also charged with five counts of attempted

811
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,384
Yeah you looks good for it

812
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,224
Pick up the wrong guy

813
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,040
Dick's it seems like

814
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
I don't know Alex

815
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,600
To tell you that they got the wrong guy Alta

816
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,928
Patxi's

817
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Little

818
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,000
Or does he think is a full-on false flag

819
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,816
On the show

820
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,864
He and his gas were talking about how was a failed

821
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,240
Because whenever you have Shooters like this usually they

822
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
They kill themselves

823
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,336
Yeah I didn't kill himself matter went wrong

824
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
So he chickened out

825
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
Something like that I don't know

826
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:16,992
You know I was telling you earlier than getting into their headspace yeah I'm not that be

827
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,832
I don't

828
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,392
Yeah Jason has made you feel better

829
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,696
Yeah

830
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,256
Yeah I got business more s*** about the media

831
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:33,376
Press secretary Spicer

832
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
And Alex

833
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,448
It's telling a story

834
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,968
I'm sure he gives us a little bit of traffic

835
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
Idiot

836
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,784
Stop

Not the one.

840
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
Or at least I

841
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:15,872
Pray to God

842
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,064
With this current Administration

843
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
Alex

844
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
Jackson

845
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
Checks out

846
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,584
You've got this whole thing going on where he believes that there's a

847
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
Split in the Trump can

848
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
Between the Trump loyalist

849
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
General Flynn

850
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Trump

851
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,568

They're just f****** come along for the ride but they're established

855
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
Republic

857
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
Enemy friend

858

It's amazing

859
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,648
This narrative

860
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,208
It's so fast

861
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
Dude like

862
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,560
Something like a trump presidency

863
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
It's just so interesting

864
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Like

865
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,424

00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,392
The really great / worst time to

00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,696
There's a moment

874
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,256
Play Quiet Moments for him where he's like

875
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048

00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
I don't know

878
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,656
You get a sister

879
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Reporting the news

880
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
He doesn't know how

881
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,800
I've listen to Infowars legit

882
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,848
Every day for the last 2 months

883
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
Police

884
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,151
I ate hurt

885
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
I have never

886
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
1

887
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
Heard them do a

888
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
Piece of legitimate Journal

889
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
Yeah I have never met.

890
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,415
Call to anybody David never check the fact

891
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
Documents

892
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,255
Alright

893
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,607
They have all these documents with a site and then you go read them and they don't say what they said they say

894
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,959
So it's like okay you're not reading the things that you're saying you're reading

895
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
Fake stores

896
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
Do you got

897
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
That's all they have

898
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,847
It's insane to me

899
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,199
Premise that you had of him having to

900
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
I know it was a joke

901
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:34,111
Crazy Ray's just report the news station

902
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,415
Yeah I mean that's fair

903
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:40,255
He's an interesting dude I don't know I just

904
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:46,911
So did you guys talk about podcast about the Joe Rogan interview you said

905
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
Three and a half hours

906
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:54,079
The things

907
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
So you talked about that were

908
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:59,199
Polly Paulson Tower

909
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
He's talking about how like

910
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,575
Trump's not globalist that's why I support him but I'm not

911
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
Flower was about

912
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
She said some

913
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:17,375
I don't want that warrant

914
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,911
The most awful things I've ever

915
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,983
That was in the first hour

916
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:29,151
I can't blame it on the drinking because I've heard him doing on his show unless he's a chronic alcoholic that's a possible Theory but

917
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:33,759
Siri

918
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,319
By the end of the podcast he's talking about

919
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,343
Like

920
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:41,439
Like vampires sucking the lifeblood out of these children

921
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,535
12 dimensional beings

922
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
What

923
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,655
How do you have even the

924
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
Even the capacity

925
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,007
To sound reasonable even for a second

926
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,799
If you also have those

927
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:00,127
No absolutely it what bit do you know the thing is

928
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,151
He he he

929
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,175
Those beliefs

930
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,223
Really well

931
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,015
Clearly that's underlying

932
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,039
A lot of his beliefs

933
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
Vampires

934
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Extra dimension

935
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,439
Beings

936
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,463
Mmsbee

937
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,511
2nd dimensional beings that want to get up and

938
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,351
Third Dimension Bakery that's his demon narrative that he has

939
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,399
Yeah literally beliefs

940
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,167
That stuff

941
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,263
And also believe in Jesus

942
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
None of that

943
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:31,871
That's in the Bible wow that's what I was talking about earlier his version of

944
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,967
We're getting to like

945
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,551
Overtime will figure it out we'll get a better assessment of

946
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,575
Like what his

947
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,415
Christianity really is cuz it's not really gnosticism either it's

948
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
It's something

949
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:52,351
And we can't quite get her finger on a board for sale

950
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,143
Play that's what they all say is like

951
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,447
The I guess that's the thing I

952
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:00,799
No I just mean we can move on and stuff I don't want

953
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:06,943
Just the idea of like that's to me what's always what I've always wrestled with with with Alex Jones

954
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,527
He's he's never been someone ever thought could ever be

955
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:14,111
Something important to me in terms of information source

956
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:21,279
Things outside the mainstream

957
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,887
Bolster what I get from the mainstream

958
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,935
And I like good f******

959
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:32,031
Psycho but I liked my psycho I'm like at or below

960
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:37,151
Yeah like a psycho and tens like

961
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
Interdimensional beings

962
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
But you just weird that

963
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
You can ask

964
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,575
1210 and all the numbers in between so it's just it's it's

965
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
It just it just

966
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:57,887
Full-term baby

967
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:04,543
Who tried his best to be a wanted really good

968
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
Con artist

969
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,151
But it isn't now you're able to

970
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,175
Forget people

971
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,503
I prefer to think you're not as crazy as you already can you go on Roku

972
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
You get high and drunk

973
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
10 comes out

974
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,927
That's basically how I would look at view but I think it's probably on

975
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,487
And even like 7

976
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:27,583
Upscale bleed through on his own show when he starts screaming the whole bunch

977
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,935
Clip it's probably about 4 minutes longer so

978
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,775
It's what I would describe as him attempting to do some media criticism

979
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,103
And in the middle of it I think

980
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,383
He accidentally leaks

981
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
Not League

982
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,735
But he let slip some of that I don't believe in

983
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,015
Is Drew but if it is

984
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,063
Indicates the Trump might have committed

985
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,671
Locked up

986
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,743
He gets mad at Anderson Cooper a whole bunch

987
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,071
Tell me if you want

988
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:10,079
Just trolled you

989
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:15,711
You are the ones that are now talking about we don't cover up

990
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,479
You cover up

991
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:27,487
More police unions are coming out

992
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,839
The shake your finger at us

993
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:37,727
And say we're covering whole kind of like we said the polls were fake and Trump is going to win

994
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:42,335
George Soros was directing the Democrats

995
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,479
Exactly what I said

996
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,063
Major sources

997
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,623
Chicago PD

998
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,159
Honey

999
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
I don't tell you too much here

1000
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,535
But

1001
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,863
But you say we got all the Intel

1002
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
Andweknow

1003
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,311
Video

1004
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,783
Oh hahaha of course we cover Islamic care

1005
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,671
I'm not sure what the victory is here that he's celebrating yet

1006
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,975
Legitimately have no

1007
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,023
So is he saying so

1008
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,815
So he's saying that

1009
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,703
Trump said hey CNN there's TV happening that you're not covering cuz you're covering it up

1010
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,263
And then they say no

1011
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,335
And then because they're saying that they covered it there now cover

1012
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,919
But obviously just bring up stuff for

1013
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
The past of cover

1014
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:51,967
Yeah

1015
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,783
Alex is not good at like

1016
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,879
Considering options outside of what he already believe

1017
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,951
There's not like an alternative possibility

1018
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,231
It's all just like this

1019
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
This is the truth

1020
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,279
Globalist

1021
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,815
Bad Trump good

1022
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
Anyway you going to play this clip

1023
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:13,471
And interrupted a whole bunch

1024
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,287
It's it's clasica Alex Jones

1025
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
It's it's weird

1026
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,359
And like I said he

1027
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,407
He hasn't alternative

1028
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
Narrative

1029
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:26,527
Of how Trump ended up running for president that I

1030
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,599
I don't think

1031
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
Okay

1032
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,647
Lucy with you

1033
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:40,607
Police the police

1034
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,375
Alright

1035
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:51,103
September 2014

1036
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,431
Anderson

1037
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:58,527
There's no scoring system

1038
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:03,647
It's come out

1039
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,911
You will no longer exist

1040
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,199
Thousands of innocent people

1041
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,015
He might have been celebrating or he might have been

1042
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,551
A journalist

1043
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
I'm not sure

1044
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,303
The Cooper in the southern

1045
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,703
Everybody knows your comment okay everybody knows your fraud

1046
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:55,103
Abro job done

1047
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,687
Acosta

1048
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,759
Adequately these attacks

1049
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:05,087
Most puzzling person inside this list

1050
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:11,487
You see mentions of the Paris attacks were 125 people.

1051
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,631
Terrorist attacks

1052
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:39,391
Under it if your regular service says braking house releases list of uncovered

1053
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
Undercover

1054
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:44,767
Under

1055
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,815
Cupboard attached

1056
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:56,799
They're admitting they didn't even cover them all and what we're saying is they underreported

1057
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,967
You don't put a picture of him

1058
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:08,831
Looking for someone

1059
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,647
It's not true

1060
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,631
A very white genocide

1061
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,423
Narrative

1062
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,239
The talking point of of

1063
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,287
White victimization

1064
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
Did the facts

1065
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,711
Pictures of black guys on the news

1066
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,735
It's either

1067
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:40,575
It's almost it's either not true or the opposite of what is it

1068
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
Yes but

1069
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,183
If your audience base as we broken down like

1070
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,399
Overwhelmingly over 50 years old male in

1071
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,727
Easy to scare

1072
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:58,751
And

1073
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,519
Maybe our

1074
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,799
Really good at research

1075
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
You just tell them you have course

1076
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:08,735
You know they think they are researching it by the Internet by watching his internet

1077
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,503
And the

1078
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,295
Trust him that he is done the

1079
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
He is not

1080
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
Sure

1081
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,743
You want to say that some things aren't covered

1082
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,279
Recover everything

1083
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:24,863
Like I said if you go down this list I have the list of all the terrorist

1084
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,167
That the the governor

1085
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,447
Put out

1086
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,239
And there are deep big one

1087
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,775
Fitbit got

1088
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
The coverage

1089
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:37,407
Some might say too much coverage

1090
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,943
There are just one

1091
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,503
We're like a foreign citizen

1092
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,039
Why would cut

1093
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,343
Bye-bye a potential

1094
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,879
Islamic person

1095
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:47,903
In another country

1096
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
It's it's it's

1097
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,047
Embarrassing list

1098
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,607
Supposed to be

1099
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
You're right

1100
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,679
Alex is totally right about one thing

1101
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
It's trolling

1102
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:06,847
Yeah it is kind of fall fortiva

1103
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,199
That's what kind of to me that's was kind of terrifying about a trump president

1104
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,503
Sure

1105
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:18,367
Ignore it even though that's really the best move because it's the

1106
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
President

1107
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
You can't ignore it.

1108
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
We're going to have

1109
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,279
Everything is going to be deregulated

1110
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,815
Privatized

1111
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,839
We're going to leave in a

1112
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,863
Bizarre dystopia

1113
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
Yeah

1114
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:33,727
If you just ignore back against that you get caught up in these

1115
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,591
Weird Labyrinthian live

1116
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,151
Alex Jones Is Right that they're putting it

1117
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,943
They're putting it on their own

1118
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,711
Scroll

1119
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,503
White House releases list

1120
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,039
Uncover

1121
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,575
Beetle Terrace

1122
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,647
So how did most people watch CNN like at the

1123
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:54,463
Airport at the doctor's office

1124
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:10,335
Because to be perfectly honest they can't say we covered all of them because again they don't need to cover a knifing in a foreign country

1125
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,151
It's not it's it's

1126
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,711
If you if we are expected

1127
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,527
Deborah coverage of every

1128
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,063
Again it's not good

1129
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,647
Someone got stabbed or sexually assaulted

1130
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,951
Not necessarily

1131
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,511
Global News it's not something

1132
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:33,887
It is it was probably covered in that local paper or to wherever that I would definitely assume

1133
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,447
I don't know how foreign media works.

1134
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,471
Anyway

1135
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
This gets weird

1136
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,591
Everybody knows about this

1137
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,871
This is America

1138
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:51,295
Again

1139
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,879
Let's go back to other Jokers

1140
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,671
This appears to be

1141
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:11,775
Are not reporting on these attacks

1142
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,967
No one knows why

1143
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:27,903
Sitcom told him and general Flynn

1144
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:35,583
There's been a deal made with Saudi Arabia and Al-Qaeda to take over more than 50 countries

1145
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:42,239
And we got to stop

1146
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:45,311
Women double-crosser they overthrow Ally Egypt

1147
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,479
It's a major

1148
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:16,799
So

1149
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:22,431
About Lee says the military I think you know why

1150
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,951
And you are the ones that came to me

1151
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,535
What the f***

1152
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,607
Trump

1153
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,167
To tell him to run for office

1154
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,447
Stop

1155
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,471
The

1156
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,007
To stop by to switches

1157
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,287
The creation of Hillary Clinton

1158
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,591
Barack Obama only one man

1159
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,663
Treason

1160
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,455
If it's true but it's

1161
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:00,063
That part is bizarre

1162
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:05,183
It might have something to do with Bazaar Russian

1163
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,887
Terrible things

1164
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,679
Whatever happened

1165
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,239
Totally opposed

1166
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,775
That you everything that was in it

1167
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,823
Propaganda 4.5

1168
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,103
Communist Chinese

1169
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:27,455
And Hillary Clinton and George Soros and Saudi Arabia

1170
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,271
But back to this flip the reason that I said there's like it

1171
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,807
Fairly treason

1172
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:32,831
I believe

1173
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,111
Is that

1174
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,159
You have these generals

1175
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,439
Allegedly

1176
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:39,999
Story

1177
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,047
A little far-fetched

1178
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,839
If it were true

1179
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,887
There would be these dudes

1180
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,911
Who have

1181
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,703
Security clearances

1182
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,471
Secret information

1183
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,031
Enter coming to private citizen

1184
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,079
All around insane person

1185
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,871
Donald Trump

1186
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,175
Telling him these clothes outside

1187
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:04,575
You better telling him these things that they should not okay that is weird that you know what I think about that part

1188
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,855
Clearly class

1189
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,879
They plan

1190
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,695
Some sort of revolution

1191
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:12,255
And use and disability

1192
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:15,071
Other things that to Alex talk about music

1193
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,863
The Insider people in the

1194
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,143
Information agencies

1195
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
Are the ones

1196
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,447
Delete stuff to WikiLeaks

1197
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
In order to

1198
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
To help drop

1199
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
And if that's the

1200
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
McKay's

1201
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,591
Added into what he was just talkin about here

1202
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
That is

1203
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,383
Straight up tree

1204
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,199
Yeah that is like we had

1205
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,503
I don't believe that

1206
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:38,111
But it's true then we would have essentially an insurrection

1207
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
Our government happen

1208
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,415
That

1209
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,719
Is way scarier

1210
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:45,791
Yes

1211
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,327
This clip ends

1212
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,911
Anderson Cooper

1213
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,679
Talking

1214
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,983
Well he's talking

1215
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,055
Know that there's a video montage of him

1216
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,103
Reporting from all of these

1217
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,127
Relocation

1218
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,943
Okay okay

1219
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,991
They just show footage of him

1220
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,063
Cuz they were

1221
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,879
Important enough to be flew him out report

1222
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:16,511
Here we are man the gloves are off no limits

1223
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,327
You really want the rest of the story

1224
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
Cooper

1225
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:26,495
You and your idiot audience don't know what's happening hoping you're still some group of morons

1226
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,759
Cooper is a monster

1227
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:42,879
Great-great-grandson

1228
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,439
I agree that the that shows

1229
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,351
Outdoor Republic

1230
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,911
Every single one of these people

1231
01:00:55,167 --> 01:01:01,311
Who knows what they're doing conscious is undermining this country

1232
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,343
Every single one

1233
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,999
You know why those military commanders today

1234
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:31,263
Not true

1235
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,055
That list the White House

1236
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:39,455
I know because I was there on the ground in Ottawa Canada October

1237
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
14

1238
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:45,599
Oregon man killed a reservist the national War Memorial

1239
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:58,399
What it was

1240
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,191
So he's saying that

1241
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,519
The news media didn't cover the Pulse Nightclub

1242
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:07,359
Bethel on the list of underreported terrorist attacks

1243
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,895
Yeah

1244
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:13,759
About 30 with

1245
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,039
Aiding and abetting

1246
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:19,135
I'm going cover the covering the f*** out of that covering it now

1247
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,279
Was that crazy where they said

1248
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:30,143
Something like the poles thing was under covers all of the

1249
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,423
Everything that could

1250
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:34,239
Possibly be cold

1251
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,287
I wish it was

1252
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,055
224

1253
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,615
But

1254
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,175
The list is embarrassing

1255
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,223
It's it's time to stop

1256
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,503
We all got an asphalt

1257
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,527
We heard yet

1258
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
I'm going to skip over this next

1259
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,695
Clipit swear

1260
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
Alex

1261
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,999
Explains that there is a

1262
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:01,631
Does flight clubs being organized at Berkeley and other universities and faculty are involved

1263
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:05,471
Universities are starting fights

1264
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,775
Southern University sanctioned

1265
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,055
Offer left it

1266
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,335
To learn how to fight

1267
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,871
Lincoln take out these

1268
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,407
Conservatives when I come to town

1269
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,175
Young again

1270
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,455
Breakout

1271
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,271
No and don't know no one.

1272
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,879
I read the articles that you posted

1273
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,415
And it's just us

1274
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,207
Some people who are concerned

1275
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,255
That there's going to be attacks on minorities

1276
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,535
Ndawn

1277
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,815
Lgbtq

1278
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,583
People

1279
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,607
Heritage

1280
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,703
Leather calling it's like clubsound cuz it's fun

1281
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,103
The university has been like we're not involved in this

1282
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,383
Real

1283
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,223
It suggests a clear-cut case of his lying

1284
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:51,039
I want to get to though

1285
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,087
He has an interview

1286
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
At the end of this episode

1287
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,415
With the guy

1288
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,463
Named Darrell hamamoto

1289
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,535
Is Professor

1290
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,583
He's really again

1291
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,119
Liberal b*******

1292
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,959
I want I want to play this cuz I want to give

1293
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:11,263
The listeners I want to give you an idea

1294
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,799
How interviews go on

1295
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,567
On his show

1296
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,383
Cuz it's it's really bizarre

1297
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,919
If you've ever watched

1298
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,223
Interviewed on a news show

1299
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,759
It's on like that

1300
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
In any way

1301
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,063
A couple of them

1302
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,343
I'm excited

1303
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:29,183
With the introduction that he

1304
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:29,951
He gives

1305
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:33,279
The reason I want to start with it is because

1306
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
We're both

1307
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,119
You know what have I have

1308
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,655
Spent a lot of time to stand up

1309
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,471
Yep we know what a good intro is yeah we know what

1310
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,287
This is a bad intro

1311
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:49,919
Cuz it's like if someone is introducing you as a performer and they spend like

1312
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,943
5 minutes list

1313
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,711
Incredits

1314
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,503
Then how you going to get up there

1315
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,367
And then how

1316
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,671
Professor hamamoto starts

1317
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,463
Is bizarre

1318
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:05,023
Okay so this this sounds

1319
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:05,791
Is not a good host

1320
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,839
I'm just going to work

1321
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,375

Academic historians will refer to when they write about this

1392
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:29,471

01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,535
People need to be checked for mental health

1397
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,559

1398
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:59,423

Which has multiple husbands

1414
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,719
He meant Pollyanna

1415
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,255
But he said polyamory

1416
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,279
Which is a much broader thing

1417
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:04,703
Both Partners has more a multiple man with one woman

1418
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,983

At this point he pulls out a guitar that he has sitting next to him

1429
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,487
Okay

1430
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,279
It's on normal guitar

1431
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,071
It just happens to be pink

1432
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,095
That's it

1433
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:08,447
There's nothing special about this guitar okay it doesn't have anything drawn on it

1434
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,471
Just a pink

1435
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,519
Awesome

1436
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,567
Because when he said that we have

1437
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,103

1438
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,383

1447
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:50,431
Some toothpaste that he would order from Alex

1448
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:55,295

Moving out of state

1450
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,439

1459
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,263
Cultural takeover

1460
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,055

Screening for mental health

1466
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:09,535
Wait let's try to go point-by-point it just is almost overload

1467
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,303
Looks like it is

1468
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:13,631
If you think the guitar is phallic I do not want to know what you

1469
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
Your cock looks like

1470
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:20,287

For her pleasure

1476
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,927
What then wait what is why is

1477
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:43,327
Rap and hip-hop there's a conspirator funking hip-hop's conspiracy to get undergraduate

1478
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,143
Urban Jungle Rhythm

01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:48,703
Braces

1480
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:56,383
Sorry my brother

1481
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,175
Idea that

1482
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,991
These guys are homophobic

1483
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:07,903
So he's proving that by taking his quote on quote gay instrument to try to play with them and they say no your

1484
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,695
Honestly

1485
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,487
I don't know don't know

1486
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,559
Elaborate on that at all

1487
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,863
And Alex's interview-style is not

1488
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,751
Look I'm going to call out

1489
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:25,823
Prove these guys who they really are my take my gay instrument

1490
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:31,199
And they're going to say it's to gas and then I've proved my point

1491
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,503
Be with my super gay instruments

1492
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,599
I think he was saying that I have the gayest in

1493
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,135
Instrument I could possibly find

1494
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,183
And of course they loved

1495
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:47,071
So of course

1496
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:55,007
There's no way to take that that makes it like less hilarious

1497
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,895
I've listened to the entire interview

1498
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,919
And I don't know

1499
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,479
Guitar gay

1500
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,247
It's pink

1501
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:13,695
Weird that you're generalizing

1502
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:20,095
Your Pinkett are slightly more sure happening

1503
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:20,863

From like a laptop or whatever in his living room

1507
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,783
Into his kitchen

1508
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:43,647
So like I don't know what kind how many instruments you've got degrees

1509
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:47,743
Look I think is this a failure of this like

1510
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
Like this

1511
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,047
Higher education

1512
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:53,375
He might ironically be that which he is

1513
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,143
Critiquing

1514
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,727
Unpack is like

1515
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,543
No baby just teach it to uc-davis

1516
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,359
Let's not like a mental real

1517
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:09,759
He has like a sitting room next

1518
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,527
To his kitchen

1519
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,319
That I might be

1520
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,855
I might be pretending

1521
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,647
Navigate to studio apartment when it's not

1522
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:19,743
Or you might have like some divorces and have alimony

1523
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,303
You never know what people's lives are like

1524
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,071
Yamamoto

1525
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:26,143
Live in a one-bedroom

1526
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,935
Apartment

1527
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,495
Situation

1528
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,031
Like that, Moto

1529
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,079
So that was crazy

1530
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,359
That was not

1531
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,407
To that last part was

1532
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
Wow

1533
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:42,527
They wouldn't let him sit in

1534
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,135
There's no way that's the whole story

1535
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,415
No

1536
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
Dudley price that

1537
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,375
Hey bros

1538
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,447
Can I sit in with my gay instrument and they were like

1539
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,215
Do that

1540
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:05,055
All that's weird you need to leave narc

1541
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:10,175
Guess there's some real hate going on here

1542
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,599
Like everybody

1543
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,623
Concert like I don't

1544
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:21,183
I don't know if it every protest there's music

1545
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:24,255
OK Google

1546
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,559
Just people sitting around

1547
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,583
Oregon walking

1548
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,375
If there's this potion involved

1549
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:32,191
Unplugging your aunt

1550
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
Is that weird

1551
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,495
That's fine

1552
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
Choice

1553
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:40,383
It's a little bit much as a lot of people around here

1554
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:46,015
I've never met anybody

1555
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:47,807
Current

1556
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
New College

1557
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,391
Save-A-Lot

1558
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,159
Never like

1559
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:55,999
Why wasn't collagen

1560
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:58,559
Nothing like any other women like guys or girls

1561
01:18:59,327 --> 01:18:59,839
Friendliness

1562
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,399
I think I would have go to protest with friend

1563
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,447
Is much like

1564
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,471
Eternal socializer

1565
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,263
I guess I did get pamphlet

1566
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,543
People and stuff like that

1567
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
Now what

1568
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
You know what

1569
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,151
The fantasy was that

1570
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,735
You'd meet somebody to pass you

1571
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,503
Some grass

1572
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:21,343
You're offered to A Whole New World Revolution

1573
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,623
It was never like that

1574
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:27,231
Especially now that I'm like in my 30s

1575
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,535
I go Android

1576
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:32,607
I didn't I wasn't able to that day I was busy but

1577
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,911
I did go to a number of lawns

1578
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,191
Around the elect

1579
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,727
After the election

1580
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,775
How to make a stomach feel better

1581
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:42,079
It did it did it made me feel like I was a part of sea

1582
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,663
Secede

1583
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,943
So many different

1584
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:50,783
People you know a lot of diverse

1585
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,855
Causes being represented all-in-one

1586
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,927
There's a lot of solidarity I think it's good

1587
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:57,951
The only gets likes

1588
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,719
Splintering

1589
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:03,327
I don't think so because they're all merging as one to be like all right look we all have our

1590
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,191
Big picture we know

1591
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,215
All of us

1592
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,495
If we

1593
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
If we let this guy

1594
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,055
Yeah

1595
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,080
Central Time

1596
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,408
The next thing

1597
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,712
The next thing that's

1598
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,272
Oh there's more hamamoto there is

1599
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,832
Koodegras baked

1600
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,856
Oh no

1601
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,136
He goes he goes deeper

1602
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,184
He had some thoughts about who these broke

1603
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,208
Bizarre

1604
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,744
And who these radicals are

1605
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,560
I don't know how to put

1606
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,584
Too fine a point on this

1607
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,352
I don't agree with

1608
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,912
I'll just leave that right up top

1609
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,936
We'll see what you think

1610
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,520
Is because

1611
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:50,176
Hypotheses based on what we already know about.

1612
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:59,392
Much obliged by the way as I stated before were concentrated in the east

1613
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:06,048
She and others of a certain specific

1614
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,072
Even though

1615
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,608
The majority are

1616
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:15,008
Great Christian

1617
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:15,776
Americans

1618
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:19,360
I think they're coming out of the Alameda Naval Base

1619
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:24,736
Are are the products of what colloquially is known as the super soldier program

1620
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:31,136
And what is that

1621
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:37,024
He's not done yet but I want to point out that Justin

1622
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:41,888
When he's at the super soldier program you raise your eyebrows and just gave a nod

1623
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,912
Like

1624
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:52,384
You look of your face was

1625
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,456
Incredulous it wasn't like what the f*** you

1626
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,808
Red look like

1627
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,536
Oscar Healthcare to education

1628
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:12,608
This new generation

1629
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:19,264
Naval personnel

1630
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:24,128
Military service at the core

1631
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,528
Northern California

1632
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,112
A Flying L

1633
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,672
What's just means a government background

1634
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,976
Exactly

1635
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:43,584
The ordinary

1636
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:49,216
American sovereignty

1637
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:53,824
Institution

1638
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,480
I think

1639
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,392
Shadow libraries

1640
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,696
Shadow Fight

1641
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:16,864
Apply your packages

1642
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,168
The two chanez Shadow up top

1643
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:25,568
Go to Shadow organization, Beyond The Shadow version of this podcast next week

1644
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,152
These like you know something maybe that we know

1645
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:29,920
And Alex

1646
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:35,040
You know what dude to go to your

1647
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,064
Again like

1648
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:41,184
More cynical but God damn if it's not more probably spot on view of

1649
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,744
These types of people in terms of like

1650
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,024
When were talking about

1651
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
Like

1652
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:50,912
I feel like I was defending but just more kind of just speaking on the fact that like you know like

1653
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:54,240
If you're gay that's okay

1654
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,264
Like I don't hate you

1655
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,800
It's also like

1656
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,848
It's weird how they

1657
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:01,664
Keep doing that all the time where it's like

1658
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:02,944
Well

1659
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,808
You know it's not the Navy that protects us I love those guys those are those are great guys

1660
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,832
If the shadow

1661
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:09,856
Yeah yeah

1662
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:13,696
It is weird how they always like separate and then retract

1663
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,488
But it's still like

1664
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,048
Do you are still calling out the Navy

1665
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,840
Well it's it's like

1666
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,376
Cynical take on it

1667
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:25,216
It's one way of creating a narrative about the world and never having to

1668
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,264
Take responsibility for things

1669
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,288
Exist in the real world

1670
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:31,616
Because it could be like oh no my narrative involved

1671
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,384
These other things

1672
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:40,832
If someone from the Navy word alike call in or

1673
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,880
Whatever hypothetical way.

1674
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,928
These people I've been

1675
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,304
All this is crazy

1676
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:56,960
Will start thank you for your service but you're not in the shadow Navy in now but that is compartmentalize

1677
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:02,336
Know what goes on because someone called me

1678
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:07,456
Okay

1679
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:09,248
What is caborca scallions

1680
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:14,112
Interesting interesting

1681
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:17,952
You know what it comes down to me and I hate I hate that it sort of boils down

1682
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,720
To this

1683
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,488
In many ways.

1684
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,256
I think

1685
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:22,048
So much of it comes

1686
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,840
Down to misplace

1687
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,120
Masculine

1688
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,936
And like weird versions of masculine

1689
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,728
Please

1690
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,008
Elaborate I'm interested

1691
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,104
This guy a lot of his

1692
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,384
Research

1693
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,920
Is on the

1694
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,200
Desexualization

1695
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:39,968
Asian box

1696
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:46,624
Popular culture in American culture

1697
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,000
I'd love to read a book on it right now

1698
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,560
Say that women don't want to date Asian man

1699
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:00,192
I got some real s***.

1700
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:04,544
The stage

1701
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,848
You left for the untapped evaluation

1702
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:13,504
The one I like 1027 that early but I was I don't know if you do know or not

1703
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,784
Huge Steve Harvey fan

1704
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:19,136
So I knew it existed I was just never up that early

1705
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,232
It's one of the greatest Defenders of

1706
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:27,072
Fake phone calls I've ever heard

1707
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,424
It's just all actors gacho embarrassing

1708
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,448
He is the only

1709
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,496
Radio personality who's more Christian

1710
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,520
Outwardly than Alex

1711
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:39,104
I want to get back to you I don't want to

1712
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,944
Interesting

1713
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,480
Research topics about

1714
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,248
Did you sexually

1715
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,272
Location of Asian man

1716
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:52,672
Of course

1717
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
That in your mind

1718
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:58,816
And then on top of that it is about these protests

1719
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,864
The idea that

1720
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,192
The coming future is going to be ruled over by women

1721
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,240
Is just an incredibly

1722
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,312
A massive fear of

1723
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
Women

1724
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,616
We having any control over

1725
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,688
I think that's what a lot of this boils down

1726
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,968
I can't believe he's a

1727
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,736
Teacher

1728
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:17,760
Like a professor

1729
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,296
Here's what I would say

1730
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,856
When you're in college you're still developing as an

1731
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,136
An adult in many ways

1732
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,184
Think it's right to

1733
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,488
Someone who's in college

1734
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:31,072
You shouldn't treat them necessarily like they're full grown adult

1735
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:33,376
Cuz they're still figuring a lot of stuff out.

1736
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,168
That that sort of thing

1737
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,752
But they're not so impressionable that having a challenge

1738
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:39,776
Teacher is Dane

1739
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,360
So if you have a teacher even if they are a little bit wacky

1740
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,944
Yeah I could take a class of his

1741
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,480
When I was in college

1742
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,760
And be like

1743
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:58,208
It wouldn't make any poop damage would have been like you I'm taking all this

1744
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,328
Yeah I'm going to ruin every party talking to

1745
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,864
About it

1746
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,800
Bring us to the end of our clips

1747
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
Let's

1748
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:16,896
Did that this day and Alex Jones my man

1749
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:19,200
That was a hell of a ride

1750
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:22,528
I don't like I didn't like today's episode that much

1751
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:27,648
In what way

1752
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,440
The disappointing performance for Malik

1753
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:31,744
I'd rather you didn't go off the deep end

1754
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,536
Yeah and the stuff he was

1755
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,304
It just wasn't

1756
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,584
It wasn't Alex enough

1757
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,632
Yeah there's just

1758
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,656
Something you can feel

1759
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,960
You can feel it when he's on and when he's not in it

1760
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,728
Just felt like he was

1761
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,008
Really on

1762
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,544
It could be part of it

1763
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,592
And now that we've come to the end of this

1764
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
I feel guilty

1765
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,384
A playback

1766
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,664
No

1767
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:54,784
Cuz I was like I was a nice moment

1768
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,552
To start things

1769
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,856
Eminem in Oklahoma City

1770
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,416
Yeah it's a it's a it's a nice.

1771
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,952
Method of what we expect

1772
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,536
Yeah

1773
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:06,816
Soft kill

1774
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:09,888
Grandma

1775
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:12,192
Basils Redman I did it I had a great time

1776
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,592
But until then

1777
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,152
Thanks for holding

1778
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:27,040
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
