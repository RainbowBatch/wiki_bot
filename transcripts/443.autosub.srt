00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263
You're also a raptor princess

00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,359

89
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175

It's all over your God

93
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
Very few people

94
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
When they are

95
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
At juice

96
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,887
Are you so much

97
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,567
These Gents

98
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:47,967
You can take that generosity

99
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,039
Wonderful as well

100
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
Sweetheart appreciate

101
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Hindi

102
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,903
Like I said Jordan

103
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,487
This episode because Monday

104
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,071
I turned on the show and

105
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,471
Shroyer

106
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,543
Come in and do some of the show later but

107
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
I don't know what I'm doing.

108
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:23,807
So I was pretty worried that we have nothing to really cover for this episode so Tuesday comes around 29

109
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,903
And I turn it on

110
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Stuff

111
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Goodnight is bro

112
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,279
And he's

113
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
He said

114
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,679
Alex is going to be in a little bit later Steve pieczenik was going to be on

115
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
Ozark well alright

116
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
Got to find out what she has to say about things that

117
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Awful

118
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:54,783
Broad

119
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
Ignore all the time to David nights I was staying

120
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
The end of the first hour Alex shows up

121
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
In the last segment of the first hour

122
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,047
And so we begin our investigation and exploration

123
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,631
When Alex comes in and actually I will say

124
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,423
Disappointed

125
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,495
There's something else that goes on in this episode

126
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Fantastic

127
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
And definitely worth our time

128
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,871
So we start off with Alex teasing

129
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
Although

130
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
Is you know

131
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,831
He starts off with like an intention of what the show is going to be at 9

132
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Almost done

133
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
It's what I want to do today

134
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
Open the phone

135
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Stop the balance

136
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
The next

137
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
Make your phone calls

138
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
On the subject of what's on

139
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,031
So Alex is going to take phone calls hours

140
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
Three phone calls

141
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,711
He doesn't start taking calls for another hour

142
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Retakes

143
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
A couple calls

144
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,575
There's a reason for this

145
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,207
He will later stipulate

146
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:12,607
Okay

147
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
So you are

148
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,383
Alex

149
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Call Africa

150
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,183
He talks about this phenomenon that we're seeing people getting hit by cars at protest

151
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,047
Nationalist

152
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
Video video

153
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,935
Throw themselves on the hoods of people's cars

154
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Wow

155
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
Says oh look

156
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
Someone tried to Ram them down and killed

157
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Repeat Charlottesville

158
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
A big steak

159
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
Drama club

160
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Entomology

161
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Kontrolfreek

162
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Repeating

163
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
The same.

164
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:17,375
Do a lot of

165
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:22,751
A lot of people are shooting themselves 40 or 50 times in the back before they talked to the

166
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:29,151
The cop true

167
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
Sometimes in the back

168
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:37,343
So I would say that this is a really interesting for Alex drank contextualize and hand wave away a bunch of videos of protein

169
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:45,279
Cars left and right another way to look at it is it since the unite the right rally

170
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,351
Celebrate

171
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,679
And what you're seeing likely contains at least a kernel

172
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
So I don't know what else is doing

173
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:01,151
But here videos describing a slightly different

174
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Stances

175
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:08,319
Some of them are police to attempt to drive through people or intentionally open their doors are passing the protester in order

176
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Other civilian

177
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,207
Consider driving it to people

178
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
Pictures of individual case

179
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,815
It's kind of hard for me to speak about them in a blanket sense

180
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,935
Please one is a little bit different

181
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
People isn't attack

182
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,799
That's where I'm at

183
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,407
In the last week or so I can find instances of protesters being hit by cars

184
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:39,807
Chattanooga Jackson five-year-old Robert who died after being struck by a car in

185
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,903
Course the weather the incident to Denver from the end of May

186
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,951
It says he's been happening quite a bit

187
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,607
I can't get into the specifics of all of those cases but what I can't do is discuss one recent instance of this that is very cool

188
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
Illustrate

189
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
An awful Alex's

190
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:04,127
On Sunday night in Seattle 31 year old man drove his car directly toward a group of protesters who stopped

191
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,967
Wendy's car stopped some protesters naturally started hitting his cars

192
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
You tried to run people over

193
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,879
Nearest open driver side window falls to the ground haven't been shot by the man who's driving

194
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
The car

195
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,951
Dude gets out of the car brandishing a gun

196
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,743
You try to escape by a sort of mix

197
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:26,143
Again with the crowd and ultimately subdued by protesters

198
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,703
Been forced to shoot someone with carjacking at sounds

199
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,079
Doesn't match with the video

200
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
This is intentions were to run

201
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
People

202
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623
Wait to see what information eventually comes out on this front

203
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
This is disgusting stuff going from Alex

204
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
The First Amendment right to protest

205
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
Alex knows that

206
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
I hope it eats them up inside

207
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
Because he's Mox

208
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:10,175
I'm surprised that he's not going with the false flag and somewhat

209
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
Like refresh

210
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,903
It's too easy to go with the false flag now protesters are jumping in front of cars

211
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,303
I guess so but it's not really cuz that is.

212
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
I'll give him I'll give him at least one new wrinkle

213
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
It's not a new wrinkle

214
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:44,479
What are the difficulties of Alex's

215
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
100 different things

216
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
Depending on what the circumstances are you sure

217
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
The Claymore fake

218
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
Very frustrated

219
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,767
You know these last two days for us you've been pulling half right

220
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:03,167
Well too many processors been jumping in front of this car might make the argument

221
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,751
Maybe he's not as committed as you really pretend

222
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,079
Come on Alex, I just

223
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,943
Floating theories floating Theory

224
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
Alex has an explanation for why

225
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
Sitting in the first one

226
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Montego Bay

227
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
When you go to break

228
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Reason you should

229
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,071
Whether or not it's sold as a toothache

230
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
I find it

231
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Difficult

232
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,007
To believe that Alex had a tooth extracted and it's not affecting his speech at all

233
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,079
It's possible but it seems really weird

234
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,175
If you don't have no swelling

235
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,015
You could get a you wouldn't want to be doing a ton of talking

236
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,343
Dry socket is shoes or kinds of reasons

237
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
2BR advisable

238
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,951
He's been practicing his neck so big

239
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:35,071
He's been chewing cotton balls in the back of his molars you met with 9

240
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,863
It keeps accidentally swallow

241
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:43,263
My perspective surgery take a day

242
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,663
I think maybe he's not lying

243
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
Waze back

244
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
Podcast I used to do I had a root canal

245
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
And then I came immediately

246
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:02,463
No s*** like I it is possible that my voice is pretty altered because

247
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
Massive swelling

248
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
I don't know anyway

249
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,631
Just take the day off man

250
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,447
Take the day off all right

251
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,823
Yes I'm not sure what Alex thinks about

252
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
Kennedy

253
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
John

254
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,575
I'm not sure what Alex's take is on the assassination

255
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
It's a conspiracy

256
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Maybe

257
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:37,279
I don't know what is specific take on it is because Rodger stones in the book about it

258
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
Talked about a bunch of

259
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
You Howard Hunton

260
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,447
The bums in whatever

261
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
But like

262
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,359
I've not really heard a coherent version of what he thinks the conspiracy is especially not want

263
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Consist

264
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
I think

265
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,711
He's going to come out with

266
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
John F Kennedy

267
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
Jump into the bullet

268
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,087
And that's why it was so magic

269
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,159
Straight into the bullet

270
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,679
This next destination

271
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
It doesn't make sense

272
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,871
I know that work for the CIA

273
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,111
Eia.gov

274
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,463
The real quick

275
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,815
Miss talking about memorandum 7277 is the

276
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
Cold war-era

277
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,935
Department of War

278
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
We talked about it

279
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
Just to clarify

280
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,895
You know I don't think you're all of them

281
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
But he was really behind in this world

282
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,503
Did by end of the gun

283
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
What was the last straw

284
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Play sad

285
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Meant well

286
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
What

287
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
It was behind

288
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
What's opening up China

289
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
Plan

290
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
But he was actually opposed

291
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,455
So complex who would have been a lot better off

292
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
Okay

293
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,647
Expect Alex's Angleton OB that's some good guys in the government decided to stay because

294
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
Designated the president

295
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:47,327
Confiscation that was the last straw for

296
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:52,191
Whatever and

297
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,799
Alex could say that's complex and sophisticated what it actually is

298
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
And convoluted

299
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:04,735
Eia.gov

300
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
Talking about memorandum 7277 being real

301
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,343
Plan to disarm the citizens

302
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,999
It's a link to a CIA posting in their reading room of an issue of the minutemen's newsletter On Target from 1960

303
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,095
Which presents 7277 is a plan to disarm the public

304
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:26,239
And it's from the Minutemen so whatever

305
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
The Minutemen

306
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Anti-communist

307
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
They're not talk

308
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,783
Think about it.

309
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,183
Right it was one of the things in their newsletter that I

310
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
It doesn't mean anything

311
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,887
Is assassinated in November 22nd 1960

312
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
53

313
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
Memorandum 7277 was written

314
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,775
And released in September 1961

315
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:05,919
So I guess what Alex is saying is

316
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,711
Major

317
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
Destroy the world

318
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:14,111
And this was the last straw for the good guys?

319
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Who killed JFK

320
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,464
This memorandum which did nothing

321
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
Succeed in the Escalade in the Cold War

322
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,448
Good guys

323
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
Got together on the

324
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:35,872
Plan to kill the president

325
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,832
They're not even doing it together they both

326
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:51,232
Just happened to come upon him as a hundred percent they showed up and they're both

327
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,792
Right on either side of a

328
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:05,056
Impressively are always at least ten years behind

329
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,848
Planning to kill JFK before using

330
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,152
I could be

331
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,968
I don't know if they were behind in the 60s

332
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
I think God

333
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:19,648
Increasingly behind Sussman schedule

334
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,304
This is sloppy even for Alex like what makes absolutely no sense

335
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
Keeping a low profile

336
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,448
You come in there and slap Alex around or sing this kind of foolish

337
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
This is embarrassing

338
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,056
Alex

339
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,408
It's on the next mentioned that he wants to take calls but he's trying to get

340
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
People from a null set

341
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
And you'll hear that here

342
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
What I want to do today

343
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
I want to open

344
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
The phones are

345
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,000
Who's walking

346
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,304
To tell their story

347
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
People that work

348
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,936
Black matter

349
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
The call-in

350
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
Your story of what you witnessed

351
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:16,736
Good luck with getting those collars from your audio

352
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,784
Taneous info Warrior and

353
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,136
Former antifa member communist

354
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,720
So do you like to talk

355
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
And I don't believe him for a second on this one

356
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Also when I open the phone

357
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
For leftist

358
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Really do think prompts

359
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,008
I really do think

360
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,288
Abolishing the police

361
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
Is a good idea

362
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
Think that

363
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Temperature

364
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
You seriously disagree

365
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
I think there's a distinct

366
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,024
I'd like to respectfully hear from you

367
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,424
I'm not going to be respectful

368
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,776
Rank disrespect but I need respect from you

369
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:18,432
Imagine anybody listening to the show

370
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,368
I think one of those even then

371
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
One of those

372
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,184
Pretty much

373
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,232
Exclude the other two right

374
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,840
Like you can't be leftist who really believes in abolished

375
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,168
Sing the police and think that the Democratic party has your best interest

376
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
Mind

377
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:46,592
They have no interest in abolishing the Democrats

378
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:56,832
The black-and-white simplistic version of what's going on

379
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
Infowars land

380
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,744
Sort of requires that just so I can see how

381
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
For you

382
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:11,168
That makes no sense

383
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:16,544
Heart of Darkness

384
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,408
So it doesn't slip Alex talked a little bit about

385
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,968
A little bit David George Floyd

386
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,576
You can kind of sense a lot of Alex's

387
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:34,720
Universal feelings about situations like like these and then also him starting

388
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
To get in line with

389
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,864
What I assume is going to be a lot of what the right-wing has to say about this

390
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
With wings

391
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
This is

392
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
He's dead

393
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,624
Doesn't sound like it

394
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Five of them

395
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
To feel guilty about anything ever

396
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,752
Just consistent to Alex Jones

397
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
Pathology

398
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:26,176
Essentially

399
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:34,880
Leaning towards

400
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
Good person

401
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,464
Or whatever

402
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:42,304
Seems to be the end

403
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,888
You seem a bit more than some of the right-wing news

404
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,472
Sources

405
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,776
It's just it's a cheap

406
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
Cheap Trick

407
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,224
Like whether they're right or wrong which I don't believe a lot of things in particular

408
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,272
But whether they're right or wrong is irrelevant

409
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,832
A2dp larger situation

410
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,928
I'm so great

411
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,488
But like they even have almost a

412
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,840
Time stamp on it where it's like okay week after the the murder

413
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:20,192
Will people will be emotionally distant from it enough for us to be like

414
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:26,336
All right he was obviously leaving guy right now that we're all mad and we're all done with that let's just

415
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,688
Get together and realizes the cop should be able to kill

416
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
Earlier on

417
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:38,368
Try and say now's not the time to politicize things will let you know if we're if we're able to pull that off

418
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
Cheap either way let's be disingenuous yeah

419
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,840
A story that is actually fairly

420
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,008
Isn't Dad so it's not as tragic as it could have

421
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
Ended up being

422
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,104
Bad

423
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,176
Alex has a perfect example

424
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
To demonize All Pro

425
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,576
Video

426
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,928
He doesn't stop

427
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,208
Shoot them in the head

428
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
Satisfaction

429
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
Skin on the face for your TV viewer

430
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
He is a he

431
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,424
Shot a man

432
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Stop.

433
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
Celebrating

434
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
You know what

435
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Try to run him over when it did

436
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,112
He had a heart attack and died in Charlottesville

437
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
Two again

438
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
Create the Civil War

439
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
People on Highway

440
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:59,520
So this is the situation out of

441
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
What does

442
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,616
The name of the city Alamosa in Colorado

443
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,944
I found a video that was released by a local news

444
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,504
Absolutely does not look good

445
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,368
Looks like this guy James Marshall

446
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,672
Way out of line absolutely

447
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Any shots

448
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,232
Yeah he's way out of f******

449
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
King lies

450
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
0 contacts

451
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:28,448
12 protesters in a small town called Alamosa intersection at a crosswalk

452
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
A black truck

453
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:33,824
The truck pulls up to drive through the intersection

454
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,176
There's a distinction without putting any of the protesters in danger

455
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,832
He is at a complete stop in from the video forward a little bit but not anyone

456
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
Silver or heard anyone

457
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,392
That's not cool

458
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
Appreciate someone doing

459
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,280
There's a big difference between that and someone speed in towards

460
00:29:54,304 --> 00:30:00,192
He's coming through the intersection you see a guy appear to shoot him through the window

461
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,240
Amanda guy

462
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:07,872
So f***** up mess

463
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:13,760
Honestly I don't know all the details about the situation at this point since the investigation is still ongoing

464
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:19,136
The shooting has been arrested and charged with multiple crimes including attempted murder

465
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:25,536
I've not seen any indication that anyone is calling in a year out because

466
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
What is audience

467
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,424
Or he basing it on a couple random tweets that is interned found which mean nothing

468
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,496
I'm not entirely sure this is a tragic situation

469
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
Like I said

470
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,336
The guy who got shot isn't dead and that's great

471
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
Positive

472
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,808
I've not heard anyone say this guy's a hero or that this is

473
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
Hooray

474
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,856
No absolutely not

475
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:00,608
Consider this but I can't find anything

476
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
You can you can justify property

477
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,984
Nobody on the left

478
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,776
At these protests

479
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Whatever

480
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
Condone that

481
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,384
I can't imagine

482
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,784
And Heather hair didn't die from heart attacks

483
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,576
Alex's

484
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,624
As a way of trying to

485
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,416
Make it better

486
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,768
They ran over over

487
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
Intoxicant

488
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
Right

489
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
So

490
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,680
That's all bulshit

491
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,264
It's like it's going to allow him to completely write off

492
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
Almost every

493
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,336
Sort of protest

494
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:47,200
But it'll work for his audience

495
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
Right now it's going to be

496
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,320
There will always be a what about forever

497
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:56,160
30 time for a while

498
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,048
Is first color that is presumably an ex leftist

499
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,680
A little bit nervous

500
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Called in several

501
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
Since I start

502
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,336
Listening in 2011 and I ended up hanging up

503
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,128
Because of the long wait

504
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
But I was

505
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
It's really rather

506
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
Pleasantly surprised

507
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
How long I didn't have to this time

508
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,344
So first red flags

509
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,160
Not sure exactly

510
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
How's this

511
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
Works

512
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,912
Deeply involved in stuff prior to 2011 or whatever

513
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,496
Then she said something else

514
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
My last

515
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
The peace and joy

516
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
This movement

517
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
3 when we were

518
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,328
Country was Obama

519
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,984
Estimated maybe she wasn't that investigator all that she doesn't remember what f****** countries

520
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,592
He was protesting against those bombing

521
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
Massive red flags

522
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
Anybody

523
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,176
Claim speed

524
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
2003

525
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:31,648
The moment that we go to absolutely aunt

526
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
And then you're like well we lost this one

527
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,144
I guess that's kind of ridiculous

528
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,032
Yeah so you have a situation presented themselves as

529
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,592
Annex person of Alaska whatever

530
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,296
All right you don't count

531
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
Whatever leftist credentials you think you have

532
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
You don't

533
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,160
Another caller

534
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,768
Don't think this guy's a person is much better

535
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,584
Tanger Outlets

536
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
Reliant

537
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
People

538
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
Hanging around those people just

539
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
I woke up

540
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
16 years old I knew that was

541
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,784
Wasn't they

542
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
The real thing you know I

543
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
High School

544
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Here's the deal

545
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,448
High School

546
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Occupy

547
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Right

548
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:56,640
How on the left disgusted by occupy

549
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:07,648
I don't know about that they were doing so much they were

550
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,928
Whatever

551
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
This is

552
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,280
Kind of collar that you're going to get called again when you put out these sorts of

553
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,632
Like this is the person I want to talk to

554
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,936
Ridiculous

555
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,752
Voted for Obama

556
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,592
Country and I

557
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,224
And it was

558
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Media

559
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,624
Talbots

560
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
We're coming out

561
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,864
Uber

562
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Contradict

563
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
What immediately

564
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
Yeah I know

565
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:09,088
So that's

566
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,904
Exactly

567
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:18,560
I lost my mind I literally lost but I didn't jokingly lose my mind it was gone

568
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,704
Yeah it's something that you could passively watch wants if you're not thinking you're high

569
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,104
Like you could get through it be like 10 and that road is a real

570
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,504
Alarm Bells go off unless you're

571
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,856
Are you like hold the f****** phone if you see me 20 times

572
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
You know what to say

573
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Is good as Avenger

574
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,448
I will later

575
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,896
Bona fides are that you voted for Obama first and what's going on here

576
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,456
Cold callers is just

577
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,736
This is what you get

578
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,040
It's it's comical

579
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,832
Yeah

580
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,648
Baby

581
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:20,256

582
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,352
God dammit

583
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
Weird

584
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:30,752
I am now most afraid of are anybody anytime

585
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,568
I did some research I'm like I shut off I'm done

586
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,640
I'm out on whatever you think research is

587
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:41,248
Is amounts yeah yeah it is

588
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,832
Climate we're watching YouTube videos and

589
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:50,464
Reading qanon Post got to be a little bit careful

Police release

605
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:39,872
The statement themselves warning that there were multiple fake fundraisers for David Dorn

606
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,712
And according to a June 3rd article in Fox News

607
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:47,040
Police say none of the pages have been authorized by his family

608
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,600
Authorities are in the process of taking them down

609
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:56,000
The GoFundMe page that Alex is referring to that is under $50,000 donated to it is actually one of the pages

610
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,328
It's listed as an example of such a scam fundraiser

611
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
That authorities are trying to get removed

612
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:06,240

Backstoppers is an organization that provides aid for families of police firefighters and paramedics who were killed so they have

618
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
Work already in place

619
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:35,168
I'm not certain that this amount covers all their expenses or anything like that but it's likely relevant factor in them not to crowd

620
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
It's worth all of their system

621
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:41,568
I want to present this as a case of no one caring about David Dorn but in reality

622
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:46,944
This is a situation where a bunch of people

623
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,784
How to know I deal with the reality of the situation is so

624
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,392
Fraudulent crowdfunding campaign didn't make enough money

625
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,184
Nut yeah that's a weird thing to do

626
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
Yeah

627
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:04,608
The official George Floyd GoFundMe page has raised almost 14 million at this point but

628
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,168
So what

629
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:12,032
I mean I don't know you have 14 million dollars isn't worth

630
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,336
Human life so cute

631
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
If you had five children

632
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:19,456
Expenses that are needed for helping them

633
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:25,856
There's a possibility

634
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,648
Probably

635
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
At least

636
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,744
Some of it is going to go into charitable

637
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,792
Causes

638
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,888
See that is like the family May 14th

639
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,680
There will be plenty of things.

640
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,544
So

641
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,080
Maxscholar

642
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,128

All say

644
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,480
I don't know if I don't know if I agree with everything The Scholar says

Black people will never

650
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472
Because of what

651
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
We went through

652
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,544
America

653
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
That's really was

654
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,640
Call Danelle

655
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,016
Do do bad things that we going through

656
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Texas verse 810

657
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
Course you haven't

658
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,728
Opposing or trying to block it

659
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,080
A hundred percent

660
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:02,879
Clearly to sipping a drink that's that's something still in there it's true

661
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,183
That's suspicious

662
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
Yeah

663
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:12,095
Also a tax for 10 years is not the same

664
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,375
The problem

665
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,167
Has been attacked or destroyed for generation

666
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,031
And more importantly I suggested this or is

667
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:27,455
You believe for a second that people like Alex who think affirmative action is a brutal attack on whites

668
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:33,855
We hear Trump come out and see the black business owners don't have to pay taxes

669
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:42,559
Globalist reparations or some s***

670
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,863
How to make this up because he's eating

671
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,191
Any other Filipino response to the very real point of dollars make

672
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:54,847
Decides to make something up

673
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:01,247
Haven't heard about that

674
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:07,647
$100,000 tomorrow and Democrats block your mouth doesn't sound.

675
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:15,583
Another caller

676
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,423
This caller is apparently

677
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,127
Well you sound like

678
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,455
The movie

679
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,015
Onion rings

680
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,047
You're going to eat anyway

681
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,839
So this caller

682
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,375
Is

683
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
You know

684
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Sub

685
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:57,055
Onion ring with an open molar are you shiting me that is going to release date

686
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,103
You're going to get dry socket

687
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,151
Is Santa real

688
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,711
So this caller goes on and this

689
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,599
Infowars

690
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,879
Panda

691
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
What happened to the old

692
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
Firepower

693
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,679
I'm very very racist because we

694
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
More crew

695
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
Michelle's very popular

696
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
We just have them

697
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
Suspend that

698
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
Election

699
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:51,839
We got a big

700
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
Problem

701
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
Call Oso

702
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,615
And then

703
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
Show for a while

704
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
What is inherently

705
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,503
Real weird

706
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
Audiology

707
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,623
I'm engaging evil racist

708
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,415
Tell me tell me more about what I did

709
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,935
Call Jack

710
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
So

711
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:39,455
This caller who thinks they're pulling a stunt accidentally kind of highlighted a bit of proof that Alex is making stuff up to cover his

712
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,479
Racist ass

713
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:47,135
Stopping the show Firepower which featured his only

714
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,415
Will Johnson

715
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:51,487
Alex claims that he stopped doing that show because they

716
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
Find the crew it's the clue thing

717
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,071
But in his defense

718
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,119
Actually disproves

719
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,751
Show started

720
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
After Firepower ended

721
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:09,663
Whatever crew barnes's using easily be handling Firepower so the crew excuse just doesn't work

722
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:15,039
For some reason Alex did not value Firepower as much as he values the possibility

723
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,319
Of doing another show

724
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,855
Gets worse

725
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,927
The other host of Firepower with Tom pepper

726
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:27,583
If you go to Bam. Video you'll see an entire section of a site dedicated to top and is dumb blog National file

727
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,679
Will Johnson

728
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,471
America first

729
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,543
Which there are no leaks

730
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,311
No

731
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Will Grey

732
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:44,223
Will still has his own YouTube channel

733
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:47,039
There's absolutely no reason that itself produced

734
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,087
Contact Astilbe platform

735
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:56,767
I'm not saying this is proof of being racist

736
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:00,863
Definitely calls into question the argument that he didn't have a crew to keep well around

737
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,191
Memeworld Tommy Robinson David Icke

738
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,007
Kaitlin Bennett

739
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,567
And those are just third-party produced content

740
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,639
It's really suspicious that will Johnson doesn't have a page himself

741
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,175
It could be a personal thing

742
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,503
I can imagine how it sucks to work with

743
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,063
And honestly I think it would happen.

744
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:26,463
But one of these Trump rallies will Johnson was the guy who got interviewed by like CBS News

745
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:32,863
Whenever I interview

746
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,655
Border

747
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,703
Was really not good

748
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,751
And maybe will Johnson was like

749
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,591
Look it's going to be bad for me to express my opinion or whatever

750
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,615
Now I dissociate

751
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:47,967
Honestly my first thought

752
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,063
Less anything to do with Alex cuz I think he actually would

753
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,391
Really love having a problem

754
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,951
I do the whole thing with

755
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:03,327
Probably more an indictment of how racist Infowars viewers are

756
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,143
How could you can sustain the show that

757
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,167
Nobody

758
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,215
Watching because everybody

759
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:23,551
Alex is weird

760
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,343
I would say

761
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,695
Based on whatever you're putting in versus what you're getting out

762
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
Terms of

763
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,999
Ratings and all that stuff

764
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
Appalachia

765
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:37,119
If you just using it on a straight calculus

766
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:41,727
I don't see that being racist decision in and of itself

767
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:48,127
Kohinoor David Knight shows probably it's a little around forever so

768
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,199
To be allowed to be bad

769
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,991
Ranks or whatever

770
00:48:54,271 --> 00:49:00,415
More notable to me that he doesn't have a page on band.

771
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,951
Estranged

772
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,487
The only thing that makes it

773
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
Released

774
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Suspicious to me

775
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:09,119
Is this clear excuse

776
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:24,735
Doesn't work

777
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:30,623
You just keep people who think they were left us cuz they supported anti-war causes until the war started and Infowars

778
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,815
Very surprised for a leftist to call in and then provide Alex

779
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,911
The platform to advertise his other shows and do so very quiet

780
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:48,543
So in this next clip Alex gets another collar

781
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:54,687
About Mike Pence because kind too nice

782
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,391
Getting up in the

783
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,695
You know they

784
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
Couple things that I

785
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,327
Work together

786
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,375
Bill's you know

787
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,655
And I'm not saying he should

788
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,679
Talk bad about him

789
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,447
Anything but like

790
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
I just don't know about

791
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
Honestly I feel like

792
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Paul was the

793
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,895
More people would come to his

794
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
Funeral

795
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,527
Call Marlon

796
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,087
You say yours

797
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:39,999
Another call

798
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,583
This is

799
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,799
He still wishes that buttigieg

800
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,847
The nice guy

801
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,063
Used to be on the last show what are you

802
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,879
The time of Benghazi

803
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,207
Really f****** do it

804
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:16,095
Obama just really wasn't saying that he met you know he was

805
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,655
He was just reading lines

806
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,311
First thing and it kind of just woke me up a little bit

807
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,591
Wow

808
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
Cool

809
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,431
Boy

810
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,711
Boy

811
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,247
Benghazi

812
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:41,183
Birtherism further ISM in Benghazi its unofficial

813
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:45,023
It seems to be a lot of people lost their minds around Benghazi

814
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:53,471
An incredibly full court press

815
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:58,079
The right-wing media

816
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:02,431
Underestimate a little bit in terms of like heaven

817
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,223
A real transformative effect

818
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
McDonald lot of people

819
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,551
Or if you were into birtherism

820
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:12,671
Maybe maybe you weren't that great

821
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,743
If you found that persuasive

822
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,535
Maybe that means it's you

823
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,911
The seventies is like cigarettes

824
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,679
She's probably fine

825
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:30,591
In this next clip Alex is trying to get to Steve pieczenik but

826
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,623
Is he couldn't even have a crew for his own show

827
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,927
Not good

828
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:51,071
He does actually complain that's like we get these people who apply and then they find out that it's Alex Jones and they say no

829
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,495
So instead of talking to Steve he doesn't

830
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,775
Entire segment

831
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,799

00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591

4 months of The Bella

Mason iodine

842
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,471
It's finally here

843
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
The harness the full power of

844
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,039

845
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,575
The ultimate

846
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,439
Feel good

847
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:56,095
It's so weird to hear them do like a straight

848
00:53:56,351 --> 00:54:02,495
Weird how it has that testimonial

849
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:06,847
Ad copy

850
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,407
Very suspicious

851
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,711
Steve

852
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:12,479
Man

853
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:19,391
Messy. I missed him a little bit just because I think we should defend the government

854
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:25,791
Only fund the police may just want to break down the entire State Department pretty much everything about government

855
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,631
Police Department whatever

856
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:33,983
I just think that he usually is the kind of cuckoo really swings he takes

857
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:41,663
Are you cranky or sometimes he yells at Alex

858
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:47,807
Show that I can always appreciate interesting

859
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,831
Worthwhile

860
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,135
And I hear is Alex saying hello

861
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:54,975
Researcher

862
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,887
Just joined us

863
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,191
Break

864
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,215
With what we're witnessing

865
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,239
Singer George Floyd

866
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,151
Classic Coke

867
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,431
Programming Behavior

868
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:25,951
What they going to pull next year's with Steve has the situation going on in the world right now

869
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,399
The reason I say that with a smile is

870
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,727
She's not there

871
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,519
Neither of the leaders

872
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,591
Party

873
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
In the business

874
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,039
Station propaganda

875
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,727
In this case it's

876
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,007
Complete disaster

877
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,847
Or maybe that's not what's happening

878
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,919
Maybe your analysis is completely off

879
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:23,807
Popular

880
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
Various countries

881
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:31,231
Steve goes into a McDonald's has the worst Olive Garden

882
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:37,631
Never seen I can't believe these people are trying to do it

883
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,167
McDonald's

884
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,543
The breadsticks what are these what are these

885
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,591
Potato things that I'm saying

886
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:52,991
It's like saying If This Were agitation propaganda it's being done terribly the time you take the info

887
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,015
Yeah

888
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:59,647
Steve discusses this idea that you know

889
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,207
This is all just agitation propaganda

890
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,839
This case it's a complete disaster

891
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,631
Number one George

892
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,167
Is the wrong example

893
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,263
Nike element

894
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
How to do a fade

895
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:33,951
An argument is not good so far

896
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
If you commit a crime

897
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
You got it

898
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:45,727
It's not your fault

899
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:52,127
Super f***** up

900
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,431
Might also be evidence of

901
00:57:54,943 --> 00:58:01,087
One listen to that station about George Floyd

902
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:05,695
This is a clear and flagrant example of

903
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,743
A very long time

904
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
For a lot of people

905
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:13,375
Demonizing George Floyd Mayfield important for the right-wing propaganda stink.

906
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,423
Really missing the forest for the trees

907
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:20,799
Every drug in the world on Emmet arrested as many times as you like in the past

908
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,847
It still doesn't really affect

909
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,639
How inappropriate the police action

910
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,455
And how they attempted to sweep it under the rug

911
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:32,319
Whether or not George Floyd was a good enough person not to be killed is the definition

912
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,391
Missing the point crucial for people like Steven

913
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,927
Because I'm sublevel

914
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,487
I think they have to recognize that the protest

915
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,023
Heaven results

916
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:44,607
That makes them very scared

917
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,471
The best trick to take NSYNC up is to attack the murder victim

918
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,519
But it's not going to be effective in any way

919
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:57,407
They can probably Harden their base up a little bit with this and make them feel better for hating the protest and protesters

920
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:02,527
I can't imagine anyone has anything other than

921
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:08,927
Like a complete disconnect from reality and if you want to play this game choose another person has been killed by the Pooh

922
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:16,351
Minneapolis

923
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,471
Situation

924
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,751
More

925
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:25,567
Realistically put Emma and Steve obviously couldn't

926
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,639
Say that about every single person

927
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:36,319
Steve's a dum dum this is stupid to try and use the veneer of

928
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,623
His like psych Warfare nonsense

929
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:45,023
To apply to the situation

930
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:48,351
Doris or whatever

931
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,655
It's even more.

932
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:53,471
Because that opens him up to okay fine

933
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,495
You think

934
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,775
Floyd is the wrong person

935
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:59,871
Who's the right person and then you go down the f****** list

936
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,151
And your point is made

937
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,479
That's one way to put it

938
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:09,855
So Steve believes that suspects are in the mix

939
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
Sociopath

940
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:21,375
Really unhappy create agitation

941
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,935
It would be a miracle

942
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,263
CI Elementary

943
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,799
The FBI

944
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,615
Some of the other elements within our

945
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,407
Which is

946
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,687
You guys explain

947
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,039
None of that means anything nothing

948
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,319
So now you want

949
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,367
I want to know

950
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,415
Now let me tell you who the leaders are

951
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
What

952
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:57,727
Reverend Alan Sharp Allen

953
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:03,615
If you haven't never will because his name is short for Alfred

954
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:10,015
What are you doing better

955
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,831
Write a book

956
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,623
About Sharpton

957
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,415
Tenn Tom Clancy

958
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:18,463
Anyway

959
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,487
Steve

960
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,791
Suggest something really troubling

961
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,095
Couchtuner

962
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,399
What did what begins kind of like

963
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,423
Sensibility

964
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,959
It's it's bad

965
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
Trump's wrong

966
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,823
What's wrong to say Instagram

967
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:39,455
You know what he may have been wrong but his job is to keep his mouth

968
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,223
Quiet

969
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:46,623
So they're expressing the Trump meme been wrong to want

970
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,951
What is f****** mouth

971
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,231
You don't want

972
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:57,631
Anybody in positions where they can make a difference to say something when something clearly wrong is being done

973
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,191
Until you retire and you've written a book

974
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:06,591
And then eventually say you were following of core make yourself feel better because nobody ever remembers the

975
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,615
The Nuremberg trials

976
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,407
Yeah I mean

977
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:14,271
I honestly don't understand perspective of like

978
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
Yes

979
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:19,647
The president was considering and talking about doing something

980
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,183
That would be dangerous

981
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,975
And it's completely wrong

982
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,023
But you should let him do it

983
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,559
Because he's

984
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,983
That's all you can you imagine them making that argument in any other circumstance

985
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:40,383
Absolutely that's what they do

986
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,175
Your f****** mouth

987
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,967
So much I hate him so much

988
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:50,111
Get to talkin about

989
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:50,879
Jared Kushner

990
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,463
I think this conversation could be described in one word

991
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,887
I want to get in the particular

992
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,055
Everybody needs

993
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,591
Issues it's a very

994
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,223
The inside he tells me that

995
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,527
Is literally the worst thing on the planet

996
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,351
When he brought in Georgia

997
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,959
He have to pay for

998
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,031
The issue now is he has

999
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,199
The

1000
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:58,975
This is wild like four people over someone at respected expert on Alex

1001
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:05,119
Feel like coming in and being like we need Lockheed Martin guys in the administration

1002
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:11,519
This is beyond all of Alex's documentaries include like a little selected clips of Eisenhower's

1003
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,591
Speech about the military guys doing

1004
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:20,991
What is happening

1005
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
Really bad

1006
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,551
Unhinged

1007
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,343
Look at

1008
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:31,743
Let's get the Koch brothers I don't know which one of them is dead but bring his go so long to let him run everything

1009
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,535
It's it's convoluted

1010
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,559
It makes no sense

1011
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,863
I mean I guess

1012
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,143
Honestly

1013
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:43,007
The problem is a little bit of

1014
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
Sing something it's

1015
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,055
Increasingly insect

1016
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,103
Ultimately

1017
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,383
Lead to the sort of friction

1018
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:59,647
In reality if you were just listening to Alex's

1019
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:07,839
Find would be a subject of the tides whatever is being

1020
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:14,239
Talked about on the shows will literally come to the end of 1984

1021
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:18,847
What

1022
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:22,943
I wrote some documents somewhere that you could make an argument that

1023
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,527
We've been wrong all along

1024
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:29,087
Good really good

1025
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,111
Right

1026
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:35,743
Globe would be good if it was all under Trump

1027
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:39,327
The problem isn't the method

1028
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,631
Right there

1029
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:42,911
Sure

1030
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,447
So

1031
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,239
Don't understand

1032
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,007
No one

1033
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,055
Is that

1034
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,079
Trump gets things

1035
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:54,687
No he doesn't

1036
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,295
People like me and you

1037
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,647
He eliminated regulation

1038
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:05,951
Play

1039
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,559
History

1040
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,263
For the first time in our history

1041
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,335
We have to use Russian rocket

1042
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,783
Here's a president United States

1043
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,879
Makespace

1044
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,951
Muskingum said do it

1045
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:44,863
You guys also

1046
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
Rocket stove

1047
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,655
Lunker

1048
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,935
Stop being an office

1049
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:52,287
That being said responded to a very fitting

1050
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,359
Appropriate thing in that is

1051
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,663
Presumably

1052
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,199
Are sitting here talking about

1053
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:05,599
Space walk board and the atmosphere entirely

1054
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:11,999
Play and then we only have to fight Wars in space cuz everybody

1055
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:15,071
Be first US launch in 40 years

1056
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,887
The last one was in 2011

1057
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:20,703
It's been nine years I have the last one was under Obama

1058
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,751
The space shuttle Atlantis took

1059
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:29,151
International Space Station on July 8th 2011

1060
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:34,527
If you're including on man launches into this than Atlas 5

1061
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,063
2020 out of Cape

1062
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,855
Canaveral

1063
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,879
Steve is trying to make you

1064
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:44,767
Feels like Trump has gotten so little done that in order to make it seem like he's gotten a lot.

1065
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,559
Is Stooges just makes it up

1066
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,911
Yeah he's not done anything deregulation

1067
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,935
And then

1068
01:07:54,495 --> 01:08:00,639
And you've got deregulation he's confirmed

1069
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:04,223
Number of judicial appointment

1070
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,759
History

1071
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:10,879
Weird

1072
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:14,207
Elon Musk

1073
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:19,583
Get that rocket up because they have a secret

1074
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:22,143
Because I'm sure you know this

1075
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,287
They got a deal him and must actually get my

1076
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,311
Year

1077
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,847
They've already got robots

1078
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,639
Step on the moon with a 3D printer

1079
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,111
Tomorrow

1080
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,391
Okay

1081
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:46,975
Elon Musk

1082
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:53,631
How many different album titles in the past

1083
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,655
You try you know

1084
01:08:54,911 --> 01:09:01,055
Starship amazing

1085
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:04,895
Sitting On the Dark Side of the Moon believe that her name of the song

1086
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:11,039
Distance down the road kind of conversations about the possibility of building something on the Moon by

1087
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:15,391
They're doing it now I'm going to need a citation on

1088
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:18,207
We get a building on the moon give me Med beds

1089
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,743
Also I

1090
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,511
Do thing

1091
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,839
This would be an international incident

1092
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:31,519
Because space is not owned by United States

1093
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:37,919
Is a Cooperative aspect

1094
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,735
That kind of high-level information I mean unless

1095
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,527
They were to listen to Alex Jones

1096
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,855
Or notice

1097
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:49,183
From the International Space Station

1098
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,207
Alright

1099
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,999
I think this is a load of s***

1100
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:55,327
That is also kind of makes it

1101
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,799
Also Moonraker

1102
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,079
Totally real

1103
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,615
Definitely

1104
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,551
F****** around

1105
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,879
America is going to release all these

1106
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,671
Depressed Technologies Ezra

1107
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,695
Technology

1108
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,031
Dark Side of the Moon

1109
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,823
Printers ready

1110
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,103
They got a bunch of other stuff

1111
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
Have mango

1112
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,527
Enemies

1113
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,111
They've already got the base

1114
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,463
Not if it's already has already changed

1115
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,047
Also there's literally no way

1116
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:02,399
That Alex would be cleared to disseminate this information

1117
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,191
If This Were something it was happening

1118
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:08,799
President Yvonne bus

1119
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,871
Look we got a base on the moon

1120
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:16,735
Robots

1121
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,783
Alex

1122
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:25,183
Alex we want you randomly talk about this

1123
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:27,487
You're stupid radio show after surgery

1124
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,023
I need a bunch of onion rings

1125
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,095
The protests have already

1126
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:32,863
Accomplish more than

1127
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:33,887
Trump has in office

1128
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:39,775
Yeah that's probably

1129
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,799
Will not

1130
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:44,127
Get a moon base it will not end in a moon base

1131
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:50,015
So This Is the End

1132
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:54,367
Winestone uneventful end and then Paul Joseph Watson takes over for

1133
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,391
4/4 hour

1134
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,695
Half shift

1135
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:07,167
I honestly because of the move and everything because Alex is out of Studio I was very seriously considering not doing it

1136
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,471
I heard Steve was on

1137
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:16,639
Like it's the siren song

1138
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:19,967
Didn't live up to what I wanted it to be except for Alan Sharp

1139
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,503
General courses

1140
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:26,367
That's pretty great in the process finding the spring of calls

1141
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,159
Was absurd banana

1142
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:34,559
Episode

1143
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:44,287
Or the correct length of an episode according to every other podcast in the world

1144
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:48,639
Coconuts another hour out of this but am I going to

1145
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,687
So

1146
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,391
Cialix within his contacts

1147
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:03,231
IC concerted effort

1148
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,767
To try and invalidate

1149
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:08,863
The protest what he thinks is the Coralville

1150
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,167
He's missing the point entirely

1151
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,983
But he's worried about it

1152
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,007
Oh yeah

1153
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:19,359
I mean the stuff about like really making a big deal out of

1154
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:24,735
The guy who shot the guy in the truck

1155
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,015
Another guy

1156
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:31,135
Should be should have the consequences that

1157
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:35,743
Yeah using that to be like

1158
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:39,327
Guys in trucks or whatever

1159
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,655
Kind of stuff is pretty pretty normal features

1160
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:45,215
ICICI

1161
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,239
In him

1162
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,775
And

1163
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:51,103
I think that's what he's expressing what he's trying to get these calls

1164
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,919
From people who used to be an antifa

1165
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,943
I think

1166
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:58,015
You seems that signal project Veritas did this

1167
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,551
We are b******* piece

1168
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:06,207
Call her

1169
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:10,303
No one does

1170
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,839
Students

1171
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,655
And the other thing with those calls to is

1172
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,447
Trying to get the message that like

1173
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,775
It's okay to come over here on this side

1174
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:23,871
And unfortunately all the examples are people who

1175
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:27,199
Or not

1176
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:32,319
I was fine I didn't think Obama was born here I still vote for him because

1177
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:35,903
You got to give it up to a guy who didn't even know who wasn't even born here become a

1178
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:46,143
Who knows I don't know until then

1179
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,935
