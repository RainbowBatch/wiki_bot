00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600
Exostar something

10
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,184
I don't know what this is selling us now

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,816
I believe it is the Coca-Cola Starlight

12
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,888
It's the pits

13
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,472
That is a beverage featuring a red color and a unique mean

I don't know Myspace

17
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
This tastes just

18
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
If empty it is empty it takes your breath away

19
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Absolutely I like it

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,720
That kind of messaging and branding is somebody

21
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
It's impossible.

22
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,704
Actually taste like

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
It is

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,152
Taste testers lick it and they were like okay

25
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,992
I got this one now so are far more questions about space

26
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:34,880
Take me to VIP cuz this is every it's overly sweet why don't we send taste testers to space

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,768
That's a great question what is the dust taste like

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,072
Like to taste nothing

29
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,472
How many people would love to brag that they licked the Moon

30
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,824
TV

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,432
Nothing like a strong to get into a fight with somebody about like

32
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,248
Whether or not he's licking the Moon

33
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,064
I bet he didn't have the guts to take that helmet off

34
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
Yesterday I went and got the first session of my

35
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,560
Wedding ring hand tattoo that's right yeah it's really really nice

36
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:19,424

37
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
Issues you know how I have a tremor

38
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128
Haha sometimes I'll be doing some fine motor work and I'll jerk around and we'll go flying everywhere

39
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
When you're tattooing

40
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
That hurts a lot more

41
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,784
Yeah and especially on your hand so he was having a real bad day

42
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:41,440
I could I could see that being being couple you don't want to inflict pain on people

43
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,840
And at the hand tattoos ever

Sing yeah yeah

65
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175

Well Where Do We Begin busy week

67
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
Weird chaotic

68
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
Stressful

69
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,951
Yes so we had planned on Sunday

70
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:56,351
Aleve for Austin

71
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,751
Broadcast like live reporters I was planning to get a hat that I can put a little card absolutely.

72
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Puppy

73
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
The best I was definitely going to get an old rotary phone I had already looked up various ice cream place

74
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:16,319
Chicago like

75
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:21,695
Dreamy creamy summer yeah you were going to get a two-week like exploration

76
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,047
But unfortunately that trial has been postponed

77
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,119
Do to Alex's bankruptcy maneuvering

78
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,519
He owes me money for flights are not cancelled

79
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,335
I mean there's that there is a small part of it that's on you

80
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,151
Getting on refundable ticket

81
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,223
What what I'm going to get expensive tickets that you can refund

82
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
What how was I supposed to

83
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
To guess in a situation like this

84
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,719
Said something surprising would happen that would delay the trial something surprising that also you knew

85
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
Who was a possibility

86
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
From the jump

87
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,703
It's ups and downs with it throughout the week I gave this going to happen is this not going to

88
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,263
Like it was just

89
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
Really

90
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,687
Chaotic and moralizing

91
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:22,111
Past won't be able to take this trip

92
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
On Sunday and I was excited to be

93
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,487
They're with my parents in Austin the whole thing

94
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
So there's a little bit of deflation Maybe

95
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
So

96
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,543
Some of those issues also are

97
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
It's still developing and so we'll see we'll see where things

98
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
And exactly in terms of

99
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,807
If and how and when this trial is going to proceed

100
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:57,951
And when we have more information I sure you you all it'll be wonderful and we'll we'll get into it that's the plan

101
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Alex needs money

102
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,887
Yes we do know that you know that as there's big news that is broken that people

103
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:10,239
Baby making more out of than they need to or maybe not I'm not sure

104
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:16,127
And that is the issue of Alex going to the doj and asking for immunity

105
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
Exchange for a conversation

106
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
Now I think that there is one way to look at this and that's the way I think a lot of Twitter is looking at this and it's like Alex

107
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Flipped

108
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
Yeah

109
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,671
I don't know if that's the case

110
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
I mean 41

111
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,815
Alex did talk about on our last episode covering his show from Monday

112
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:39,167
That he was planning to go and make an offer to the FBI

113
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,519
And that he doesn't know anyting but he doesn't want to

114
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,407
Run any risk of getting in trouble and so he would do it for the deal of immunity

115
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,991
So I'm not certain exactly how much of this is

116
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
Is revelatory as people made

117
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,415
Everything good maybe obviously the people who were

118
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:06,559
Reporting on it are people who necessarily watch Infowars so they wouldn't have seen that on bonfire

119
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,959
If it's something that is like Alex's turned State's evidence

120
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:19,103
I don't know how much you be talking about that on his show

121
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,407
And this is the way I would like things to go

122
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
If I had

123
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
My druthers

124
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,319
Everything Alex is doing right now we have to assume

125
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,623
The end goal of that is to get more money

126
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
2

127
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,279
Avoid paying money right it's all about money is my point at this point in time

128
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,935
Yeah yeah yeah yeah and the way he makes money is by advancing bigoted politics

129
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
Erode public confidence in

130
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,567
Right centralized collaborative system

131
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
And at this point in time

132
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,199
Giving him any attention is only going to be beneficial

133
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
That's my vibe on it

134
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,647
Well sort of outside of that you run into is they win you over

135
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,487
Write something like this would be like Alex's flipped he's going to turn to tell everybody

136
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,071
He doesn't or if that doesn't happen it looks like

137
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Right right

138
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,215
No I do think there's a possibility it's a very small possibility

139
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
Outside possibility

140
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
That Alex has realized

141
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
That some of his friends

142
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:29,503
We're up two more than he realized initially or that's possible you know reading some of these indictments of The Oath Keepers

143
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,807
And stuff maybe you realize like

144
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:37,183
I do have texts that are relevant to this and I didn't realize they were

145
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,511
Right I better just make sure I don't get arrested

146
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Could be

147
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Could be there's a chance

148
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:47,167
I don't think it's high but I think there's a chance of that might be I wouldn't

149
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,495
I maybe that's flipping I don't know if

150
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
If he was flipping

151
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
It wouldn't be Papa

152
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
Like this

153
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:02,015
So what are you doing now because it's so public it suggests to me that one he doesn't actually have anything to share

154
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
So there's no risk in him coming out with this

155
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,671
It's possible they're going to run with it and you know how we know cuz they did

156
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:15,071
I am so I kind of think that he's got nothing and he's trying to get headlines that aren't about Sandy Hook that he

157
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
Chicken fundraiser off of and people are obliging

158
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
Yeah

159
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
Yeah that's my feeling

160
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
Yeah it's I think that's pretty strong possibility but yeah we'll see we'll see what I

161
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,895
Happens with this

162
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Just a guess

163
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,879
Spie the boj probably aren't interested in giving him immunity

164
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
30 from 4

165
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,047
I don't I don't know it it seems it seems like a weird thing for them to the humor

166
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,703
I mean not because like there's necessarily like giant charges coming for him just because

167
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
No

168
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
Absolutely not

169
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Absolutely not

170
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:03,199
Just a flat-out no whatever information you have is worth less than me saying no to you right now

171
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,759
Like no matter what you've got for me

172
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,831
It's going to be better for information the long-run to say

173
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,903
F*** you and so much of the information that they probably

174
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,695
Would need from Alex they have

175
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:20,095
From the other side other people messages

176
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,143
Available by spell roaches

177
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,239
I don't know I'm not

178
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,335
I don't know if this is as big of a story as some people are experiencing bad

179
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:35,711
But that's it I don't have any inside information I don't know that that the ins-and-outs of this so

180
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:42,111
I could easily not know a piece of information that isn't public and that could be the piece of information

181
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
And that changes my mind on

182
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
On everything

183
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
So we'll see we'll see

184
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,815
There's so many moving parts and

185
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Is there is

186
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,959
A lot going on in pores but how bad they need money yeah and there's some stuff

187
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
I just know I think it's going to take

188
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:06,175
Until Monday for me to really get another episode together

189
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Back burner

190
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
Well unfortunately

191
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
I don't have to tell you this

192
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
I

193
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,671
I don't have any Project Camelot I don't have

194
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Jim Bakker

195
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
I know I've been talking a lot about this Russell Brand and I think eventually there might be maybe a Jimmy

196
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:29,983
Door episode at some point down the line branching out a tiny bit

197
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,335
Okay because here's a question that I have been thinking about for so long

198
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
And that question is

199
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
Well I suppose it's not a question

200
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
But it's more like

201
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,855
Alex rant about the devil and witches and we get all of his perspective and all of his

202
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,927
He's guess perspective on that what have we never done

203
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
We've never interviewed the devil

204
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,583
We've not done that we've not

205
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,471
Had a month of puddings that's what I will say to you is this

206
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
You have not interviewed the devil

207
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
Yeah but we should talk to someone

208
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
Who has

209
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,407
Somebody's interview the devil

210
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
We haven't seen we haven't heard from witches heard from magicians

211
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,623
The magical powered people

212
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:26,559
I mean maybe not specifically on the devil but we've definitely heard some people with powers on it we had a project

213
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Quickly Magic

214
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:34,239
Can I also say that I think that our main subject Alex Jones thinks he can do magic

215
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:38,335
He has seen the devil

216
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,151
I think we'll find that there are a lot of similarities

217
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:46,271
Is Joe Rogan and his talk to the Clockwork elves that to do what you do DMT

218
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,087
But I would say we're about to talk

219
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Well

220
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
Some witches

221
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,535
We are going to what it is this is an out-of-context drop for you

222
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Give me a little idea of what's going on

223
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887
Alright great so and the next question

224
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:07,007
Let's get into the role of the devil and the Saints and European magic and Witchcraft and

225
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
Do you believe in the devil and if so

226
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Are there a lot of them

227
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
What is the Dell

228
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
What is what is

229
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
Do you believe in the devil

230
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735

232
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,087
Wait. Kind of messing it up

233
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,647
Follow-ups

234
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,463
I imagine I do believe in the devil

235
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
Would you believe that there is a bunch of them

236
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375

237
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,751

238
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,663

Yes why you looking for sharks in Lost Cities

274

I think they lost cities there's more to be found that sharks you can find sharks anywhere in the ocean

275
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,367
Yeah but not the most magical ones the most magical sharks obviously moved into the Lost City

276
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:08,767
And by being in the Lost Cities have game the magical power tools

277
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,983
Barry gleed

278
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,543
Has

279
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,431
I mean his credits are amazing it's quite a resume it doesn't get better than that

280
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,527
So he's he's he's like a certain he's like my age

281
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,599
Okay

282
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:38,719
Have you ever had a billionaire bottles at once

283
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:45,119
He said it's Alexis few experience I have actually had a billionaire Night by me

284
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
It was just sparkling grape juice

285
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
So I can't really compete

286
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,311
I had a millionaire dick bag buy me a bottle of champagne

287
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
I wouldn't put it in my credits

288
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,831
So he is being interviewed by Rex bear

289
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,927
Who is the host of the leak project

290
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,767
Which I guess is a podcast in and web series

291
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,071
It's words

292
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,911
The news media and the government this is its description of what it's

293
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
Okay

294
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:26,079
Okay the news media and the government are entwined in a vicious circle of mutual manipulation myth-making and self-interest

295
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,407
Journalist need crises to dramatize news

296
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,223
And government officials need to appear to be responding to Christ

297
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,807
Too often the crises are not really crazy but you ain't fabrication

298
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:42,207
The two institutions become still ensnared and assembly out of Web of Lies that the news media are not able to tell

299
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
Tell the public what is true

300
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
And the government is unable to govern effect

301
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
That's

302
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
It's credits

303
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:56,031
FleetPride Stanford complaint

304
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
About us

305
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:03,455
Write about the government and not at all about the Libra description I wouldn't know if this is a

306
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
Show or

307
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
No

308
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,695
Crazily enough that does not move over to Rexburg is a delight of a man

309
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
And he's going to tell us what we're going to talk about

310
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,815
That he's harboring these feeling

311
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,911
He's mad at the government but like how we all

312
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,215
You know like it is f****** up

313
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:30,591
Sure and if you believe in magic maybe you think it's f****** up a little bit weirder yeah I would assume so

314
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,919
And I want to get into real quick

315
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
But we're going to talk about

316
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
We're going to discuss

317
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503
The grimoire tradition

318
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
And its relationship

319
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Chaos Magic

320
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
The latest Consciousness science

321
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
And the return of

322
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Animus

323
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
The role of the devil

324
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
And the Saints and European Magic

325
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
Witchcraft

326
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
A chaos magic form of remote

327
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
Viewing

328
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,887
A method of summoning Dragon spirits

329
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
That sounds exciting

330
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,215
A Sumerian method of banishing ghosts

331
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,239
I need that one

332
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,383
A complete system of stratification hello and the second part of the podcast you will be taken question

The ghost get out of here

335
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
Cuz you asked the question

336
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:17,952

Syfy show ghost

339
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
Hades developing a recurring theme there

340
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,960
That smell is going to come back up

341
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:33,568
He is not going to explain to us why he needs it though that sucks it drives me insane

342
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,152
There's a couple things that I have to deal with here first

343
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
Too much on the plate

344
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
This if your life

345
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,272
Too much to get into

346
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576

351
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
Also chaos Magic

352
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:07,360
I can't not think of Sonic the Hedgehog the chaos emeralds Chaos Control

353
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,200
Find it chaos magic is very different from the sex Magic

354
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,552
I mean I can't really answer so much

355
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
Of that

356
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
Because

357
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,880
I've read Gordon White's book

358
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,952
Which was a fun thing for me to do

359
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
And

360
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
His

361
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Belief system

362
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
Of what chaos magic is

363
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
It's kind of

364
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,400
Everything is right

365
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:36,800
Okay so so like in his book about what spells are this dude is really really brilliant

366
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:41,408
I don't know if he's brilliant so much as if he has in an eidetic memory like

367
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
He's

368
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:49,600
Absurdly well-read and he cites things that are 100% true like he is a fan of a dancer

369
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,184
Okay if he starts telling you about the history

370
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,048
He can talk for like 5 straight minutes tell you everything that actually happened like that is

371
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
That is understood

372
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
And then be like okay

373
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
Now we know what happened

374
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,960
Here's why magic did it you know and you're like

375
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
What

376
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,544
What why why did you do that

377
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,592
Maybe someone Put A Spell On You

378
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,760
That made him think of Magic's real well I'll tell you I can I can know we're going to do a couple spells

379
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,136
Here's what's important about the show bar

380
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,952
This is the most evil portion of the show

381
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
What was the production

382
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
It is

383
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
An app

384
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Yeah

385
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,168
And also real quick folks I wanted to let you know my friends are betrayed like

386
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Genius

387
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,496
Diatom Robert and specialist Ali project listener

388
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,544
This is just a really great way

389
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,616
Hilburn about trading of the convenience of your own home

390
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,896
What's nice about this

391
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:49,248
It's actually said you trade alert so I just wanted to show people real quick cuz I've been getting dozens of emails

392
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
The past few days

393
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,064
Wrecked how does this actually work

394
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,624
So I'm going to show you real quick what it is

395
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
Because I think it's Alexa

396
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
That's essentially

397
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,488
Super easy and a lot of people get nervous

398
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
Screen share

399
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
This right here

400
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
Boom this is

401
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
An alert that I get

402
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
Every single day

403
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,520
And sell this is a training that I've got about an hour ago

404
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,568
You can see right here I clicked on the alert

405
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,360
And then I opened it up in here

406
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,920
And this shows you exactly

407
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:22,016
The time to buy you can also get into more details of the charts

408
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
If you want to

409
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
Take the bundle opportunities or

410
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,136
Extremely discount right now if you want to do all the car.

411
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
Holiday but no leak project

412
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
I sent you

413
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
55%

414
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,304
To check it out trade like a genius.com but no leak project

415
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,376
Alright Matt let's let's rock and roll let's get into

416
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
Gordon

417
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
Where do we start

418
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
Where do we start

419
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,288
We already started

420
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Now

421
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
Why

422
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
Dan

423
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Do you think

424
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,432
That's a company like trade like a genius

425
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,248
Would choose a show that might be

426
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
A lot about wealth Magic

427
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,368
Put an ad for trade

428
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
I think it speaks for itself

429
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,816
Also assume the trade like a genius isn't necessarily a gigantic company and maybe this is something that's within their

430
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:12,704
Horizon budget I mean I think they are pretty big I'm not sure I didn't look into trade like a genius but it is what it is

431
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,104
Is it another one of those wealth trading apps where it's like okay according to this signal of a line that goes up when

432
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,224
Whenever it does this you should buy Bubba Bubba and then we get a shower and

433
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,504
And it's more of a

434
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,064
Merchant service so it's not like they get a cut of your trades

435
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,136
It is like you pay them five bucks a month or whatever

436
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
It's one of those kinds

437
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:38,560
Stream I find it's sketchy no matter what but also a presentation

438
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,632
Far more ethical than the way out 100%

439
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,192
100% this is these guys

440
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,800
Really are trying to do things as close to what they believe is the right way

441
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,336
As they possibly can

442
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,152
Now they do also have a lot of that wealth Magic

443
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Big stuff in there

444
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
Gordon weitzbuch

445
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
The chaos protocols

446
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
Protocol

447
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
Two things

448
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,440
It is like an exhaustive

449
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,488
Collection of historical

450
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,560
Spells and magic and end

451
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:14,144
Hey an exploration of where they came from and who created them

452
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
And it's it's

453
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,216
Really really

454
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,008
The other thing it is

455
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:25,408
Is a millennial screed against how the government and the economy is f****** ass over and how

456
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,200
In the 1960s

457
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,784
Certain things were worth this and now we can't buy houses

458
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,600
Sure like it's full-on

459
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,440
As anarchists socialists

460
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:42,816
Do all this s*** you know what I'm thinking about I don't know if I'm making too big of a leap year

461
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:47,424
But it makes sense to me that magicians would not like our current monetary system

462
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
Because Alchemy

463
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
Works with the gold standard

464
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
Right you know

465
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,664
Oh my God actually let me know I have this prepared.

466
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,248
Walking know how right you are

467
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:10,208
I thought there was a stupid phone

468
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,280
The chaos protocols until 1971

469
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,864
The value of the dollar was pegged to a fixed amount of precious metals

470
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,936
Just as it was at the beginning of a fractional Reserve Bank

471
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:27,360
When the famous Voodoo is Marie Laveau and her daughter were alive in the 19th century a dollar was either

472
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,408
Either made with a guaranteed amount of silver

473
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,968
Or was convertible into a specified amount

474
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,600
True things right this fix the dead but I don't know what

475
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,416
This fix the value of a dollar into something real

476
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
Now

477
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
This is where we get at that so that

478
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
Reasonable

479
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
Now we just go

480
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,584
And here's a magic is involved

481
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:53,984
So if either Laveau senior or Junior had use the customary folk magical practice of putting a dollar under a candle

482
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,032
She would have been growing wealth from a stick

483
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Text amount

484
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:03,968
If you have tried the same piece of folk magic anytime after 1971 then you are doing the opposite

485
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:10,880
In today's money you need almost five $5.78 to buy the equivalent of what a dollar could buy you a 1970

486
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,976
Such a magical act in codes in a rosian of wealth

487
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
Rather than an accumulation

488
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,096
Magic as like inflation

489
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,656
Okay

490
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,824
That's baffling I've read that 30 times trying to figure out what it is he's real

491
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,224
Really tried to say to me saying that if we went off the gold standard magic stopped working as well

492
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,528
Because because it was

493
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,112
Concretely connected to glaze resources

494
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
There's a certain

495
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,952
I mean there's a certain logic to that no

496
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,280
Disagree

497
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,352
I get the thought track

498
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:56,192
I get I get how this makes sense you someone like

499
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,008
Who has that those beliefs came up with it

500
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
Yeah well I was

501
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,336
Making a joke

502
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,128
It's kind of like her

503
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
You would make a joke about like

504
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,968
Like a libertarian

505
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:14,368
Like being against roads until they make flying cars

506
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Nobody

507
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,744
It's also a little weird for that to be the gold standard

508
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,328
Is Rhodes

509
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,864
The government shouldn't be paying for it

510
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,424
Lead back to the gold standard somehow

511
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
So

512
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:33,312
I'm going to tell you this about Gordon in case that that little stretch of

513
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,664
Dense text didn't make it clear he is a talker

514
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
He's a long-winded talk

515
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Andrex

516
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,552
Gives him I mean

517
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,392
7/8 minutes of uninterrupted speech at a time

518
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:54,048
Then he cannot stay on topic here ambles about consistently and I can't like really

519
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,096
Play mat to anybody and I'm not going to put you

520
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
See-through five minute

521
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,912
So what I've done is I took the next

522
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
8 Minute stretch of time

523
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Where he speaks

524
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
Uninterrupted

525
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,616
I don't be one of those little time montages for YouTube for cut little Supercut

526
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
All right here we go

527
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
Gordon

528
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
Where do we start

529
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,296
I didn't know I mean you you held up a number of

530
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Books there

531
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
That

532
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
I mean maybe we should

533
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
Can start with what a grandma is

534
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416

00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Soy

536
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
I mean originally

537
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
It comes from the French

538
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
Related to the

539
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816

540
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
Read grandma from

541
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
It kind of gives you so

542
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
What's an armoire

543
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
Inside

544
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248

547
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
A cooling up

548
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Demon Zane

549
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
Either one

550
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,192
So that's cool that's the swan book of anuria

551
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Inside

552
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,568
How to create the umbrella of gremlins

553
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Solomonic

554
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
Whiskey Pete's like Alyssa key

555
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
And you have other ones

556
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
Scholastic

557
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,416
That's like the maid one that's the one that everyone knows

558
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
Big Daddy

559
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
Psychological

Modes of

561
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Overcooling thing

562
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,912
Coronavirus has like

563
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
Angels and sewing in it

564
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
You would do this

565
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Abiquiu Sullivan

566
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
The other one

567
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,504
That was what we call a stolen money

568
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
They pretend

569
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
Someone

570
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Perkins

571
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
The Bible

572
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Bye

573
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Demons and

574
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
Status ideas

575
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Cooling

576
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
Spirit

577
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
Holy Cross

578
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,592
What to do the bidding of

579
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,360
Good's if

580
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Is why so many

581
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
Okay

582
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,624
Right sure I have a few problems I think there's so many

583
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,952
Well I don't know about the ethics of enslaving demons

584
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
Right

585
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,512
Demons

586
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:36,864
Sure but what does that do to you to enslave a thing

587
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,656
That actually will come up later on

588
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
Oh yeah

589
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:46,080
I don't like how all the point I noticed that you are essentially thinking like a chaos Magician of the highest caliber

590
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:52,480
Maybe I listen to too much stupid s*** maybe it's just that

591
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:58,880
Magic and everything that we talked about are essentially the same concept which is

592
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,416
Whatever I think is true is true

593
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
Sure sure

594
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:08,096
Yeah and I think one of the things about magic that's kind of different than

595
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
Some other

596
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,704
Conspiracy stuff to be a system

597
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Imagine

598
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:19,104
And I would like in order for people to like really try and make their argument there needs to be a system

599
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,736
Where is Lake with conspiracy theories there is the absence of the system there's the beginning and the conclusion

600
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,272
And then the middle is like

601
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:31,136
There's no Global let's start doing all this stuff

602
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:35,744
There's a beginning and like a thought

603
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
Kind of

604
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,584
I can kind of see that

605
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
Yeah

606
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,448
But it's still it's long it's long

607
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:50,848
And he just keeps going so Sullivan put demons in books and then Angels help you remember things

608
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
Essentially what he saying over 8 minutes

609
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,944
Grimoires

610
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,040
A couple of different things but generally speaking we're talking about books

611
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,856
That have history or magic spells

612
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,648
Bien

613
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,720
Do I associate that word with Harry Potter

614
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,144
Is a famous Skyrim has grimoires might be

615
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,264
Are the traditional like high fantasy magical term for

616
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,080
I think it's probably Skyrim that thing

617
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
Now

618
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,432
We heard a lot about Solomon

619
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,248
Okay now are our hosts Rex bear

620
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,344
He comes back from this eight minutes right where he lets go and speak uninterrupted

621
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
With this

622
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
Okay

623
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,952
Now even the word Solomon somebody brought up to me 1

624
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
You're right

625
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
Saw

626
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
Sun

627
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
Oh

628
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
And then mon last Solomon

629
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Me like sun in the Moon

630
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
So that's a

631
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
I don't know what sounds like an archetype

632
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Name this tune

633
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
It's bringing

634
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
The light in the dark

635
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Together

636
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
Damn

637
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
Deep

638
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,872
Right cannot Love More

639
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,432
That he just that Gordon went

640
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,712
So long

641
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,784
And the first thing this dude he has to come back with his like

642
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
Somebody told me like

643
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,368
Soul and then Moon

644
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
Yeah

645
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,696
Well I mean like this

646
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
Not

647
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:15,328
Moon most other older languages isn't like a loon

648
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,632
I like more of that

649
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
Synetic

650
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,960
Then son

651
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Yes so you could get

652
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,848
You know

653
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:33,760
I don't buy it I mean it's more at this level of thinking from him is more like if you were like Solomon

654
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:38,624
You know solo and then mon from like Pokemon so it's like one Pokemon

655
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,952
That level of s*** right there

656
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,840
A lot of the folks that we end up looking at do like word association games

657
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
And I can relate

658
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:54,752
Oh yeah absolutely

659
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
You're not far off

660
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:03,968
That just make a little connections that aren't really there but people go at work sometimes it sometimes

661
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:10,880
So you can see that we're clearly deerling with a disparity of expertise between our hosted

662
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,696
Whimsy on one hand

663
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:19,328
Loquacious mess on the other

664
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,888
It doesn't get worse there their relationship

665
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,936
It just it just gets nicer

666
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,216
I guess it's interesting

667
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,544
I think you even told me this once when I

668
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,592
I discussed how I read some

669
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
Passages out of

670
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
The dad in it

671
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
Spit me out I had

672
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
Dream it's weird

673
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
Start happening

674
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
I quit messing with it

675
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,064
Was it you that said well that's because you're messing

676
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,624
What the most powerful magic in the world

677
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:48,512
It might have been

678
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:54,144
We talked about the Tibetan book of dead as well as the Egyptian Book of the Dead and how they're different

679
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
Okay

680
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:59,776
This is an important part of chaos magic both 100% accurate

681
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,568
Even if they disagree with each other

682
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,408
They're still right this is another thing about magic everything is right

683
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:11,808
It's pretty tough to to wrestle with

684
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
I enjoy

685
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
Is

686
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,928
I had some freaky dreams

687
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,488
Bicycle the Tibetan Book of the Dead

688
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,144
Come on man you too much ice cream before bed or like is there another variable he's got a lot of

689
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
I've got a lot of freaky dream

690
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,984
Sure you dreams

691
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,568
I have a copy of that book of the somewhere

692
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,896
It's not affected my dream really doesn't

693
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,992
No

694
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,064
Is anything that Rex comes back at him with he's like

695
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,856
Yeah that sounds right that sounds good

696
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
And then it just keeps going

697
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Like I don't

698
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,952
Siquijor two-word rexha the entire time

699
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:56,352
I think it's a necessity of collaboration and mutual support

700
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
More than there is an improv

701
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,704
Oh yeah

702
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,104
If you start to split hairs and be like no

703
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896
Sometime you ruin the premise

704
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,968
The whole get the whole interview stops everybody just goes

705
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,504
What I don't understand

706
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
Right

707
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:20,928
Conceivably if magic were real you be able to cast a spell prove you're right

708
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,512
Unfortunately we do. Cassidy fell down the show

709
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,072
Because we be messing around with too much power

710
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
I understand that

711
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:33,728
Prove you wrong but I can't talk about the thing that I know

712
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,312
Like I have all the evidence but I can't show it to you alright

713
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,152
A boy Rex bear continues

714
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:47,296
I mean I can't even describe some of what he's doing here just it just easy to the light

715
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
You can

716
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
Some funny things

717
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,000
Mess around with a note to do what I'm saying

718
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
Some things will happen

719
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:04,448
Well certainly I've had my fun and I just read a few of the scriptures and

720
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,264
Anyway yeah like the one giving mouth

721
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,032
That was an inch

722
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
Hieroglyphics

723
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,944
They're having a little bit of fun in that one but hey why not I mean

724
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
It's your time to pass I mean

725
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,016
Anyway so

726
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,576
Anyway I'm not going to get too deep into that

727
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,184
It looks like he's

728
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,488
He's getting all those like the Pharaohs getting

729
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
Some action

730
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,840
During that certain

731
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
Ritual witch

732
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
Variance

733
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
I think he's already in the car

734
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,448
Cardenas in Costas

735
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
So

736
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:41,312
But then somebody brought up it was like hey man that's that's like the most powerful time of your life

737
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,896
Lady getting f***** in the coffin

738
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,968
Pennsylvania's responses like man

739
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,504
That's the most powerful time of your life

740
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,952
Just sounds like dude

741
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:04,352
Talking about drugs 100% Lookout

742
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:09,216
Exactly

743
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,240
Hey man look at

744
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,568
I know that you smoke weed before but this stuff is

745
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
It'll mess you up

746
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:19,456
Be careful yeah I'm not saying don't I'm not saying just be just be responsible

747
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:25,856
It's not going to stop talking with you everybody would say that about mushrooms

748
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:30,464
Cochlear like 1718

749
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
Where you like what

750
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,512
With what what

751
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:39,168
You got f***** in a coffin

752
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:43,520
How much magic and he has so many problems that he's never does not

753
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:49,408
It explained it wasn't having all this fun and f****** in conferences how all the ghosts showed up in his house right

754
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
Call Dan

755
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,992
Here is where we're going to get into some real trouble okay

756
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,784
You continue to be a witch

757
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,856
Which is funny on this episode

758
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
Because once again you have brought out

759
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,304
Drugs being very important yeah tell you I know you've gotten one of the answers right but I wanted to look in

760
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,096
Into some chaos Magic

761
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:15,520
And Gordon explains that there are three effective ways to become invincible okay can before we get to this

762
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,312
Chaos spell

763
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:23,968
Regular it would have been more Arcane if he went with a k

764
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:28,064
I thought there might be something weird or something

765
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
Georgia gas

766
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,184
You can try you've already got one drugs one is drugs

767
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,328
That's the best way to do it wow who's the most effective way that's number one

768
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:45,728
Say that this is a bad message to people messing around with drugs worth

769
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,056
Never say it makes you images on he says

770
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:55,455
Specifically the most effective route to becoming Invincible is to take a high dose of psychedelics in a suitable ritual environment

771
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
So he does want you to be safe

772
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,063
Or at least it could make you feel

773
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,111
I think that's kind of the boys right

774
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
Doesn't make you invent

775
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,695
Let me guess okay

776
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
Replace of another human

777
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,791
No animal

778
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,119
Drinking blood

779
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:19,007
Sacrifices are a historical then really

780
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:25,663
Is booze included with the triplets

781
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,967
To do magic when they're like

782
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
Falling over

783
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
I'll tell you the second most effect

784
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,599
Okay lighting a candle

785
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,415
And reciting the Lord's Prayer backwards every night for 3

786
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:43,327
I was not going to guess that most effective

787
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,631
It's it high dose of psychedelics

788
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,959
Maybe just like a candle

789
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
Okay alright

790
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,567
Sure of course

791
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,359
I think I know this

792
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
Think I know that

793
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
We have to

794
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:03,039
Run really fast with three blocks

795
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,879
Haha and then do 6 push ups

796
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,927
Climb to the top of a roof

797
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,767
Run around the top of a building 28

798
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
2X

799
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,631
2A can't be one egg

800
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,471
I feel like that would make you invincible

801
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:26,591
The third most effectively is the preliminary invocation or headless right

802
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,127
If chop your head off

803
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:34,271
But you are not a holy guardian angel

804
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:38,111
Let me give you a little bit of idea of what the Headless right is

805
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,183
Very detailed instruction

806
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
Face North

807
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,535
Touch your left temple and then your right temple with

808
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
The parchment

809
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,607
And read aloud what is written on it six times

810
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
Eyebrows

811
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,959
Buscema taxable

812
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
Lalo

813
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
6 *

814
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:59,871
Okay alright then say I'm not going to do it because I don't want to say get shrekt eternally invincible

815
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Do you want to accidentally

816
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
You coming out

817
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,039
Then say subject me to subject to me all Damon

818
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,343
So that every Damon which is not spelled like

819
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,231
Weather Heavenly or Ariel or Earthly or Subterranean order Ezreal or aquatic

820
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,559
Might be obedient to me and every enchantment and Scourge

821
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,583
Which is from God

822
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
Okay

823
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:27,007
Eagles on move from facing north to facing the direction of Orion and continue

824
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:33,663
I stopped and you had this one who created other than having a great about you that you created the light and darkness that you are outside

825
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
All red robe

826
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
It continues

827
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,271
Sure

828
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,551
Several pages on

829
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:46,207
This quite a quite a ritual with all power and authority of the one who spoke truth and who had made it

830
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,767
So you see it's a long ritual yeah this is

831
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,095
This is a problem for me for a couple reasons here's the first one

832
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,911
What does it mean to be Invincible does that mean you can't be killed

833
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,471
You can't be harmed in any way

834
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
It is

835
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:03,359
The least explain part of his book second might be a help

836
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
To you second question

837
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,967
What do you think being Invincible is I think it's a really important question

838
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,503
Listen for what you think you got out of

839
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:13,599
I think that's the only way to know if you were successful or not

840
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,671
Second question how long does invincibility last

841
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
At forever

842
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,719
Really forever

843
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
Really

844
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
Really

845
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,631
All right I mean you got the book right here I can email it to you

846
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,983
Well I would say that this has not worked ever

847
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,847
Because we don't have a bunch of invisible people walking erect actually I can't prove that

848
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
Exact

849
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:43,039
The magician always win

850
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:49,439
Determined incivility spell it really wouldn't be helpful if its 6 pages long

851
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,975
Use that spell if you need it

852
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,047
Probably soon I mean the one that tells one of them takes 39

853
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,655
You know you can't just whip that one out with your with your old-fashioned

854
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,423
True

855
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:03,775
And the other one is like doing ayahuasca

856
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,079
What you can do in a hurry that is true

857
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:12,479
Sure it's harder to do drugs really quick and safe and fine

858
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
More of a challenge

859
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:20,159
Okay so now we want to get into some comparing with Alex right because we're talking about the

860
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,719
We also need to talk about the afterlife

861
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,999
Brian talked about

862
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
Go ahead

863
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,559
Compare notes

864
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583
Might be a

865
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
Brought

866
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,423
Definitely

867
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,215
Who point

868
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
The books

869
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
What's the date today

870
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,335
Was it was this idea

871
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
Can you die

872
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
The passage

873
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
So good

874
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
You have to kind of wns

875
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,503
The judge

876
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
I'm just weighing of the heart

877
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
The swamps you

878
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
Get through that

879
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
Snakes

880
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
And all these kind of things are they

881
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
The movement of the Soul

882
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,743
From the Buddy

883
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
Requires noches

884
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
Router that it's not

885
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
It doesn't necessarily follow that just

886
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Is your dad you get

887
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
You you have to sit up

888
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
Sure

889
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,175
Yeah so

890
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,479
Alex believes that when you die

891
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,759
If you did good

892
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
You can go to heaven

893
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,575
Right

894
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,903
Theologians believe you to sit with the harp and that's not true

895
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Rye Rye

896
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
So

897
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,743
He's the kind of agrees with him right

898
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
Todai

899
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,607
Bright and then crawl through a swamp with snakes

900
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,167
Write questions about that what what question

901
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,447
You could you possibly have about that

902
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:43,103
Are these living snakes are they like real snakes snakes

903
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:49,503
System cuz them things to eat they reproduce be like ecological changes

904
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:55,903
Is there afterlife

905
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:04,607
What if there's an invasive invasive species rights it starts and it's nicer to people

906
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:11,007
Are you going to need to artificially Brigade

907
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,799
Obviously you will

908
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:19,711
It's a complex system it's like a golf course I think I feel like you could just much more easily have

909
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,735
Fake snakes

910
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,783
Making fake snakes

911
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,391
Now let's get into some fun we got to talk about ghosts

912
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
I love it

913
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
Storehouse

914
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,231
Or old

915
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
Hose

916
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
American

917
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
Is a book of

918
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,287
Looking at

919
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,335
European

920
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,175
She calls

921
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
She calls it

922
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:51,967
The Wild app

923
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,039
A really good

924
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
Where you going

925
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
Adversarial

926
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,671
Booze that makes the devil

927
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,695
A really bad

928
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,511
He's kind of

929
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,279
Mysterio theme

930
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,327
And untie

931
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
I'm so excuse category that

932
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,703
So

933
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,983
This is what it's like

934
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,799
To get to we need to talk about ghosts with this guy

935
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,663
The words that mediately before this are like okay what do you think about ghosts

936
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,223
And so he's like okay first thing you got to know

937
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:30,623
Here's what the devil is herbalist believes that the devil is the natural adversary

938
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:37,023
And now we move so I don't think that when you say that real adversary it evokes the idea of whether to me

939
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,583
Cuz I've never seen a storm and been like

940
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:46,239
That's my anime anime anime of my enemy in the storm's I don't have an adversarial relationship

941
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
Kinship with weather

942
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,799
But

943
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,103
And I don't feel it does with me either

944
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,943
If you believe that everything is some sort of

945
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:59,551
Force or action or spiritual spirit

946
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,831
In this situation

947
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
Is

948
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,135
Really whatever you think

949
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:07,231
It is the idea of an adversary is what the devil is

950
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:11,327
So whatever you think you're doing if somebody's trying to stop you that's the devil

951
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,607
Play I can

952
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:17,727
I can kind of get into that a tiny bit as long as you don't go too far with that stink

953
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,543
I know there's a lot of there's a lot of this that's just like

954
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,335
Regular old self-help stuff

955
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:28,735
Yeah and then you like the crystal or something cuz water as long as you can stay like sir to self

956
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
Aware of what

957
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
Your

958
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,575
Video using these ideas for

959
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:37,183
I don't know if it's necessarily terrible to be like my laziness is the devil

960
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,487
No and it is it is kind of

961
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:44,607
That is kind of what gordon-white is trying to do in and I think woody woody

962
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
His main goal is

963
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
Right

964
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,495
He's trying to create a system wherein you can be a good purse

965
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
You know

966
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,311
You can

967
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,383
Care about other people you can do all of this other stuff

968
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:02,783
You can fight racism he's he's a gay man and what's so important to him is the way that the LGB

969
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,575
Btq Community is being treated right now

970
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,623
Like he's Furious about all this

971
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:11,999
Beyond that I don't know he might be a Monster who haven't either covid annihilus but he's a magician so what do you

972
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:24,799
Spell viruses were worth $5

973
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,103
38 cents more than they are today

974
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,943
So he's trying to create a unified

975
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,247
If everything is true magic

976
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,015
Religion

977
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,295
All of this stuff

978
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,575
Then we can stop

979
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,599
Fighting about it all

980
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:43,231
If if I can tell you that Islamic beliefs are one hundred percent true

981
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:47,327
And Bentley's Wommack magical beliefs are 100% true and that

982
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,375
God and Christianity

983
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
Everything

984
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,471
Everything has something that he pulls from

985
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:57,055
So his basic idea and let me try and take you

986
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,103
Let me try and take you through his thought process

987
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
Okay

988
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,431
If you just look at

989
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,735
Least likely stuff

990
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,271
Then you'll be escaped

991
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,295
Thor's Magic

992
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
You're like

993
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,855
There's okay you didn't actually

994
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,623
Perform that mirror

995
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,695
Think I could be skeptical about the most

996
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,279
What if you are the person who doesn't want to be scrapped

997
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,559
Alright

998
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:22,655
And you want to be the smartest person in the room who always wins every argument

999
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,703
Then what you do is you seek out

1000
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,799
The most likely like the most credible

1001
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,591
Magical thing that you can think of

1002
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,919
A magical thing that is so credible that it can get a lot of people

1003
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,199
Otherwise be like

1004
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,991
No of course it's not a miracle

1005
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:38,783
I have no idea

1006
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:45,183
Okay

1007
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,999
What's the most credible thing

1008
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,791
Shroud of Turin or whatever

1009
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,815
Who cares

1010
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:54,655
Hieroglyphics magic or whatever whatever it is you want it's got to be ancient

1011
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,423
Right

1012
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
So

1013
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,775
Then you can get into arguments with other people who already believe Magic

1014
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,823
And be the smartest guy in the room

1015
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:06,687
And since you've got these concrete examples that to you prove magic is real

1016
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,247
You can work back out again

1017
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,831
Because if magic is real on this most credible example

1018
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
The now I can

1019
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,135
Can point you to that that

1020
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,439
Miracle that is obviously bulshit

1021
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:22,559
More likely to believe it because you already got like

1022
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,095
That is what's going on here

1023
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:29,215
Fun so he hits you with so much that eventually your you're

1024
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:34,591
Ability to fight Baxter Road it right exactly

1025
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,639
So he keeps going though

1026
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,431
Now we speaking of that

1027
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,479
Do you feel that the ancient

1028
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
Egyptian

1029
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
The

1030
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
Let's go

1031
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,807
For somebody

1032
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,831
That the modern

1033
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
Theros

1034
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,903
That we've uncovered

1035
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,463
They've done an incredible job

1036
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,999
Preserving their bodies but

1037
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,791
It seems to me like they were mimicking

1038
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:56,095
Something even before that maybe a scientific

1039
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,167
Turned into a a magical ritual

1040
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,191
Versus

1041
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,727
Your magic and science

1042
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,775
Same thing but real magic worse

1043
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,823
Where is there's the this way do match

1044
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,639
Give you that good feeling oh yeah ha that's amazing

1045
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,455
But it doesn't affect so I'm just wondering if

1046
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,991
You think that the

1047
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:15,295
There was a original race or race of beings

1048
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,855
What are not from here somewhere else

1049
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,135
But we're here on this planet

1050
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,415
Time in China

1051
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:26,303
That were using their bodies and then preserving it in a way that they could like go into the

1052
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,607
Different dimension

1053
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:31,423
Like when we pass and then bring that knowledge back or I mean

1054
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,703
What do you think the purpose

1055
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,495
Go to timer

1056
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,335
Super Justin Quest

1057
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,919
It's

1058
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,479
My favorite my favorite part

1059
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,759
And you heard

1060
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:49,343
Give a little swear of that time and space

1061
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,367
He does a little

1062
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:56,255
Time and space movement course like he's waving his hands and I like going to sell it

1063
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,815
Very very fun I don't know what to think about

1064
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
The question

1065
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,423
I don't know if I care

1066
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,751
Magic and science can be the same thing

1067
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,799
No

1068
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:15,199
Well you are you know why cuz that ritual involves putting apartment up to the temples of your head

1069
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,135
You have to test the hypothesis

1070
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:29,535
I think a lot of people have not invincible so maybe those are

1071
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,119
Test cases will be the control group on this one

1072
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:38,495
I won't do the spell it right if I'm invincible so far so good

1073
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,775
Okay so

1074
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,799
With this next clip

1075
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:47,455
He is going to explain a little bit of like how summoning spirits and all that works

1076
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:51,807
And our host is going to really enjoy the snowblower

1077
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,623
But it's also not it's also

1078
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
Like the oldest

1079
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
First thing we've ever done

1080
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
100.

1081
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,511
Are appointed

1082
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:01,791
2

1083
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,071
Not have two men

1084
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
Ringing of the spirit

1085
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,119
But to be the thing that

1086
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,143
Spirits to doodle

1087
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,447
Amber Ruffin

1088
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,263
Yeah absolutely that's

1089
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
Did you just

1090
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,335
Maybe I had some sinks their soulmate

1091
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,151
And some some mind expansion

1092
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,431
That was wonderful thank you

1093
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:24,831
What does it mean

1094
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,599
People

1095
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,927
And they are often times referred to as the igigi

1096
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,743
You didn't tell me that earlier they brought up the verb

1097
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,327
They really hadn't brought up the bird people maybe was all fair

1098
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,399
It was more of like I mean

1099
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:45,823
They didn't bring up the bird people in that conversation where we saw the Pharaoh getting a b****** in the coffinger

1100
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,615
He then says

1101
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:52,735
And we've also seen these hieroglyphics that are like bird people so I mean Beyond him saying

1102
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,015
There's a picture of a bird

1103
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:59,903
There's also the the Ruto right Zelda

1104
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,743
Garuda from Final Fantasy

1105
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,791
Yeah there's a bird people

1106
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:11,679
Where can I get we're going to talk more about birds in The Matrix

1107
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,775
He's trying to say

1108
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,543
Is

1109
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:22,687
There, I'm pretty sure that he's trying to talk about four-dimensional space know how if you got a plan it it's a sink

1110
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
It's a gravel

1111
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,527
So he's trying to do that for reality

1112
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,855
We got sunk down into reality man

1113
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,647
Is more powerful

1114
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,439
Until you sorta out of the

1115
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,231
Conversation for a second guess

1116
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,559
He does that a lot

1117
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,327
Yikes

1118
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,863
So Gordon's Roland

1119
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,399
Gordon's getting into it

1120
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,167
Okay

1121
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,471
Why am I listening to anthropologist

1122
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,751
To strawberries to know this

1123
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,287
If they don't know it and I do

1124
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,055
Anyway

1125
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,687
Like you said maybe it's it's like behind the scenes people finding it

1126
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,967
What happened

1127
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,271
This this so little money and

1128
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
So much comfort

1129
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,855
If you don't

1130
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
Find

1131
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
The proverbial

1132
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,695
Your career is over

1133
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,279
So he's talking about how in Indonesia

1134
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,071
They found

1135
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,607
Hieroglyphics

1136
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:17,471
That day that he thinks are older than they're the oldest ones that people say

1137
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
Publicly

1138
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,543
And then there is also

1139
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,591
Hieroglyphics in Australia

1140
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,639
That might be even older

1141
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:31,039
Oh my so he thinks that people are stupid for not knowing that these are Australian hieroglyphics

1142
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,319
Might be a little bit older

1143
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,599
Okay and

1144
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,951
He goes on to be like see the problem with journalism right

1145
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:44,351
Is that you always have to find the most something you always have to make it so big and everything no self-aware

1146
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:47,423
Fairness in terms of reading this f****** book

1147
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:51,775
Write how everything is the most powerful shityoucan Do-Right

1148
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,823
Uw's is trying to get Medline

1149
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:00,223
Exactly he's chasing the very thing that he thinks it is and in order to get published

1150
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:06,623
Slimeatory I mean it sounded like he was complaining about like archaeology

1151
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,951
Don't find the sunken city then you don't have a job

1152
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,231
I would say to him

1153
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:14,815
That is not true

1154
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:18,655
There are all sorts of archaeology departments

1155
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,959
Around the world

1156
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:30,687
We better pumpkin pie going to close down

1157
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:38,367
The dean is up my ass we haven't found this f****** sunken city yet I agree that finding the Second City whatever

1158
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:41,183
To be a big fight

1159
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,719
Right

1160
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,511
Noah

1161
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:49,631
Looks like it's find Atlantis or else their funding dries up except maybe in some kind of like

1162
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,679
I don't know if it's

1163
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:58,335
A quest being done by magicians privately-funded

1164
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:01,919
Progressive the next level sure absolutely

1165
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,479
And he continues he's got more complaints

1166
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,271
About mainstream

1167
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,295
Stuff you know

1168
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,855
It doesn't matter what you find

1169
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,623
And it has to be like

1170
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,159
Sing in the world

1171
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,951
And then you if you read the extra

1172
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,719
Text of it

1173
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,023
Still correct

1174
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:17,791
Where they do tax

1175
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:19,583
Spider monkey

1176
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,143
Just s***

1177
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,167
Science journalism

1178
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,215
No one no one

1179
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,495
Less than

1180
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,151
I understand science

1181
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,735
You don't understand it less than a chaos magician though

1182
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:40,319
I mean magician probably but

1183
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:44,415
I'm driving I guess if his argument is that like

1184
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,719
Headlines are sensationalized

1185
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,487
Sure

1186
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,535
I agree

1187
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,095
It's it's so fun

1188
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,375
How mundane it is

1189
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,399
He's like

1190
01:00:54,655 --> 01:01:00,543
Oh man I'm so powerful I'm such a powerful position I can become invincible

1191
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,639
Invincibility

1192
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,687
What's wrong with it well nothing actually

1193
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:12,831
The implication is that anybody who knows these ways to become invincible must have

1194
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,159
Taking the time to get invincible well you would think

1195
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,183
Yeah but

1196
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,511
If you know the invincibility spell

1197
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,791
I should be free to attack

1198
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,327
You think

1199
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,399
Now here's the problem

1200
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:29,215
Okay what if I don't want to mess with magic

1201
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,031
Alright we're talking about demons

1202
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,079
Demons spirits

1203
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,359
God

1204
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:40,479
Which is what I like I like his angle on so much of this

1205
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,759
This dude is

1206
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:48,159
Like again everything is real so he believes in God he believes in he believes in gyms for sure

1207
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:52,511
Of course you know he doesn't have this like all you need to worship God or like it's more like

1208
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,559
Little buddy of mine

1209
01:01:54,815 --> 01:02:00,191
If I call him he'll help me get my car out of the snow like that's the kind of relationship

1210
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:03,775
You have with God in this scenario

1211
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,543
Similar

1212
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:09,919
You know what I mean yeah but also probably disrespectful

1213
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:15,295
He's like I've met gospel going to be onto

1214
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,831
And so

1215
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:22,463
He's proven that science journalists are full of s***

1216
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,511
Here he's going to prove some more stuff

1217
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,559
My bank

1218
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:28,863
Is that

1219
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
It looks at the

1220
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
This stuff

1221
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,447
And then for no

1222
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,239
Will fullback

1223
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
Materialistic

1224
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,591
So we have

1225
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,383
I'm good headed people go back to

1226
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,687
Seven-year-old male

1227
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,711
Hey bud headed

1228
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,527
We have Garuda

1229
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,551
So we have

1230
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,087
Hindu cosmology

1231
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,135
Eagle head

1232
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,487
And that's before we get the whole way over to the

1233
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,303
So

1234
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,583
And by the way this

1235
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
We actually have

1236
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:03,935
Marcos

1237
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,775
Down the southern code

1238
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,567
Brandon Easter is

1239
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,847
Hopping around in a cross

1240
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
With dealing with

1241
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,663
The same culture

1242
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
So that's the fish

1243
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:17,759
Are they

1244
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,343
Spices that sufficiently attractive be genetic

1245
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,647
Flow of the bird people

1246
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,719
Yeah so the problem

1247
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:31,071
With too many materialists right is that they fall back on falsifiable science

1248
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,863
Haha

1249
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:36,447
Exactly now you've got it

1250
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:42,847
That is our issue our problem with materialism is that you should be explaining it with magic or them

1251
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,663
Materialism that I have chosen

1252
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,247
Materialism

1253
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,039
Evidence

1254
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,343
It's nothing compared to

1255
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,183
I say some things and then I feel weird

1256
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,975
100%

1257
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,743
Let's

1258
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:02,559
Here we're going to hear about an old friend of ours

1259
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:05,119
Actually

1260
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,143
Oh wow

1261
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Butthead

1262
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,447
Beans Indian

1263
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:09,727
Spirit world

1264
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,567
Stop right there

1265
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:19,967
Imaginal

1266
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:25,855
Physical and imaginary imaginary cuz that makes it sound like they're not real

1267
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,671
Imaginary

1268
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,695
The whole thing kind

1269
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:30,975
Bulls in

1270
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,743
To play Sweet

1271
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
It's the classic

1272
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,607
Landspeeder

1273
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,375
Helicopter

1274
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,959
Because you could look at the anomaly

1275
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,007
And it definitely

1276
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
But if you

1277
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,567
Is lead only

1278
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:46,847
Materialistic

1279
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
You end up

1280
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,407
Zecharia sitchin

1281
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,431
Nuclear-powered Rucker

1282
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
Spirit world

1283
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
It is

1284
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
It is some kind

1285
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,695
And so if you see this bird headed

1286
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:02,975
Everywhere

1287
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,511
What I can tell you

1288
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,279
Tentatively

1289
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,559
That idea

1290
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,423
To get oldies

1291
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,471
One price

1292
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,495
That point

1293
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
Well

1294
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,311
What is it

1295
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:18,847
Does it need

1296
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,615
Tubi

1297
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
I didn't need to be a physical

1298
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Birdman

1299
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:23,967
Espirito Santo

1300
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,295
Drugs

1301
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,063
In dreams

1302
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,671
Who knows. I think it's better I think

1303
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,695
More

1304
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,719
That is better

1305
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
Satisfying way

1306
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
Taking

1307
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,119
The anomaly

1308
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,727
Be exciting and unusual things

1309
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
History of it most serious

1310
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
Without having

1311
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:50,847
Make statements for

1312
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
Seandainya

1313
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
Divisive

1314
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,503
Skeleton

1315
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,087
We still we know about

1316
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,927
We tackled but yeah like I said there's there's no public knowledge of

1317
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,695
Lovebird

1318
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,279
Skeletons so until there is

1319
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,351
We got to keep question we got to keep your tips

1320
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:17,215
So should be private knowledge of

1321
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:21,823
Bird skeleton

1322
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,847
Big butt listen

1323
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:27,967
We know we don't need to go around explaining things like zecharia sitchin with

1324
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,551
Boulder cars or bird skeleton beings or whatever

1325
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
And his response is like

1326
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,855
Not yet

1327
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:36,159
But if we keep looking I bet there are

1328
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:41,791
The criticism of zecharia sitchin Izzy's to materialist

1329
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,583
Bizarre notion

1330
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,607
Also

1331
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:51,007
Yeah if I were this guy that's exactly the route I would take

1332
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,287
Spirits or whatever

1333
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,847
Great loophole great cop out

1334
01:06:55,103 --> 01:07:00,991
Cuz I mean I guess like you could just say like okay so like all these cultures also have flood moti

1335
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:05,343
And stories they had everybody tripped balls and thought about floods

1336
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,879
You got it or whatever

1337
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,647
Great

1338
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:11,743
We can explain all of history and everything through folklore

1339
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:16,607
Yes 100% through two people got really high and saw stuff

1340
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:23,007
It is it is kind of a I find it very silly to me but to think that

1341
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,615
Bird-headed beings only go far in the imaginary sense

1342
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,687
Only go as far back is however a lot like

1343
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:37,087
40000 years the first time that a bird headed being was imagined was like the first few people

1344
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,367
Well that we're alive we're like

1345
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:42,719
Batman wouldn't be weird if you had a bird head like I was at like humans work

1346
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,767
Flashlight

1347
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,047
And I definitely found a way

1348
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,655
I think

1349
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:54,239
The bird headed people is kind of a pretty easy jump to make

1350
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,287
Cuz you thinking about like a birds

1351
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:59,103
Can fly blind be fun to fly

1352
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,407
If there's probably a person with a bird head

1353
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
Moving on

1354
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,967
It's not a far jump

1355
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,503
Uber database

1356
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:09,599
Especially if you're in early artist painting

1357
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,623
Okay

1358
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:15,743
So now let's get past all of our fun little openings because we're here to talk about the devil

1359
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,815
I forgot about the devil you're talking about the devil

1360
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,351
What is the devil

1361
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,887
Sprouts Babel

1362
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,191
Do you believe in the devil and if so

1363
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,983
Are there alot of them what is the

1364
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,799
So I mean this is

1365
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,615
A huge a like one

1366
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,919
As well as degree Marco sost

1367
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,711
Premium members

1368
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
Is botan 1H

1369
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,319
And I should give it to look at the beginning of this year

1370
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,999
The devil is

1371
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:48,767
A bunch of

1372
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,327
That was bunched up a bunch of stuff

1373
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,351
Great

1374
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,959
Kind of hurts of the definite articles the

1375
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:58,495
Being in front of it but

1376
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,775
Okay I'm listening

1377
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:04,639
Yeah I mean that's kind of where we're going and where we're coming from with every

1378
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,175
Anything that is

1379
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,479
Is probably a bunch of

1380
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,575
The operating principle is

1381
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,111
Short story long

1382
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:21,023
Also avoid being too specific specific

1383
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:27,423
The Devils also this and the devil's this specificity is for the materialist that's the problem with the material

1384
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,007
Century things so let's keep hitting we need to hear more about the devil what

1385
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775
Play the devil.

1386
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,543
Double

1387
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:36,127
Got to think of this hypothetical Portuguese

1388
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
His grandmother

1389
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,711
Tanjiro this

1390
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,479
Senor

1391
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,759
Daughter is getting married

1392
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
Affectless

1393
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,807
Sun if there blacks

1394
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,087
And you think

1395
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,111
You should marry the

1396
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,135
The traitor

1397
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,671
I have a much better life

1398
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:52,767
Semi-literate

1399
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,071
And by semi-literate

1400
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,935
The devil is the lord of the

1401
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,983
The devil is set

1402
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:02,751
By God

1403
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,287
Trulia

1404
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,567
And so

1405
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,591
Yes you want to

1406
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:07,615
To worship the Dead

1407
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
If your

1408
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,199
Like because the different leagues

And and he's literally go to the office

1410
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,319
Like the devil office Jesus

1411
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,343
The hobo

1412
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,903
I need his set by God

1413
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,671
To rule this

1414
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,487
That means if you have personally concerned

1415
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
You take them to

1416
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,607
I'm so on a Sunday you might go to Mass

1417
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,375
And then

1418
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,935
You might leave your family and puddle of Into the Woods

1419
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,495
Offering

1420
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,263
To the devil

1421
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:36,799

In milgram's

That's

1426
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,039
Very different options

1427
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,319
Huge drop-off

1428
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:52,671
Kill the guy or the zika virus be less interested

1429
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:57,535
There was a really worldly those two options

1430
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,607
Yeah I think it also there is something

1431
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:04,191
The Bible about God being a jealous God

1432
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,983
Dinner

1433
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:11,103

Google I don't ask me why

1437
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,719
But you do understand what the devil is

1438
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,487
Obviously

1439
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:33,631
Subway mid-level administrator for Earthly issues

1440
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,679
Write so well I mean maybe

1441
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,959
Oh no

1442
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
But you do have it

1443
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,543
Unholy Triumph

1444
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,591
Lucifer Beelzebub

1445
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:45,151
I need not necessarily

1446
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:45,919
Summon

1447
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
At all

1448
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,807
But those names

1449
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,111
Because they the Kings

1450
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,159
Those names of

1451
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,719
So you should have

1452
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,023
Spirits in the name

1453
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,607
Depends on the book

1454
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631
But they'll have gift

1455
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
They might be

1456
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:07,935
Categorized

1457
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
Into one of these three

1458
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,031
Brutus

1459
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:12,799
Is Lucifer is

1460
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:13,823
The king in spirit

1461
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,103
And so

1462
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,663
The idea of the devil is the

1463
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,431
The storehouse

1464
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,967
The devil you find more

1465
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:20,991
Invoke Magic

1466
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,527
But you find more loose

1467
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:24,831
The grimoire

1468
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,367
Even though no one in the greenhouses

1469
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,135
Is worshipping

1470
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
No one is

1471
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:42,239
So you got all the different names for the devil are all different things Lucifer belzebub

1472
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:48,383
Same Old Scratch has different guy has different people for you

1473
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,943
So if you if you get this correctly

1474
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:56,575
Right I don't know if I get this correctly it's like that for me

1475
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:02,463
Warner also I'm going to call Beelzebub, now you're not actually going

1476
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,791
Sure you don't got to sit for Beelzebub

1477
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:12,191
But I will call Zelo Toth

1478
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:18,591
Because he's the one who has enough power to call the Lesser Spirits so you're sort of needs to sign off on it

1479
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:24,991
911 dispatch hello baal-zebub here

1480
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:29,855
If you send a spirit over please

1481
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
And also

1482
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,671
One thing

1483
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,951
It also a bunch of others

1484
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,559
Okay I'll really any of those and you can't even call him

1485
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,839
You can't call him

1486
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,119
You could but he woke up

1487
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:45,215
So you clearly understand the devil now right

1488
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:51,615
I guess just make up anything and that's probably with explanation

1489
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,407
Him because he knows more than you

1490
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,431
The devil

1491
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,455
Oh no

1492
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:59,551
Gordon but he is the devil

1493
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,831
So this is

1494
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,855
This is just

1495
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:06,207
This is where it gets really really good and things start to go absolutely Wild

1496
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
If you look at the

1497
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,583
About a third of

1498
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,607
Of Souls

1499
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,655
Particularly now and I actually say the numbers

1500
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,215
About a third of spirit

1501
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Hang around

1502
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,895
Seems like about a third of the

1503
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,943
And I would argue and

1504
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,711
Just a guess

1505
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,015
But that number is

1506
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
Increasing

1507
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,063
We are

1508
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,087
We die and such

1509
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,623
Secular Way We Were

1510
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Sure

1511
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:39,999
Sure

1512
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:42,303
So for so much of this entire interview

1513
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:45,631
He has been basing all of this stuff on historical books

1514
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,399
Right

1515
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:49,983
Magic books everything that is is fake

1516
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
You know

1517
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,311
And then all the sudden he's just like you know what

1518
01:14:54,335 --> 01:15:00,479
Scientifically speaking after we've done a study from Johns Hopkins

1519
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,783
A third of spirits

1520
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:09,183
Start making it anymore

1521
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:09,951
Hot take

1522
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:16,351
I think that numbers going up buddy probably a terrifying increase in overall so

1523
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,631
Sticking around

1524
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
And that's a problem

1525
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:23,519
Well it's going to be a problem for ghost housing that goes housing prices

1526
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,799
2008 all over

1527
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,335
I know it can be brutal

1528
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,359
Right

1529
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,151
Ghosts will be able to

1530
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,527
Very susceptible to nft

1531
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:38,367
That's going to be a problem,

1532
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:42,463
Oh and they have unlimited money because it's not tied to anything physical anymore

1533
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,255
True

1534
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,607
And now they all they want to do is

1535
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,655
Catch Pac-Man

1536
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,191
Swell

1537
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,471
For a while

1538
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,263
Sometimes they really don't want to

1539
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,055
That's true every

1540
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:00,383
Alright so now

1541
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,407
Beach at

1542
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,687
Has gotten involved

1543
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:07,295
And we are going to see a little bit of how the host is reacting to them

1544
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,343
So kind of crazy

1545
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,135
I find that

1546
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:11,903
Historically

1547
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,487
Me too

1548
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,791
And I also just wanted to make a

1549
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,071
Comment real quick because

1550
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:22,655
Ninety-nine percent of what I'm reading in the wife chat here is awesome

1551
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,471
And there's always somebody that may be ignorant

1552
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,287
And when I use the term ignorant that just means on inform

1553
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,847
There's there's one person that's the

1554
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,639
Having a real hard time

1555
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:36,735
With I guess me personally they they seem to think that I'm a

1556
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,783
A black magician

1557
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,599
So

1558
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,159
What is a time it must be the blue blockers

1559
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:47,743
15 Jesuit

1560
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,791
That's both

1561
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:53,375
Yeah yeah because I don't believe that the Earth is shaped the way they tell me and you

1562
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:56,703
Needs to be so it's okay I get it I understand

1563
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,727
Are internet

1564
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,543
Everything's real on the internet forum

1565
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:07,199
Jesus it's so much of theirs

1566
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,759
Yeah

1567
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,039
He does not explain

1568
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
Which

1569
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,087
Shape he thinks the Earth is

1570
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:19,231
Okay I don't know

1571
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:24,351
Yeah I think that there is a strategic thing that sometimes people have knees

1572
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,911
Turtle veins do that that is the

1573
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:33,311
Responding to criticism that is like you're a black magician because that keeps the criticism even within the word

1574
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,615
World that they live in

1575
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:42,015
The criticism of this is a bunch of nonsense I'm glad for you if this

1576
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,575
Does something empowering for your life

1577
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,135
But you might be over selling something

1578
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,439
I think that criticism probably

1579
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:52,255
Much less likely to respond to Where is the

1580
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,303
I'm a black magician is just like

1581
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,607
That's in game credits

1582
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,143
And II

1583
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:02,751
I think that's kind of fun I mean do you think he's a black magician what do you mean

1584
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:09,151
Alright well what's the distinction let's find out what a whether or not he's a black magician

1585
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:13,503
So so anyway no I don't practice black magic

1586
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,039
And I don't really have time

1587
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:19,135
I'm doing LeapFrog Jake is at Blackmagic kind of freaks me out because

1588
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,183
If there is a cause and effect

1589
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,975
If there is a cause effect

1590
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,791
If your doing dark things dark things Mike

1591
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
Back to you

1592
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,119
I mean it's science

1593
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:33,983
There was one time that I got on eBay

1594
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,055
Back in 2008 I got a hundred bucks I was so excited

1595
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:37,823
Does a 1930

1596
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,615
When I do

1597
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,895
I immediately knew

1598
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,175
Something was up man

1599
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,991
Real dark energy and I had it for

1600
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,015
A couple of mine

1601
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:50,367
And I remember the whole time I had it the energy in the house

1602
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,671
Stephen Moore.

1603
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,975
Northwest

1604
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,279
We found out after we sign the lease

1605
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,583
That the five previous people

1606
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:03,423
Or the five previous couples that live there before us inductive or Steam

1607
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:08,543
The neighbors that live there for 4.

1608
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,127
I got this book

1609
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,919
And I can just

1610
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:14,943
No Mana

1611
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,247
I don't know people are doing something negative with it

1612
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,527
Before what

1613
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,807
Like I could

1614
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:20,831
Send

1615
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,623
Dark Energy I was thinking

1616
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,671
Bad thing just

1617
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:28,767
1815 Campo

1618
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,535
That gives a

1619
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:30,559
90s

1620
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,327
Something is

1621
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,607
What's up man to admit

1622
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,399
The shore like

1623
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,191
II

1624
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,727
I think that is a valid

1625
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,751
Unlikely

1626
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,287
Experience

1627
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,079
Sure

1628
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,383
Don't mess with those books absolutely not

1629
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,175
Screw someone up later

1630
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:49,247
Five previous couples got divorced

1631
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:53,855
That probably has something to do with it I'm salute right

1632
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,391
And then we got the book

1633
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:59,999
That 90 years to be messed with any power

1634
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:04,351
Dark Forces that I think it's probably likely that he's correct

1635
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:07,423
Yeah I think there's no way around it

1636
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,959
It's the only conclusion I mean

1637
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,263
If there is a cause and effect

1638
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,799
Obviously

1639
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:17,408
Do you do evil things

1640
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:22,784
I would be a black magician but I'm too busy with leak project I just don't have the time

1641
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,320
Boots

1642
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,112
I think there's also something

1643
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:26,880
Quaint

1644
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:31,488
Tough to deal with about the idea that if You Can Do Magic

1645
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,840
It's accessible for $100 on eBay

1646
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,400
Ivory everything about this

1647
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,424
I love that

1648
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:43,008
And and here is your so important this is 22 Rex

1649
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
Okay

1650
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:48,896
This is the only time he interrupts in the entire hour and 10 minute long interview

1651
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:54,528
And it's to continue this f****** story cuz it's not done yet

1652
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,368
Real quick I just got to say so I get it away right

1653
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,648
The day that I gave it away

1654
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,696
My wife had no idea I had this book

1655
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:03,232
The day I give it away

1656
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,000
She goes

1657
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,280
She comes in the house this year

1658
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,584
It feels lighter in here

1659
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,864
You noticed

1660
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:11,168
Oh yeah by the way

1661
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:16,032
Cookbook I bought and now we didn't have it yeah

1662
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:23,456
Coincidentally she also bought new blinds that day and we had our Windows boss

1663
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:29,856
Track lighting

1664
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,648
The reason you feel better

1665
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:35,232
This hundred-year-old book I bought on eBay I got rid of it

1666
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,768
Sumrall MS

1667
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:43,680
Oh you got a promotion is probably not important I have a great lunch

1668
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:50,080
I have a part of my friend it was a delightful time I'm feeling a light on my feet

1669
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,640
Yikes he's not a black magician

1670
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:59,296
Important really know what that means except for it someone who does Black Magic but now I don't know what black magic means

1671
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:02,624
That's interesting because Gordon's going to explain a little bit how it works

1672
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,184
Nothing gets you off the hook

1673
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:05,952
To be tomorrow

1674
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,720
Does that make sense

1675
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,256
You can pray for someone

1676
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:13,120
And in the same thing this is easier benign or even

1677
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:14,912
They are not

1678
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
They are spirits

1679
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,472
Deeply ambivalent

1680
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:22,336
It's not I'm not saying hey everyone it's fine and it's

1681
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,640
It's not that at all

1682
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:27,200
But it doesn't necessarily make you evil

1683
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:27,968
I want to do it

1684
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,504
You could be evil

1685
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,576
It is evil to pray the gay away

1686
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,856
Like that's literally eat

1687
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:34,880
So you

1688
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:35,904
Not get

1689
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,208
Nothing

1690
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,232
Lets you off the hook

1691
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,256
For being immoral

1692
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,072
What

1693
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:48,704
I mean I'm glad that he doesn't believe in Prague the gay away

1694
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,496
I'm happy for that

1695
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:53,056
But I don't understand the distinction between

1696
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:56,640
It not being necessarily evil to pray for someone's death

1697
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,176
It's just not recommended

1698
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:05,344
I don't know I don't get it I don't get I don't get the distinctions I also there's a bigger question that I have

1699
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,672
To be like alright magic can make you invincible

1700
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:15,840
But it's not able to UK there's no magic spell you can do to reverse cause and effect

1701
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:19,424
It seems like that's bizarre well I mean you can

1702
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,704
Also let me

1703
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,776
But you can break all the rules of reality but the that way

1704
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,592
Let me disagree with that premise internally

1705
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,640
If you're Invincible you have

1706
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:35,040
Broken cause and effect

1707
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:41,440
Believe

1708
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:46,816
No that's that's a contradiction of classical

1709
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,608
Tell me the physics of it

1710
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,376
Defisit cousin

1711
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,680
Probably get rid of

1712
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,728
Except when we.

1713
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:56,288
Okay sometimes it's we do but sometimes we do

1714
01:23:56,544 --> 01:24:00,896
And when I say is when we do right and what I say is what we do we do at science

1715
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:07,296
That's how it works in his velocity it doesn't come off very because he's like

1716
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,320
It's okay to pray

1717
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:10,624
For somebody's death well it's not advised

1718
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,672
I mean what are you trying to say

1719
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,440
Is that

1720
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:17,024
A black magician is not somebody who practices

1721
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,048
Black magic

1722
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,328
It is that

1723
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,120
Magic is a tool

1724
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:23,680
And you are a person who is using that tool

1725
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,728
Aloha so if you do bad things

1726
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,776
It's not the magic that did it

1727
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:32,384
You know you just talked to some Spirit or very ambivalent about how they treat people

1728
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,920
Boxer on the planet

1729
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,200
So you can't

1730
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:41,600
You can't be like nah nah it's cool I'm a magician you have to you still have to be a moral person

1731
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:45,184
That's his that's his idea of magic there

1732
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:50,048
There's sort of an ambivalent morality to praying for someone's death

1733
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,840
Yeah but not for praying away the gay

1734
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,144
Fine

1735
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,936
There's I feel like

1736
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,472
Specific

1737
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:03,872
I feel like there's a cause and effects and it the causes listening to this and the effect was me hitting my head on the wall

1738
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:08,992
The chat has some agreement with you here

1739
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:11,296
Is what I named this clip Ono

1740
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,344
And yet

1741
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,112
If they died

1742
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:16,928
Surely that's what it was

1743
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,744
It doesn't necessarily follow.

1744
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,168
Thank you or

1745
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,448
It doesn't mean you're losing your

1746
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,776
So either

1747
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,568
Doing a dream and that's it red

1748
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,848
That's it

1749
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:41,248
How dare you say I didn't bandyrowe somebody else time do you out I wasn't even me I don't care

1750
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,528
Kummerspeck

1751
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,088
Whatever you want

1752
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,368
Exact

1753
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,904
Play The Devil can enter your dreams

1754
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:48,928
Rather you doing

1755
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Great

1756
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:56,352
Turbo now never sleeping again

1757
01:25:56,608 --> 01:26:02,752
Strike Back

1758
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:09,152
You kept getting little little notes for people who likes are you a black magician and he's he's sensitive

1759
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:12,480
It's not something that he realizes I think was people

1760
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:17,600
Yeah okay cuz it was like a little bit of a

1761
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,880
It was a little like

1762
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:25,280
Meme they happened in the chat for a little while the fact that he

1763
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:30,656
He's a little overreacting a little bit

1764
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:34,496
Now we're finally getting to something that Rex needs purse

1765
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,800
Ghost Yubel mobile you got it

1766
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,640
The Vanishing go

1767
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,944
Sumerian method of banishing ghost

1768
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,480
I need to know this one

1769
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,296
One of the things I

1770
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,064
I kind of delight

1771
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,832
In doing an

1772
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:49,600
How you find this in

1773
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,136
A couple books

1774
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:58,816
I just really like the idea

1775
01:26:59,328 --> 01:26:59,840
Of looking at

1776
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:00,864
Kind of like that

1777
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,144
The dead butt

1778
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,912
Bet Sistas

1779
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,984
For the most part they are spells for Deadpool

1780
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:07,264
Use that. As in

1781
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,824
Where's disability from Sumerian one

1782
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,104
The pier to do

1783
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,128
Ap2 used

1784
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,152
I've confused

1785
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:13,920
Big dogs

1786
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
Demons

1787
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,480
Might scare the Dead

1788
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:17,760
And I just

1789
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:18,528
Love playing with

1790
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,064
But like getting rid of

1791
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:20,832
What

1792
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,368
Getting rid of

1793
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,392
Negative

1794
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,440
We're getting rid of

1795
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:26,720
Icky

1796
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:27,744
Spirit prison

1797
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:33,376
They never get enough

1798
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:37,472
I have listened to that one I play that on repeat for a while just like

1799
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,776
Negative energy is such a dumb word

1800
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:42,336
And you're like there's no way that you can

1801
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,128
Go to Iggy Spirit price

1802
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:44,896
Who's in the house

1803
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:50,016
And be like well clearly I've nailed it I've been proved on negative energy

1804
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:53,344
So they can fuse large dogs with spirit

1805
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,392
Does that mean the spell is like sit

1806
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,440
A little bit

1807
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,232
And also I

1808
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:03,328
She doesn't explain it but he does say I really like playing with

1809
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,656
Call Keys

1810
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:09,472
I think he thinks or I think he's insinuating

1811
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:12,544
Then he is summoned to the spirits of these dogs

1812
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,336
And place with them regularly

1813
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,104
Great

1814
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,408
That is what I think is he is one of your

1815
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:20,992
You say it sounds whimsical

1816
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:26,112
If you're doing magic to imagine that you're playing with dogs that aren't there

1817
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,392
I mean

1818
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:29,696
Seems harmless

1819
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:36,352
Well let's let's take a look at that Sumerian spell I just want to make sure that you

1820
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:38,144
You get it correctly

1821
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:43,264
So I eat it is not Sumerian as far as I can see from the chaos product

1822
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,336
This it is

1823
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:47,872
Greek magical papyri

1824
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,176
So

1825
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,712
It goes something a little bit like

1826
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,528
Hale hermanubis

1827
01:28:54,784 --> 01:29:00,160
Tumi Ojai 10 Mighty 1090 Stir of Secrets for those in the Underworld

1828
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:03,488
Affair of those in a mentillo chief physician

1829
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,792
Thought of Osiris whose face is strong

1830
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:06,816
Among the gods

1831
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,608
You should appear in the Underworld

1832
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,400
Before the hand of Osiris

1833
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:16,544
You should serve The Souls of a beat us in order that they lived through you these Souls the one secrets of the underworld

1834
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,336
You are Anubis

1835
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,360
You are herpes

1836
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:22,432
You are the one who went forth from the heart of the Great agathodaemon

1837
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,480
The father of the father of all the gods

1838
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:28,320
Come to the mouth of my vessel in dwell in this forum dedicated to

1839
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,368
And receive my offering and praise

1840
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:31,904
Sister Wives

1841
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,952
The sayings of whose mouth shall come to

1842
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:39,584
Did you notice that it's quieter in here it is a lot quieter in here

1843
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:45,216
That voice that's always saying you suck

1844
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:50,080
Spirit presences

1845
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:56,480
This show isn't about lifted from us

1846
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,784
We had to suddenly stop

1847
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:05,184
Okay we have cleared out the ghost presents

1848
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,976
I've been

1849
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:09,792
Powerful enough to help Rex from a distance is what

1850
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:13,632
Adolescents should be taken care of he can just play this

1851
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:17,728
Personally I don't know it if I were to believe in ghosts which I'm

1852
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,288
Much like the spirit realm I'm a

1853
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,152
I don't know if I'd want them to leave really

1854
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,784
You know like if there are ghosts in there is a way of communicating with them

1855
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,320
Just want to talk to him

1856
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:33,856
Be the friend

1857
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,880
I mean

1858
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:35,904
I think

1859
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:36,928
Be

1860
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:37,952
Problem there

1861
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:38,976
Is

1862
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:44,096
Once you become the person who talks to ghosts friendly like all the ghosts are going to come to you

1863
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,376
ABC the show ghost

1864
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:46,656
Seems fun

1865
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:53,312
Have you seen the Sixth Sense doesn't sound fun at all, just say that I've only seen the commercial for the show Joseph

1866
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,848
Looks fun

1867
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:55,872
But I do.

1868
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:59,712
Well play on Survivor

1869
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:02,272
No Giver see that one Michael j.fox

1870
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,064
Man he fights ghost

1871
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:09,952
I want to fight a ghost he's divorcing Thirteen Ghosts

1872
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,976
I don't know if it was

1873
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:14,816
No wasn't alright dude well we've gotten to the end

1874
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:17,632
We've got our Sumerian spell let's bring it home

1875
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,168
Alright we're going to close the show

1876
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,192
Practical Magic

1877
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,984
The people can use every single day

1878
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:24,288
Yes and in this case for wealth

1879
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,896
Tyco's and wealth

1880
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,688
Tell me about Midtown

1881
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,016
Sign me up

1882
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:40,928
Right on board and thank you so much again I really appreciate it check it out ladies and gentlemen

1883
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:42,720
Be excellent to each other

1884
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:45,792
Hit the Bell you need hit that Bell to get access to the wifey

1885
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:46,816
And be the change

1886
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:52,448
To Wayne's World references in 30 seconds

1887
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:57,568
Ashwin be excellent to each other is impressive

1888
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,336
There it is

1889
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:04,736
That is how we bring it all also Practical Magic was a Sandra Bullock movie from the late night

1890
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:10,368
Yeah but he's he's giving you wealth magic okay that's what you looking for

1891
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:14,464
You are looking for I mean and and his book is absolutely nuts

1892
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,232
You know like

1893
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:21,632
73 quarter to the bottom of your shoe and walk around 46 miles

1894
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:24,960
But also here's the problem with Alan Greenspan

1895
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:28,032
He talks about Alan Greenspan in this in the chaos protocol

1896
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:30,848
Cuz you know it's that kind of s***

1897
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,664
We now know what the devil is

1898
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,016
Which is everything disagree I don't know what the devil we now know how to get rid of spirits

1899
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,296
I guess we did it

1900
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:41,344
Is there anything else you learn today

1901
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,880
I don't know

1902
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:46,976
Looking overwhelmed I feel like you don't believe in magic anymore

1903
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,256
Anymore

1904
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:52,352
No I mean like my position on a lot of his stuff is

1905
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:55,168
Like I don't need to be too cruel if people do believe

1906
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,704
Even some stuff that

1907
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,752
It helps them in their life and I think that

1908
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,056
There is there is an element of

1909
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:07,456
Benign or rationality that I think can be fine and maybe even positive in people's lives

1910
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:09,504
I resent some

1911
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,552
Of this stuff

1912
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,856
Also though

1913
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:16,928
And I find I don't know

1914
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:19,744
Especially when you're

1915
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:28,192
Maligning other people in scientific theories

1916
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,472
Sing a turtle

1917
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:33,824
A clearly is a subscription platform you saying his premium members

1918
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:40,224
And he's offering classes on wealth magic yep you know these kinds of things I find distasteful in many of the sea

1919
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,528
Same ways that are our right-wing scam

1920
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:48,416
Folk are distinguished from people who like maybe have some kind of

1921
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:54,304
Ritual thing that they like to do it somehow makes them feel better God bless you for it

1922
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:59,680
I don't think that's the same thing as with these Network clearly engaged in this like

1923
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,472
I mean it's a scam

1924
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:02,752
Magic isn't real

1925
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,592
And you're not going to get Wealthy by by taking his

1926
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:12,224
Magic course it'll be a coincidence

1927
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,016
More is is like a

1928
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:19,648
You know I'm not going to go to glitterbug church but I still want that

1929
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:24,256
I still want somebody to tell me that if I'm a good person I'll get rich

1930
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,816
Haha

1931
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,840
It does

1932
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:28,608
Kind of

1933
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:36,032
I don't know it seems like an incentive to be a good person

1934
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:39,104
Go to Joel Osteen or you can go to this guy it's the same basic

1935
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:42,176
Glitterbug Church

1936
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:43,456
Stop

1937
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:46,528
Falls into fairly similar category

1938
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,880
Christianity or religion in general is not in and of itself

1939
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:57,280
The bad thing or -8 is the other behaviors that are coming along with it right that make it

1940
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:03,424
Regularly distasteful aliens

1941
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:08,800
Whatever as long as you're not coming from a place as long as you're not

1942
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:09,568
Like

1943
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:14,944
Actively hurting people and even then even the most desired

1944
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,016
Like all I'm so mad and I'm a chaos magician I'm going to

1945
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,296
Can pray for your

1946
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,600
And then you'll get it

1947
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,136
You know it's like you're not actually

1948
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:27,744
Hurt him I'm sorry I'm sorry for you as a

1949
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,048
Person it seems like a good way to wallow in some

1950
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:32,096
Feelings that aren't going to help you

1951
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:35,168
Maybe there's better use of your time

1952
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:37,984
Another thing that I find that I resent a little bit about this

1953
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,520
But you've presented to me

1954
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,312
But it's not your fault but like

1955
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,872
I've got nothing to hold onto

1956
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:49,504
Like there is no real specificity of you even read one of these spells and I own

1957
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,064
It just seemed like it was a

1958
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,392
Name of Egyptian deity list you got it

1959
01:35:55,648 --> 01:36:01,792
Yep I don't know what black magic is I don't know what the devil is I don't know what why

1960
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,840
Why he needs ghost out of his out

1961
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
Out of your

1962
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:06,912
I don't know any of these things

1963
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:13,312
I don't have more questions and when we started cuz I don't care

1964
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:19,712
Oh no I kind of resent that a little bit some interesting things along the way

1965
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,248
I can't get enough of

1966
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:24,064
That guy's just

1967
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:27,904
He's having such a great time Matrix sink

1968
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,208
That guy has more fun than that idea

1969
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,488
Probably

1970
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,512
So

1971
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,792
Idolize

1972
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:37,120
I mean it was nice to not have to deal with

1973
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,144
People who are like

1974
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,728
People should be lit on fire all the time like it's nice

1975
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,496
Sure

1976
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:45,824
Nice fat is that is a pleasant little break

1977
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:52,992
That was fun nobody has any goes

1978
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:57,600
No more episodes

1979
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,904
So that's that's that's great

1980
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:06,048
I will be back to talk about Alex on Monday through a bit of this

1981
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:13,216
A bulshit we are also

1982
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:18,080
On Twitter that's right and act

1983
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:18,848
Correct

1984
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:25,248
But till then I Mio I'm Leo and bcx Clark I'd like to wish you all a Happy dream

1985
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,016
Creamy creamy summer

1986
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:29,600
Dreamy creamy

1987
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,624
The sex robot

1988
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,928
Holding

1989
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:38,560
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
