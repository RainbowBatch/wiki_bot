1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge babe I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,488
Acknowledge

6
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,560
The Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

7
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,144
We already a question for you

8
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,472
My break is that I have been

9
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,104
It all taken care of and I'm okay

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,152
That's indeed at this point

11
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,944
I was an interesting weekend

12
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
Actually I got my date wrong

13
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,624
And I ended up getting the vaccine on Saturday

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,952
I had heard from some people

15
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,976
Some friends who've gotten

16
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
Coshocton

17
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,072
They've told me about like the next day

18
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632
Pretty bad or like I had a little bit of

19
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
Some effect

20
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,496
Kind enough to drive me to get

21
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
The vaccine in that I went

22
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
And immediately I was

23
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Very cocky

24
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
I wish I was very much I want to be part of the team

25
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,088
I appreciate it very much

26
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,488
What's the the hubris of communal experience

27
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
Of the side effects

28
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
Yeah it's evening

29
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
The return of

30
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
Consider WrestleMania

31
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
And there was this weird resonance but

32
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
Between

33
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
I got vaccinated

34
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,920
On the same day as wrestlemanias heaven

35
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:30,784
Crowds return a swell of emotion of like Norm

36
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
Normalcy

37
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,904
You can repeat the her I head over

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,208
Chicken

39
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,512
30

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
He got hit by

41
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
A train of a fever

42
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Locomotive

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
And so I had a little bit of

44
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Fever

45
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,800
Through the end of Saturday night Wrestlemania

46
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
And I went straight to bed

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,664
Sunday relief

48
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,528
Real stupid

49
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
The communal experience

50
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
Side effects Daniel

51
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,464
Vaccinated I felt really stupid cuz I was like looking at my text

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,816
Do you realize like there's no side effects

53
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,656
Is there anybody in the Superman

54
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:25,056
Valeri like resentment towards you I was just sitting there going to like all I've heard some people don't have side effects

55
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
Will be one of the ones

56
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
Something something

57
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,504
Going to happen too bad to like it wasn't even like a really bad fever I'm just

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Kind of week

59
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
Very soft

60
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
A little bit of a fever and I was just like

61
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
Heidi Citgo

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
I need to put on a little hat a little bedtime hat and goes yeah yeah yeah

63
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,984
Feel like I should do this a little review of Wrestlemania

64
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
Cebu

65
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,360
That was a very little review

66
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Wow

67
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Real bad

68
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,016
How did the conversation about the Bray Wyatt

69
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,904
Did they do what we did they would do a movie like that

70
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,952
We don't go inside of it

71
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
What happened

72
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,047
Listeners who don't watch wrestling

73
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
Bray Wyatt

74
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,143
Was a guy who's a swamp hillbilly called later

75
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
It was a lot of fun

76
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
Unofficial

77
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:31,359
Mascot of this podcast

78
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
Yasuke used

79
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,831
Be a swamp hillbilly called later and I was a lot of fun.

80
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
You gave rambling sermons

81
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,207
And then he went away and he came back

82
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,791
Is a children's TV show host

83
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
Show at the Firefly fun house

84
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
And then he

85
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
Possessed by a demon called the

86
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
Brightside made him

87
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
Nearly indestructible

88
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,799
And there's a bunch of convoluted nonsense storytelling

89
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,151
Then at last year's WrestleMania they did a cinematic movie type match

90
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,967
Where I was called a firefly Funhouse match

91
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Deconstruct

92
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,855
Did John Cena's ego and higher career weird

93
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
Psychological

94
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:21,535
Constructivism a song about wrestling that I've ever watched

95
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,119
I told you this was actually very very good it was a lot of fun

96
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
So over the course of this year

97
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
The fiend

98
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
The demon

99
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Guy

100
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
You got burned

101
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,359
Alive rain trench

102
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Randy Orton

103
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,503
Set him on fire and burned him alive and he disappeared for a bit but

104
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
By that point

105
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
Doctrinated Alexa Bliss

106
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
There's another character on the show into the dark

107
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,743
Sativa whatever

108
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
And throwing Fireballs at him

109
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,119
Throw Fireballs now cabin

110
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,751
You burned a man alive you might as well give his buddy the ability to throw fire

111
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Fireball

112
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
At the last

113
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Pay-per-view

114
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Alexa Bliss

115
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Did talk to Randy Orton

116
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
Turn into a match with her

117
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
And of course this was all a trap

118
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,295
And the fiend came back and he was all burned and everything

119
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
Chart up

120
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,903
Oh my God

121
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Sherry Sherry Sherry

122
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
Three other ghosts

123
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,279
Tubidy really following

124
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,375
This WrestleMania Night 2 they had the match

125
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
Between the fiend

126
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Is it going to be

127
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
I'm already burned him to death

128
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,943
Bone match I was like this is so stupid

129
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
And so actually

130
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
It during the pre-show of night

131
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
I was yelling at the screen

132
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,183
Open WhatsApp

133
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,023
The worst idea why would

134
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
Would you ever open the show with that match

135
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,399
Terrible idea

136
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,983
So dumb they opened a terrible idea

137
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Yeah

138
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
It was really bad

139
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Wake me up

140
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
It started with the Bray Wyatt

141
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
Chard

142
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
Walking down the hallway

143
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,111
Which are dropped off Hammond

144
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:33,631
I would

145
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,727
Explain what happened in the match but I don't really understand it then do is dump

146
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
I will say my high point if this is

147
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,335
Damningly WrestleMania with faint praise

148
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
My high point was

149
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:51,039
The rapper Bad Bunny earring a lot of people say positive things about a wrap

150
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087
Yes

151
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:57,183
It might have been when my fever was setting in but she killed it

152
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,023
Is a lot of fun to watch him have just

153
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,095
The best time to have a lot of fun

154
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,423
Leave that that didn't happen I checked with

155
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
It's the people before the show and they were like

156
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,055
Never been on WrestleMania Dan just had a fever

157
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,359
Stay on your fever was so bad

158
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
Oh no brain was torturing

159
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
It's a fun night to that

160
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,295
Like a little little piece where Bad Bunny comes walking up on

161
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
Like onto a street

162
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,391
AAA Triple H's standing there with a

163
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Briefcase

164
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327
Did great at WrestleMania now you go do what you do God no hands

165
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:44,031
No nothing I don't even know anything about that bunnies music and I have been won over

166
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
Anyway this is been my project

167
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
Brightspot new Jordans

168
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,943
Did my bright spot of all things

169
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
TV show called maid4luv

170
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
It's for someone who's Birds Death

171
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,415
Comes back

172
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,975
Surprisingly close

173
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
Billionaire

174
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
We got some stuff it's quite funny but

175
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,863
The main thing is Ray Romano is in

176
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Incredible

177
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,959
Oh yeah he has turned himself into an act

178
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:18,335
With good you wouldn't expect

179
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,687
Everybody Loves Raymond to be this guy and to pull it off as well as

180
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:29,087
Who does Andre Braugher men of a certain

181
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
Quantum Leap

182
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,607
Dracula still alive

183
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,423
I remember that you're being all right

184
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,823
I might be wrong about that it was a show and I thought it was like like USA

185
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,223
Impact to Wild Hogs is Armageddon if it will

186
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
Came out the same year kind of thing

187
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Haematic

188
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
Overlap

189
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Joy

190
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Asian

191

As I was getting back to work I was like I don't want to

206
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,159
Do this

207
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,719
I didn't want to look at the present

208
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
Stevenson's shootings

209
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
Police involved

210
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
In Minneapolis

211
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,239
I just I just didn't have the stomach to jump right back in

212
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
And that without

213
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055

214
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,639
2003's back in

215
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,455

And here is another context drop

273
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
From Today Show

00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
Yep kids are being arrested

275
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,191
For stepping in water puddles

276
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
In water puddles

277
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,079

00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,919
What is the pool of water in this circle

280
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
I regret to

281
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
Inform you that Alex does not get into the

282
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
It does not get any of these

283
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,135
Specific details

284
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
So Alex

285
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439

286
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
About the bass

Is being put in all the

288
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
Positions of power

289
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
Amanda Rock

290
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
Retrospect sounds

291
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,727
Really right on he's right about everything

292
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,055
He won't you will shortly be very very very wrong

293

And then we get additional for the

294
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
The game

295
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Where in

296
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
In the world

00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
Saddam Hussein

Has no comfortable living in Russia

300
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
Okay so episode

301
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Haiti or the Cuba

302
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,439
He was believed he was in Cuba

303
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
The last couple days

304
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,655
Indiana jones-style interstitial where there's the play

305
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
In the red line going from

306
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
He gets around

307
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Nobody

308
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,663
Nobody is seeing him get on any of the

309
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
These flights

310
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
Cuba

311
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,735
Russia

312
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Butthole

313
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
That bih

314
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
Exactly

315
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,903
Travel itinerary

316
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,719
Yes this is interesting

317
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,279
The way that this is this is playing out that Alex

318
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Cuz very much

319
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
Omnipay Jose

320
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:40,703
I do the best party is going to be in charge of everything at

321
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
It's just

322
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
Could be very very wrong

323
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,079
Very short.

324
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
His career

325
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,943
He's a different Alex Jones

326
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
Then he is in the

327
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
In the present day

328
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
He's the same

329
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
In some way

330
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,879
In 2020

331
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
Be a real

332
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
Dum dum on Aaron

333
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
Being very sad and

334
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
What is job history

335
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,959
He's still in a million-dollar Studio you still got the LED screens behind him

336
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,775
He's the kind of guy who shows up

337
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,079
Bull horns at events

338
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,431
He didn't organize and DC and people chant his name and can't afford

339
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
To hire at least 50

340
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
1518 year old

341
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:29,599
Do you can draw crowd he can leave some people

342
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,975
From Trump's rally to the capital in a way that might look bad in hindsight but

343
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
In 2003 was a little bit different

344
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
What kind of book

345
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
Alex was taken back.

346
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,503
Silence is basically Z100 radio

347
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,903
There's maybe minor league baseball games

348
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,255
Going to be appearing at I was wondering

349
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,607
Cuz it's just going out of his way to go to the station

350
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,399
Seems weird

351
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,679
Can we find out about this

352
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
This place

353
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
And

354
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,287
Well there's a 2020 article

355
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
About the station today

356
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
I was a little bit in

357
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,967
Think how things turned out for them last year

358
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Okay alright

359
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:06,111
Pete Shartel

360
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Radio

361
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Sputnik

362
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:14,047
They are they're broadcasting for 6 hours a day this station AM 11:40

363
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,863
For approximately $60,000 a year

364
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,703
You know it's tough keeping her mom call radios

365
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,799
Station alive though I don't like you got to you got to find Revenue

366
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,847
I got to do what you got to do

367
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,943
Interesting interesting not necessarily

368
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,271
Anything weird

369
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,343
Prior to this this station was hearing people like

370
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
Alex Jones and of course Rick Wiles

371
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,487
Who you may remember is that fundamentalist assholes who called the Trump impeachment quote

372
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
Juku

373
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,911
This line in a kcur profile about the him and the station is actually kind of stunts

374
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,543
Shoretel acknowledges that kcxl has it

375
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
Who quote seem anti-Semitic

376
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,943
Churchill said that you thinks his listeners are welling

377
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,247
To decide for themselves whether they think something is

378
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,575
Antivirus or anti-vax weather it's based on prejudice

379
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:14,975
Burp on someone's wrong interpretation of the fact I feel like you're misunderstanding a real issue there

380
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
It's up to the listener

381
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:22,911
To decide whether or not they believe it is anti-Semitism however it is and you put it on the radio sir

382
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,775
I certainly says it's

383
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,847
Real good to go back to put it on the radio

384
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,895
And plenty of your lister's

385
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,159
I'm taking up time on my broadcast to are Nazi stuff in I'm in Oceano

386
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,231
LeBron commercials during ashcorp

387
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
I trust that the audience

388
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,095
Guess what I don't like this

389
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:57,727
Forum I'm just going to give them a place to spread their views without any pushback

390
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
Station that Alex's

391
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
Going to do good

392
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,847
Great stuff

393
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
So Alex's

394
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
Some grapes

395
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,943
Ben 2003

396
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
You've got some issues

397
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,295
Is above all of them

398
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
The Green Market

399
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:56,608
The biggest issue that the truth movement or whatever I engaged

400
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
Faces these

401
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:04,032
Opportunistic radio people who talk about the real issues but then mix in stuff like

402
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
Aliens are let's say exit

403
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,920
Four-dimensional demon while fighting the literal death.

404
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,016
One one could say that he has become everything that he hates most of this

405
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,880
Future Self

406
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
Got to love it

407
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,000
I heard that and I thought like well that's just

408
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
It's good fun

409
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
This actually leads

410
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
To what I think it is

411
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,424
A really interesting moment later in the episode

412
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
Okay there's something

413
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,752
Rises this up

414
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
211 love relevance

415
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
I have otherwise

416
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
Alberto

417
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
Get to that Alex

418
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Complain

419
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,432
A lot

420
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,504
About how they're going to Outlaw homeschooling

421
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Blue

422
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,400
America

423
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,784
What

424
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,856
Amarillo

425
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
911

426
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
Interesting

427
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,424
Wow it worked back then about the Muslims

428
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,776
Panoramic VR Taxi

429
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
Okay yeah

430
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
So all the terrorism

431
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,688
Without bars gold or fake Muslim terrorist

432
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,552
I think that there aren't really any except for CIA

433
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Ranma

434
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
Some terrorists

435
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
Others interests

436
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
They're going to get rid

437
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
Homeschooling

438
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
The calling it abuse

439
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,888
I mean I have a problem with

440
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,472
Skooly get as a way to avoid learning

441
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:14,592
That's a big issue were there like I don't want my kid learning any of that devil math

442
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
That's an issue

443
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,432
I think kids should learn the math of

444
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
The Spheres

445
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:23,552
Homeschooling in and of itself isn't necessarily

446
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
You can't be an elementary

447
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,392
Abuse if you are keeping your child in a

448
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
Raising them in some kind of

449
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
Absurd way

450
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,144
Could be an element of that decides to homeschool

451
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
Does not necessarily

452
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Equate

453
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,240
To that

454
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
Likes to play the margins

455
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,104
Did everybody is saying that homeschool is

456
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,152
Intrinsically inactive

457
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
If abused

458
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
People are making

459
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:58,880
You know I mean I'm in my small community growing up we had a couple I had but I have that but I think we had both ends

460
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,952
The spectrum of homeschool kids the kids who are home-schooled

461
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
Who were clearly

462
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,840
Play overachievers and you meet them and they're six years old near like at

463
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,632
You shouldn't be in with the rest

464
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,960
Of the chattel you need to be raised by your weirdo parents

465
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,080
That's fine and then the other end of that was the like

466
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,616
Well okay

467
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
So they know everything about the Bible

468
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,248
And then beyond that were in real dicey territory

469
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,344
Sure the difficulties and challenges of homeschooling

470
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,392
Cuz obviously like socialization

471
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,976
I think people that figured out ways around that was like

472
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,816
Groups and portly

473
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
I don't know

474
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,240
There's some homeschool stuff that's bad

475
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
Alex on the other hand

476
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
When he looks

477
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Sure

478
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
It's all bad

479
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,800
They're weird examples

480
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,128
Yeah this is a very strange dystopian

481
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,712
Infant that were real

482
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,272
Put some very weird adults

483
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
Doing some weird

484
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
Stop

485
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,600
What does a hole

486
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,416
Yeah I don't I don't know how public education

487
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,464
Teaches you to be and I I don't I don't like this

488
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,304
But as I was just calling it a crack w****

489
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,352
I don't track sex worker I don't

490
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,704
I don't know what the educational curriculum is like

491
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
I also

492
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,848
Fake obviously tag and dodgeball that's just those right-wing

493
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,664
Surround assignment periodically

494
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,736
Whenever they wanted to play those

495
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:38,880
Yeah it's weird yeah I remember any classes growing up there was just like okay we're going to watch The Wire

496
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,952
And then you figure out what character you want to be

497
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,816
Build a curriculum based on that I don't know

498
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:53,728
Glasses ever have been like Christianity to call Tonneau here's how you become a Muslim

499
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,432
Picture of describing a women's studies course in a very wrong way

500
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,576
Advertising examples like the way that this is out of

501
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
Control in the school

502
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
Schools

503
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Control

504
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,976
Trying to get everyone

505
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,160
Years ago

506
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,616
Themes

507
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
If true

508
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,296
Outraged yeah I don't believe this

509
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
The first thing that I find

510
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:20,000
Troubling about the stories that are weak is a pretty quick recovery time for a kindergartener to get over pneumonia

511
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
Strong kindergarten

512
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,120
I would ask you this question what is

513
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,680
Truancy if you're a kindergartener

514
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,848
4 and 6 years old or even able to skip class

515
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,408
Alright they turned around

516
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,712
If there's an unexplained

517
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,760
Signs of a child in kindergarten that's an issue with

518
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
The parrots

519
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,344
A six-year-old is not responsible for getting themselves

520
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,440
To class like a high schooler might be

521
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
Maturity is just ridiculous

522
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,048
The kindergarten hires a guy

523
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,120
To drive around outside all 7-Eleven

524
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:02,240
You're one day you got to be in school

525
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:06,336
According to the Texas Board of Education there are a bunch of steps that are taken before any kind of

526
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
Courtwood coming to play with truancy issues as a

527
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
It stands now

528
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
These rules were

529
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,760
Change that to get rid of any possible criminal charges back

530
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,344
In 2015 but even prior to that the worst it would really happen to us

531
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,624
Is it would be charged

532
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,648
Do the class C

533
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
However

534
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,696
Could get out of

535
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
Control

536
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,840
I feel about any of this but I'm also pretty sure

537
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,376
This is only something

538
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,656
Lady of dawn

539
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,680
After their attempt

540
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,728
To resolve the truancy issue and noses

541
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
The failed

542
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
It's not even how this stuff works

543
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
Anymore

544
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
Interesting things

545
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Things about Alexander

546
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
The past though

547
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,992
He's actually covering a murky subject but he sensationalizing it

548
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,784
It's so far past the point where I could be taken

549
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
And seriously

550
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
Thoughtful people can

551
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,904
And should discuss what approaches are appropriate to take

552
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Improves of encouraging attendance

553
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
In school

554
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,536
And how chronic truancy is often an indication of a larger problem

555
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
That should not be

556
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
Be ignored

557
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,912
Need help with yeah it kind of truancy the problem is not

558
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,448
You're not in school often enough

559
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:09,312
The right is a sign of something that's

560
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
One could use

561
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
Some kind of assistance

562
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,504
He's imposing fines on ice coolers and skip class all the time a good strategy or is it overly punitive

563
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
Counterproductive

564
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
That is a fine conversation

565
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
I think that

566
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
It's worth having

567
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,672
Where it falls apart

568
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
What is a terrible source of a

569
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
Information about anything

570
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:31,584
Is the point where he makes this about a kindergartener read pneumonia being criminally charged

571
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
For being out of school

572
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,424
That's absurd and even according to the debatable

573
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,496
Leave to harsh rules that Texas operated under at the time

574
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,800
These truancy rules only apply to students in

575
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
1st through 12th grade

576
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,360
How does making up an

577
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,944
An extreme example of some

578
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
Image in the audience's head

579
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,528
About this policy that he's looking to demon

580
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,600
He does this because that's easier than it would be

581
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
To look over data

582
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
Come up with an argument against

583
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
The policy as it exists

584
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,560
If you can just paint a dramatic overly emotionally-charged picture in your audience's head

585
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840
You don't have to do the work

586
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
Making an actual

587
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
Yeah

588
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,008
I love you like I remember whenever they took away 33 ad a PRACK

589
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,664
Says when I was in high school do in football and making the kids soft and all that

590
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Add stop

591
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
And I

592
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
Yeah that was probably the best

593
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,344
Decision to take that away but this would be like if Alex got out of it was like

594
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
They said you only have

595
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
How to do two

596
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,488
V103 anyways

597
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,536
So they f****** kill them they just

598
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,752
Problem is like a bin process

599
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,568
Also by Framing the issue that Alex

600
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
Is discussing like this

601
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,408
You can sidestep the uncomfortable reality that

602
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
Program

603
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,224
Millie victimizes stood

604
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,992
Without me

605
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
If you skip

606
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,832
You can't pay the fine

607
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
What happened

608
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Then

609
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,416
2015 article on BuzzFeed

610
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,000
Discuss the case of an 11th grader in Texas

611
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
Jail credit

612
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,816
At a rate of $300

613
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
Per day

614
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,632
This is an incredibly flawed system

615
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:15,008
And the conversation about it is done a disservice by having Alex Rider grandstand about imaginary kindergarten

616
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
Bank Weiser other adults

617
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,360
Discussing these sorts of issues in terms of reality

618
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,664
And adjustments no thanks

619
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,456
Idiotic fake address

620
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
Yeah

621
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,856
It's such a huge issue to when you consider the school-to-prison

622
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,160
Pipeline and housing so many things are meant to

623
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
Criminalize children

624
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,000
At an early enough age so you can just

625
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
Keep them criminals forever

626
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,096
The fuel for the capitalist

627
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,864
Mill

628
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,656
But Alex

629
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
Clearly one only

630
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
Here's about white kid

631
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
So there's a problem there

632
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,032
N2 is just

633
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
But he's not

634
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:53,408
Dealing with any of the larger problem is

635
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,432
Kindergartner

636
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,296
Intersection of

637
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,832
That school-to-prison

638
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,904
Pipeline ideas which is definitely real

639
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,184
An issue

640
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
And also

641
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,256
Misguided but

642
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
Well-intentioned

643
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Ideas

644
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
Cuz I do think that some

645
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,144
People who may not

646
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,704
Be trying to criminalize children sure

647
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
Okay if

648
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,520
You're in high school

649
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,568
Can you skip school when you get a fine

650
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,616
Maybe you'll be less likely to skip High School

651
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
Sure

652
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,944
Behavior the wrong way

653
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,224
Yeah I think that there is

654
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
An element

655
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,040
Does that even suck no matter what

656
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
Where is

657
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,880
More of the way Plies

658
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:38,720
Whatever Alex is doing is pointless

659
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,560
No and you can totally imagine like I can give Inside the Mind of

660
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,840
The person who offered

661
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
The kid like

662
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
Oh what's up

663
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,216
Will give you credit for doing jail and that person was

664
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,008
Probably thinking they were a genius

665
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
It's like see you

666
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
You can't afford to pay it

667
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:57,664
You just do some jail time helping you out instead of somebody who should have been

668
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,968
Slapped in the face the moment they had that thought

669
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,064
Yeah if you don't feel like I do sometimes

670
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,416
In jail instead of paying me the money that doesn't make any sense for you to pay me in the first

671
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,464
Reading that kind of stuff

672
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
It doesn't

673
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
Make a lot of sense why

674
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,536
You would

675
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,352
Continue down this road of this policy

676
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,448
Alex mentioned a guy named Chris

677
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
Chris klick

678
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,056
Who is a lawyer for an organization

679
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,104
That is a staunchly

680
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
Conservative Christian organization

681
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,712
All about homeschool

682
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
That's terrible because I would listen

683
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Listen to MC Chris

684
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
Chris klika

685
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,344
Instantly I would listen.

686
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
Mixtape

687
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,000
Go to pose actors

688
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Weather

689
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
They're trying to

690
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:56,288
Do whatever mean

691
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,896
Oh yeah

692
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,456
Okay

693
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,296
So yeah this is this is the way this manifested in 2000

694
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
Mixtape is I was hoping

695
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
No no

696
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:16,512
That was not the coloring books

697
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,680
A lot of this stuff with the schools and the truancy and Punishment

698
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,960
That gets me so

699
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
Social Services involved in all this

700
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
Some part of it

701
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,800
Is it there's a major push

702
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Take your kids and give them the

703
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,360
Sure

704
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:36,480
Sure

705
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,576
The edge of a conservative

706
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
Yep

707
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,136
These people are silly

708
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,696
It's so weird to go back into

709
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
The past

710
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,792
And listen to these people and think you're still allowed to talk aren't

711
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,840
People still listen to you

712
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:58,496
You listen to that and you're like really were doing that back then you're still around

713
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
Free Wild

714
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
If it's just in conservative

715
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,360
Chris

716
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,640
Middle is just so

717
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
Endless

718
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,040
Just slightly different

719
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:15,136
Window into the same stew

720
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
S*** so if you go to the hospital

721
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
Social Service

722
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm going to take the I know I'm going to steal those kids and I'm going to give them to homosexuals I believe released

723
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,048
Don't know what it means

724
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
I don't know

725
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,656
I honestly don't know what do you mean

726
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,704
It does not mix true

727
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
That's true it did rain really does

728
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
Doesn't make any sense

729
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
Nope nope

730
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,872
I just don't you know

731
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,176
People listen to that and they don't hear

732
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,480
People who are whining like

733
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
Crazy people

734
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
Like this isn't set like

735
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:19,392
Do you know what's going on now I went to the DMV to re-up my license

736
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,440
And instead of giving me a new lights

737
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,768
In my mouth directly into my mouth

738
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Literally

739
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:44,736
Brighton

740
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Children

741
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,296
Yeah yeah it's it's

742
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
Wild

743
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,952
You talk about that it gets into

744
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:54,976
Okay

745
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,512
Obviously Alex

746
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
Would call them

747
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
That's what you would do nowadays

748
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
In 2000

749
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,960
3 people who makes that stuff up

750
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,008
Father

751
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,080
And pills too far that's how you make the Patriots and all this

752
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
Caller calls in

753
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
And wants to talk

754
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,968
The social service workers

755
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,992
And he thinks

756
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,016
But they are demons

757
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,832
Okay here we go here

758
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
Alex's

759
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Respond

760
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,464
Statements that these people are

761
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Fireball

762
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,304
Just listening to you talk

763
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,352
The guidelines

764
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,544
We're totally

765
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
Script

766
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
And Alex you're right

767
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
Money with that

768
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,784
These people

769
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Program

770
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,744
When you're around

771
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,680
That's kind of measure

772
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,056
This isn't news

773
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,896
Interesting

774
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,224
You trying to walk a line

775
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,040
He knows that like I can

776
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
Can present myself as a guy who sang it

777
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:32,000
My enemies politically are devils seriously

778
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
I have some

779
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,304
Pretensive

780
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
Thing to be respected

781
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:39,936
Oh man I think I might be able to get a show on an actual Network

782
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
At some point

783
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,520
Yeah that is very interesting

784
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,592
I mean what kind of interesting about it is that at the

785
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
The time I say

786
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
Vicky's right

787
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:49,920
You couldn't

788
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
Be out-and-out

789
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,480
The demons are coming

790
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,784
Kill us all

791
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
Take you serious I think I look certainly didn't

792
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,136
A big enough career

793
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,672
A big enough star to be able to

794
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,232
Absorb whatever blow my come from

795
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,048
And then I would say probably right around what like the

796
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,072
The Tea Party Movement

797
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,376
Whenever they swept in 2000

798
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,936
That's really wet at all was like

799
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:15,776
Started a change where you could just talk about demons all all you want

800
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,848
Restaurants in Cortland

801
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,920
Get weird the weird turn tomorrow here in Pro you got wet

802
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
The normal is that

803
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
Tea party on the right

804
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,832
Yeah whatever you are as Alex Jones

805
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:33,952
Yeah I don't know I usually don't know for sure if that is when

806
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:34,976
More

807
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:40,608
Over conversation about demons and it was later

808
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
I think so

809
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,472
We did not seem nearly as much

810
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,776
These people at the f****** devil longer looking

811
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,848
2015 true that is true

812
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,384
I think I think it might be more Reese

813
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,479
But I find I find this Glimpse at

814
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,039
2003 really really interesting

815
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,319
And it's mixed clip

816
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,623
I think Alex has to stop himself

817
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,159
Interested

818
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
These people are demons

819
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:10,047
Okay and this clip will not stick out to me at all if I didn't

820
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
Noah

821
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
What he does now

822
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,167
What you're telling me is that

823
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,983
Like a demon trying to get out

824
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,823
What's to call these people be putting that out there

825
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,967
Wentworth family and friends

826
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
I'm sorry

827
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,287
I'm trying to get through the future

828
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:58,175
You were there the whole time doesn't that sound

829
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
Almost like

830
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,991
Someone had told him

831
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:01,759
Dude

832
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,807
Don't f****** save your fighting

833
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,415
We need like Teddy Anderson told him there's no way we're going to be able to sell gold

834
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:11,487
If you yelling about the literal devil

835
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
Sorry literal

836
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Long pause

837
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
Sorry

838
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
Wild

839
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,447
Hey Pete this is this is a piece of evidence

840
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,751
I'm sanchal obviously

841
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
Not definitive

842
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
But it works towards

843
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
Answering the question that I

844
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
I had for a while

845
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
Which is

846
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:36,063
Is Alex's I'm fighting the devil thing a new thing underneath

847
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,391
He was pretending but that wasn't what he believed

848
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,415
And I kind of thing

849
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
This looks like

850
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:46,559
Doesn't really sound like

851
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,095
Track gumshoe

852
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,751
Feels like that is at least in minor indication that Alex

853
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,823
Has this idea that his enemies are literal demon

854
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,871
He was covering that belief up

855
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
For the sake

856
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Appearing respect

857
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,503
I'm interested to see if there's any more

858
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,295
Flickers of indication

859
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,575
But that made me

860
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,391
Laugh really hard

861
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,231
That clip would not be

862
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,047
It wouldn't sound off any alarms

863
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,703
Unless you knew that 18 years later everywhere

864
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:31,103
That's so ridiculous

865
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,895
I'm mad at him and the best

866
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,687
For lying to me then

867
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,063
If you think your enemies are literal demons you should tell me

868
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,159
Yeah I think it would be more responsible to the audience

869
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:51,071
Tell me that you're hiding that their literal demons everywhere because you are supposed to be

870
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:57,471
Truth-teller on your own show and you're pulling back whenever you know that literal demons are killing every

871
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:03,103
Trojan Horse the literal demons at the talk of like the Federal Reserve and all this stuff that's not

872
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,127
To the audio

873
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Totally

874
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
Anyway

875
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,479
Alex is a guy who's again

876
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,063
Totally totally

877
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,647
Weirdly fine with the idea of deposing Saddam Hussein the business flow

878
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,143
Great

879
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,359
Route

880
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,791
Operation American freedom

881
00:45:54,047 --> 00:46:00,191
In the mold of operation Iraqi freedom and that involves getting rid of social workers

882
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,215
Okay we did it

883
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,031
That is

884
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:10,175
Complex series of steps you need to get to those three things being related to each other at all

885
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
I don't like it

886
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
No

887
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,807
I don't like it

888
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,343
Because guest

889
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,903
Nope I think these people are literally even

890
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:26,303
No no no I've been hiding that belief is old-time

891
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,095
Bad

892
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,311
Demonic side of it

893
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
One-place

894
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,615
The scripture where

895
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
Messiah

896
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,831
And these people are not letting

897
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,303
It's called math

898
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,095
Weird

899
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,935
Weird questions to ask

900
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
Play where are you by the way

901
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
Yeah you think

902
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
This is a bit

903
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,359
It's more than I expected

904
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
Cuz I think the prison

905
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,455
Temptation that Alex has is very much like

906
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,295
And I had no problem with Islam or anything like

907
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
I got the sense

908
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:24,159
It is is a anti-islam stuff kind of

909
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:24,927
Escalator

910
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:28,255
Yeah that's coming from his collar

911
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
But

912
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
Yeah

913
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
Yeah that doesn't

914
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,631
Surprise me I would be

915
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,911
Islam in the schools

916
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,703
Who sing that Islam is

917
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,727
Multicultural

918
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,495
Crap yeah

919
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
What the f*** is this

920
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,567
Freedom fries just

921
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,847
There whatever you want

922
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,383
Just just f******

923
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,199
Yeah so this girl wants to know where in Virginia

924
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
Chris's organization

925
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:58,719
How to find the square root of something roots are in the backyard my friend that's devil worship that's what I'm telling you right now.

926
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
Find the square root

927
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,047
Get tickets

928
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,095
Go find a switch

929
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
Sweetheart

930
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,447
They chat about where they are in Virginia and Alex have to be like

931
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:16,127
So unfortunately they end up stopping

932
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,199
Conversation to take another call that might have been

933
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Mistake

934
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
One dance

935
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,087
A couple of questions

936
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,135
Cuz I know that there is

937
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,071
Change it

938
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,871
Sandpoint

939
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,343
That does not answer the question

940
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,111
No

941
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,695
Seems like a fair amount of sovereign citizen collars at this

942
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:07,583
How is his career it is it is funny because it seems like he also really doesn't like

943
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,911
Noises have silly a lot

944
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:15,263
Are the arguments are they make it look bad without doing

945
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,567
Making a show that is this

946
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
The catering

947
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Directly

948
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Play to Sovereign

949
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:26,271
It was just too all over the place but good

950
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,063
Maybe half hour of this episode

951
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,343
Is dedicated to Alex

952
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,719
Arguing with a collar about the Republic of Texas

953
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,487
Should secede

954
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
I tried to

955
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,303
Support all that stuff

956
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,351
But everybody kept declaring themselves the present

957
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:47,519
It's really funny but it was

958
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,311
Cut Clips in a way that would make it work

959
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,847
So funny

960
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:55,711
Ahsoka Tano

961
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,599
Anything's going

962
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,391
Fruit cake

963
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,975
Fruitcakes to describe the Republic of Texas people like

964
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
Maybe

965
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,279
Five or six times

966
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,815
Very specific word

967
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,863
Made me think maybe

968
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,887
He has a personal beef

969
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,167
8 City

970
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
It's kind of funny

971
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,263
Little bit like somebody like

972
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,055
Starting a roller rink

973
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
And then

974
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Like

975
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
Just hated people who roller skate

976
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,455
Yeah like Heating

977
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,015
Hating people who use like in line

978
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:35,135
Yeah yeah yeah

979
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:41,279
The law says I have to let you skate okay this is America to the Magna Carta

980
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
What

981
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
Chris

982
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:44,863
Chris leaves

983
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,655
He was not that much of an inch

984
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Sing cast

985
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,263
Just kind of like a very reactionary against social workers

986
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,799
Pro homeschooling

987
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,847
Did not drop a mixtape did not

988
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,199
Take your time

989
00:50:59,455 --> 00:50:59,967
Very different

990
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
Cool

991
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,319
So Alex gets to some headlines

992
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
Is a lotus

993
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
Behind Bars

994
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,911
Salix is misrepresenting this case said that he's covering to make it appear that it

995
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
System is now just have to put

996
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,727
Criminals

997
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
And punish the good

998
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,263
People which is

999
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
Code for white gray

1000
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,823
Hey if people aren't committed

1001
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,895
So this is Tony Martin

1002
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,199
Man from the UK who shot it to

1003
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,991
Two young men who were breaking into his house

1004
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
Which resulted in the death of one of the

1005
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,343
The issue here isn't that Tony was wrong

1006
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
To practice self

1007
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,183
Defense didn't believe that he was acting in self-defense

1008
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
In the shooting

1009
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,535
The incident happened in 1999 at which point Martin

1010
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
Not have a license

1011
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
Thanks for the shotgun

1012
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,351
Used in the shooting

1013
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:25,471
You lost it 5 years prior when he supposedly found a man stealing apples from his Orchard

1014
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,519
Shoot at him leaving the hole in the man's vehicle

1015
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,311
Point of order

1016
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
You you

1017
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
No

1018
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:38,271
Added to this was Martin publicly known hatred of the Romani people which was referenced in a guardian article from

1019
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
Some 2,000

1020
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,343
Apart from Steve's Martin

1021
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,623
Pet hate was gypsy

1022
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:49,023
Norwich Crown Court heard that the farmer had talked to put these in the middle of a field surrounding

1023
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:49,791
You got anything

1024
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,887
The article goes on to say that Martin had said quote Hitler was right

1025
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,911
About these people

1026
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,447
And also points out that Martin's

1027
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:00,287
Uncle Andrew fontenot's one of the founders of a straight-up fascist measure

1028
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
Right right right

1029
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
So you're not

1030
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,407
The problem here

1031
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:12,575
The prosecution successfully argued that the shooting was not an act of self-defense but that martinet laid in wait and shoppies in

1032
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,111
Intruders without first giving award

1033
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,927
This wasn't the sort of case that Alex's portraying it

1034
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,463
Get to be where the burglar is

1035
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,743
Play someone

1036
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,023
Legitimate self-defense

1037
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,815
I meant Sue's the homeowner for it

1038
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,887
Hit clearly unhinged lunatic with a history of shooting at

1039
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
People with a clearly race

1040
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,191
Has passed

1041
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:28,959
Deadly force

1042
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:32,287
Intruders to his home but not presented a mortal danger to him

1043
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,335
According to the British

1044
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,103
Escorts that

1045
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
So I was

1046
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,407
Natsu except

1047
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,687
Use of self-defense

1048
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:43,295
So I don't know

1049
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:48,159
Yeah you know if someone breaks into your house and they slip on a banana peel they can sue you

1050
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,999
No they can't no no they really really can't

1051
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:52,767
You have to

1052
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
Kind of go

1053
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:59,679
Way out of your way to be the one who's convicted of a crime in that scenario and that's what this guy did

1054
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,239
Yeah it's someone is like

1055
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:06,079
Presenting a danger to you do I have the right to self

1056
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,871
Does not

1057
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
Weather in your house

1058
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
You have to tell them

1059
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,687
To leave

1060
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,711
Before you shoot

1061
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,527
Took that I would try I would I would open with

1062
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,807
Excuse me

1063
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,159
Alex has some

1064
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,695
Interesting similar problem

1065
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
In his life

1066
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,767
2003 the present

1067
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,815
One is it

1068
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
These calls just don't work out

1069
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,239
The difference though is it a 2003

1070
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,007
Handle it

1071
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,287
Sure

1072
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,055
Yeah

1073
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,247
Mike in Illinois

1074
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:05,215
Claire

1075
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:16,991
Wow that is such a

1076
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:21,599
Breath of fresh air this is a minor setback

1077
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:26,719
Not a big deal we're just going to rebroadcast

1078
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:29,535
Everybody bear with me

1079
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:36,447
That's the vibe that I got there everybody bear with me I suppose we're doing a live radio show

1080
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,007
Sometimes a little bit of a hiccup

1081
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,287
This happened

1082
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,567
Normal

1083
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,103
This present day

1084
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,991
Another was that talk with the Texas

1085
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,527
Folks about

1086
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,855
Now they're all weirdos and everyone's president now it's hatred

1087
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,183
But everybody can secede if they want

1088
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:01,791
Sure I was very procession 2003

1089
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:12,031
Because contract

1090
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,311
But but but

1091
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,871
Civil War

1092
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,367
Realpolitik

1093
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,511
That's correct

1094
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,655
What

1095
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,191
What

1096
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,007
That's true

1097
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,663
The Confederacy was full of globalist I do like

1098
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:54,271
How people who study the Civil War

1099
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:58,111
Change their story all the time

1100
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:03,487
Quite frequently in the story because

1101
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,023
We were in the pic

1102
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,815
Picture is easier to understand

1103
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,631
And you have a full awareness of what's going on

1104
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:16,031
New World Order moles as it seems as though the Civil War involved

1105
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,311
Whatever it is you want

1106
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,847
To be at any given point

1107
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:22,175
Time even if it's the difference between same day

1108
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,735
But what if you find something that sounds more

1109
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:28,575
How can you be Global how can you be Confederate royalty if

1110
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,879
Your royalty is just

1111
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,695
Infiltrated by New World Order globalism it's not like

1112
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,743
Everybody was New World Order

1113
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:39,327
How is it possible for everyone to be as so

1114
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,143
Well-informed Wyndham National rate of

1115
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,935
10%

1116
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,495
The new world order was running

1117
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,895
False flag Civil War

1118
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,175
He said it was a false Flags

1119
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:58,783
Everything is fake nothing except

1120
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,551
Conviction

1121
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
The truth

1122
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,671
Subway

1123
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,207
Confederate false

1124
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,767
Flag Civil War

1125
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,327
So there's a commercial for the Genesis Communications

1126
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,911
It's not working or anything cuz I just wanted to play this a little bit of it

1127
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
Cuz it sounds really

1128
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:27,199
What is our real interest

1129
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,135
Gcn Radio Network

1130
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,951
Are you tired

1131
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,511
Well so are we and we're doing something about it

1132
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,791
Where the jury

1133
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:45,119
You're the judge

1134
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
We've already

1135
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,471
Decided and you have to pass

1136
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,239
What's the sentence

1137
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:51,775
Executioner

1138
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,127
Doesn't talk

1139
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,735
Prosecution

1140
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,783
Metaphor

1141
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:07,391
Your honor the jury has something to say this

1142
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,695
Nova Jory.

1143
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,279
Where are the attorneys

1144
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,303
You're the jerk

1145
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,655
Jerry just stands up

1146
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:25,055
I could do a better job as lawyer in s*** hit this prosecutor out of

1147
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,151
Kuester is an expression is pretty good

1148
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:29,919
Think about it

1149
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,943
For even one second

1150
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
No

1151
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,479
Amazing

1152
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,271
Good job gcn

1153
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,575
Probably wrote that

1154
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,391
You got a bee in his bonnet

1155
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,415
Because

1156
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:41,951
Is it holiday

1157
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
The bush

1158
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,559
Bright evil one

1159
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
Yeah

1160
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,119
You got this holiday

1161
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,167
You got this holidays off

1162
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,471
Not about that

1163
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,751
Accommodate

1164
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,711
Memorial

1165
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
That's terrifying

1166
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,255
Google world

1167
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,423
Grabbed all natural resources

1168
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,135
So two things

1169
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:46,975
Is the jumped out at me there like the first is

1170
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
Clearly

1171
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,767
Fully aware of the

1172
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:53,375
Colonial exploitation that is part of our country's history that he completely denies

1173
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,399
In the present

1174
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,447
And second thing I was thinking is like

1175
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:01,311
Totally fine with the holiday called Loyalty Day if it was like a nationalist

1176
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:07,711
Extreme right-wing government everyone had to be loyal to

1177
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,759
Royal DJs my favorite day is

1178
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,295
If it was his

1179
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,343
Thanks

1180
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,439
A f*****-up thing to have a Loyalty Day do you know how that's so f***** up

1181
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,975
It would be like if

1182
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Every

1183
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:25,119
Morning kids had to go to school and recycle

1184
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:31,519
That would be so f***** up be very weird

1185
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,823
Point out that Loyalty Day is a holiday that's existed

1186
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,871
1921

1187
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,687
An attempt to replace the Communists leaning mayday

1188
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:41,503
Whereas it's also known International workers day

1189
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:47,647
That holiday marks the date of the Haymarket Riot which was something that the American government in the early 1900s

1190
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,951
Eager to not glorify we do

1191
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,999
You talk about Workers United

1192
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:58,399
We are still mad there's a weekend so yeah they didn't want to endorse workers rights which of course

1193
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,703
Was communism in so there was my idea

1194
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,495
Ceeday coming in on May 1st

1195
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,543
Take over

1196
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,103
The holiday itself didn't catch on until 1950

1197
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,175
T5 during the Cold War

1198
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,967
Official holiday in the United States

1199
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
And every

1200
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,271
1958

1201
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
Is recognized

1202
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,063
Reclaim the holiday

1203
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,111
See if you can guess who said this

1204
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:18,879
Quote

1205
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:23,487
Now therefore I Donald J Trump president of the United States of America

1206
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:26,303
Proclaim May 1st 2017 as Loyalty Day

1207
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,703
Disloyalty day I call on all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies in our schools and other public places

1208
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:36,799
Including the recitation of the pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America

1209
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,847
I also call upon all government officials

1210
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,127
Display the flag of the United

1211
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,687
It states on all buildings and grounds on that day

1212
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,223
Who said it

1213
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,503
I got to go with clay

1214
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:49,087
So close

1215
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,879
Every time

1216
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,695
I thought you were trying to trick me

1217
01:02:54,975 --> 01:03:00,351
Very ideology to create Alex Jones at the same ideology the created the idea of a holiday called

1218
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,375
Loyalty Day

1219
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,167
Express loyalty

1220
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,447
Did the United States in the face

1221
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,983
Communist Manifesto

1222
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,847
How to understand so little about the hits.

1223
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:11,871
The here he is

1224
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:15,455
Is rambling about the direct result of his ideological forefather

1225
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,991
A time to get some kind of it

1226
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,527
Evil event Bush wanted

1227
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,295
Create

1228
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,111
He's much more palatable and seems happier in two

1229
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,671
Freaked out when he can't get to a collar button

1230
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,695
You still a total idiot

1231
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,487
Yeah it's almost as if

1232
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:31,327
Conservative reactionary ideology is essentially an Ouroboros

1233
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,607
It creates an outrage

1234
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,935
And then later on gets outraged when their outrage

1235
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,983
It's created a thing for them to get out right

1236
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,311
2017 there was like

1237
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,359
Some people who are you know like

1238
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:49,759
Is creating loyalty

1239
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,783
Self into thinking that this

1240
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:56,927
The first one ever whatever you deprive all the context of it

1241
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,463
You just using it as a

1242
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,255
As a prop

1243
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,303
It also seems almost a little insult

1244
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,327
Isaac

1245
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,119
22 imagine that

1246
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,423
Whatever year it is that way

1247
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,727
Was the first year they thought of Loyalty Day

1248
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,495
Listen

1249
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:15,871
We've had plenty of fascists running America for a long time they thought of a loyalty

1250
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,431
EBay every time workers tried to unite

1251
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:24,831
They were like okay here's what we got to do pledge loyalty to the 120 Hour Work Week

1252
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:29,183
Like that's what they were doing

1253
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,255
So is Alex

1254
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,023
Exactly

1255
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
So stupid

1256
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,351
Yep

1257
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,935
The differences

1258
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,471
When I was looking at this episode.

1259
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,751
In present-day Alex

1260
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,519
Some back then

1261
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,543
Is he seems like

1262
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,847
To understand that movies aren't real

1263
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,871
At least

1264
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,471
It's like that

1265
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,239
Yes

1266
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,263
Yes

1267
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,823
Similar to this media reference

1268
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,847
The plan

1269
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:21,151
And they were not telling it to you

1270
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,431
By releasing that movie

1271
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,711
Yeah yeah it's

1272
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,527
Disconnect

1273
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Between this

1274
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:31,391
Idea that's represented in media and I reality

1275
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,951
The merging together in some weird

1276
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,743
It's using Alex

1277
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,279
Gestalt

1278
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,911
Yeah yeah it's people know the

1279
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Prince between movies

1280
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,447
Season reality

1281
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,239
It's comforting at least

1282
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,031
Because

1283
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,823
When I listen to this I can be like

1284
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,103
Alright

1285
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,151
We all agree

1286
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:59,039
That we breathe are that's their time moves

1287
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,343
Entropy is real

1288
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:05,183
That's comforting cuz I feel bad

1289
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,231
It is it is a real bummer

1290
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:11,327
Going into the past and finding things that are more positive than the present

1291
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,887
Because you're like you want to live in a place where hope is

1292
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,679
This but we do this we're like

1293
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
Man

1294
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,983
Isn't that nice

1295
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,055
And then you remember where it goes any like it could happen

1296
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:27,455
It could happen to you

1297
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:34,367
Yeah that is a bet is a little bit scary it's enough

1298
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,951
Should all be careful to not tired baby

1299
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,975
Secretly think

1300
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:42,047
They were fighting demons

1301
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,095
Elsa

1302
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:48,447
Try to keep it a secret for too long you turn into Alex

1303
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,823
Don't buy you are what you pretend to be

1304
01:06:55,103 --> 01:07:01,247
Going to figure out a way to make an infomercial out of that lasted not sure

1305
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:03,807
PSA

1306
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,367
So Alex believes

1307
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
Is the u.s.

1308
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,439
Sure

1309
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,999
There is a problem

1310
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
Confused

01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,991
When Alex fake cries in 2003

1314
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:09,343
Clinton Phil Hartman doing Clinton

1315
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,135
Set a Wonder

1316
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:17,535
I really heard Phil Hartman that sounds like

1317
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:21,119
I think that you're doing a great job

1318
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,191
Ridiculous

1319
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,007
So silly that was weird

1320
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,823
Completely artificial presentation of

1321
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,383
Emotion in sometime

1322
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,151
But

1323
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,687
I started think like Okay so

1324
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,527
Patriotism apple-pie

1325
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,807
And all this

1326
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,343
Is it is a facade

1327
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,903
And underneath that is just rotting maggots

1328
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,927
And what have you

1329
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,719
What do you love them

1330
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:48,255
Like what

1331
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,119
What do you think

1332
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:56,191
But it's right there in the title

1333
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,263
Countries evil

1334
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,591
But it's a rotten

1335
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,895
Cafe

1336
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,175
Lid on it

1337
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,991
E82 saying iPhone

1338
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:15,391
Yeah he likes me why not make the whole plane out of the black box and what do you what do you not understand I don't fully

1339
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,207
We understand what it is that like he's hoping

1340
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:18,975
Hoping to

1341
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
Save this

1342
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,559
Rotting underneath with a fake

1343
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,607
It seems like

1344
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,447
You expose that you take the lid off and you'd realize

1345
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,727
Yeah maybe we should go

1346
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,287
I don't need I don't need what's in this

1347
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,055
Rotting

1348
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:37,407
I don't feel fully that I understand

1349
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:41,247
Yeah yet from listening to this iPad

1350
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
What is Entrada

1351
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,343
Right I would guess that it's gone

1352
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,623
Sure

1353
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,647
Property rights

1354
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,439
Loyalty to your country

1355
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,023
Absolutely

1356
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,095
Hating

1357
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,143
School shooter

1358
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,935
Whites only

1359
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:06,335
I don't have a full grasp of like Alex's entire policy set in 2003

1360
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,895
Like I think I understand a lot of

1361
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
Stop

1362
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,199
Through the prism of

1363
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,039
Thousands of hours of his other content but like

1364
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:19,135
Some stuff that's going to be surprising and I don't want to make too many assumptions

1365
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,671
Yeah you know I was

1366
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:22,463
I was listening to that clip

1367
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,743
And thinking about

1368
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,791
All the stories of people who listen

1369
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:31,679
Listen to him at this time. We're kind of drawn in by that and I was

1370
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:35,519
Thinking about my understanding of politics at that time like

1371
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,567
As the Iraq war is going on

1372
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,103
It totally felt

1373
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:43,455
The first person to discover how evil America was

1374
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,479
It was like

1375
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:50,879
I have been told all of this stuff all the way up until I'm 16 years old and then the Iraq War

1376
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:54,975
Or happens in there like maybe you should read Real History is and not your school stuff

1377
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,791
And then I really did feel like all men

1378
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:04,447
But this is before redpilling became the meme that it was but it did feel like that and then you listen to Alex go like

1379
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,239
This is a rotten thing and you can

1380
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,775
You can really get that

1381
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,799
Sense of like

1382
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:15,199
Yeah that's how I feel yeah you don't have sophisticated political opinions yet I just know that this is some

1383
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:15,967
Bulshit

1384
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:21,087
Yeah yeah pretty surface-level their presentation that is almost

1385
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:22,879
Perfect

1386
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,927
For exploiting

1387
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,951
Disillusioned

1388
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:32,351
Yes it was definitely a period where there is a lot of people were feeling alienated and dissolute

1389
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
The world

1390
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,959
As they had

1391
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:39,007
Been brought up to understand that

1392
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,055
That you and I though we're a few years apart

1393
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:41,823
We're both

1394
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:47,967
You know a certain man of a certain age when they're Wrecking Ball

1395
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,503
Where were you

1396
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:53,087
Amm. Where people are generally

1397
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,391
They go through. It just illusion

1398
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:58,975
I meant to have that compounded by something as

1399
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:02,559
9/11 and the Iraq War

1400
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
Yeah it's

1401
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,119
It's something where you

1402
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,167
You know those feelings that you're having

1403
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,471
You could see them mirror

1404
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,263
Maybe something like Alex talking

1405
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,799
Sing about the

1406
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,567
Core

1407
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,615
In the Passat over it

1408
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,383
You could you could

1409
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,175
You could gravitate

1410
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:18,943
Towards that

1411
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:20,991
Interesting to

1412
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:27,391
Think about how much goes along with it that you might not realize that you're also accepting of course like that homosexuals want to take

1413
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
Children

1414
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:34,815
Absolutely cuz you know that's what liberals got pricked and he wasn't

1415
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:39,423
Driving you you're listening to this you're you're on a 20-minute drive right

1416
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,983
You papa Anna Infowars because you're like

1417
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,031
Disillusioned and disguise

1418
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,567
Pretty funny and

1419
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,223
And you only get 20 minutes where he's doing the anti-iraq war stuff and you don't listen to the half-hour he does with

1420
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,247
The games are coming

1421
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,015
Steal your

1422
01:12:54,271 --> 01:13:00,415
You know and you're like arguing about the Republican

1423
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:05,279
Only be sucked into that it's much more believable

1424
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,303
Like

1425
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,375
The notion of like him having a large audience

1426
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,655
If you listen to the present

1427
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
Yeah what

1428
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:15,519
In God's name that's much more believable when you look back at this

1429
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,543
Petulant Lehigh

1430
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,311
Outburst

1431
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,591
All the time

1432
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:22,431
The presentation of emotion is generally within like

1433
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:26,015
Where he would want to be to make a point

1434
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,295
Yeah and

1435
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,855
He still got that dynamic range of like heat

1436
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,647
You can get it up there hi and he can

1437
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,695
It's not out of can

1438
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,463
Control

1439
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,511
Although it is silly

1440
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,583
Training sincerity sounds like

1441
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,863
Is a little bit

1442
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,935
Weird I don't know

1443
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,519
You know the Civil War was a false flag

1444
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,311
So we we learned this

1445
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:54,175
Yeah it turns out no in grocery stores they're putting

1446
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,247
Self checkout line

1447
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,271
Wow

1448
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,295
Eventually

1449
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,319
But first

1450
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:03,135
They're going to transition the self-checkout Lanes

1451
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,903
Into fingerprint

1452
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Scanners

1453
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:08,511
Where you're going to have to have some sort of a mark of the beast or whatever notify grocery

1454
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,559
We're never not going to do Market

1455
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,607
I want to be done with Mark of the Beast

1456
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:16,447
Can't we do about telling you what

1457
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,007
At at the grocery store

1458
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:19,775
I meant

1459
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,311
You're going to have some sort of a Christian

1460
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,847
It's going to go bomb

1461
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:27,199
Biometric false flag

1462
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:34,367
Presaging our people are going to bomb 5G towers and it's going to be a false flag

1463
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,823
Already

1464
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,663
Worst

1465
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
What

1466
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,975
Okay we're we're talkin about

1467
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
Picture

1468
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:49,631
What abortion

1469
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,935
Yeah okay so all the abortion clinic

1470
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:57,311
Attacks that we don't know if he's Mighty don't even know if he's mine

1471
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,079
Controlled

1472
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,895
So it could still be the Feds that one's on the fence

1473
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,967
Hello boys closest I get to admitting that

1474
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:08,063
Could possibly not be a false flag everything I was on there

1475
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:11,391
That's exhausting

1476
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:14,463
About this sir this is a glimpse into 2003 is like

1477
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,999
Everybody is a f******

1478
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:16,767
Concomitant

1479
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,559
Everything is fake death

1480
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
He's talked about like

1481
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,607
All kinds of

1482
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,375
Folks bike

1483
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,679
Joe Scarborough

1484
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,215
Ultra communist

1485
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:30,079
Well that's that's turned out to be a prophetic

1486
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,615
Who's the other person

1487
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,919
Do you label the Communists on this episode

1488
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:39,295
F*** I can't remember it is another is another right-wing guy

1489
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,831
The pettiness of

1490
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
Like

1491
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:46,975
Chris Matthews

1492
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:50,815
I just love the Lakes they're putting finger scanners in there

1493
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,095
They're going to do all this s***

1494
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:58,751
Second problem I don't want to do my own baggage

1495
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:05,151
Patty right now that is not the Patriots main complaint

1496
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,479
Girl girl

1497
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:14,879
Is a convenient I always put the eggs in first and then then they went

1498
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:15,903
We ever get 10 eggs

1499
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,975
I've never been a train. A bad thing

1500
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,767
Do people have training

1501
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,839
Silly

1502
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,119
Also great prediction

1503
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,679
That they put in the self-checkout stuff and then

1504
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,447
Next

1505
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,471
Finger thumb scanner

1506
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,519
I don't think that I've ever

1507
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,543
Scammed by Thelma

1508
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:37,919
Skating a credit

1509
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:42,527
8 years old 8 years on self checkout pretty ubiquitous

1510
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:47,647
Not even really in the conversation I don't think entertainment

1511
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,183
Problem with self

1512
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,231
Checkout line isn't doing your own baggage

1513
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,535
Find somebody who shouldn't be using

1514
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,327
There's too many items

1515
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:58,143
Not just that whenever they're clearly

1516
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:01,471
Not bagging material if you will wow

1517
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,799
I don't have many complaints

1518
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,079
At self-checkout

1519
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,359
I kind of take everything in

1520
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,383
Stride

1521
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,991
So yeah everything's false flag there's going to be Christian

1522
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,039
Places in

1523
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:15,807
Going to be all fake

1524
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
All these predict

1525
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,599
Fantastic

1526
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,159
Just constantly right about Atlanta

1527
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:23,999
I'm going to be real mad if the when we do start getting those biometrics

1528
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,559
There are biometric

1529
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,839
Make things in Little Alchemy

1530
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,119
Message you can have you can put little

1531
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,167
Electromagnets in your finger

1532
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,191
And stuff like that

1533
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,239
Sooner or later we're going to have an implant

1534
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,007
Turbo chips

1535
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:35,775
Some sort

1536
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:38,847
And some that are available now

1537
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,639
One that will be

1538
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,943
That final that like iPod moment

1539
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,503
You know where all the sudden

1540
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,527
This thing didn't

1541
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,575
Exist and then it's everywhere

1542
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,623
And it should be called The Mark of

1543
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,647
The Beast I think

1544
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,695
It's possible that that that

1545
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,743
Technology will go along that line but it's

1546
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:56,767
Equally possible that

1547
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,303
I don't

1548
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,583
No I don't know

1549
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:03,167
I don't know if there will be an iPod Moment Like That

1550
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,983
But it better be called The Mark of the base we got Soylent that's real

1551
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,263
Yeah

1552
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:10,591
And we don't talk about it start I don't know

1553
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:16,991
We got to find out how to find that episode of our to show he's going to be furious about that

1554
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:19,039
Definitely

1555
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:24,415
Okay guys going to be

1556
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:29,279
Go get the bodies

1557
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,839
Yeah I'm taking the piss out of bed

1558
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,887
Episode really DeSoto Market

1559
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,423
Some of this is stupid

1560
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,447
It is but

1561
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
You have to write

1562
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,055
And if I slip

1563
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,079
Welearn

1564
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:42,847
About

1565
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,383
Something that maybe

1566
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,431
Isn't in the history books but it should

1567
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,247
Alex Save-A-Lot alive

1568
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,807
Do you laugh

1569
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,343
You got okay

1570
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,360
They didn't do it

1571
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,896
Now it's stopped

1572
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:20,224
A smallpox attack by publicizing information

1573
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,504
In about smallpox attacks

1574
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,784
You stopped it

1575
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,576
You can't I mean book

1576
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,600
He said it

1577
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,392
Obviously it's true

1578
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,672
He saved so many wives

1579
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,208
IQ

1580
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:36,096
Lucid hearing you laugh and it's better hero who are the benefits of having a narcissist

1581
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,376
Personality disorder

1582
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,704
In that you can invent your own crisis is to become the hero of

1583
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,800
I've never felt like a hero

1584
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:51,456
Maybe maybe

1585
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,992
Probably make me feel better

1586
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,600
Do the costume like a pro con

1587
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:06,816
In the pros or things like that saved the world

1588
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:08,096
10 times over

1589
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:12,704
No matter how many things you've bungled it easy to convince yourself it's

1590
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,752
Plot positive red

1591
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:18,336
It's all worth it. I save the world from a smallpox

1592
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,640
Love that kind of stuff

1593
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,664
The app

1594
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,480
So this was this was little bit of a fun

1595
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,504
Trip

1596
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,808
2003 in order to

1597
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,136
Ghetto get our toes back in the water for 4

1598
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:38,304
Probably an unpleasant present-day episode on Friday disgusting nonsense spouted by a Munster

1599
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,352
Looking forward to it

1600
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,888
It will happen

1601
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,912
Now I think

1602
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,704
If I had to solve this up like

1603
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,496
The reason that I thought the fifth

1604
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,264
So it was like

1605
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,032
Really

1606
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,824
He

1607
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:53,408
That moment where Alex says literal

1608
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,176
Cre

1609
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:54,944
Yeah

1610
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,760
He stopped himself from saying literal demon

1611
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,808
It's so

1612
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,576
Import

1613
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,856
Right there

1614
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:02,880
It is

1615
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,184
If we can demonstrate

1616
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:10,816
If we can find more instances of Alex stopping himself from talking about the literal devil in the past

1617
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,376
I'm going to

1618
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,400
My mind's going to be

1619
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,984
So you're saying that you're going to be the jury and I'll be the judge

1620
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,008
And then

1621
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,544
The audience

1622
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,568
Executioners

1623
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,616
I don't know I don't know how this work

1624
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,152
We will

1625
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:30,016
We will be court reporters

1626
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,320
The audience can be an audience

1627
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:39,488
Can I be the stenographer I want to play with one of those ticket can't use can't type fast enough

1628
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:46,656
With another episode but until then

1629
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,896
We are invisible to iTunes

1630
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,920
People I do agates

1631
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:04,320
Omniome Leo I'm dzx Clark I'm Daryl rundus I invented Liberty day

1632
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,512
Alex
