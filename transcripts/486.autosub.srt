Doordash

4
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
What's up

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,472
What's today

6
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,872
Hey look at work tired of

7
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
On what am I on

8
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,440
And it was exhilarating

9
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,488
Overwhelming

10
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
I kind of feel a little bit I might cry

11
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,784
Sure

12
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,112
I don't know how excited

13
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,768
Slices

14
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,168
Like some people frame their first dollar made in business

15
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
No problem

16
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:31,296
I'll be more excited

17
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:36,672
It's probably true

18
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
Workout

19
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:51,520
R6S

20
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
Cucumber

21
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:17,120
I know everybody's getting tired of

22
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Tennis

23
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:43,488
Felt like it was

24
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,288
Jesus is over already

25
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:02,688
Is far too f****** long

26
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,552
What we should do that exactly

27
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,952
No no reasonable person would say otherwise more time

28
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
Two weeks and then Raphael will have another French Open

29
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:33,151
When I was younger

30
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:49,023
2020 iPod

31
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,823
Acquired

32
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
Announce

33
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
43 Court which wasn't Garth Amy Coney Barrett

34
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,391
Great

35
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,511
Immediately

36
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,071
The inside scoop

37
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
Coney Barrett

38
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,447
Totally excited

39
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
Dr. Robert Barnes

40
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,663
We're coming in with some real hot

41
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,967
Barrett

42
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:51,999
She was basically

43
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
Where's Detroit

44
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:59,935
Barn pitched megillah and somebody who would give him basically a winning floor

45
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,591
Very conservative doesn't have a lot of the bag

46
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,135
Really

47
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,511
Nomination

48
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:34,495
Workout

49
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
Somehow this is getting lost in the in all of this

50
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:59,327
Usually whenever there's big news why the Saturday episode

51
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,359
Navigating somebody that he and his buddy Barnes

52
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,063

Going to play

56
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
The choice

57
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,079
Justify

58
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351

00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,047
This is the stupidest thing in the world

68
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,863
No

69
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263

00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,103
Thank you so much

72
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
What you could do

73
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,271
I see your eyes looking around

74
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,135
Rolling around in there

75
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
What you can do is be browbeat administration of your school in tattooing absolutely no

76
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:23,263
Dealing with the fuc

77
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Normally I

78
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:31,967
I f****** pull this off perfect absolutely

79
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:44,511
I really like

80
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,559
A nightmare on

82
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,775
I was just overwhelmed

83
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
Do you want me to try disingenuous

84
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:19,327
I don't want you to listen

85
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,399
Surprising

86
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,783
Tattoo on your arm

87
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,183
To do right there

88
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,279
Audio

89
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
I told you I was off a little bit

90
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
On the ground

91
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,903

95
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
And

96
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Subordinate

97
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
Vajacial

98
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,783
Talking about Siri

99
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
You know what

100
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:02,239

101
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895

Cool

104
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,255
Serious people. People

105
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,727
Cameron

106
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:11,871
Instead imagine a bunch of people with rocks just likes

107
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
Oh that's for damn sure

108
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,975
Literally

109
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:48,223
Initial investment

110
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,207
Expectation

111
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:03,839
Some sort of a charge for

112
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:12,287
Real serious real serious

113
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
What about everybody

00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,503
Nixon friends

117
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,927

00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:09,119
To this with some sort of like agenda

Every

122
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:38,815
46 days until the election

123
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,519
Getting a little closer

124
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
Motherfuker

125
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
You

About Tony Barrett

128
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:38,975
Maybe pretend

129
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,303
David has the worst decision possible

130
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
The moment

131
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,663
Hours after Ginsburg die

132
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
Action

133
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,255
She's the picture

134
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
Ginsburg

135
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,223
Call list about using covid-19 takeover s*** is completely made out of

Which was hosted by

138
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,031
It was posted online on July 14th

139
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
Not in February

140
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,407
Groupism

141
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:39,807
They're meeting every year in Davos Switzerland

142
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
You referred to as

00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,047
Put out this report not Davis because

144
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,703
80%

145
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,639
Is the name

146
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,696

These great reset presentation was released

148
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
Things are structured

149
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
Across

150
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:48,160
Very wide-ranging

151
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,744
February because that's when he

152
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,352
The date

153
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
224

154
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
Intentionally

155
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,480
Listen to this section

156
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,752
That he's using

157
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,808
Group document

158
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:06,240
Survivor

159
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
I just I just can't

160
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,200
Is that you can't start and then

161
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:23,648
Mike Adams

162
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:30,048
To seriously bother Everything is Everything

163
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,080
Police officers

164
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
Who were shot

165
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,088
Story

166
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,312
Charade

00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:23,552
WLKY

168
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,136
Charged with 14 counts of wanton endangerment

169
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,792
He's $1000000 with that

170
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,608
Games of Discovery chair

171
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:42,752
District attorney

172
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,280
Tutoring

173
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,376
The narrative in the story only has a weight if you accept the first plan

174
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,704
Where's the Second Glance

175
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,288
Punishment for first-degree assault

176
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:22,432
Pretty steep

177
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,232
District attorney

178
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,072
Charges are far more likely

179
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,848
Conversely it's much harder to understand how it's affected

180
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:58,528
This is the sort of thing

181
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Refurbished shooter

182
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,376
Responsible for reporting that there are no attempted murder charge

183
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,776
It's a nice receiving the consequences

184
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:26,176
Something that is true but not the line part

185
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
Athletic

186
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Respond

187
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:17,632
Intellectual

188
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
F*** yourself you know what you're doing

189
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,616
About that

190
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,968
Days of the inauguration

191
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:35,296
And that is because we have a new narrative

192
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
It is

193
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
The time between

194
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:43,232
The election inauguration

195
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,536
Might be the Rapture I don't know

196
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
Alright

197
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
Election going

198
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Vermont

199
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
Surskit

200
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
No they're losing

201
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Call Aaron

202
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:15,648
Nick Lachey

203
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:20,000
Soon or something

204
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:27,680
So I guess

205
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:40,224
From getting elected

206
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,648
Misrepresented

207
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,816
Recording booth

208
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:02,752
When New York Times article about Trump attack

209
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:09,152
Forward

210
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:14,528
I don't want

211
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
Throw Stone

212
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,952
Trump to do

213
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:43,712
Afterwards

214
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:56,512
We all know the outcome is already decided

215
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,328
Explanation

216
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,888
To come out with that ad campaign

217
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:48,224
Election

218
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:56,928
He's he's really really trying to push this talking quite hard because

219
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,976
Libertarian

220
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:03,840
Dictator

221
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:16,896
You know hey if there's all these protests which are going to destroy city and sure

222
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:23,296
Call Linda

223
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
When the military

224
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Jerry

225
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
The Shadow

226
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
Nothing worth anything

227
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
What

228
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:52,896
What seems so angry fake stories

229
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:59,296
He's with their newspapers and they look.

230
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,576
Jesus Christ

231
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
God dammit

232
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Zoe

233
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,536
Destroyed

234
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,728
Spanky

235
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:22,336
I never should have said anything

236
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,784
Magical little Counterpoint

237
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:44,352
That's not fair the part of it though

238
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:50,752
Stan

239
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
Gigantic detail

240
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,112
I forgot that they're also going to send alligators to eat

241
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:11,744
Crocodile

242
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,568
People Like Us

243
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,248
That's great

244
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
Different problems

245
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,392
To have a reason for the

246
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,976
Decision to take longer so they can crash the stock market

247
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,032
If you believe anything

248
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
Worked up about whether or not

249
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:43,392
The globalist

250
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:51,072
Vaccines

251
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:57,472
How to twerk

252
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,640
Which is the release of super bio weapons

253
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,432
The relief

254
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:25,632
The word he says

255
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:32,288
I'm getting another four years means nothing

256
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:38,688
If he threatens our plans at all

257
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,504
None of it has any effect

258
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:46,624
Words that came out of his mouth

259
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
For Christian

260
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:06,080
Unreleased world society

261
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
Display seems like a small

262
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:25,024
All about whether or not Trump

263
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,824
Bored

264
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:59,840
Having an emotional day

265
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,424
By way of trash truck

266
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
Chris Brown

267
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,312
Trucks

268
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:15,712
Hundred percent certainty

269
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,296
Next year

270
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:28,768
What's appreciate

271
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,352
It's like nobody

272
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:41,056
Murder

273
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,736
A lot of control over a lot of

274
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
And

275
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:06,656
Yes certainly this is made us all take a lot more of the philosophical Longview like

276
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,984
Generation

277
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,264
Obviously

278
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,664
Yeah

279
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,064
Don't worry about it

280
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:35,328
I don't have a lot to answer

281
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,520
It's a real problem because

282
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,336
All this should be trivial

283
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,152
The ultimate

284
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:54,272
Is to stop

285
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,600
You know it's right away cuz evolve then

286
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,536
Prism

287
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,864
Find Soros and take him out real whatever you know

288
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
It's alright

289
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
Is to discuss

290
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:23,456
How do you clean water

291
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,952
I don't think it's as profitable

292
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:41,120
Binder demon

293
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,424
Juice everybody up

294
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:05,439
Attorney General of New York Township

295
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,847
Truly believes that

296
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
And all that stuff

297
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
Call Ben

298
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,047
Stupid

299
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,935
For the Supreme Court

300
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:52,287
Alex isn't saying it is a very bad idea

301
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,591
Hey got to fall in line

302
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:14,047
Power notes

303
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:24,287
Obviously

304
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,567
Licker

305
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
Cool

306
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:36,063
Then

307
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:44,255
Then you're saying that you want a Supreme Court Justice

308
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:48,607
Globalist plant

309
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,679
Strength

310
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:58,335
For some reason Trump

311
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,407
And supporting

312
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
Globalist plan

313
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
Buddy

314
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:20,607
Now that you think about suggest that isn't a class of

315
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,911
Goodnight everybody

316
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447
All of them

317
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,007
For summer

318
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
Well

319
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:32,639
Going through because

320
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
Democrat

321
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,943
Are clearly again

322
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:44,927
She had a lot of ideas

323
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,231
Sportacus

324
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:53,631
Basically just Oppositional defiant

325
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:28,447
Oh no she's broke

326
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:40,991
See this is the difference between someone like Alex

327
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:47,391
Embarrass

328
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,703
For Supreme Court nomination

329
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:07,103
It violated some piece of the Damned

330
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,663
Or something

331
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,503
Except in opposition to

332
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:28,351
I mean

333
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:32,191
The Reason by everybody

334
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,007
Is there unified in one

335
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,567
Anything but left like soon

336
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,919
About their political position

337
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:48,319
5 blocks

338
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:54,719
Anything that they don't mean you have to support it

339
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:02,655
Soros paid all the protesters me run 2019

340
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:15,455
Socially responsible

341
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,831
Black lives matter

342
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,623
Elemento

343
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:27,231
Protest

344
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,087
Sure whatever

345
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,879
So for Alex

346
00:47:55,391 --> 00:48:01,535
There's a position needs to be called artificial

347
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:21,759
Because

348
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,903
You believe the same thing

349
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:34,047
Maybe

350
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
Can't really

351
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:38,143
Can't really drive with

352
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,007
Philosophical

353
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,103
I think the Democrats are right on this one

354
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,943
Like imagine inside in 2020

355
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,503
Imagine that

356
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,039
So

357
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
Because

358
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,023
I mean you want someone

359
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,815
Quran the Quarry

360
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:12,447
Rite Aid got to figure out why the f*** did Trump nominate this person

361
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:17,055
She's prorock down and pro-vaccine

362
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
Oh yeah

363
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:55,455
That this is a Federalist Society

364
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,551
The election

365
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:10,815
Brother

366
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:17,215
You're the one that told me

367
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,383
Response

368
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,575
What else you got

369
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:46,143
Pro lockdown pro-vaccine

370
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,959
Mandatory vaccine

371
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:52,287
Because you were told she would hand him

372
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:59,711
Because she was part of the bush-gore team which aliver Bush stole

373
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:12,511
Federalist

374
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,423
You think

375
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,751
If you are born

376
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,335
Like how can you understand

377
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,383
Your guy who's your

378
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,687
You telling me

379
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,759
Federalist Society

380
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,767
That these people can visit

381
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,535
Trump

382
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:49,119
To nominate this person right because of the

383
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:55,519
Bush V Gore

384
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,639
Malik

385
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
Is

386
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,719
In order to stay in power

387
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:20,351
That's not good

388
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:33,151
Everything that you disagree with her about simply because she is

389
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,175
Wrong with that damn

390
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,575
It's bad I mean it's just

391
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,543
Cupboard

392
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,343
Bar was a terrible choice in many

393
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,183
Appointed there because he had previously helped

394
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:23,583
Cover up crime

395
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,143
Whether she could be another William Barr

396
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:35,103
Hey this looks like a bad idea

397
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,991
We have to wrestle with a really difficult in here and that is that

398
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,599
The Koch brothers

399
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,743
Amy Coney Barrett

400
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,559
This is going to probably piss you off

401
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
Actually

402
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:19,903
Wow

403
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,327
Paisley that makes me shiver

404
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:33,727
Physically you just took a shot of something weird for the first time

405
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:43,711
That one was

406
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:56,511
Or whatever

407
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:00,607
Kill me

408
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:07,007
Career considering

409
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:11,871
And Ron Paul is first president of a way back and then where

410
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:16,991
Cook Brothers bathroom freedomworks Sunday then after fantano

411
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,039
The tea party with you

412
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,879
It's tough to understand how

413
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,903
Pro-immigration

414
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:36,447
Watching listening to these two guys eat what is clearly a big bulshit

415
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:53,087
Honestly

416
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:06,143
Bad

417
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:12,543
In order to make things

418
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:18,943
Pretty funny

419
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:28,671
Leave this in the same position

420
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,999
Supreme Court

421
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:07,071
Adulterated

422
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:13,727
The end of it I'm just shivering and angry

423
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:36,767
You know that's right

424
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,839
Unclear

425
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,399
Tumi

426
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,055
For them

427
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
2

428
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:54,175
Nominate end-to-end another Supreme Court Justice

429
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:57,503
Like because if you add Coney Barrett

430
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,319
The Supreme Court is so comically

431
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,135
There's no point in even having

432
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,999
Still

433
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,791
What's that mean

434
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:15,423
Even then you know whenever if we elect by and actually work

435
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,263
Great

436
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:22,335
Supreme Court

437
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,455
Where

438
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:31,295
Tire system

439
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,087
It's not too much different

440
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,135
Tumi

441
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:38,207
What's going to or what needs to be done to correct

442
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,743
Gretna

443
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:47,935
What the answer to that these world

444
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,311
Ultrabar

445
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:59,711
Amy Coney Barrett somebody who

446
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:03,039
Prologue

447
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:07,647
He's someone who's highly susceptible to attack from The Fringe right

448
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:11,231
There is a possibility

449
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:17,631
On people who are like Ted Cruz

450
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,191
Not being able to support her nomination

451
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:26,591
Pissing off on crowd

452
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,343
And we end up with

453
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:43,743
Getting to the election with an opener

454
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,679
Probably

455
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,215
Supreme Court

456
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,319
And I were at the hearing

457
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,415
More than anything else

458
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,655
A reverse psychology

459
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:29,055
Like seriously just she believes that the far-right Fringe

460
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:33,919
Their ship

461
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:40,319
But like seriously

462
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:58,239
Subway

463
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:07,967
Particularly vulnerable to

464
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:17,951
It is a tool that the last disposal

465
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,511
Toodaloo

466
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,375
There are a lot of people

467
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:39,199
Clearly saying that they don't like her

468
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
For sterile

469
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,623
Nations in Topeka

470
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,095
Never issued in America

471
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,935
Citizens united

472
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,599
USA

473
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,399
You selling me on.

474
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:42,175
This goes to show

475
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:48,575
I don't know cuz I'm not

476
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:54,975
Underline

477
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,791
Jacobson

478
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:04,191
Massachusetts

479
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,519
Dollars

480
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,063
Not getting vaccinated

481
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,855
They create the public health burden

482
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,279
Territory

483
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,815
Forcing people to get

484
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,863
Vaccines

485
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:49,759
That if you don't get a vaccine

486
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,463
Subsequently

487
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:05,631
Yeah

488
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,991
How succinctly they are making the case

489
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,039
For not supporting her

490
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:26,367
The same time

491
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,671
F******

492
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,719
Now it gets even weirder

493
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,743
Because

494
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,655
This was that

495
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:44,543
I've experienced even on Infowars

496
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,591
Pretzel

497
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,767
The George Soros

498
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,935
That's amazing

499
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:12,959
So

500
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,311
Trump to appoint

501
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,335
This lady

502
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,151
Who is pro-force vaccination

503
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,431
In order

504
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,271
Vaccination

505
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,551
So

506
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,599
By himself

507
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:35,999
Make a decision to nominate for the Supreme Court

508
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:36,767
To make

509
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:42,911
Horse vaccinations

510
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:47,775
Supreme Court

511
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:59,039
This would be like Garland

512
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:11,839
In 2016

513
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:28,223
I can't believe

514
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,503
Can't believe this

515
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,551
You know you want

516
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:35,903
People to find some Backbone in times of crisis

517
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,183
Just a little bit

518
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,999
From no one

519
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,727
Need

520
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:55,615
From the consequences of trump

521
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:06,623
Even worse

522
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,031
Interview scenarios

523
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,383
Himself

524
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:34,015
We need Trump

525
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,063
Used Supreme Court nomination

526
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,111
That you chose to make himself

527
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:44,767
It's not even making a lesser of two evils making an evil

528
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,703
Supreme Court

529
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:05,759
You know in the next 4 years

530
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
We might need

531
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:19,583
Bernie Sanders

532
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,039
As anything other than

533
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:43,391
F****** right-wing dingbats

534
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:48,511
Brave

535
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:54,911
4

536
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:01,823
It's one of those things where I think the right has to be a little disappointed in their dictator

537
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:06,943
Mussolini

538
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:12,575
They were they were evil dictators

539
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:19,231
Trump doesn't even know how to do barisan dictator

540
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:27,679
Where it's like you know how you

541
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:34,079
You made him good

542
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,383
Barnes about like

543
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,943
You know hey

544
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,831
What about you

545
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
So weak

546
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,743
This is just the weakest thing ever

547
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
What

548
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:09,311
Trump

549
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,871
Is Brentwood

550
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,431
How can you eat this much s***

551
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:20,575
This is so much eating this much s***

552
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:26,975
Tired

553
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:33,119
Yeah

554
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,871
Exactly

555
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:50,271
Alex is worried about going to jail Oregon

556
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,183
Position in the market

557
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:03,583
Surrounding Trump

558
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:09,983
You know

559
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:16,383
Over and over again probably true

560
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:34,815
God dammit

561
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:47,359
Really super viola

562
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,175
Shreveport doesn't matter

563
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,903
And this is it

564
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,463
Leave a little leftovers there

565
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,559
And then lick Trump's boots over and over and over again until maybe he uses

566
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,887
Smiles at you

567
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:48,543
But I don't know why

568
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:53,663
Disgraceful

569
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,943
Almost to like

570
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,503
I expect this

571
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,879
I expect them to pull out bowls

572
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,415
Trump flavored chips

573
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,231
And eat it in front of us because there's no bottom

574
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,023
But at the same time

575
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:12,863
How can anyone pull out of a trump flavored kit

576
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,143
And not be

577
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:20,543
Not have a problem continuing to

578
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:23,871
An argument for why somebody should not be nominated

579
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,687
As it's a great choice

580
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,711
Is a parrot

581
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:57,407
Ears

582
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:00,991
Or why it is parody is because he's

583
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:07,647
Literally saying you should vote for this guy because he's in appointing a Supreme Court Justice

584
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,439
Who's in favor of killing all of us

585
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:15,839
Who is

586
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:19,679
How do you estimate
