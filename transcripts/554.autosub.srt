Mayonnaise around this time of year

15
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,464

The game of baseball gloves

And we can get to do that last year and this year we just got

21
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,520
The tickets and we're going to a game

22
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,848
It feels so amazing so amazing

23
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,664
I'm I'm like shivering with excitement I can't wait

24
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272

The Pirates

27
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,624
Becomes a terrible this year so again

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,392
Who cares

29
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,208
All right they're probably going to lose

30
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Alright let's see what do I got

31
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,584
I guess I don't know what stuff this is sort of a hypothetical bright

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
Right spot alright I'm listening I think

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,936
Think I feel comfortable enough

34
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
To maybe try

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
To check outage

36
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,824
You know like it weird

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,432
Yeah yeah yeah that is where

38
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
I could feel comfortable whereas

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
Is going to look before

40
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
Certainly there was no ability to kind of space to the gym was

41
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
Nightmarish hellish

42
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
It was a little

43
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,792
Scary to see that level of

44
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
It was a

45
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:50,240
Passive manslaughters has worked out better than better than pads Advance Auto Parts

46
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,336
Certainly was not for lack of trying do I do if your responsibility going on it

47
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Did not care for it

48
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,664
I feel like it's about

49
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,992
I feel pretty good about that I always enjoy going to

50
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,320
The gym spring

Today we talked about April 30th

59
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,024
This is an unforced error on my part

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,424
Back I think so either of us

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,496
We're going to be covering the end of the week

62
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,872

I'm going

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
To give Rodger Stone

74
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Rodger

00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,887

76
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
Incriminating evidence

Nikki Rochester

80
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
A single word

81
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
And I will keep

82
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,855
Snapshots of offers of bribes to get a pardon

83
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,439

Beef a dog

88
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,727
I know it makes a white here's why it's so believable

89
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:03,615
Because everybody's so stupid

90
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
Nobody's doing anything like

91
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
Even a half-assed attempt

92
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,247
Googling how did not get

93
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
Arrested for these specific

94
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
The crimes would be like

95
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Don't give it to Rodger Stone

96
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,951
The part of it that makes it even more believable Zahn on

97
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
For me is that like

98
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
Here they have their app

99
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559

Sing apps delete the messages

101
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
And Rodger followed through with that

102
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
That's good

103
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,127
That came out of

104
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,943

00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
Troubling news

00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:17,055
Coming to you live from the infowars.com studios in the recapture

174
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,175
Joe

00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,575
I'm glad you responded that way cuz I couldn't tell if we've talked about that before or text me now

176
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
Okay

177
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,975
What did they recaptured I don't know it was occupied

178
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
Yes 41 Tire careers in occupied

179
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
Was liberated for awhile wasn't

180
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:49,567
I don't think so time where they were like state currently turning blue

181
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
I guess it's been real

182
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,015
Yeah maybe that's meant to be like recapture to buy democratic

183
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:03,135
I don't know I mean that. More latinx people are allowed to vote

184
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,743
Texas the more it is being recaptured from from the colonialists so that's nice

185
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
It was strange

186
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
I think I might have heard that before in the past but it's

187
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,447
It struck me as very new and I don't know what it's in reference to I

188
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
Alex

189
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,223
Start the show off with some Lana Del Rey

190
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
Allowed

191
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
No it's it's

192
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,135
It's more aggressive than the more

193
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
More

194
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,719
Symphonic movie Wednesday

195
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
But

196
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
It's too loud

197
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
And I did not mix

198
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
This well

199
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
Diner House downtown

200
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
Extremely honored

201
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,823
Call

202
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
Very small plant

203
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,991
Hurtling through space orbiting

204
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
Two-thirds of the way out of the spiral arm Milky Way go

205
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
There are 7 billion people on

206
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,047
Nebula see themselves as Guardians of the earth Guardians of the Galaxy

207
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
What

208
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,679
Poisoning dumbing-down

209
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
And then calling

210
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Human population

211
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,591
Sure

212
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
The EU has laws in place for the decade

213
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
Slaughterhouse

214
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,439
Anybody selling pardons for money. What do you got to say

215
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
And then you butcher it

216
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Drugs

217
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Radiation

218
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
Separating us from God

219
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
Gerardo

220
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
And then we'll be so stunned

221
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
So disease

222
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,271
So much in Bessemer I sleep

223
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
Brightburn

224
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Choppa Style

225
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Nicely

226
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
No it's totally super

227
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
Editor's

228
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
Ryan

229
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
I think I just heard

230
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Did Matt gaetz was going to

231
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:23,935
I don't know what you heard all I heard is just stuff you can just say no

232
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
No

233
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
I don't know what

234
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,799
Humane practices at slaughter houses have to do with

235
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
Cuz you got it in the slaughterhouse

236
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,455
No Country for Old Men that was a book

237
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,551
Anna movie I just I just hear Alex saying things that I just

238
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,367
Yeah

239
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
That's a

240
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,975
It's one of those things where somebody stealing time

241
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,559
Screw your delcamp

242
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,655
Or exactly what you were doing

243
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
Seems like you'll be talkin about the all of them crime

244
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
Just talking through it

245
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Just got to get through

246
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
In

247
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
2A

248
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
Possession

249
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
Total control

250
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
And that's what all of this is about

251
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
But you are the really huge

252
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
Issues

253
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
Everybody needs to be aware of

254
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
That is

255
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Many of us

256
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
Removing mice

257
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
Into a post

258
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Human

259
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
World man

260
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
Special Report just starts playing

261
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
Somebody

262
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
Somebody in there is I'm telling you Dad

263
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:54,815
When the music was too loud we've seen too many appropriate song Choices

264
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,823
I'm telling you there's a secret Patriot inside of

265
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,127
Studios the problem

266
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
Here's the problem it's bit like

267
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
The line but

268
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:16,063
Queen f****** with Alex and incompetence is indiscernible

269
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,159
I mean

270
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
Just up that moment

271
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
A real resin

272
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
Ignatius

273
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,727
This is how it is he's too tired to even get mad as how it was

274
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
How it was

275
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,591
How is going to be for the future. I love it

276
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:46,783
So Alex has a special report that he wants to play and it might have been that one that's different

277
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
Daily Sheriff

278
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
That up

279
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,559
Last night

280
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,143
Will you stay late tonight and tomorrow morning

281
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
And get out a report on this

282
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,239
That's because

283
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,799
Investigative journalist The Washington Post

284
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,639
That was two days ago

285
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
Didn't get any coverage

286
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
Because I know it's true that

287
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
Which is true which is huge

288
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,743
I have this come out in

289
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
If we can force the story out

290
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,863
This is really

291
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,679
Devastate the New World Order their whole operation

292
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
The recently Rogan hunting

293
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
An episode we talked to a guy named Josh Rogan

294
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
R o g i n

295
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,847
Not really

296
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
As a reporter who works for the Washington

297
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Post

298
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,271
I watch the relevant part of the interview and I don't find it too

299
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
3 super convincing

300
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,367
That said Josh was explaining to Rogan wife

301
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,463
The theory that the virus started

302
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
Completely crazy

303
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:04,095
He doesn't prove or even claim definitively that he has information to talk to you or the lab is

304
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Is responsible for the outbreak

305
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,959
He's just reiterating information that's been widely publicly discussed

306
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
Over

307
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
The entire life

308
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Substantial evidence

309
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
Makes people think that I got loose from a lab

310
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,687
There's some circumstantial evidence that makes it look like the virus was naturally occurring

311
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,271
That's not even a new or controversial thing to say

312
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
It's just

313
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
Generally

314
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
Experts who looked at it

315
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,183
Feel very natural explanation is far more likely

316
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,535
Yeah I know there was like two weeks ago there was another story where it's like

317
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
DOD cam

318
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:40,959
Rule out the possibility of course not they're bunch of really really hard

319
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
The binary possibility right-hand you prove the affirmative

320
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
Very difficult and so

321
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
Obviously

322
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
People who died

323
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
They're talking about this seriously

324
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
Deal with it

325
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
Only unserious people would be like

326
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,391
There is no possible way I

327
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
Clara pot

328
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:07,839
Create of their opposition

329
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
Another opposition to argue again

330
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
So just kind of seems like a little bit of a dick

331
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,983
Only because

332
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
I don't believe

333
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
He's unaware of what he's doing

334
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
Like he's not some guy on his first

335
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,151
Recipe renzi's a guy with a career in Media

336
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:27,807
He knows what he's doing is lending The credibility of his mainstream media credentials to be used exactly how Alex's using this clip on

337
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Show now

338
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Unless Josh had some

339
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
Some actual evidence of

340
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Of anything

341
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,463
The behavior he displayed in that interview was at best

342
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
Irresponsible

343
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,303
This next clip from Alex's show which is complete

344
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Bulshit

345
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
Is the direct result

346
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
Of that kind of yours

347
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Possibility

348
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,983
Bombshell Friday live Washington Post medication

349
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,311
That's falchi behind Wuhan leaks and he's the main suspect

350
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,639
So now it's turned into a Washington Post investigation

351
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,479
She is the main suspect in there getting rid of that getting

352
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:01,343
Wolf say I mean all you've done is create

353
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,463
Proven by the conversation that happens with Rogan

354
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,535
What what extra do they bring to the table other than

355
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
Surname Washington

356
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
Didn't post report

357
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,143
That's what they bring to it

358
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,935
Embassy Washington

359
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,007
Logan gets caught

360
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
Not introducing a new idea that like

361
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,127
There is a slight possibility

362
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,199
There was a lab origin

363
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,991
Not that that's not new

364
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
It's normalizing

365
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Conclusion

366
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
That it was

367
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Stop from a lab

368
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
No excuse just irresponsible and I just don't believe

369
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,743
It's somebody who could have the level of career that

370
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
He does

371
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,119
Would be able to go on Rogan and not recognize that your behavior would be interpreted by lit

372
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Listeners that way

373
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Well I mean

374
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
In that

375
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
Situation there's two things

376
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
He's going on

377
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,311
One if you have any credibility that you've

378
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,871
Built up through being a reporter of any kind of

379
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,967
And you go Ian Infowars or Rogan or whatever

380
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,783
They're there to steal your credibility

381
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
They don't give a fuk about

382
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
Your credibility is what they

383
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
They're stealing so they

384
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
I can do that

385
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
And you're there

386
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
To get

387
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Attention

388
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:18,143
What's the deal maybe sell something you're selling

389
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,191
When you're a reporter for the washer

390
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,543
Post if you don't know that you're there to sell something in there they're too

391
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
To steal your credibility

392
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,591
Your

393
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Stupid

394
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Like that's

395
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Beyond The Pale

396
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
Cuz that's the only reason you would go

397
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
Not because Jose fun

398
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,599
No no no cuz Jose such a good to Jamie's

399
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,903
He's a cool dude I don't even know anything about

400
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,439
Never heard of her to Google

401
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,767
Alex

402
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
From across the pond

403
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
Who pays a visit on this episode

404
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,375
Paul Joseph Watson

405
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Sure

406
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Play this is

407
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,751
Is really just all about the anti-muslim agitation

408
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
I was Wonder

409
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Oh boy

410
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,383
Take a picture of stuff so what

411
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
What

412
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
We are

413
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
Call Frank tomorrow

414
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
London is London Stan

415
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
Okay so

416
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
Is the game

417
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
To the UK and the rest of Europe

418
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
In the world

419
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
We need to stand with the French people

420
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
They're good people

421
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,703
Whole thing is essentially that extreme

422
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
Sense of anti-muslim

423
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,543
Programming it's pretty it's pretty

424
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,847
Just geograph

425
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,919
How could France be the Gateway

426
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
The Chunnel

427
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,855
Is that the channel from France to England

428
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
Gateway

429
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,927
For Europe

430
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,951
Like France

431
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,743
Like if you're looking at a map of Europe

432
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
Right right

433
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,863
And you got the whole year up there sometime

434
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,751
For the Gate Park

435
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Africa

436
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
That's what is it

437
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Creole

438
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,127
Real eels real

439
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,407
Does that argument

440
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
Scarier

441
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,247
Cuz it's not throw it away there's 50

442
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,575
10 countries between them and the gateway to London

443
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,976
What's going on here is that there was an open letter that got published

444
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
In France

445
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
That was about

446
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
The fear of

447
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
The Muslims

448
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
Well this is a no

449
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,080
Noises from

450
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
Military personnel

451
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
General

452
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,272
Warning about the situation on the

453
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,576
Edges of the suburbs of major cities

454
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Lacrosse

455
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
Do you have this

456
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Parallel Society

457
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,632
Bye-bye is completely undermined the

458
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,680
The French government

459
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,240
Essentially what government

460
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:08,128
First of all Alex's entire libertarian identities based on the rejection of the state have in Monopoly on power

461
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,712
The entire reason that the Second Amendment so important is that if the populist

462
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
Can be armed

463
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
The state can't Attain

464
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
Complete Monopoly of 4

465
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
So weird here bald

466
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Be concerned about

467
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,392
Rex for the Monopoly of power of the

468
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
The French

469
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
That's why strange

470
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:29,120
Yeah anyways this open letter that Paul is talking about wasn't insane letter that was published

471
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,936
The far-right magazine called valuers actuality

472
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
Hi in French

473
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,824
Interesting Lee was published on the exact 60th anniversary of a failed

474
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
Coup attempt against

475
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
Charles de Gaulle

476
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,968
Back in 1961 the idea of allowing Algeria to enjoy self

477
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
Determination was put to a vote

478
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,320
And Algerian Independence won the day overwhelmingly

479
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,624
Naturally many former generals / 2

480
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
Particularly those in

481
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
Algeria didn't like this

482
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
Suneva sided to form a hunter

483
00:22:54,464 --> 00:23:00,608
And tried to take over major cities in Algeria

484
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:09,056
Didn't work out for these generals but it did lead to many of them forming a group known as the organization Army sick

485
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,872
Which was a terrorist group and a destabilizing

486
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,408
Situation Algeria

487
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,712
In order to maintain French Colonial rule

488
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
Because what

489
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
Needs to eat so you want

490
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,880
The government of Algeria to not having the Monopoly on power

491
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
Make sense

492
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,768
So it seems like this may be more than a coincidence

493
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:33,376
Set this letter warning of an Insurrection was published on the anniversary of a failed insurrection

494
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
Aimed at maintaining archaic

495
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,752
Particularly when you read that one of their stated

496
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
Complaints about various

497
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,312
Anti-racism group

498
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,872
Is it they want to tear down statues of famous French

499
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
Colonialist

500
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,712
It's a little bit

501
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
It's a little bit I grow

502
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:55,392
That does sound a little bit like a memorializing the day mishma tried to over

503
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:01,792
Overthrow Japan nice little letter like Emperor Hirohito was pretty great I don't know if you guys remember that guy's pretty

504
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:07,424
Naturally noted fascist Marine Le Pen has voiced support for the letter and it said signers

505
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,824
Which is very clearly a part of her push towards running again in next year's election

506
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Against macron

507
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
So

508
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
Good

509
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
Hey

510
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
Hey you know

511
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
With

512
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
This is just a Muslim

513
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,880
All I know is that you admit

514
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,184
Doubling 10 years ago Christian persecution

515
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,792
Anywhere in the world the Muslims are killing you including

516
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:40,448
Paul Joseph Watson about what's coming next day with us there are very legitimate issues about

517
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
Persecution around the world

518
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,872
Recognize that org

519
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,920
To deny that or minimize it

520
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,456
The answer is not

521
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,504
Oppressing Muslims

522
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,808
No it's not that

523
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,856
Turning it around

524
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
Okay

525
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
Okay now I see what you

526
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,256
And when you say that you think what we're going to do is we're going to break the

527
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
The cycle of violence

528
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,120
Have you considered though that on the other side of that

529
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
Cycle we're the ones

530
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
I'm committing file

531
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,568
So like as long as we die before the cycle turns around again I will I will say that the

532
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
Depending on which side you're on

533
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,432
Feels very different but it's still bad

534
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,456
Yes

535
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
What is it

536
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,296
Is kind of becoming a

537
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
The thesis of mine

538
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
Overtime

539
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Xavier

540
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Repeated

541
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
Over and over and over again by people

542
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,048
In the Infowars fear is that I think one of those

543
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
Characterizing

544
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Elements

545
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Of what makes

546
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
These people in this world

547
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,264
Is an inability or an unwillingness to recognize the difference

548
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
Between fiction and real

549
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
That it's

550
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Just

551
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
Something is

552
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
Inability

553
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
Yeah

554
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
Think that's the

555
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:04,672
Or maybe maybe not unwillingness so much as all of the incentives

556
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
Bush tour

557
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
Why deal with

558
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
The incentives are towards

559
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
Believing in false reality

560
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
So why would you

561
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,680
You go back to real reality you have to get like a regular job

562
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,032
Alex isn't going to just like bad groceries

563
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
It's not just Alex I mean it's Paul

564
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,688
Find French author in intellectual

00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
I have the Charlie hebdo Massacre

567
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
And he predict

568
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
Muslim Community

569
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,280
Friends

570
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,376
Isis literally puts out

571
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
Festo

572
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,936
But I can make an alliance with the

573
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
I also hate

574
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
Joey Bosa

575
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Warning the

576
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,944
Beacon traxsolutions moles would be in a Muslim

577
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
Thanks power

578
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,088
Compromises to get it all under control

579
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,648
So this book by Michelle

580
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
Started predict

581
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,488
It's not even a nun

582
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
It's a novel that

583
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
Resent a fictional future

584
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,400
Weather socialist and a Muslim Brotherhood political party

585
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,192
Set band together to resist the rising

586
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,496
Empower from the extreme right-wing

587
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
National

588
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,592
Right that's the plot of one of the driving forces of

589
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
The plot of this

590
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:32,736
Fiction novel novel there's a right-wing government suppressed

591
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,320
Sing everybody the type that somebody like Paul Joseph Watson would appreciate

592
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,856
And then they banned

593
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,648
Together the Muslim Brotherhood in the left

594
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
Until Paul is taking

595
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
That as a no

596
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
Attack on the

597
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
Real world right way

598
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,560
I don't I look

599
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
Some people inside the book itself

600
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
To be like fairly islamophobic and

601
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,496
Some troubling tropes but I'm not really entirely sure cuz I have

602
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
Read it I just read a

603
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
Description of the plot

604
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,640
I do know though unlike Paul Joseph Watson that this is a novel

605
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
Not a prediction

606
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,200
Things to come like

607
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
This dude looked in

608
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,320
The gods I like Alex claims to

609
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
This Saturday

610
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
Vision of the few

611
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,184
Future

612
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,000
That kind of it so you're telling me that it's a novel

613
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Right

614
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
Pulses

615
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
Okay but

616
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
If you're right

617
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,984
That means that all those dragonlance novels I read when I was younger aren't going to come true oh no

618
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Jordan

619
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
I bet

620
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
No

621
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:35,456
Happened in the past

622
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,808
That's not the future That's History

623
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,880
So Paul is

624
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
Just a real Realty

625
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Piece of garbage

626
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
The French government literally

627
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
Before the first coronavirus lockdown

628
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
The ministry theme

629
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
Interior

630
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,656
And said that it shouldn't be enforced in these migrant

631
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
So again

632
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,544
Blissfully creating a separate Lowell weather

633
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,336
Enforcement the lockdown.

634
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,616
Oppression imposed

635
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Is north

636
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,504
You can hear Paul's angle on this story which

637
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,344
She's a poor migrant communities are being Exempted from the Draconian in fascist

638
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,904
Accruals that the white man of Europe were being subject

639
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Higher class

640
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
The people to the global

641
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:24,352
Interesting Lee there's another side to the story and that is the one based in reality where the

642
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
Particularly in France

643
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,680
Allocate funds

644
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
To provide assistance to

645
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
Poor migrant community

646
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,056
Nongovernmental organizations were working to advocate for

647
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,616
Establishment of mobile clinics near areas where migrants

648
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,664
Camp but their appeals generally went on

649
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
John heard

650
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
The accommodation of people experiencing homeless

651
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
Tragic at the beginning

652
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,064
The pandemic and they're still serious issues now

653
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,416
You can see how Paul is rewriting governmental negligence toward the vulnerable population

654
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,976
It's actually secretly being them getting favorable

655
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
That sucks

656
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,096
Also how do you

657
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:00,704
How do you force a hawk a stay-at-home order to people who experience a coma

658
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
What are you even talking

659
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:07,360
I don't know if there's anything more right-wing then

660
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
Having

661
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,944
White people ignore immigrants

662
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,736
And then blaming

663
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,904
Yep that's the right way up to

664
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
Play Sabaton.

665
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,768
Spell Alex drop something that I thought was really

666
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
Really interesting

667
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,328
Confused me

668
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
A lot

669
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,680
Hot potato salad

670
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
ABC Australia

671
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
That

672
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,592
You will get your freedom when you have your vaccine

673
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,920
The moment of freedom for you is when you get your vaccine

674
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,456
These are the quotes everywhere

675
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
And it gets even crazier

676
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,064
Top scientist epidemiologist you never coming out today

677
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,856
Yale medical doctors

678
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,184
Hospital

679
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
Telling people

680
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
We predicted that hear it

681
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
It is ladies and

682
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,960
Like your freedom comes when you get the vaccine

683
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:09,056
Somebody on a talking head show that was

684
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,616
Discussing how some people are not motivated

685
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
Goodbye the idea that you can

686
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:19,808
Text other people by getting vaccinated maybe appeal to people selfishness of getting people

687
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
Go to recognize the

688
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
Getting up

689
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:26,720
And I understand what this person saying I also think it's a misguided perspective by

690
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
I don't think

691
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,536
Think they're taking the advice

692
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,584
One person on CNBC

693
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
As if it's V

694
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
Google Alexa

695
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:38,752
Global position of enemy faction

696
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,824
I do but it's up to

697
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
People should take

698
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,128
The things that I say in

699
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,712
Extrapolate them and put them upon every single person

700
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:54,112
It's a little silly over and over again

701
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,720
It doesn't prove any point yeah that's annoying but I have no idea

702
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:02,816
Statistical majority people who are hospitalized now or their due to the effects

703
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
Sexy not from covid

704
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,656
And because he's not providing a source there's nothing I can

705
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Can do with that

706
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,496
I would I would argue that if that were true

707
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,568
That would be the biggest news in the history of ever

708
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
I can

709
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,616
Jordan tell you that

710
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
55 and older

711
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,088
Divisor and moderna vaccines were 94% effective at preventing hospitalization

712
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:25,856
Which is

713
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,696
Produces day. Be happy to look at it but

714
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,488
At this point all available information

715
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,512
Asian points

716
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
The exact opposite

717
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
Set Direction

718
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,656
Yeah especially considering how sensationalized it is whenever things don't

719
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
Work

720
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,520
It's like you just said oh it's 94% effective at

721
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
Stopping hospitalization

722
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:50,176
But how many times have we read an article that says that but only but instead of saying 94

723
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
Affected they like

724
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,784
6000 people in the hospital now because of vaccines

725
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,344
And then you're like out of how many

726
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,624
You know I got it

727
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,928
You guys suck at

728
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
If that were true

729
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,304
Imagine how the sensationalized news world report that ship

730
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,472
Everyone dying

731
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:17,312

00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,024
But we are we mentioned it

740
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048

How to get everyone to go another guy he wouldn't let people into

743
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,384
A bunch of

744
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,432
Complaints about them having

745
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224

Talk to you about

00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,768
That's what you become a preacher

00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
But I wanted

754
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248

CA was on Monday

759
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,352

760
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,424

00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
He said he's going to go

762
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,056
Places like Walmart

763
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,176
It's kind of interesting I'm not sure

764
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,224
Based on this interview if he's

765
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,624
Saying that he's going to do this like go preach at a Walmart on April 27th the last time he was on

766
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
Alex said

767
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
You've got to

768
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
Walmart's field

769
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
Bacon

770
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
My parents

771
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,632
The church

772
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
Because that's against the law.

773
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,240
I can go with my church with my friend

774
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
Do Ikea and have a

775
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:27,360
Walmart

776
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:33,248
Say you're going go in and then hold a church service there you'll be allowed to question they'll throw you out that be great

777
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
Great stunts

778
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:39,392
The reality is that this preacher has taken out

779
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
What is advice for a stomach bug

780
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,536
A couple days prior

781
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:50,144
Yeah I remember my favorite parts of the Bible where where where when

782
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,960
Jesus got ideas from the devil in the devil is like man

783
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
You should really try that out that's great

784
00:35:54,752 --> 00:36:00,896
I remember there was a couple chapters that really stuck out to me when I was a kid a Bible

785
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,456
I will study about God making dang

786
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,992
Dank memes totally total

787
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Absolutely

788
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
Absolutely

789
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
So this Preacher Man

790
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,464
I don't I don't care for the way this guy thinks

791
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
Inspectors received

792
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
Permission

793
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,352
From a judge

794
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
To use any Force necessary

795
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,776
This story is no

796
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,336
7 billion names

797
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
They have found a judge

798
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,456
That is a family of Bill Gates I don't know

799
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,504
David Gates the judge here in Calgary

800
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
What

801
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
What

802
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,112
7 billion

803
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
Upser

804
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,440
Grow up

805
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,256
There are not

806
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
Dad we have had to reuse a few

807
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,448
Is it can I lose Jasper 900,000

808
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,008
The health department guy

809
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,056
To enter his church

810
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,360
And

811
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,640
The person who signed it was gate

812
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
What

813
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
What are the odds

814
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,296
Probably zero and critical incident

815
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,880
You know I'd like if I was in it at church and I heard him

816
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Just go like

817
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,208
And it's the same last name is Bill Gates

818
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,864
What is that tell you I be like oh no I guess religion is fake you personally are so

819
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
Go stupid

820
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,912
I don't believe

821
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,960
Believe in God anymore in my faith

822
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,312
You're too dumb no

823
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:39,712
To be re-evaluated you're suggesting that all people named gates are related even if it's just for fun

824
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,272
Still crazy

825
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552
So Alex and this dude

826
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,368
They get to

827
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,160
Discussing how the left right the last

828
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,440
So it's us

829
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Is there using

830
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
The budget

831
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,120
Jordan order to get the police to attack

832
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,168
That's what's going on

833
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,240
Why are the police so happy in your area

834
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,776
And in other areas

835
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,312
I will other churches to put

836
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
Fences up around

837
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
Soviet Russia

838
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,736
Because the mayor that homosexual

839
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
The police

840
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,368
20 million dollars

841
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,952
And then after about 2 I should get

842
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,888
What the police shutting down churches

843
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
Not stopping

844
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,984
That's exactly what

845
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
Right now

846
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
Hoobly

847
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,848
If that is on the table I will absolutely hold the police officer

848
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,640
That is on the table

849
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:47,040
Somebody let me hold the police hostage I will do it right f****** now just a little bit though

850
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
I was on the table

851
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
Are you got these

852
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
This

853
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,184
This guy

854
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
He's worried about

855
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:54,976
Zone

856
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:59,072
Don't repeat what he said about the

857
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:03,936
Yeah yeah we're all worried

858
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
Destroyed

859
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
I think that's

860
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,032
My biggest fear

861
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,080
You don't ask yourself question that is

862
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,616
When you going to rise up

863
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,920
I mean Wednesday

864
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
Where are you

865
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
You going to rise up

866
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,368
Never going again this until people say no

867
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,928
That's right

868
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,464
What we know about bullies

869
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,280
Stop bullying until

870
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
You stop the bullying and that's for the day

871
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Get out no

872
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
Get out

873
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,008
For the New York Times and Homeland Security

874
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
Prices for Christian

875
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
Vaccine

876
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
You're off.

877
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
Program

878
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
See what I'm saying

879
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,296
More people

880
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
Then

881
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
Virus

882
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,880
Hoo-boy

883
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
Whataburger

884
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,256
I don't know what are we going to have I don't know it sucks

885
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
The very interesting perspective

886
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,840
Deceived

887
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,400
Actually I think the only thing that I really find it

888
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,192
Nothing about this is how how much it may

889
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
Make sense like

890
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
Alex started

891
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,056
They sort of their closing down all the

892
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,592
These churches get with the grace life

893
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,920
Iran from Rebel news

894
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,968
And she wouldn't go along with his like

895
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:24,064
Everyone needs to calm right right alright and I don't think I was fun for all

896
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,392
No so now he's found Artur pawlowski

897
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:31,232
Yahoo is like everybody got a rise up

898
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,840
I don't need any of your Rebel media reporting bulshit I want to stoke

899
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:40,704
Plastic terrorist I think that this guy is exactly what I was

900
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,312
Totally talking about the grace Life Church

901
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
This guy is

902
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,408
Exactly what Alex wants

903
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,200
So apparently

904
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
Alex gets a lot of emails

905
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
About

906
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
Big medical news

907
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
That

908
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,088
Never

909
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:03,488
Never really makes it to the show and actually I think that's good because they would just be anecdotal stories that show who would be meaningless

910
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
Our email is full of.

911
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:11,168
Doctors and lawyers and teachers and nurses

912
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,008
Where they are giving people shot and people are dropping dead

913
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
The vaccination centers

914
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,104
It's not just from the Kobe shot

915
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,408
Show me the flu shot for killing a bunch of people

916
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
Going on here

917
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,992
Yes yes we knew.

918
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,528

Becky wants to eliminate 6

920
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,368
A billion people

921
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
Now I got

922
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,208
Issuing

924
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
Got the rights of freedom

925
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
We know something is going on at Grisham

926
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,352
As always being

927
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,144
In opposition to genocide

928
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,008

930
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,407
Please send all the proof

931
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943

935
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:10,815
Yeah man I really don't think that I would like my Christian preacher adding a little

936
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:14,655
Georgia guidestone in there every now and again you know you don't people added

The kind of guy though who's not going to be.

941

Christchurch

945
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,487
That's exactly that's why tomorrow I'm opening the church

946
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,559
Tomorrow I'm going to be preaching

947
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,607
Let the whole world see what is

948
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
Happening

949
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
Contra virus

950
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,263
And at least let there be thousands of people with

951
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,127
Tell us what time and where

952
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,431
Website as well

953
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,503
Interesting Lee Orchard have his services

954
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
Next day on this Saturday

955
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,831
How to get pigs and go well

956
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,391
I'll just be here from an article in the Calgary Herald

957
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:14,303
Community members living on living near Street Church say preacher Artur pawlowski and his followers of threat

958
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,327
Brighton neighborhood violin

959
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,607
After speaking out

960
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,423
Against the congregation to disregard for public health measures

961
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,495
And their hateful rhetoric always been against

962
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,823
Violence

963
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
From this article

964
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,151
Our neighbors here have been threatened

965
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,735
For at least seven weeks by these anti-maskers were violating Health regulations

966
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,015
And it's spreading messages of hate

967
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,319
Said Michelle Robinson who lives in the neighborhood

968
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:40,671
Is a very similar thing to what happened after the big uproar surrounding

969
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
Grace Life Church

970
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,743
H2

971
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:48,863
People did show up there and who knows who was because of the Rebel news reporting order

972
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,911
Some bloggers Alex who knows exactly

973
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
But

974
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:57,055
Elizabeth Simmons the deputy director of the Canadian anti-hate Network told CTV this

975
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,335
After quota monitoring

976
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
The crowd

977
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,431
It would be accurate to say that the event attract

978
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,271
Conspiracy minded individuals for sure

979
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
This is important to understand

980
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,135
There's a reason why Alex is trying to ramp up in height and

981
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,927
The tension surrounding churches that refused

982
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
Cooperate with public health measures

983
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,535
This isn't intentional strategy meant to create a stand

984
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,327
That will lead to a galvanizing moment

985
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
For the extreme right

986
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,959
Business super dangerous situation even if it doesn't escalate any further

987
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,263
The neighbors of this church are having to deal with it

988
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,543
Incredibly unfair Circa

989
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,591
Come stand assistant preacher

990
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,127
Clothing is a creating a

991
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,663
The Powder Keg in their front lawn

992
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,455
Like it's just inappropriate

993
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:42,367
I need to I need to understand that this is an intentional thing whether or not Alex is sitting there with a whiteboard

994
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,671
Trying to dry out how to create

995
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
A martyr

996
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,999
Conflagration

997
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:52,351
Put a billion I'm putting a million-dollar bounty on whoever

998
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,887
Can start a holy war

999
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:54,911
It is

1000
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,191
He's trying to ramp up

1001
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,007
Pretensions that would lead in that direction and hoping

1002
00:44:59,263 --> 00:44:59,775
Cooking for the worst

1003
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,823
Yeah well I mean whiteness didn't work

1004
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,127
Working America so let's try religion in Canada

1005
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
Think is what he's trying to do

1006
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,687
It's

1007
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
It's pretty upsetting and I

1008
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,015
I hope for

1009
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,831
You know all these these situations

1010
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,599
Navigate

1011
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,647
Delicately

1012
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,671
Good luck

1013
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,207
So Alex

1014
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
It's done with this dude

1015
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
And take it back to the news

1016
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
Hugo

1017
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
F****** bombshell

1018
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:30,239
Are butterflies

1019
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:34,335
I'm working on for a while

1020
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,103
About

1021
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,919
9 minutes out

1022
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,831
May 2021

1023
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,695
Spring 2021

1024
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,047
Or just break

1025
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
Total proof

1026
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,607
Joe Biden has dementia

1027
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
Handle

1028
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,031
Wally has eventually stole the election

1029
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
It's just unbelievable

1030
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,919
So I've so many guess I'm going to have time to Arizona show today

1031
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
Really

1032
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:17,599
Do you have proof weiwei video that prove

1033
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,391
Does Joe Biden both has dementia

1034
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,439
And stole the election

1035
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,975
But you don't have time to

1036
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,767
No time to time

1037
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,815
I got a proof of it

1038
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,607
Fasting

1039
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,375
We have

1040
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,911
Perhaps the most

1041
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
Piece of proof

1042
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,471
Of the 21st

1043
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,335
The game is being played here is Detroit Drive traffic to his website

1044
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
Yeah that's

1045
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,455
Videos of this isn't worth his time on the actual show

1046
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,735
You do IUI

1047
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,295
What one thing that people haven't really gotten

1048
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
Me with yet is

1049
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,367
Why I should care if Joe Biden

1050
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
You know like

1051
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
I kind of

1052
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,511
Don't care if their Weekend at Bernie's in

1053
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
Him

1054
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,327
Right like so far

1055
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,375
It's it's like I don't want them on Ark

1056
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,447
I don't want a president whose

1057
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,287
Doing all of that stuff fine if he's dead

1058
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:13,663
I'm fine if he's dead and they've got him enough like a scarecrow stick figure thing behind

1059
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:18,271
I'm out and deep faking his speeches I'm fine with the I feel like

1060
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
You speak

1061
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
For at least

1062
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,343
The segment of the population

1063
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,135
I think we should get some polling on that

1064
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:28,511
He think everybody would be fine if you're just weakened it burned as they don't know what the temperature of the country is

1065
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:32,863
Will be fine with a Weekend at Bernie's president

1066
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:38,751
We'll see we'll see it let's put it up put it out on Twitter pull out

1067
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
So anyway back

1068
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
Statistic

1069
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
Sorry sir

1070
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
Do you know about statistics

1071
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
Bombshell

1072
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,479
60% of new covid patients are

1073
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Vaccinate

1074
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,807
Harvey rice

1075
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,367
Medical doctor

1076
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,183
On new patients diagnosed with Coronavirus

1077
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,975
More than half have been vaccinated

1078
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,559
Having autoimmune disease that they're having allergic responses

1079
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,863
And the hospital's retold Paulette covid

1080
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,655
Course they test positive

1081
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,959
Because the PCR test is set up

1082
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Just like

1083
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,007
Terra Nostra

1084
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,311
About to drop a little bit of a

1085
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,127
Specific piece of information I can tell you what he's talking about

1086
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:22,783
He almost certainly just saw this in a meme that was going around on social media now it says no idea who Harvey righteous or

1087
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
Where that quote

1088
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
Comes from

1089
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,135
It turns out that it was from an interview that Rice did on

1090
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,671
Bannon podcast

1091
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,695
I swear you said quote

1092
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:34,047
What clinicians are telling me is more than half of the new covid cases they're seeing

1093
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,071
How to treat

1094
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,351
Is people who've been vaccinated

1095
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,655
They've estimated 60% of new page

1096
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,215
Since they've been treating have been people who have been vax

1097
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,007
This is

1098
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,823
Best secondhand estimations base

1099
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,175
Presumably on anecdotal information being thrown around on Steve bannon's podcast

1100
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,967
A lot more trustworthy than

1101
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
Data

1102
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,831
According to the CDC as of April 20th there were 7150

1103
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,135
87 reported cases of people who are vaccinated

1104
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,415
Who still contracted

1105
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Covid

1106
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:05,791
That's out of 87 million people who have been vaccinated so that is not really that's

1107
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,583
Surprising of a number

1108
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,423
A CNN article from earlier in April had to

1109
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,447
Figure at approximately

1110
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,495
5800 breakthrough cases

1111
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,799
Of which only 396

1112
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,847
To those required hospitalization suit

1113
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,383
Hard to believe

1114
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
That these numbers could be

1115
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Accurate

1116
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,247
It's tough whenever you're working on numbers that are such a

1117
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,807
Huge scale because what we should be saying is

1118
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:34,719
396 only 396 needed hospitalization we have Miracles we make me Rich

1119
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,535
We create Miracles and all this

1120
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,559
God bullshittin

1121
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
You keep talking about

1122
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:45,471
Is insane because only 370 think we need ice

1123
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:50,335
Cp2 make a song about this

1124
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:56,735
So the numbers do not match up unless there's more than a second-hand story being told on Bannen

1125
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,527
Broadcast I'm just going to ignore this

1126
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,831
But it's important to recognize that

1127
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,367
This is the level of backing

1128
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,183
Can go to claim needs to have for Alex to take it as gospel

1129
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,231
As long as it lines up with a narrative

1130
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,023
He's currently profiting off of

1131
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,327
The only thing that really matters

1132
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,375
Is that all about

1133
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
Podcast

1134
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,447
Regardless of whether or not

1135
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,239
Previously was

1136
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,799
A very respected Yale medical doctor

1137
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
The moment you go on

1138
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Steve Bannon

1139
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,687
Very and respected are removed from my baby

1140
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:29,503
Vocabulary jail also published something

1141
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:33,599
Nephew number of months back in August that was like

1142
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,879
Critiquing

1143
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,695
And the denouncing his

1144
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:41,535
Fervent support for hydroxychloroquine Isaiah covid cure

1145
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,327
Yeah yeah I'll put out a look at this f******

1146
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,631
An a****** sorry

1147
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,399
Weather Reno

1148
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:49,727
So Alex believes that vaccines are going to be mandatory

1149
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,287
Man he says something I think is really weird

1150
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,591
Once they get

1151
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,503
But you wouldn't do it so they're still covid-19

1152
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,295
What makes a computer

1153
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,647
I know when you died the other viruses are things are actually releasing

1154
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,999
6 months from now

1155
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
2 years from now

1156
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,871
Humans will probably die in 6 months

1157
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,175
And I are in a month

1158
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
Humans

1159
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,503
That's math

1160
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,575
Transitive property of Fire

1161
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,367
A human dies in 6 months a year

1162
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,415
I hate you I hate you so much

1163
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,695
What you doing

1164
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,231
I hate you so much

1165
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:48,863
I hate you so much damn talk to you. I hate you

1166
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
You

1167
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,167
Yeah Alex

1168
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:56,799
Can say that you were supposed to keep me away from that s*** no because it's important to recognize that.

1169
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:00,383
He thinks dog years are literal

1170
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:04,479
That takes your breath away

1171
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,319
Yeah if a dog dies in a so he thinks that

1172
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,623
When we talked about dog years when I just talked

1173
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
About relative

1174
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,183
Have time that's banned for life

1175
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:16,767
He thinks that we literally mean that's the only way I can make that

1176
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:20,351
Approach this from a number of different Direct

1177
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,119
Because

1178
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:24,447
I don't know if he knows this but different animals have different biology

1179
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,727
Nope not true

1180
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:32,127
Everybody either toxic 27

1181
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,407
All Creatures some respond

1182
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,711
Animals have

1183
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527
It's just timing

1184
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,343
I want

1185
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,671
I just can't today I just can't real good

1186
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,463
It's 80s

1187
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,231
Good stuff

1188
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,767
There's something admirable

1189
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047
About a man

1190
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,351
Who can so consistently say something

1191
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,143
That floors me

1192
00:52:54,911 --> 00:53:01,055
Yeah and confidently and he repeated us multiple examples of how animals have different life

1193
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
Multiple examples

1194
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,871
Of the same wrong

1195
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,895
Example that may

1196
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663
Makes no sense

1197
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,199
Good stuff

1198
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,247
So

1199
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:12,575
His remarks

1200
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
For Congress

1201
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,135
I need mentioned something

1202
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,159
To the effect of white

1203
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,439
White supremacy is Terrorism

1204
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
And

1205
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,023
Alex and Ani

1206
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:26,655
This just went up on infowars.com I told you this was coming yesterday nobody else was talking about it with your buddy

1207
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
They told you

1208
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,055
Who's bad

1209
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,919
White supremacist

1210
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,111
To be clear I don't think

1211
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
I would say

1212
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,159
Support any new laws

1213
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,231
For domestic terrorism

1214
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,303
That the idea of taking white

1215
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,863
Supremacy seriously as a terrorist

1216
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
6th right

1217
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,703
Is something that is a long overdue

1218
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,495
It is also not surprising why

1219
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,263
Tucker and Alex

1220
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:08,383
Where are the people on the Vanguard of their attire

1221
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,151
You know

1222
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,687
Their money is made by white

1223
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
Victimhood

1224
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:18,367
Yeah your best bet there for them is like it's a slippery slope argument but even then

1225
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,671
You're arguing for white to Prattville

1226
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
Like DIA

1227
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,767
That's what you guys are doing you're not

1228
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
Cuz it don't pointer they like

1229
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,887
Well what we should do is focus on the extreme Elements of Life

1230
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,679
None of that

1231
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:36,287
None of that is like it you're talking about white people I will kill you it's really

1232
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,311
Interesting that you say that

1233
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,335
Because I think it even because

1234
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:43,199
Becomes more clear and figures on the issue

1235
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,527
Adam Schiff

1236
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,575
The rest of the Chinese spies on his committee

1237
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,303
Predominant

1238
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,631
Nationalist

1239
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,655
Broccoli

1240
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,447
Because

1241
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,727
Politically

1242
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,775
But some of the folks are part

1243
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,079
We have to stop there really quick

1244
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,359
Because I think that Alex

1245
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,919
Just tried to Divine white nationalist as just

1246
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,455
Not global

1247
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,735
That's not good

1248
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
No

1249
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:22,623
No I don't believe that he doesn't know that that is a compound noun that is

1250
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:26,975
Specific meaning problem there are some people like

1251
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,767
It was one of them

1252
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,815
We Believe doesn't know what white nationalism

1253
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,911
He thinks he's a nationalist who happens to be white

1254
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:39,263
And that makes you understand

1255
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
Alex

1256
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:40,799
Does

1257
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,079
Died do not confuse

1258
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,615
Discuss

1259
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,895
Ideas

1260
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,991
Couching that there is the opposite of global

1261
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,783
That's a problem

1262
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,087
Yeah yeah that is interesting because

1263
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,391
Dave is astonishingly stupid

1264
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,439
Yeah but Alex is stupid

1265
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
Astonishing

1266
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,743
Yeah

1267
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
I want to say

1268
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,655
Giada CIA

1269
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,983
Cyndaquil team

1270
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,263
What's that mean

1271
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,543
Is it

1272
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,175
It is the Twilight of our Republic it is

1273
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:22,527
That's not that's not necessarily what that means

1274
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:28,671
To be clear what's going on is that Alex's defending white supremacy and white nationalism because he knows that it's a part of his power block

1275
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:32,255
He doesn't like the people are discussing how these things are

1276
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,023
Problem

1277
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,815
Unwilling to separate himself

1278
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,375
For my nationalism because it's his bread-and-butter

1279
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,191
People keep saying that I'm a white nationalist

1280
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:40,959
Android

1281
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,775
Way wrong now I would just like my supporters to

1282
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,567
Continue sending me Nazi coin

1283
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,407
That's the new official branded

1284
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:55,807
Cryptocurrency I only accept conflict diamond

1285
00:56:56,063 --> 00:57:00,159
I also think

1286
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:04,511
Actually thinks that swalwell's name is swallows well

1287
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:11,679
That was something that was the name that Rodger gave it to him when a couple years back when Rodger was mad at Adam Schiff

1288
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,983
They have that blow up

1289
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,335
It's just doesn't realize that that's not his real name

1290
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:20,895
As a joke

1291
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,431
Can we live in a

1292
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,199
Dictatorship

1293
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
When

1294
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,295
The man who is telling me we are living in a dictatorship

1295
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,087
Just told me that he has proof

1296
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,135
The dictator of said dictatorship

1297
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
Is

1298
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,439
Dementia

1299
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:36,255
And animated video

1300
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,303
Yeah I wouldn't really be a

1301
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,631
It weird one would be a strange one

1302
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,911
Speaking of weird ones

1303
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,215
We shouldn't be seduced into that

1304
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,519
Thinking that because we're white weed ride

1305
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,055
And you don't win an argument

1306
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,103
Manipulating definition

1307
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,151
Do you agree Norm that you're a racist

1308
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:53,919
Well now

1309
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,199
Well that's because you're a race

1310
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:58,271
Lenore Pattinson's back to be a really sensitive

1311
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
I guess

1312
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,927
Just to remind people in cake

1313
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:09,791
Look I'm not noted stand-up comedian I'm not saying that Norm is racist

1314
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,327
Because he says he's not racist

1315
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,191
I think he's racist because he doesn't think I like the best two weeks ago

1316
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,751
Buick standup

1317
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,311
Comedy the other night at a small club in Connecticut

1318
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,359
And I ended my wrist

1319
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,663
The following hey you know I tried to buy

1320
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,455
Insurance the other day

1321
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,831
Assurance is what you need if you're white Matthews I'm reading the paper

1322
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,391
Wrong with this country is my fault

1323
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,207
How am I going to pay for all of this

1324
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:38,975
Insurance

1325
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,767
And we're at a point where

1326
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,791
Sort of humor

1327
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,863
It isn't necessarily farcical any longer

1328
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:51,007
I think in comedies are some things that are evergreen like I could probably hear some

1329
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:53,311
Mitch Hedberg one-liners

1330
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,639
I've heard a hundred times that still make me laugh

1331
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:04,831
Guy tried to give me the insurance for a donut I said I don't need insurance for a donut

1332
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,879
Still am but I used to

1333
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,423
Racist Mitch Hedberg of the new character

1334

Okay I'm sorry I've got to get lots of that for a while

1342
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:54,239
If you get inspired please feel free

1343
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,543

The guy who

1346
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:08,063

The scientist and what have you

1350
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:15,487
He wants to get Francis Boyle and Norm

1351
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,255

Sure do it

1355
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,703
Yeah let's get it done too that's pretty funny

1356
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Because

1357
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:31,871
Alex explains to Norm the vaccines are dangerous and Norms response is hilarious

1358
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:37,503
I got to get him with more passes our lawyer so that we can go with this

1359
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,807
False a religious exemption

1360

First Amendment Shropshire BS totally reasonable

1361
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:50,559
Shoehorning

1362
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,351
Totally different system in

1363
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,703
And called it a vaccine

1364
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,823
Why don't you want to preach at your Norm

1365
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,151
I just really pissed about this

1366
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,175

I don't know enough

1372
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,559
Intelligent

1373
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,607
What it what what you're telling me is that

1374
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,399
Significant portions of what has

1375
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,703
Been sold in the name of Public Health is actually a

1376
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:29,983
For something else

1377
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
And handsome

1378
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,775
Implicit dangers

1379
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,055
That we're not being warned about

1380
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,127
If that is in fact true that's an outrageous

1381
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,151
Violation of trust

1382
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,687
Look what we have

1383
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,223
Laws in the United States

1384
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,503
It says a person is

1385
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,807
Free to refuse medical treatment

1386
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:46,623
And in order to accept

1387
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,671
They must give informed consent

1388
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,695
No I took the

1389
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:57,119
Double-shot to Pfizer nobody warned me about any gene therapy or anything like that so as far as I know

1390
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,655
I was taking a bath

1391
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,679
Maxine that was

1392
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,447
Tested

1393
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:03,775
Under exigent circumstances to meet an emergency

1394
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,847
Think I'm alright

1395
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,639
Maybe I'll be here tomorrow maybe I won't

1396
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,663
But what you're telling me is

1397
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,199
It's that is is base

1398
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:14,527
Basically paid better attention to what's going on and I'm ashamed

1399
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,135
Marathon runner SIU Masala during the breakout cuddlefuck up

1400
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:23,487
I saw you eating a salad I thought you hated

1401
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,511
I love you baby

1402
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:30,911
You eating a salad I love the idea that I like all this

1403
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,471
I got the vaccine

1404
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,495
No

1405
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
Oh no

1406
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,335
It's funny when people take Alex

1407
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,639
Seriously and try to restate the things back

1408
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:44,479
And try and act like they give a s***

1409
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,271
Oh I took

1410
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:50,879
The vaccine and now I'm worried I was so scared

1411
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,695
I had no idea that the guy

1412
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,719
Who show

1413
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,255
I have been on

1414
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,791
Nobody's distantly

1415
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
For the past

1416
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,839
Several years

1417
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:04,703
Said that vaccines had something inside them that could kill you

1418
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:10,847
Breaking information about the guy who weirdly on his show a whole bunch

1419
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
Has been

1420
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:18,527
Eeyore saying don't get this vaccine I got both of them I got him immediately

1421
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,463
I could drop dead at any moment

1422
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,023
Goodnight will say that he has the acting chops with most

1423
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:32,351
Comedians that I've met

1424
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,423
Sensitive

1425
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,215
That's right in there

1426
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:37,983
Oh yeah

1427
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,055
Another guest after after Norm bales

1428
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,871
Cuz he's so worried just got to get this

1429
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:50,527
He's got he's going out there on

1430
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:52,319
I imagine that's what what you figure

1431
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:55,647
You're that does sound right so he has Alex now has another

1432
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
Person on

1433
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
And who who

1434
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,487
So doctor

1435
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,767
Thank you doctor

1436
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,607
By over here is a

1437
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,399
Charlotte

1438
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Play ZZ Ward

1439
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,215
University Hospitals and Clinics

1440
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,103
So Carrie Maday is not a prestigious Doctor Who's been right about all this vaccine stuff the way out

1441
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,383
Going to try to present her

1442
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,711
Peter qanon lunatic who's committed a series of public embarrassed

1443
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,807
That the audience that people like her and Alex are cultivated their praying to ignore

1444
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,855
An article in Vice pointed out of

1445
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,879
Particularly sad in

1446
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,951
Carrie just believe in whatever bulshit she saw online

1447
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:36,607
This past summer she was convinced that a long debunked website advertising the cannibal Club restaurant in Los

1448
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,935
Was in fact a real Eatery serving human flesh

1449
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:45,311
We taste like pork she tweeted dear God help us change the world for the better

1450
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:52,223
Terry is an osteopath which on its own isn't necessarily a bad sign however being an osteopath on Alex's

1451
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,527
So who also believes qanon should means

1452
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
To me that this is

1453
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
Is a person pretend

1454
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:00,415
Yeah I was really I was really fascinated when she was like see

1455
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,183
What happen

1456
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,463
When's is if you eat a

1457
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,767
Ferret but then go to the cannibal Club it takes

1458
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,047
The year to digest

1459
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,887
True person it only takes a week see it's reverse

1460
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,679
Situations

1461
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,727
It makes perfect sense

1462
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:16,287
And also I don't know if you remember this

1463
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,079
Cuz she has popped up on the

1464
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,151
Before but her big decline

1465
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:27,551
Wasn't saying that like covid vaccines are going to kill people will rise to prominence is based around a very not true claim that

1466
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,855
The MRNA would alter people's DNA

1467
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,135
This in turn would

1468
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:34,207
DNA into something that would be patented in advance

1469
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:40,863
Someone else's intellectual property

1470
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,959
It's a real dumb

1471
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,263
That's what you wrote that's the way of she wrote in

1472
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,311
I am really bummed

1473
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:53,407
It really bums me out that these people don't understand

1474
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,967
There are way cheaper way

1475
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,295
For corporations to steal money from all of us

1476
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,415
Absurdly complex

1477
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:10,559
They're stealing your money at a regular low boring level

1478
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,607
As long as things like

1479
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:16,703
Check cashing places exist or at least

1480
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:22,591
Exist on regulated the way they are right whenever need to create

1481
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
So stupid

1482
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:30,527
I mean you're you're evil Bill Gates who's the most evil man in the world

1483
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:34,623
Who hates everybody is creating this vaccine to kill everybody is against

1484
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:38,207
F****** making a generic version of the vaccine

1485
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,743
Gibby sent around the world

1486
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:43,583
He's actually doing the things that they say he's doing

1487
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,143
You're not doing

1488
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,679
Yeah it's complicated

1489
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:52,031
Carrie is on and she has some bad news

1490
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,055
About.

1491
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,103
In one day I asked

1492
01:06:55,359 --> 01:07:00,735
My members I said does anyone have any problems with their menstrual cycle and fertility Etc

1493
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,271
Send

1494
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,063
Being around someone who's been

1495
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,135
Vaccinated and I had over 700

1496
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:10,207
Responses within 6 to 12 hours

1497
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,487
It's unbelievable

1498
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,535
This is anecdotal and I do not

1499
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,863
Press the reporting of weirdo carryminati followers online

1500
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:21,215
This is just one of the new trendy things that are pushed

1501
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
It's the idea that people who

1502
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:26,335
Vaccinated or shedding diseases that are affecting people around us

1503
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:32,735
This is why Mike Adams insist people stay away from vaccinated people and why that dumped school in Florida ban teachers who have been back

1504
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
Akinator

1505
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,575
A recent article in the New York Times deals with this ain't no answer

1506
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
Certain terms

1507
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,439
Vaccinated people can't shed anything because there's nothing to be shedding

1508
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,975
Dr. Celine gounder

1509
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:46,815
I am Texas disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center

1510
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,095
Remember president

1511
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,143
Transition

1512
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,167
Home Coronavirus

1513
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:54,239
Go to the people who said virus are people who have covid

1514
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,287
So if you want to prevent yourself or others from

1515
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,311
Virus the best

1516
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,079
Way to do that

1517
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:02,943
Vaccinated so you don't get covid testing

1518
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,271
If he wants to make those conspiracy steaks he's basically going to need to create

1519
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,807
A new theory of Medicine

1520
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
Which would be interesting

1521
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,903
I've got a new theory of Medicine

1522
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
For you,

1523
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,439
The Lord's

1524
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,207
Will

1525
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,535
So what about what does God think about

1526
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,559
Nanotech

1527
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:23,423
Another thing that is a very interesting possibility is

1528
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,007
It's because we're using nanotechnology because they have the ability to

1529
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,567
To be like antennas or uses biosensors

1530
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,847
What if

1531
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,151
They actually are emitting some kind of

1532
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,175
Frequency out there

1533
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,735
This is what's on SyFy but it's a

1534
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,503
Possibility

1535
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,527
Not to sound dumb

1536
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
What if

1537
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
What if he's shot

1538
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,903
Noatak into us

1539
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,695
What if

1540
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
What if

1541
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,511
Damn

1542
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,303
What if

1543
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,327
Alright

1544
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,863
Now hear me out on the

1545
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,399
None of our left

1546
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,935
Speederia

1547
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,983
All of this everybody has

1548
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
1 ft

1549
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,799
Right foot only the left foot

1550
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,079
All Nanobots

1551
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,151
Created by the devil

1552
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
How does this what is this half

1553
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,503
To do with the human

1554
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,527
Genome Project

1555
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
Being made

1556
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,831
To get Nephilim DNA

1557
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:16,159
Well that's where they got the nephelym DNA they removed all of our fee

1558
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,207
Is this bastard

1559
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,303
With your b*******

1560
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:26,655
Yeah I really can you just had Steve Quayle on the other day like what are we doing

1561
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,191
Struggling with all of

1562
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,727
The bulshit you guys are expect

1563
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,775
Take me to and it's a lot

1564
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:32,799
It's a lot

1565
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,079
These are really serious concern

1566
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:36,639
Now I was kind of surprised to learn

1567
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:39,967
The Kerry is still worried about people having

1568
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,503
Patented DNA

1569
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,295
And everybody needs to know this

1570
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,575
That is

1571
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,879
Any of these synthetic genes which the Spy

1572
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,903
Protein has

1573
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,439
Synthetic genes in them

1574
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,487
If the synthetic genes

1575
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,791
It's integrated into our genome which

1576
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:58,143
Can happen because we have enzymes in our body that can do that

1577
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,679
If that happened

1578
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,983
You and the owned

1579
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,775
By whoever owns that

1580
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,055
Patents overnight

1581
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,871
The Supreme Court Justices ruled that a human being

1582
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,151
And Beyond

1583
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:12,735
If they have a synthetic gene or genome inside of

1584
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:18,623
Interesting interesting interesting decision for Justice John Roberts to of

1585
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,647
Wait are you

1586
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,951
What's a court decision

1587
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,975
I would like to know

1588
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
Supreme Court

1589
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,631
Look I don't find this person

1590
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,399
All that info

1591
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:36,543
I think that she is a coon on weirdo who has a bunch of a really dumb ideas that aren't based on

1592
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,311
Anyting

1593
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:39,871
But

1594
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,919
This interview devault

1595
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:44,223
Okay and it turns into

1596
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,503
A story

1597
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,295
Of her getting inducted into

1598
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
To the globalist

1599
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,343
Cult or something

1600
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,367
Unclear

1601
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,391
On

1602
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,415
Clear all right

1603
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,439
Now you're selling me

1604
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,207
Here we go

1605
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:58,047
Describe that meeting where this whole scientific dictatorship

1606
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,071
Tried recruiting

1607
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,447
Yes this was actually a business owners meeting on VIP bus

1608
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:08,799
I sent you the location our cell phones were jammed this is around 2,000

1609
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
14

1610
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,431
And we were locked in the building until the meeting was done and this was

1611
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:18,015
People seeing and etcetera etcetera I was a small fish

1612
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,295
I didn't hear that

1613
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,623
Talked about how they were going to change it modify

1614
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,927
The behavior of the people of Georgia

1615
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:27,231
With using their smart device

1616
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,279
The health app on there and when

1617
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,583
Somehow getting didn't tell us how

1618
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,887
A substance inside of their body that would be used

1619
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,911
Biosensors

1620
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:41,567
The ideas they felt people here are too racist and they're not amenable to different cultures so they took it upon themselves

1621
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,591
How to change people

1622
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,127
And they

1623
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:50,015
Inside these injections because that's how I learned about them

1624
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,551
They said

1625
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,159
Thoughts your emotions

1626
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,975
If you're lying by a voice inflection app

1627
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,279
Also they knew if you're lying by

1628
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:04,095
Polygraph test with your sweat glands they can do that

1629
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:07,167
Also your blood sugar level your life drawing

1630
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,495
Breathing I'll so you know what you're having

1631
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,543
Sucks they are interested in that if you're

1632
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:16,639
Drinking alcohol after taking drugs they know everything about you

1633
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,175
Literally they said they could do it

1634
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:23,295
Analyzes data and they had an algorithm that a computer would

1635
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,575
Being charged up

1636
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:28,159
And every time you lied even a little white lie about where you were

1637
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:34,047
The smartphone would know it immediately by these parameters and give you an instant repercussion

1638
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:38,399
I then also overload say one two three months all the lies with the added up

1639
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:44,031
And then you would be considered either of good human or bad human in the computer with a lot you

1640
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,311
Social credit system

1641
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,591
Or cryptocurrency

1642
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:50,175
You said this on my show this meeting happened

1643
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:50,943
Man

1644
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,735
Hubble

1645
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:59,391
Yeah

1646
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:05,791
I wonder like

1647
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,815
If I were in

1648
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,095
The position that she is in

1649
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:12,703
1 ways that I might make myself seem a little bit more credible house that provide

1650
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,471
Details

1651
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:16,031
What's the name of this organization who else was there

1652
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:16,799
CNN

1653
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:17,567
What

1654
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,871
Why was CNN there you said was he in English

1655
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:20,895
Smiles

1656
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,919
What does that mean

1657
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:24,479
Okay you never there okay

1658
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:29,087
The goal is to make people less racist that's why they have CNN

1659
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,623
Truth

1660
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:35,487
Siri go to MSNBC

1661
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:41,887
Shouldn't the story be that every time you're racist you lose points in your credit score else isn't only

1662
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,423
You lie what the f***

1663
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:46,239
He's going on. If you're lying about being racist

1664
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,519
You will be shocked

1665
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:50,591
Romello

1666
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,127
Right

1667
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,455
Higher Love

1668
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,479
I love

1669
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,503
Confidence

1670
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,527
And the worry

1671
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,319
With which she tells the story

1672
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,111
People

1673
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,415
Really just

1674
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:08,511
Figuring out how magic works and using it in any and every pot

1675
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,559
Because all of that you just said it

1676
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:13,631
The magic yeah I would assume that what you went to was like

1677
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,423
Some kind of a get rich

1678
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:19,519
Motivational seminar or something like that

1679
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,567
Like one time I went to a Cutco

1680
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:28,223
Needing accidentally

1681
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,551
Yeah

1682
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,831
And I was the same kind of

1683
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:34,623
Can't leave

1684
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,647
Maybe that's

1685
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:38,463
I don't know this this all just seems like nonsense

1686
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:44,095
Timeshare because that's basic when your presentation eventually you're going to think

1687
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,631
They're trying to kill everyone

1688
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,703
Oh no they're going to try to make

1689
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:53,823
And I bet that you were saying something races then someone's like a calm down

1690
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,615
Trying to make people this week

1691
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,735
Car right Sunway Alex's

1692
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,295
Super into this story because of course

1693
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:10,975
They tried to get him

1694
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:12,255
Population

1695
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,839
So Alex revealed something else here that I was unaware of

1696
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:19,679
Go back to how they were cruising this cuz I do have a lot of roots

1697
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:31,199
Do they have your eyes closed

1698
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,783
Obviously not disclosing anyone

1699
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,343
Because they did this on 9/11

1700
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,719
Tacoma day before it was an emergency

1701
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,791
They put them all at 6 a.m. in there

1702
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,863
Jumbotron TVs the towers being blown up

1703
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,911
We don't need that they told him this day

1704
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,191
They followed orders

1705
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,775
The way

1706
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:56,799
Secret

1707
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,591
11 inside

1708
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,895
Way way way way way was this

1709
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:05,759
The day before or was it on 9/11

1710
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,551
Brought before

1711
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,879
And they had a nice evening that I like a little mixer

1712
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:14,975
Right and then the next morning they get up there all in line for the Continental

1713
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:17,791
Hold on one second

1714
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,071
9/11 happening

1715
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,095
Now let's go

1716
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,911
Follow order

1717
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,935
The story that I heard

1718
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:26,239
Boy I don't even like

1719
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:30,591
I've seen Loose Change I don't remember that in there

1720
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:35,711
Different things happened in the intervening time. Between when they did and did not happen

1721
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,735
Very weird

1722
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:40,063
So she talks a little bit more about this

1723
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,343
This meeting

1724
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,135
This is so sad

1725
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:43,903
Stupid

1726
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:50,559
Well I didn't really know what I was getting into I thought this is just email from more for political reasons is a good idea to join

1727
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,351
Play nidus for a year

1728
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,887
Three different people in

1729
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,679
Courage man finally I went to

1730
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:59,007
The first meeting which I just described which

1731
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,799
I was completely taken aback

1732
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,335
I got no one prepared me for that

1733
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:05,407
I tried to leave the building and they laughed at me

1734
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,199
And they said go ahead when they unlocked

1735
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,759
The doors my cell phone still didn't work and I

1736
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:10,783
I didn't know where my

1737
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,319
Car was obvious

1738
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:18,975
And there was a non-disclosure in general that was signed but not for that particular meeting

1739
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:23,071
But did you not understand

1740
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,703
And then decided to try to bring you in real first-level wow

1741
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,775
Yes and

1742
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:35,615
I don't care if I had a non-disclosure in the general sense because

1743
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,431
These are crimes against humanity

1744
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,455
That's why there wouldn't be one

1745
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,223
Yeah that was

1746
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,527
Just a regular old pyramid scheme

1747
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:48,927
Disclosure agreement to do not cover criminal activity everyone f****** knows that yeah

1748
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,207
How would you ever

1749
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,487
If you were running a

1750
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Secret

1751
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:56,351
Taking over the world trying to control people with anti-racism the app

1752
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,399
It will monitor their sweat and

1753
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:04,799
Dock their pay if I was going to turn the person in but then before I could testify against

1754
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:11,455
He married me so it was against the law for me to testify against Ball Z movies

1755
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,039
I was going to blow the whistle on a Hitler but I'd signed addendum

1756
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:21,439
How you know you win some you lose I told him I told him

1757
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,231
Ndaa

1758
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,767
Ironclad

1759
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,071
That's the part of the supervillain

1760
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,607
Suck stories that are two

1761
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,375
Just so

1762
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399
So much contra

1763
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:34,751
Inviolable contract law

1764
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:37,311
Dealing with the literal Devil Himself

1765
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:40,639
Known for deception somehow

1766
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,199
Contract law inviolable

1767
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,991
Almost

1768
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,015
Certain this was a

1769
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:52,927
Better now that's absolutely a make way too many times

1770
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:57,535
This is Nigeria JD's

1771
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,303
Yeah

1772
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:01,375
So here's what we doing everything makes sense but

1773
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,399
There's a year

1774
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,935
Yaakov of like

1775
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,703
People

1776
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:10,591
Okay you should come to this Tupperware party or whatever and yeah it's really cool

1777
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,615
It's not you're not

1778
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:16,479
Not selling anything what you're doing is you just get a discount whenever you purchase something

1779
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:19,295
And then if other people use your numbers

1780
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,831
They'll get a discount

1781
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,367
But you'll get a little bit of that

1782
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,695
The globalist

1783
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:33,119
They're like busing into like a Convention Center or whatever makes total sense

1784
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:37,215
God if you want to leave because I want to

1785
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,495
People to

1786
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,543
It seem like they're giving up

1787
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,591
Help something's are foolish to leave

1788
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,615
Everything is

1789
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,175
That is it

1790
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,223
Exactly how it works.

1791
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,271
I love how Alex

1792
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:51,039
Get so excited

1793
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,575
About it as opposed to

1794
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,111
To dealing with this critically like

1795
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,415
There's no f****** way

1796
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,719
Happened like you said it did

1797
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,743
Absolutely

1798
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:03,583
I think is really thought about her

1799
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:08,191
Now we come to the end of this and

1800
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,751
What's that does not surprise me.

1801
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,543
Grand Theft Auto

1802
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:18,944
Initially

1803
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:25,344
It's so important that you had to insert your own personal stories into

1804
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,440
Seems like now in his hour of me

1805
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:35,840
Dad in the most crucial juncture of the mouth

1806
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,632
Greenberg is Dunham dirty

1807
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:44,800
Something new and I know he's lying

1808
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,688
Shocking shocking

1809
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,456
Was not covered

1810
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:53,248
So weird weird

1811
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:55,040
It seems like that would be

1812
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,064
Opticover like

1813
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,392
Alex and Paul Joseph Watson anger at Muslims or

1814
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,928
Ignoring highlight away

1815
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:04,000
Sensitivity about whiteness or

1816
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,048
Doctor

1817
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:13,216
There's people with DNA I peed and now everybody's going to die because

1818
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,800
Yeah they still blood

1819
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:21,920
It just one of those things too that I've I've started to recognize a notice about these older episodes that I've lost

1820
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:25,248
Listen to Like These 2003 ones one of the real changes

1821
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:27,296
In that I've seen is like

1822
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,344
There are so fewer guests

1823
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,112
Back then

1824
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,136
And I think it's B

1825
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,672
Because Alex don't have to do s***

1826
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,720
Like you can eat a sandwich

1827
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:35,744
Or you can let me

1828
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,280
Dum Dums talk

1829
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,304
Hey I'm like

1830
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,096
It's just so easy for him

1831
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,120
To have

1832
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,888
5 gas

1833
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,680
Stoner show as opposed to

1834
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:44,960
Covering

1835
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,728
Anything

1836
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:51,616
No senioritis

1837
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,640
In his defense

1838
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,664
Yeah

1839
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:54,688
It sucks

1840
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,224
Your show sucks

1841
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,040
The people you work with suck and you suck

1842
01:21:59,296 --> 01:21:59,808
Of course it's

1843
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:02,368
Yeah you should be having a bad

1844
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,904
Bedtime

1845
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,440
Come to the end of this

1846
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,464
Sam's man

1847
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:07,744
Just embarrassing

1848
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:13,120
What about this

1849
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,680
Episode where the Bears

1850
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,960
Anybody who was

1851
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,776
Looking at this from the outside would be aware that news

1852
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,824
Set broken that's super relevant to Infowars

1853
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,104
Snooze

1854
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,664
Have doubtless

1855
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,736

1857
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,296
He loves to party

1858
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,832
It seems like

1859
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,600
Kind of thing

1860
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,392
Might want to follow up on

1861
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,672
Especially considering

1862
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,464
One of your

1863
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,000
The on-again off-again

1864
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,024
Employees

1865
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:45,632
Is that in the mix well and here's the here's the funniest part

1866
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,424
It's not funny

1867
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,448
I get to really f***** up

1868
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,008
Situation what's funny about Alex

1869
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,800
And them being so insistent

1870
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,848
On this is a guyot

1871
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,872
Just likes to party

1872
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,152
Is the the more.

01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,944

1874
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:01,248

Oh you know where that kind of s*** happens

1877
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,928
If you're a guy that likes to party all the time

1878
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,720
Maybe you don't ask questions first

1879
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:15,328
It sure seems to be a reasonable situation instead of one Warrior

1880
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:19,680
Making it so ridiculous with this guy could be guilty of this crime

1881
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,984
The story

01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,800

Are you almost at like I saw that and I was like oh that's totally a crime

1893

01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,472
They're going to be like gay

1895

1896
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,264

Everybody knew that

1900
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,456
You could

1901
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
