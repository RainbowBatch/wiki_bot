1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:07,936
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,496
Knowledge

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,032
Spite

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,896
Let's

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,432
Just liquor way to do it

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,968
Introduce each other ourselves

8
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:25,600
Yeah whatever

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,416
Yeah so here we are here

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:34,304
A gentleman who is very interested in Infowars and Alex Jones

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
Xecular

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:39,680
Jordan

13
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,216
Sit down have a bottle of wine

14
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,056
Like the bougie assholes that we are

15
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,640
Do you buy prophecy wine

16
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,992
At the Pinot Noir out of California

17
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
Weirdo with a bindle

18
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,344
I'll look at a gesture with a bindle on the

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,136
On the front of it

20
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,232
And he is surrounded by Woodland

21
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,560
Pure

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:11,168
Illuminati symbol

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,704
That's what Alex would tell us

24
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,800
Supremacy the show here is that I have gathered

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
The Jordan is not heard

26
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
But and I will just

27
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Discuss

28
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,736
Ramifications of figure that s*** out

29
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,040
Tubidy Tubidy

30
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
At least a little bit

31
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
At the end of last week

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
First of all I could not

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,752
I could not wait to do this again by the way I was counting you to possibly do this

34
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
On a daily basis

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Yeah no

36
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,432
Yeah last episode

37
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,040
Podcasting but I was so emotionally drained Jabari home just like

38
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
How old is a man

39
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
To figure out Alexa

40
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
The amount of

41
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Mental

42
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
Stress

43
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
It must take

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
To live inside that world

45
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,144
The moment I left

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,544
I started reading about because that's the only way that we can look through this

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
And the term was coined

48
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
Not the way we think of it where it's

49
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,688
Like you can hold

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
Competing ideas

51
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,576
Whenever you get

52
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
Competing ideas

53
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,696
The one that you prefer that fits your natural narrative

54
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
Is the one that you wind up holding

55
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,584
Psychologically

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
You know

57
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
You can't

58
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Compete

59
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
With

60
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Insanity

61
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
By using facts

62
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,032
Because when you

63
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:58,176
People just doubled down on there it's in coop

64
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
Run to their line of thinking

65
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
It's it's

66
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,832
I mean we're witnessing this play out on the national

67
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
Scale International scale right now if you listen to the first episode we know the Pakistani

68
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
As well

69
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
Set this up

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,216
Last week at the end of the week Alex

71
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
Mr. Jones if you're nasty

72
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
Cavs

73
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,664
He reference on the last episode of we did that he was going to take some meetings

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
But maybe he didn't want to take these meetings

75
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Cuz he can

76
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
Warren someone in person

77
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:39,648
Well well if you get out

78
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,976
Between the lines

79
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Has taken those

80
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
And he's out of this

81
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
For the last like 4 days for days that he is going to be

82
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
Assassinated

83
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,800
Which we learned throughout the course of

84
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
Some of the Clemson play today

85
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Are weirdo College

86
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
We'll get to that in the mail

87
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
The last few days

88
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
Has been like guest host

89
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Filling in

90
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
And I don't really care to talk about that

91
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
I mention this in the last episode

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
But like no

93
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Respect to Paul Joseph Watson

94
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
No disrespect

95
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
Pjw sjw

96
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,727
No disrespect to him or orange a little disrespected Owen Shroyer that guy's an a******

97
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Them because

98
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
Without them there isn't

99
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,639
Without them it doesn't matter Alex Jones can do this on his own

100
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Without Alex Jones

101
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
There is no info

102
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:40,831
Yeah like he's built a cult of personality

103
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
The same way that

104
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
There are

105
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
Colts little minions

106
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,279
And they are basically the echo a lot of his marriage

107
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
So it's not really all that interested

108
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
Sing to me to breakdown

109
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
With Paul Joseph Watson

110
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Has to say when he

111
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
It's mostly just

112
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,031
There's a on and also people are

113
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,103
When Allison

114
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,431
I would never have guessed that

115
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:11,551
Anti-racist

116
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
At a future shop

117
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
But I wanted to do this

118
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
But we didn't have a show with

119
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
So I decided

120
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Let's go ahead and do that Y2K up

121
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
So that's why we're here

122
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
We're going

123
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Discuss what happened when

124
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Alex Jones

125
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
On December 31st

126
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
1999

127
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:33,311
Unfortunately

128
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,407
So you are missing out on him saying we're doing a white

129
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
2K episode and me absolute

130
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
17 years later

131
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
Here we are

132
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,647
What is happened we have not yet been

133
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,511
If you will allow me to use that term

134
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Of the Opera

135
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
Is

136
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
This story that I

137
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Picked up

138
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
That

139
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
Power plant

140
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
Pennsylvania

141
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Had been taken offline

142
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
So I'll let him

143
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
Explain the story

144
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,663
Alright let's go ahead and get to this article Associated Press

145
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,503
I just came out at 7:22 a.m. eastern standard time

146
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,415
December 31st 1999 Pennsylvania nuclear plant shut down one of the two nuclear reactors

147
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,279
PECO Energy Co Limerick Generating Station has shut down

148
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
How this morning after a piece of equipment

149
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
Play Old Company spokesman Neil McDermott

150
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
The problem was not Y2K related

151
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:38,847
It was declared an unusual event the least serious emergency classification of nuclear power plants they got have a serious emergency

152
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,919
Shutdown

153
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,831
Serious emergency

154
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,159
Emergency

155
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,463
To stop the strippers

156
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Wild conjecture

157
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
And total b*******

158
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,143
You like okay well the story is that it's nothing serious

159
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
Anal at 7

160
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Nearest

161
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Pretty much

162
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,567
Evidence has been worn out

163
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Not Y2K

164
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,383
But the story is

165
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
Nothing serious

166
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,991
It's clearly stated I also like

167
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:22,623
The the audio quality of this clip now because it does have the feel of

168
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
Like Dan Rather reporting

169
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,255
Warzone every sound

170
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
Dusty box

171
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Clips from

172
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,471
I'm not as able to take everything like

173
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
SMS episode

174
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
Just because this entire episode

175
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
It's not online

176
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,711
Okay there was just a large compilation of clips

177
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Avalon

178
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Trust me

179
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Context

180
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:56,927
Is 5 the context is like that's all you need to know about the contacts

181
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,255
Apologizing

182
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
Not necessarily to apologize

183
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
I just feel like

184
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
Affair day in court is required

185
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
So

186
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
Release date

187
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,871
It was declared unusual then

188
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:22,527
Shutdown occurred when an insulator on the main generator Transformer from Limerick to fail

189
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
We have reports yesterday of this

190
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,903
Off the record I would not report it but I had it from a good source

191
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,303
Implant-supported here

192
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,631
And just go ahead and report it

193
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:44,031
I know I'm not going to record it I have more information I don't really have more information

194
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Get up on your route

195
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,871
I know this is something I think is also really important

196
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
And fun to bring up

197
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
This is all he does

198
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
He says like

199
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
I've got this information

200
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Someone

201
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Told me

202
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
Credible information

203
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
First of all the information is

204
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Never says

205
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
Who the people are

206
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
In the same breath

207
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Now we have this

208
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,583
Intelligence report that came out about the hacking

209
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
The Russian hacker

210
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
You read the article

211
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,359
Just some guy said maybe and there's no

212
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Well

213
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
Let me be that as it may

214
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
His

215
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
The unnamed

216
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Officials

217
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
Who are giving these things like

218
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,231
But if I don't

219
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
That's because I'm pretty

220
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,119
Texting you from the truth when it's because

221
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,935
Steven Yeun

222
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
Premier

223
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
He's not dumb

224
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,591
Information here

225
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:56,735
Tomorrow formation that is not this this Transformer that they're talking about they wouldn't just got a plant on over that

226
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
Something serious maybe going on there

227
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
So turns out it was

228
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,487
Better be end of every

229
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
Turned out it was

230
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
It was like a broken

231
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
Insulator and acquired them

232
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,655
And it does happen from time to time

233
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
It's a little bit

234
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,983
Extreme innocence

235
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Nuclear reactor

236
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
Nuclear Power Plant

237
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
Is nuts

238
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,639
It does get the cool down to Coors and stuff like that

239
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
It's a huge process

240
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
But it does happen sometimes

241
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,319
Yeah well it's an immensely complicated way of powering anything

242
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Gets cleaner

243
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Isn't it

244
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
I don't know

245
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,535
Amazon going to assume it's cleaner because people are afraid of

246
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,935
Energy specialist

247
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,263
Earlier from anonymous

248
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
Actually I'm more of a Gobot

249
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,103
Special

250
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
Really where I'm or after

251
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
Narrative that runs

252
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
Throughout the entire episode

253
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
Or he just cause

254
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
Only brings up to Pennsylvania power play

255
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Annie

256
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Yeah

257
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:11,231
It just goes on and on but we can take away from that clip is that

258
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
He knew about it

259
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
Yesterday

260
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:18,911
It's on the right and there's four or five other ones around the country

261
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Better

262
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,751
Who knows what's going to happen

263
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
Since it's a serious emergency

264
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
And not just a

265
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
Transformer

266
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
Anyone at any time

267
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,271
Message

268
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,135
The underlying message is actually trying to get out or what hit the point you're trying to make

269
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
Is that

270
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,231
These aren't real serious problem

271
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
The plan problem

272
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
It's not that

273
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Happening

274
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Is that the globalist

275
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,167
Want you to think Y2K is happy

276
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
Well they have there

277
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Surrogate

278
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Terrorist

279
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,055
Go out and caused a little problem

280
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,127
The Narrative that I was not accept

281
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,735
Afraid of

282
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,063
This is a full-on false flag

283
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
Okay

284
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
Where were cover story for years ago

285
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
And the globalist

286
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,815
He's already established

287
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,959
From the jump from the jump Global from whenever he got radicalized in Junior College

288
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
Do now

289
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
Globalist the problem

290
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
I haven't finished it yet but I'm ready

291
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,455
I've read most of the book that he read in college

292
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
He cites as

293
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
His Awakening

294
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
His redpilling is

295
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
As they call it now

296
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Conspiracy

297
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
And basically all it is about these

298
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
Globalist for

299
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
That are trying to

300
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Trick people into it

301
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
Accepting social

302
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Because socialism is a lie

303
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
That leads to Communism

304
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
And communism isn't really people sharing thing

305
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
It's otter control of the state

306
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Over everything

307
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,871
Principle behind it and that's guided him

308
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Throughout his

309
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
Higher broadcast

310
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
Supervisor

311
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,439
Questions at the end of the festival in his

312
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Underlying

313
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,303
What is inconsistent and what

314
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,655
And how it plays out in the world

315
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
So so here's a

316
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
Question that I have

317
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
And Friday

318
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
Doing the globalist

319
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
25 years ago

320
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
Does he think

321
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
She's winning or there

322
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
He now thinks he's winning

323
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
With Trump

324
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
Because he believes the Trump is the champ

325
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
I was going to take them all down

326
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Okay

327
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,791
He can wrap his head around like people like Rex Tillerson

328
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,583
You know Exxon

329
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
CEOs being put on the cabinet

330
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
Now you know these Goldman Sachs

331
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Bankers

332
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Did you look at their history

333
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
They've been fighting the globalist

334
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
The whole way

335
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
I have

336
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,455
No idea how that's possible

337
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,783
Because you wouldn't want to leave a record of that in case the globalist win

338
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,927
Atleast play Both Sides there so you can survive

339
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
The globalist code

340
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,511
But then you've still got the

341
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,095
We're getting too deep into the story in modern day

342
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
But

343
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,471
Is anyone

344
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:39,615
The behind-the-scenes so let's all go back to work

345
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
Where were you

346
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,991
We were really afraid

347
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
X27 reactors

348
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
Across the country

349
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
I'm not even

350
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,279
I got the shoes about the Pennsylvania

351
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,351
Early yesterday got it again off air

352
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,703
Confirmed it with someone that is 99% accurate. My dying

353
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
You catch that

354
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
Off-air with somebody

355
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
Who's percent accurate

356
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Like I am

357
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
Yeah that's

358
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:19,551
Broadcast baby

359
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,111
Only deals with 99%

360
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,975
You only hang out with people in your own social class I'll be incorrect all the time

361
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,095
He's not correct all the time he wants to leave that open

362
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Just in case

363
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,799
Trying to report the truth and now I got the Associated Press saying will they shut the whole plant down but

364
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
They call it

365
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:49,247
Usual event the least serious emergency classification Nuclear Power Plant

366
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
A plant that

367
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
Good luck

368
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,415
Yeah pretty bad for them to power the plant

369
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,023
It has to be more bad than anything that happens where they don't

370
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
It's appealing on one level

371
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
But it's also not

372
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
Borne out by the

373
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,847
I think it's hard for us because we're trying to

374
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Compete

375
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
Non-tax with facts

376
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
Right

377
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,039
Engage with this on its on its own level

378
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:28,927
So I would love for you to do that so hard

379
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
My whole life

380
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,023
They got to leave that at the door

381
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,351
This is now I'm delving into this world

382
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
You are

383
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Concentrated

384
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
99.9

385
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
Epiphysis

386
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
If it is a serious problem

387
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
What is going to happen

388
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
All those

389
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,599
Going to go off okay so then

390
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,439
I don't know I don't know

391
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,999
I think it's probably the

392
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
We all do

393
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,375
Where's the human Community we all should wear libtards

394
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
And we care about people in foreign

395
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
Yes but

396
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
I think that maybe the

397
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,823
So good

398
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,431
Riptides for people who are not in

399
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:28,319
So I think the next stage of The Narrative of that would be that the grid goes down

400
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,183
Power goes out around the city's control

401
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Tire grid

402
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,583
And there's no backup and once the nuclear power plant goes down

403
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
It's utter chaos

404
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Which of the globalist

405
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Trying to put

406
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,007
It's funny you should say that maybe you should

407
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,823
Shakir and they're coming from one of Alex Jones is

408
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
Reputable sources

409
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,991
I'm a little bit

410
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:02,623
Yeah they're they're they're going up on it right now

411
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:08,767
I called in today I got another confirmation real early this morning and practice support attorneys

412
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,327
Come up

413
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,447
About the power plant situation

414
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,775
A gentleman from Michigan

415
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
About the

416
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
PowerPlant situation

417
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
In Pennsylvania

418
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Michigan

419
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,015
So it wasn't Michigan fact that I wanted to stop here for a second

420
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Compressor

421
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
And

422
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
Like you just said

423
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
What we were talking about yesterday

424
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,463
He was talking about the guy in Michigan

425
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,815
Earlier

426
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
He might have talked to Alex

427
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
I like

428
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,215
Proud this dude was that got it before

429
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:58,431
He is he is getting information before even Alex Jones like he's big-time and Alex Jones right that right

430
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
Take a nap

431
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
It's 2 in the morning

432
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
Even if he is

433
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
100

434
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
Accent makes

435
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
Everything's.

436
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Wrong

437
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
We'll also

438
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
The pronoun

439
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
And I think it's important

440
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
Cuz I am I believe

441
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
If you spoke to Alex

442
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
Hey Alex what we were talking about

443
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
The guy in Michigan or is it humid out

444
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
I don't think

445
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
Heating contract

446
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
The meaning of the wrestler

447
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:39,391
About the power plant situation while we were talking about yesterday in Kentucky

448
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,207
Call me about a power plant

449
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Exactly

450
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,583
And listen here

451
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
I'm talkin about

452
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
We have confirmation

453
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:57,567
When given the order they will shut this one down in that article that you were talking about about that

454
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
Paper crane in Pennsylvania

455
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Just goes on to say

456
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
Exact same thing

457
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
So do we use bag

458
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,735
Is him

459
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,039
Michigan

460
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,879
Actually believing that he is part of Alex community

461
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
Yeah okay like

462
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
Like the way that

463
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,815
The the church would say that as a possibility also

464
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
He goes on to say that there's a

465
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
Michigan

466
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,983
That it when given the order

467
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,567
They will shut it down which means what

468
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
The globalist

469
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Will be sick

470
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Right

471
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
That's what it has to mean in his mind

472
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,295
Even though that is literally what would happen is

473
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319
Your Superior

474
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
Put say

475
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,439
You would

476
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,071
Pennsylvania

477
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:56,191
This is something that comes up over and over again on this episode

478
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
The most interesting

479
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
Is that because

480
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,103
People keep calling in and saying wild s***

481
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,151
Never challenges

482
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
He never died

483
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,991
There is never been

484
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,807
Perhaps a day that we knew in advance

485
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,135
Was going to be f***** up more than

486
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,000
Y2K

487
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
I'm going to be careful about things I believe

488
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
On this day

489
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Because

490
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
Everyone

491
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Kind of full of s***

492
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,496
My I remember this

493
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056
I was 13

494
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,848
Started

495
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
Putting water

496
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
In the freezer

497
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
Like like

498
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
Incase

499
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,272
Yeah and I remember thinking

500
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
Or at least

501
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
Tell myself I remember that

502
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
That's not going to help

503
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:54,560
Go back

504
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,936
Maybe two days were the water we're going to have to forage sooner or later

505
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,008
Is reading books about 4

506
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,896
As it goes in these disaster scenarios

507
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Most of the time

508
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
You only really have to wait out about a Wii

509
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
R2 before like

510
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
Most people are dead

511
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,416
This is zombie apocalypse

512
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,280
Discussing fear p*** that these weirdos who come on Alex's show talk about all the time

513
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,352
Survival food

514
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,888
And that'll get you through like

515
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
You know

516
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,448
Two weeks and that's when all the

517
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
The Lawless people would have killed

518
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,824
Each other off and you know if you have the food it's the difference between

519
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
Being able to

520
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
To sit around at home

521
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,480
With the family or after go out and fight

522
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
Now

523
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:50,112
One thing about the zombie apocalypse narrative that these guys totally share

524
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
Which is

525
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:58,304
Absolutely jerk off to the fantasy that day would be the Lone Survivor

526
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,656
You're basically saying is like

527
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:09,312
If if she does go down it's a good thing that we have you Alex Jones and the rest of us who can sell

528
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,896
Play our first commercial break

529
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:17,248
Commercial break of the Y2K show

530
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,904
Potential wife in case

531
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,304
Interruptions of services

532
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,352
Can a whole food Reserve

533
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Yep

534
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,936
So was that the picture

535
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
You start to get the picture of what's going on

536
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
Spreading fear

537
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,616
And all this idea of like ohmygodyes disaster is happening

538
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
Is going down

539
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
Triple A

540
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Years

541
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
And right up to it

542
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,808
He's been Hawking survival food

543
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
Okay

544
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:59,232
Is he selling the food is that

545
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:03,584
Company that selling company

546
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:11,008
Because I like I thought commercial

547
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,312
Another ad later which is even more.

548
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
But

549
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
So

550
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:19,456
This meeting is going to keep water from overflowing in a stadium

551
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,576
How you know your words

552
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:28,672
Power plants later in the Navy get another update on

553
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
Something else around the world

554
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,720
Another caller

555
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,816
Also reported local person Karthik on TNN

556
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:41,728
A power plant has been blown up in Oregon okay we need to get to Iran

557
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,032
Studios at gtmo

558
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
Checking out the boy

559
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
Printing folded

560
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
Now man this is happen

00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,296
On local repeaters verified it

563
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,000
Here is a known

564
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,304
Cif-ss

565
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
Blackburn Wayside

566
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,680
Turn on the fact that we need to go ahead and report the truth but

567
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
Sure warm people are aware

568
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
Yeah

569
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:24,736
Support the troops know what are you say

570
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,528
Set a report

571
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
The truth

572
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
Something that is him

573
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,392
His hand a little too far

574
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,440
That is if it causes a panic

575
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
So be it

576
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
Should have warned them earlier

577
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,840
When he is the only person

578
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,680
Who's out there in the man like in the grand scheme of things

579
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,008
Staying all this crazy b******* and letting these

580
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,800
Whack job colors

581
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:53,408
Dictate what he believes organ explosion

582
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Didn't happen

583
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
No

584
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,504
It wasn't reported in any

585
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
You know real

586
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,808
Media

587
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,136
Tell him that someone told him that happened

588
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,672
And he doesn't challenge

589
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,096
Are are sharks color screen

590
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,192
They have to be right or is it only his

591
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,752
I don't know actually

592
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Clearly

593
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,360
I have zero

594
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
Ever changed

595
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,456
Yeah when they talk about

596
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Global is

597
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,808
Whenever they insinuate things that disagree with him

598
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,184
Very rarely

599
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,232
Righttime he just screams

600
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,608
Because I remember listening to Handy's radio show

601
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,912
My grandfather

602
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,960
Which I remember as

603
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
It's just the greatest

604
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,312
Sure

605
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,872
Is he Hannity's kind of

606
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,176
He would often bring those people on

607
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,992
Because then he could really go off on

608
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,088
And that's what was really excited but actually know this

609
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
Document

610
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,464
But unconfirmed source.

611
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
We have a number of friends

612
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
To work

613
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
Doing fake calls

614
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
The radio show

615
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,544
And like if you listen to DriveTime radio in morning radio almost

616
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,848
People call in and like

617
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,176
Morning DJs are doing bits with them and stuff like that

618
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
For the most part

619
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
Notion

620
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,368
Didn't know that you just destroyed my whole world like thirty-five $40 a call or some

621
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,464
Like that we have a number of friends I'll tell you off are who they are and what their business

622
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,512
Chemistry

623
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
Really really dirty

624
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
That's

625
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,400
That's what a lot of radio station

626
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
Because no one

627
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
Most people don't call in

628
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:58,592
Are usually crazy wonder about that because I

629
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,664
Image of somebody driving

630
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
DriveTime ratings

631
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,784
Somebody's driving and they just like to call this radio show

632
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,600
So they're driving and then pulling all this s***

633
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
Out of there

634
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
So they make me believe

635
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Give that

636
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
The thing with Hannity's

637
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
Yeah it's get these callers any

638
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,376
I have never someone who actually knows their ship

639
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Well

640
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
Coincidentally

641
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:29,312
See that's still kind of makes sense to me if you screen your colors like

642
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,104
The man on the street interviews like

643
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
They're not

644
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,688
People who know exactly what

645
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,296
People who are like that fit that Narrative of

646
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,624
Isn't everybody

647
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,952
Pinpoint about some of the Alex Jones Show that we missed

648
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,280
This week that I just want to tee off on real quick

649
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,072
So a lot of the episodes end up

650
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,632
Starting with like a man on the street

651
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,680
I wish this

652
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,776
They start with someone on the street and what there was one that was like Mark Dice

653
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:07,968
And he was going around

654
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
If I your girlfriend

655
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Pregnant

656
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,112
And someone comes up and just punch her in the stomach.

657
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
Couple times real good

658
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
If she aborts

659
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Is that murder

660
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,280
The complicated Quest

661
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:26,144
No one else has given any of that nuance

662
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Yes

663
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
To kick it out of her belly is it not murder

664
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,872
Cuz nobody else was

665
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
Is different baby

666
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
So she still acting

667
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
Upon the baby

668
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
As if she were punching herself in

669
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
Okay

670
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:54,048
That is that is an interesting that an interesting argument

671
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
It's murder

672
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
Necessarily

673
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
I think it's

674
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
A brutal assault

675
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,640
But it's a brutal assault from the guy onto her

676
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,176
It made her unable to

677
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
The carry the baby

678
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
It's not that

679
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,296
He's attacking the baby at all

680
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
He's attacking

681
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
Yeah but

682
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
He's punching her in the stomach

683
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
Multiple times

684
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
Yeah

685
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
Where is this guy coming

686
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,328
Crazy Town

687
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
No Doubt

688
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,216
So he's punching the baby now I do think you're right in

689
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
In saying that it's not murder

690
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,824
Can you murder something that doesn't have

691
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,664
Or or even the the idea of conch

692
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,456
Now that's where it gets complicated

693
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,504
It's outside the scope of the man on the street

694
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,904
A man on the street interview

695
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,536
Aldi's little debate with coffee

696
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:01,120
Prophecy wine

697
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
Shut up

698
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,984
Reactors

699
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,264
All these power plants

700
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
We're having trouble

701
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,592
You know all around the country

702
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,152
Did what

703
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,480
Being challenged

704
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
So

705
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,296
Incredibly frustrating

706
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
Because

707
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
You asked why would he

708
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
Angers me

709
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Even the question

710
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,768
Because if you are

711
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
A journalist

712
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
If you are someone who

713
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
Do people listen

714
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,168
You have a responsibility not to throw bullshiter

715
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Especially

716
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,288
On a day like Y2K when everyone is on it

717
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
Like

718
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
People were on it

719
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
They shouldn't have been

720
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,200
But they were people were buying into it

721
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,992
People were hoarding stuff

722
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,272
Like it was happening

723
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
Broadcaster

724
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,648
You do have a certain responsibility to be like

725
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Well

726
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
You know

727
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
Even if you say

728
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
The very unconfirm reports

729
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,888
Play blown up in Oregon we're looking into it

730
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,960
It's probably not true will get back to you when we have confirmation

731
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,008
I feel like that's as far as you can go

732
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,080
Would you like to be called in saying

733
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:20,736
I heard it from a guy like there's only one guy who was watching

734
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,856
But like

735
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,648
Friend who heard it from a friend

736
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
Perform another

737
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
Who are the Oregon

738
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:34,048
We were playing a game of telephone that started with

739
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,376
Yeah

740
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,912
There we go

741
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
From here

742
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
Night was not

743
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
Jump

744
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,616
Actually no let's let's leave that until we could really crazy

745
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,408
Okay well the night was not just

746
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176
What about power play

747
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,712
Lance though the night also had

748
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:56,832
Various flavors Airport

749
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,112
And power plants are still beautiful

750
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
Yes

751
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,952
Do plants came up tonight

752
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,256
It just kept coming up but also throughout was

753
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
A bunch of other

754
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:06,816
Weird

755
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
Weaving storyline

756
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
This introduces

757
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Couple of them

758
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:18,080
Civilians crap in the city Russian heinzerling shot down tanks are being blown to bits

759
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,896
Sorry I should explain

760
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,712
That is in reference to the warrant

761
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
OK Google

762
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
Hundreds of thousands

763
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,112
People are dead

764
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,184
There's another clip that

765
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
That the

766
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Says it

767
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,512
It says all of that

768
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,680
He's talking about how there's more Wars going on now than ever

769
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
Wait here I think

770
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,264
On the day

771
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,360
More Wars going on on December 31st

772
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,640
99 than ever have

773
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,200
No better than ever in the history of the world

774
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
I think this is

775
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Cash machine

776
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,352
Who is known as Vladimir the ruthless

777
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,264
And using profanity on national TV You Name It We won't read the profanity here but we've got it

778
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,824
Unbelievable

779
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
8

780
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:29,504
He is a creature of the IMF and the World Bank and international communism music

781
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
Yes

782
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,064
But also

783
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
Hillary Clinton

784
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,904
Nosy little girls

785
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
Gatorland

786
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,232
It was just

787
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,048
The guy who had the same picture as a

788
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,840
Ghostbusters 2

789
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,168
The person who Alex Jones Now is really getting behind

790
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:51,520
And supporting Millions on Russia's

791
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:55,872
Yeah he was on Russian television being loud by Alexander Dugan

792
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
One of

793
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,944
Putin great advisors

794
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Very close

795
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,832
Alex Jones was on Russian television

796
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,160
And you look like you was going to cry

797
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:15,328
There's a translator

798
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
He was on Russian television

799
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
And this guy Dugan

800
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
Explaining to him that like

801
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,664
Because of you our opinions about America have changed

802
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,456
Like it was just a rim job

803
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Of a segment

804
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,272
Alright they can't f****** believe

805
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:38,112
They're giving him lip service because narcissist

806
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
How

807
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,720
It's a very old trick and Spy game

808
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,024
So they're just like

809
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
Because

810
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,584
The View I say this

811
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,632
Anti-americanism is over

812
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,704
Looks like he's going to cry

813
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,008
Like he's finally got Daddy's approval

814
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,288
It's insane

815
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,824
So is

816
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
Who hog

817
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
On the side of Russia

818
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:06,016
Alex Jones

819
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
Is over

820
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,112
Directly because of your intervention

821
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
Yes

822
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
Okay

823
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,208
Because of you and because of your help you gave to

824
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,256
The Trump you shown us that all Americans

825
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,304
Weaselly dick

826
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:23,168
I'm paraphrasing a little bit you can find Alex Jones

827
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
It's on

828
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,960
The Infowars

829
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
I Channel on YouTube

830
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,056
You can find it

831
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,360
Absolute insanity

832
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
If

833
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:36,480
If I were on Russian television they were saying those things about me first of all I'd be panicking

834
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,552
Hope no one sees it

835
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
This is like

836
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,416
S***

837
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,256
S*** rush I think I'm awesome

838
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,704
Is the nickname of this podcast so

839
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
Like a demon

840
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:05,664
In Cahoots with the IMs international monetary fund

841
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,944
But he's also

842
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,504
Putting him as one of the heads of the global

843
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
So he is

844
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
Painting Putin as

845
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,624
Part of this Global cabal that he is again

846
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
Hey 1999

847
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,464
Which has now completely

848
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
Former KGB head

And this information is vital ladies and gentlemen we are seeing the New World Order

00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,264
I really come out in full force more Wars that have been the last 50 years are going on right now

851
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,872
Now report 2009

00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552
100000

854
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
You make those claims

855
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Which is

856
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,232
It's a lot of people impossible amount of

857
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
That's what that was in reference

858
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,120
Get back

859
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
My Maybe

860
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
But they're not old

861
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,848
4040 South

862
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:13,248
Sorry that everybody flat ground scorched-earth

863
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,320
People are off of

864
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Okay

865
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:22,208
In the city Russian Hinds shot down tanks are being blown to bits

866
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:27,584
Massive agrad unguided rocket attacks are big long, City industry

867
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,984
Air and artillery bombardment as well

868
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,784
Clear plant has been shut down one of the main system transferring the power from its failed

869
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:02,400
So you went to the commercial with that sort of terrifying

870
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,824
Bellevue place

871
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,480
Random places

872
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
Like

873
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:23,648
Didn't know where they're going to go or they just shooting their water at all different directions

874
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,232
But then we come back from

875
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Commercial

876
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:34,656
Minneapolis Minnesota to shortwave is basically downloading them

877
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,240
Production of another narrative

878
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,544
The Narrative of

879
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
The government

880
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,104
Is trying to take out radio 6

881
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
Okay

882
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Throughout the night

883
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Which

884
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
Alex Jones

885
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:55,392
We'll get a little bit love you

886
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:01,792
In Washington DC has set up a huge 50 million-dollar command bunker hooked into all the female boxers that can pay

887
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
Take over

888
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
All the shortwave

889
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,120
By Broadcasting

890
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:08,448
What the f*** is that the central government

891
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:12,544
Also known

892
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,152
Because we should operate under maritime law

893
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
Or whatever

894
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
Did they

895
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
That day

896
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
Also

897
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,368
That's not much for a bunker

898
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,768
Bunker

899
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,376
Set up

900
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,472
Because on

901
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,008
On Y2K

902
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
Just bladimir

903
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Shrek

904
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:54,016
Marshall AM FM stations as well as television broadcast.

905
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
Activate tab

906
00:40:55,552 --> 00:41:01,696
Yeah but he's afraid to take out all AM FM stations television as well he goes a little bit

907
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,464
Further into this

908
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,048
Why would they take out all the am and FM

909
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,608
Cuz they don't want Alex jumping on any of those stations

910
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,056
Communicate special

911
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Patriots

912
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:26,272
Communicating on AM FM radio or just radio

913
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
CB Ray

914
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,184
Maybe I mean I don't know I don't know enough about radio waves

915
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,744
But I'm guessing that's one of the

916
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,352
Okay okay

917
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,680
So he is once again

918
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,984
Whatever it is

919
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,800
As we as I refer to it on the last episode

920
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
Think I'm going to keep on

921
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,199
Keeping on with it

922
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:03,391
It's just paranoia scat this coming out in this case Ella Fitzgerald

923
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,695
In this case it's clear that it's not random

924
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,999
These are the Spheres that

925
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,023
The people have

926
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
Antojitos

927
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,839
Amplifying them playing into

928
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,655
Like that

929
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
Now I will give him

930
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
That on

931
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,495
January 1st

932
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
A2000

933
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,567
Boris Yeltsin

934
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
Yes and that broke

935
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
New Year's Eve

936
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
So

937
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:29,503
The idea of being scared about this Putin guy

938
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,063
He's worthless

939
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
Although if

940
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:40,255
If your name is Vladimir you do have to have a after that with whatever like

941
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,583
Vladimir the Impaler

942
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,631
My editor

943
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
You know.

944
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,983
Wonderful mycampus editor in college

945
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,567
My wrote for the student paper her middle name was Vladimir

946
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:02,271
I don't give a s*** about gladimir Vladimir the editor

947
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,647
He was better than what

948
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,439
I think I actually know another Rush

949
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
Asian girl who's

950
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,231
Middle name is Vladimir

951
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,559
That's a pretty weird

952
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:17,375
What is

953
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Vladimir

954
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,191
Tell me their name

955
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,799
Right

956
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,127
And you can't say the name Vladimir without putting us up blank

957
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,599
He's talking about someone who's giving him information

958
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,159
Are you starting this clip off talking about someone who

959
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,719
Is feeding him information that you will see

960
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
That he plays his normal game

961
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
Feels like does he give

962
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,399
A name to any Source at any point in time

963
00:43:54,239 --> 00:44:00,383
Want to former military Pizza on radio company

964
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,919
Nope nope

965
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,711
But also we learned

966
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,015
We learned that

967
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:11,391
We also learned a lot of former military people now on radio station

968
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:25,471
Powerpool Cold War in the North Pole

969
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:31,615
Origin

970
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,943
A 9.4000 up to nine point

971
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:43,135
Everywhere right now.

972
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
Superpower

973
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,999
Radar systems nuclear systems up and perhaps our military

974
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:52,095
Is refused

975
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:55,167
It's now backup from people that actually worked in there

976
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:58,495
We have a confirm from The Sound where it's coming from from experts

977
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,799
Meme

978
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,591
Well one

979
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,431
Win 4

980
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:10,527
1999 when did the Cold War end

981
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,551
To him

982
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
Never

983
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,367
Okay well no no

984
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
This year

985
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,439
M1919

986
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:21,279
2726

987
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,327
Okay

988
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,863
So we have

989
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
Okay

990
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,191
Why would they put

991
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,799
Disrupt

992
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
Technology

993
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,383
In the North Pole on the northeast

994
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,431
Santa Claus is real

995
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,967
I think he thinks Maybe

996
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
There

997
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,647
So let's just let's just work let's just go throughout this whole thing

998
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,463
Yeah cuz there's so many pieces

999
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:53,791
Because he

1000
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
Brilliantly

1001
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,471
A later one of you one of those things

1002
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,751
Is going to hit one purse

1003
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
Power plant

1004
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
This is actually going to be

1005
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,383
Be out to Pennsylvania

1006
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,663
It was really

1007
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:13,759
Let's just keep mischaracterizing power plant

1008
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
Which Are we more afraid of

1009
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
Okay

1010
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,695
So we got

1011
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,767
Powerful cold war-era

1012
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,815
Destructor

1013
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:33,471
What does from the Cold War era they didn't even have f****** planes

1014
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,543
It's because the short-wave signals

1015
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,079
Aren't that sophisticated

1016
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
So it's good

1017
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,687
If this old-time system that can shut down

1018
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,967
Am and FM

1019
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,247
Shortwave radio

1020
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,391
Have you seen a lost

1021
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,975
No I haven't seen lost that's another thing that I have not seen

1022
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,743
Great show

1023
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,815
Okay there's a whole thing

1024
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,839
In a season where there's a

1025
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
Signal disruptor

1026
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,423
On the island so they can't get radio off the island

1027
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,959
Because this

1028
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
This lady had

1029
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
Signal jammer

1030
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,311
I think that's what Alex Jones thinks of happen

1031
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
The signal

1032
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,663
Going out of the entire world

1033
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:17,247
So so if it's on the North Pole

1034
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:20,575
He believes that it can then reach the entire world

1035
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,751
Yeah you're you know what you're right

1036
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
We all know that

1037
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,615
The South Pole

1038
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,431
The North Pole is up

1039
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,711
That makes perfect

1040
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,575
I don't know what the

1041
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,343
The logic

1042
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,135
Is there other than

1043
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,463
Got to say something

1044
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Me some

1045
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Internal logic

1046
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
To that long

1047
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,143
Cuz that's just a long list of

1048
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,703
Different things for you to be afraid of

1049
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,239
None of them are connected

1050
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,543
Did to each other in any way other than he

1051
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,823
He thinks they're all happening

1052
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,639
Orchestrated by the same

1053
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,175
People like globalist

1054
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,223
Iran Bill Clinton

1055
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:24,319
Disable the Cold War other stuff

1056
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
But not this

1057
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,999
But that's

1058
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,071
Call Doris.

1059
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,143
Okay

1060
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:46,079
Cold War by first rap album

1061
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,151
I think the picture that we start to come up with

1062
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
And we have

1063
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
To deal with

1064
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,247
Is that maybe scaring people

1065
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,319
Maybe it is

1066
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,599
Not fun

1067
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,623
Inversion of War of the

1068
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,183
Basically is what we're bogged down in

1069
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,255
What were the world that it was artistic

1070
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:08,095
It was that's true Orson Welles is pretty good dude that was trolling

1071
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
This is not

1072
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
This is

1073
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,703
And we'll get to again why

1074
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,727
I'm a hundred percent

1075
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,079
At our next commercial break

1076
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,615
Can't get out it's like

1077
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:23,199
This is a whole doctor Strangelove situation

1078
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,735
It is like okay

1079
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,295
They put their Cold War stuff on the North Pole

1080
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,343
There's only one way to fight against

1081
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,439
On the bottom

1082
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,839
Do you want to be afraid of s'more stuff

1083
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,375
Hot ladies

1084
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,911
And gentlemen

1085
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:49,311
A police and military are on high alert running around looking for supposed Boogeyman and I would have given anything

1086
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,335
For him to stop

1087
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,639
With ladies

1088
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,687
Ladies

1089
00:49:54,943 --> 00:50:01,087
Do this for the ladies

1090
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:07,487
Usher concert

1091
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,583
Hot lady

1092
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:17,983
And I believe the military are on high alert running around looking for supposed Boogeyman in

1093
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,519
Paris under every Rock

1094
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,335
Military are highly visible now

1095
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:26,943
Military equipment moving into Austin

1096
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,319
Are two nights ago on Wednesday night the Fox News reported that the airport will be used as a Mastiff

1097
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:37,695
Holding facility for troublemakers for Riders here in Austin that has no history of riots

1098
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,791
They need to get that country lockdown so they could save the election

1099
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,815
Vladimir Putin

1100
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,495
Okay

1101
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,151
So the military is

1102
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
Highly visible

1103
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
Highly

1104
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,247
Highly visible in Austin Texas

1105
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,551
Occupied Austin

1106
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,159
In case of a riot

1107
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:12,255
Even though there's no history of riots

1108
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,535
The airport

1109
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,583
Yeah they're older

1110
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,983
I don't have the key

1111
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,991
Broadcast

1112
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:37,087
All the Blazer the sky gets a call and they like hate

1113
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:44,255
Let's be aware there's other countries we need to be afraid of two

1114
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:50,655
Great Cyclone we're all going to

1115
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,239
China exist in Germany pretty weird too

1116
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
The crazy thing

1117
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,567
He's one hundred percent correct about Vladimir Putin

1118
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:04,223
AAA like low-level

1119
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:08,831
Country

1120
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,111
I would posit that

1121
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,391
He's right big picture

1122
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,023
Globalist

1123
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,815
Chill and all that is

1124
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,607
Not really backed up by anything

1125
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,399
But yeah

1126
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:27,007
Be concerned about it

1127
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,799
Only Alex Jones

1128
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,615
That's not true exactly

1129
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,943
So

1130
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
Let's go

1131
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,599
Where did that come from

1132
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,135
Where did

1133
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,695
Even got to take guitar

1134
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
San Antonio

1135
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,375
I can't play the clip yet but that will be

1136
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:01,567
That's really the only way.

1137
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
Add to the answer

1138
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
Is that

1139
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:10,015
So maybe you're wondering

1140
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,343
Jordan maybe you're wondering what's going on around

1141
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,159
Absolutely wondering where else

1142
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:25,375
Christian report

1143
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,399
Excellent

1144

1331
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599

1332
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
Consortium

1333
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,903
Answer

1334
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,719
Deceive

1335
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,999
Conflict

1336
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,791
Beginning of every episode

1337
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,863
They don't ever disclose this

1338
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,215
Not even when Anderson was on the show

1339
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,239
As a guess

1340
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,055
He was on and they talked about how great an

1341
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,359
Gold one

1342
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:50,687
Even talked about how they're all in a rat king

1343
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,223
Like

1344
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:55,039
Financial entanglement it's insane

1345
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
Yeah but

1346
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,343
I feel like now.

1347
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,367
What is literally

1348
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,415
Play every media

1349
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,791
And also I mentioned this on the last step

1350
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
Bring backup

1351
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,607
Midas resources

1352
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,935
This is the company that now sells the weird help

1353
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,983
You can go to their website

1354
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:19,103
It's Midas resources.com

1355
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,127
Creative

1356
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:20,895
Supported

1357
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,687
And vouched for by a Veterinary

1358
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,735
Veterinarian

1359
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,551
Anti weird new AG doctor

1360
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,367
I actually did some research into him between episodes

1361
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,135
Arizona

1362
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,159
Confirm that I wasn't talk

1363
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:37,279
I'm not quite the thing that I also found out that

1364
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:40,863
Is that the guy went to the same College

1365
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,191
We're both alumni of University of Missouri

1366
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,983
So bad

1367
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,007
You never answer

1368
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,823
Is he a good veterinarian

1369
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,359
You the best

1370
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:56,223
What if he's a really good veterinarian

1371
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,503
I'm more likely

1372
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:00,831
To buy bolshit products Veterinary

1373
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,415
Super good veterinarian dietary medicine in college

1374
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,743
Same brother

1375
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:12,607
Because I just barely graduated

1376
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:18,239
Let's be clear that's better than me I never graduated let's be clear it took me five years and I had to come

1377
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,007
The fake major

1378
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,311
I got out

1379
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:24,383
Veterinarian

1380
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,151
I wish I was

1381
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
F****** Wallach

1382
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,455
Richer than me

1383
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,831
He's basically but that's the same shift the Doctor Oz

1384
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,623
It's like he's not better than

1385
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:37,951
No but I'm not judging

1386
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,231
Remind me

1387
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,047
We are now on I

1388
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:48,703

Now on iTunes

1393
01:06:56,895 --> 01:07:01,503
I don't want to say cuz I would never say this

1394
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,807
I don't want to say that we're the only source of information

1395
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,879

1396
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,903

Nope

1400
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,191
Who's God

1401
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,471
I don't know I did

01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:24,031
I didn't look but then also acknowledged

1403
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,567
69

1404
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,103
But it's too many

1405
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,223
You can only get one number past knowledge

1406
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,575

1407

Got all of it

1411
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:46,559
Yeah we got we got some social media

1412
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,631
I think this has really came about because

1413
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,703
You are you like you were talking about it worth

1414
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,263
You know if we get a lot of viewers on the YouTube

1415
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,311
You said that

1416
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,871
Sweden

1417
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,455
But but that's

1418
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:07,551
That's it quickly spiraled out of control for yours like

1419
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,087
This has to be if I can

1420
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:13,695
I just love doing it to a lot of positive feedback

1421
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,719
Twitter

1422
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,487
And

1423
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:19,071
Really enjoyed

1424
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,959
Are we are we done

1425
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,263
Music

1426
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:33,919
Could you edit in some Saved by the Bell music.

1427
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,783
Realized I forgot

1428
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:45,439
So now unfortunately.

1429
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,231
Unfortunately I have some bad news.

1430
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
What's up

1431
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:52,607
Debit

1432
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:59,007
Bright lights in Elizabeth

1433
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:04,127
I hope it's not okay

1434
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,943
First of all

1435
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:11,295
If you are going to do a nuclear First Strike if you pick

1436
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,063
Austin first

1437
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,623
You have no idea where anybody in America

1438
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,671
Well if you

1439
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,463
Carsmart

1440
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,767
Okay you know

1441
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,791
First of course

1442
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,327
Cuz you're the only one

1443
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,119
Is the head of patriot

1444
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,399
You understand

1445
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,959
He's the bellwether

1446
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:32,543
As goes Alex Jones so goes the nation

1447
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,335
Very first words worth

1448
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,151
They reserve the right to First Strike

1449
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,431
Can you just do that

1450
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:39,967
Mom

1451
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:46,367
Reserve the right like you don't call the restaurant advance

1452
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,647
If you

1453
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,183
I'm going to

1454
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,463
Signal that I'm going to take

1455
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
The first Reich

1456
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:54,047
Wouldn't you surprise people

1457
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,327
Unabomber

1458
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,399
What are you talkin about

1459
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:03,775
Oh yeah

1460
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,103
Some 2,000

1461
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,383
Do you got in a little bit

1462
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,479
He's a yeah

1463
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,503
Yeah

1464
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:21,695
Missile fan never asked myself out more

1465
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,535
Reserve the right for

1466
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,351
Strike and then this other voice

1467
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,631
And he's like

1468
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,935
I hope those five missiles are coming towards

1469
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,031
Yeah

1470
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,079
He is God

1471
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,615
Gorgeous

1472
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:40,895
A little bit later

1473
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,711
Okay

1474
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,295
The Narrative it takes over and sort of

1475
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,599
Of course

1476
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,159
Clinton said he would absorb the first

1477
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:53,951
We will

1478
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,071
He's not the he's not

1479
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:04,191
Or he's not just some guy jumping on a grenade

1480
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:07,775
This is unconventional but I propose we have a cigarette

1481
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,383
Let's do this

1482
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,735
Concentrate

1483
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,807
So Focus that you were about to light up cigarettes

1484
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:24,671
You know I do hope this conversation

1485
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,207
Smoke

1486
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,047
A part of it is that

1487
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
We got a long

1488
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,863
Okay

1489
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,471
Smoking with you got them

1490
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:40,031
It's my way of family

1491
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,079
Smoking

1492
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,127
Suggest teenagers

1493
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,967
Reynolds and George Soro

1494
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:53,087
This is a little bit of explanation of what he was talking about with those five

1495
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:57,183
Protocol time we appreciate

1496
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,999
Who tells us that they're currently missiles being launched

1497
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:06,399
What's going on

1498
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:16,383
Cheyenne Mountain

1499
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,175
Five nickels at Willow Lawn

1500
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:24,831
He wouldn't say where they were about that

1501
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:25,855
Nichols at 1

1502
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:32,255
Our general is out in front of our tryan Mountain tell me all this

1503
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:38,655
They were going or whatever coming from

1504
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:42,751
We're going through what kind of meclizine you could I can't give out that information

1505
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,287
First of all I want to say this

1506
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
Some pretty important

1507
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:46,847
Information to give out

1508
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,615
Absolutely

1509
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,663
I think

1510
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,479
Information because I don't

1511
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,039
Nowell

1512
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:56,831
I feel like it

1513
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,391
If there was a history book that did

1514
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,671
Have

1515
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:04,255
I think that is

1516
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,279
Probably a mass

1517
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,375
An actual news

1518
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,423
And we'll get to why I believe

1519
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,751
There was a news report

1520
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,799
And a bunch of people misinterpreted

1521
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,847
But I mean

1522
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,407
The reason I wasn't

1523
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,991
The reason I wanted to take a pause was because I wanted to give

1524
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:25,759
The co-host

1525
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,551
Two props

1526
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,831
But I'm going to give him

1527
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,135
I don't know who he is I don't know his name

1528
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,927
But he

1529
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,463
I like that

1530
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,743

1531
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,071
I like the idea of him being like

1532
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,399
Itsfunneh

1533
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,679

1534
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:47,519
Contesting the story

1535
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,823
Hey we didn't hear about that

1536
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:54,175
Maybe and then he's like tell us more

1537
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,455
Almost invalidating

1538
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,527
He's close to it because he's like funny didn't hear about that

1539
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,295
But

1540
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,111
He got a message

1541
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:02,879
In his ear

1542
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671

01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,560

1660
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:40,960
Or something like that

1661
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,984

How did space command come about

1694
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,488
Okay

1695
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,072
You able to Google space command you're not going to get something

1696
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:43,840

It's not cold space

1705
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:13,792
What is closer if it was real

1706
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,584
It would totally be shortened

1707
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,424
If you want it's like the Affordable Care Act

1708
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,960
Yeah you know what let's be in

1709
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,984
Entirely Fair

1710
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,264
Yeah

1711
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:29,152
Silly name but it is what you were we are 100% wrong on this ladies and gentlemen

1712
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,432
We're not a hundred

1713
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:33,504
Wrong in making fun of

1714
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,528
We're not even wrong

1715
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:39,136
Complete disbelief

1716
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,696
Our our head

1717
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:46,048
Was going towards this guy thought it was on the moon like Moonraker

1718
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,072
So yeah

1719
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:49,376
But I mean of the North American Aerospace defense

1720
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,912
Command is just NORAD

1721
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,448
So NORAD

1722
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,496
Slang term for that would be

1723
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,264
Space command

1724
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,336
Okay now 100% right

1725
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,616
We're in the middle

1726
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:08,576
If we're if we're going to be anti Alex Jones

1727
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,600
When were wrong

1728
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:12,160
And then need to bounce back

1729
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,464
Fitbit that we are actually write all the

1730
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,000
I'm okay with that

1731
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,560
Because history has borne out

1732
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,888
And second of all

1733
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,448
Placemats didn't take over everything

1734
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,496
See there that if you know what

1735
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,544
How can we be sure

1736
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,336
I guess we can't you know

1737
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:33,152
To see the Arkansas

1738
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:38,272
Transportation on the road and sources are telling us that

1739
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,552
These people

1740
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,112
Might have signed my girlfriend

1741
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,416
Know someone

1742
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:50,816
Still doesn't believe me

1743
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,400
Nope she was

1744
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,192
Alright

1745
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:58,240
At every point

1746
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,544
Not on board

1747
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,104
She has a friend who told her about signs

1748
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,384
Now she's on board

1749
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,944
Anyways every weather

1750
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,064
Exactly what this clip is but it's scary

1751
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,624
Things up

01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:16,928
An explanation of

1754
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:17,696
Why you do

1755
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,512
Carolyn

Q Park

1761
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:44,064
Eternity is plunging a dollar in Japanese yen

1762
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,880
Market on the

Alright okay

1774
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:33,216
Bizarre behavior American standing up as Russia threatened to attack us with nuclear weapons

1775
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,752
As we were power plants

1776
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,056
At least water being shut down

1777
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:37,824
Stop

1778
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:42,688
And the military runs around with the police and the FBI Chang terrorism is eminence

1779
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:44,736
Han

1780
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,808
Someone characterized us is dangerous because we report the facts

1781
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,112
Absolutely

1782
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,392

1785
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
Out of

1786
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:59,584
How f****** amazing is it

1787
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,608
Just cuz we were poor thing

1788
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
Facts

1789
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,008
Although

1790
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,544
Time ago

1791
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,080
Yeah okay

1792
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,920
China and Russia have reserved the right

1793
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:14,944
First Strike us

1794
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:15,968
With nuclear war

1795
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,248
Tricom

1796
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:20,832
Let's leave that as being an insane

1797
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:25,184
Like why would they do that

1798
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,744
Does he ever give an explanation for why they would

1799
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:31,840
Why they would do this why do stripers because no

1800
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,376
Not be a first strike

1801
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,144
If they

1802
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,680
Didn't have a reason for it

1803
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,472
But their only reason is

1804
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,520
Clinton has already said that

1805
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,288
The first strike

1806
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,824
Okay whatever

1807
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:47,200
Alright p**** communist

1808
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:50,272
Clinton is willing to not destroy the world yet

1809
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,832
They now know that they can

1810
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,136
REI

01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:58,208
So even though even then right

1812
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,000
So that the first strike

1813
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,536
It's not like

1814
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,304

Cuz this is all straight out of

01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:31,232
A lot of it is basically the like

1822
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:37,632
This is what we're doing to other countries ironic like born in the u.s.a.

Alright

1833
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,008
So because Clinton

1834
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:17,824
Supposed

1835
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,128
And their currency is dropped

1836
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,248
Which okay

1837
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,784
Pound and the Japanese Yen

1838
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,880
But those are neither of the two countries

1839
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,976
So-so

1840
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,768
They're going to first strike

1841
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,120
Maybe a rogue actress point

1842
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,936
And they take out

1843
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:49,056
Justice

1844
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,408
Does he not understand the mutually assured destruction

1845
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:57,760
Places then we have no capability

1846
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,648
I think we thought

1847
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:09,024
You think that we put all of our missiles in d.c. I'm a little bit red wine drunk

1848
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,608
And I'm confident that we've always thought

1849
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:18,240
I'm a hundred percent sure pretty sure only only the only New York

1850
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,544
Only our largest population Center

1851
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
Have nuclear

1852
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,128
I don't even

1853
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:25,152
Think that they have them

1854
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,040
The other places

1855
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,576
Do you want to put that

1856
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,368
See that's what you're missing

1857
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,696
Alright all of China's nuclear weapons are in Beijing

1858
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,768
Okay weapons are in Moscow

1859
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,328
That is where you build

1860
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,632
But then what

1861
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,400
You can move them

1862
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,936

Not occur to me

1866
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,336
Or either

1867
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,640
OSHA

1868
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:58,176
Somehow

1869
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,712
You have outsmarted

1870
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:03,552
I don't know what's going on right now

1871
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,880
All right you might be asked

1872
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:07,648
And yourself

1873
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:08,928
A little bit

1874
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:11,232
This is the problem with this app

1875
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,256
Episode

1876
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:15,840
At no point does anybody breakdown after the five missiles

1877
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:19,936
No no no you know what they do do

1878
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:21,984
Never

1879
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,008
Get to the bottom of

1880
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:25,056
There's never a point where they're like

1881
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,616
Is bulshit sorry about that nothing

1882
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:29,408
Move Along

1883
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:34,016
Move on to the next thing to be really afraid of

1884
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:35,808
Being the

Make you afraid of Y2K

1888
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,816
Really

1889
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:49,376
It's all

1890
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,400
No because

1891
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,680
It's all about the globalist

1892
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,728
2K bug-eyed

1893
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,264
Idea in order to push the

1894
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,288
Their agenda

1895
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,824
And create false flag

1896
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,872
Okay now you might be asking

1897
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:00,640
Can yourself

1898
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:02,944
Would love to be asked

1899
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,016
Why

1900
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,064
Are we finding all of these

1901
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,856
Truths all these

1902
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,136
Power plant

1903
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,952
All these people dying in Chester

1904
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:14,976
100000

1905
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:15,744
People dying

1906
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:18,048
All of the

1907
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,072
The five missiles

1908
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,864
The gas being out everywhere

1909
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,704
Are the five senses the water being off the shelf

1910
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,728
Everywhere

1911
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,776
The power grid going down various

1912
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,544
Places

1913
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,848
The shortwave radio going

1914
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:35,200
The North Pole why doesn't everyone know

1915
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,992
I want to know why everybody

1916
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,256
30

1917
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:51,328
Relegated to the Backpage

1918
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:04,640
We worship

1919
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,944
Out of control

1920
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:13,344
Not on Fox News I showed the old airport Robert Mueller right the middle of town

1921
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:20,000
Montego Bay airport

1922
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,984
Mac Show

1923
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:36,384
Barbed wire fence side of the hangers Michael and Shackles On The Ground concrete

1924
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,664
Give me the ground

1925
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:50,976
3000 years ago

1926
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,512
Texas in their defense

1927
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:53,792
Slavery

1928
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,376
This

1929
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,400
Clip is amazing

1930
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:03,008
Because it's basically

1931
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:05,312
But then we got on that

1932
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,592
To be the main point

1933
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,616
Does seem to be the main

1934
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:10,432
No we got to talk about this airport Hangar again

1935
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,456
Also

1936
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:16,832
But only in Austin

1937
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,600
Philly flights

1938
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:18,880
See the garbage

1939
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:19,648
Reflect

1940
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,440
Better Sun worshippers

1941
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:22,464
That would be

1942
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,560
What is that what is that even

1943
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:32,960
Close to a reference to solar power or is that just a dude nothing like Illuminati

1944
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:39,360
Every

1945
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:40,640
Also by the way

1946
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:41,920
If you guys

1947
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,200
Want some fun

1948
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,504
Look into

1949
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,832
Like the real story of Alex Jones breaking

1950
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,136
The

1951
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,160
Bohemian

1952
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,440
It's amazing

1953
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,976
He broke into the beach

1954
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:59,072
I do I do know about the Bohemian Grove

1955
01:34:59,328 --> 01:34:59,840
The Bohemia

1956
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,632
This is how he came into

1957
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,912
That's how we got on

1958
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,288
He broke into Bohemian Grove and videotape

1959
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,056
The Cremation

1960
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:09,824
Pierce Arrow

1961
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:14,176
Which is where they sacrifice a baby

1962
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:16,480
Do the giant Stone owl Mala

1963
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,296
Alright

1964
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,088
And

1965
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,160
Kia

1966
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,184
So he caught

1967
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,744
On tape Yaya

1968
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,560
Yeah there's this documentary about it you can watch

1969
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:32,864
I can't believe it's not in the mainstream

1970
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:38,240
In Austin

1971
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:41,312
Cuz he least like to watch there

1972
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,080
Bright

1973
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:46,944
Bohemian Grove

1974
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,504
It's weird

1975
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,088
But it's not anything that's a damn if you watch the actual video

1976
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,392
Bucked up

1977
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,672
They're they're like

1978
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:59,744
They're talking to a giant owl

1979
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,512
That has one

1980
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:03,072
Walter Cronkite voice coming out of it

1981
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:05,120
Recorded the

1982
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:05,888
Be vocal

1983
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:11,520
Formalogy life science Stone out also recorded the vocals on Young Thug

1984
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,616
The great album my name is

1985
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:19,200
You can hear Walter Cronkite on the back of Pop man with Wyclef Jean

1986
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,856
That's what Molly

1987
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:31,744
Things to do before we go

1988
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,536
The Y2K bug

1989
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:36,096
If I understood correctly

1990
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,120
When it happen

1991
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:39,680
The entire thing was that

1992
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:41,216
Our computer system

1993
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,496
Didn't

1994
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,264
Stan had to go

1995
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:45,824
To the 2,000

1996
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:49,408
Yeah right I was literally everything

1997
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,432
Okay

1998
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,992
Never ever once fear was that once

1999
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,272
I became

2000
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,808
Two instead of one

2001
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:58,368
Our computers weren't built to handle that

2002
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:00,928
And because of that all of our systems would crash

2003
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:04,512
Yeah you'd have like Wall Street Computers crash

2004
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,560
Everything that ran everything crashed

2005
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:09,632
Aqua deck go out

2006
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,912
So that was the big fear

2007
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,680
Okay

2008
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:15,520
Everyone everyone Warehouse film

2009
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:18,848
Yeah how is it that we're having Y2K problems

2010
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:21,152
Before

2011
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,736
The switchover on the clock

2012
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:25,760
What you mean by that

2013
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:29,856
I mean having all these problems

2014
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,416
On all of these

2015
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,696
All the planes are in the sky

2016
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,256
But it's not

2017
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,792
It's like this isn't

2018
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:40,864
Exactly at

2019
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:42,912
Right it's

2020
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:46,240
To figure out

2021
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,032
Here's what I would say

2022
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,080
If I were Alex Jones

2023
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,640
My defense would be

2024
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,688
The globalist

2025
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,456
Floppy

2026
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,296
An hour early

2027
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:02,880
Grateful is a timezone

2028
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:05,440
See that's what I was was my whole life

2029
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:07,232
When Y2K was happen

2030
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,280
And everybody was panicked about it

2031
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,048
I was like

2032
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,840
Guys do you know we're not

2033
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,824
Yeah and I think that would be

2034
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:23,616
A real reasonable thirteen-year-old

2035
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,664
Meanwhile we had a

2036
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,944
30 year old

2037
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:29,504
In Austin

2038
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,344
I mean look we've heard

2039
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,904
This is about where

2040
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,696
We're going to jump off

2041
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,024
You guys get

2042
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:41,792
A pretty

2043
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,328
Here's my summary

2044
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,120
First of all

2045
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,168
Looking at as a performer

2046
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,216
I have to assume Alex

2047
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,568
Really you think so

2048
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:57,664
I have to assume because he had to know that everything he was saying was

2049
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,944
Verifiably false

2050
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,272
That is not a bad

2051
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:03,808
Fair enough

2052
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:09,440
I'm applying my own standards to measuring a bad set by

2053
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,536
The truth that's your measuring the set

2054
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:19,168
Because you retarded you started with the dirt by the audience's reaction

2055
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:22,240
Love you started with the presumption that he was a journalist

2056
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:23,776
I

2057
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:24,800
Do not agree

2058
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:30,688
Ivan Ivan idylis Bill O'Reilly

2059
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,224
Entertainer

2060
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,296
Yeah he's doing is entertaining

2061
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,064
His audience

2062
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:38,880
Nailed it

2063
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:42,720
Yeah probably that was the greatest set of his life

2064
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,816
The night Obama was elected

2065
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:51,936
Rockton

2066
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:56,800
Like he could have been a Madison Square Garden with nothing but the militias

2067
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,080
An absolutely

2068
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,872
Smells like

2069
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:01,408
Sulphur

2070
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:06,272
The clips that we've shown

2071
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,832
Come to a bunch more than we played

2072
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:10,624
It's all just repetition

2073
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:15,744
I think that the indications

2074
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,792
Instead we should all take away from this

2075
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:19,328
Learn is that

2076
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,400
I want to give the benefit

2077
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,216
Alex Jones is a terrible

2078
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:26,496
Terrible

2079
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:27,776
Person

2080
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,312
Because

2081
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,896
He sits on the air when he knows that people are scared

2082
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:34,432
Any help somebody scare

2083
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,712
He takes

2084
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,248
Unverified reports

2085
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,784
From Anonymous callers

2086
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,832
And treats them like they're real

2087
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:43,392
Doesn't treat them like they're

2088
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:46,208
From an anonymous caller

2089
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:46,976
From 2008

2090
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:50,048
That's fair enough and we'll do another podcast about them in the future

2091
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:56,448
From this episode

2092
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:59,264
Here's what I

2093
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,848
Our first episode we went with

2094
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,664
Deck

2095
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:08,480
Whenever we recorded it was that day

2096
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,272
This is

2097
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,296
17 years

2098
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,368
It is the same

2099
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,136
Bulshit

2100
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,928
Yep

2101
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:18,720
However long we've been doing this

2102
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:25,376
He has come at you with the say he's like an apocalypse help like you remember the those guys in

2103
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:27,424
Super specific

2104
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:34,080
Friend who saw.

2105
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,360
Eclipse called that exist

2106
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:37,152
Throughout this

2107
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,456
Men when they're wrong

2108
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,248
Half of them

2109
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,784
Probably kill themselves

2110
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:44,064
But the other half

2111
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:44,832
Just keep

2112
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:48,160
Predicting more apocalypse find new news that change

2113
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,184
Angel eggs

2114
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:55,584
We were going through the whole Kabbalah thing the Bible told us git Outta transversive

2115
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,912
Variable

2116
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:02,752
My specializations he's a religious studies

2117
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,544
Professor specialization

2118
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,312
This revelation

2119
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,080
Apocalypse

2120
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:09,664
Literature and so whenever there are

2121
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,200
These people come out

2122
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:15,040
Resetting the end of the world is next week and also

2123
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,576
People who are closeted

2124
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,928
Whatever they come out

2125
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,208
Whatever these folks

2126
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:24,768
Tell the world that next week everyone's gay

2127
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,840
I mixed it all up there but

2128
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:33,728
Happens over and over again and he'll be

2129
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:36,288
Asked to comment about it on like NPR in

2130
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:39,616
He existed because I was

2131
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,640
A scared child

2132
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:47,296
During some of that there were apocalypse cares but I was always there to be

2133
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:50,880
You're 10

2134
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,672
I can't really explain to you

2135
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,280
I'm thanking God because

2136
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:59,072
It comforted me in a way that

2137
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,864
If my dad was Alex Jones

2138
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,632
He would have

2139
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:02,400
Erik McCoy

2140
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,192
Amazing be

2141
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,216
Because that's a guy who's

2142
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,752
Turn rational like

2143
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:08,032
For my parents

2144
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:10,848
You know they lived during just like that

2145
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:14,944
You do to school and they would show you the

2146
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,224
The day after

2147
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:19,040
Scariest movie at the

2148
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:19,808
Set timer

2149
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:22,112
And then we got Nightmare on Elm

2150
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:29,280
And they were told to get

2151
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:34,144
So good delicious as as a concept of like

2152
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,192
It doesn't get more pacifying

2153
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:41,312
Little bit of wood

2154
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,336
The walls

2155
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,104
Garbage

2156
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,640
That little desk

2157
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,664
F******

2158
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,712
Destructive

2159
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:49,760
The other

2160
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,040
Piece of it

2161
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,344
That was what I was

2162
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:56,672
The other piece of it is

2163
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,440
If your

2164
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:00,768
Adult and you really believe that a new could go off tomorrow

2165
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,328
Telling kids to get under a desk is the right

2166
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:04,864
Because

2167
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,400
There's nothing they can do

2168
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:08,704
And giving them some sort of agency

2169
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,008
Make the kids feel like they have control

2170
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:14,592
And that is very helpful to a kid

2171
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:18,176
In terms of parenting that's the right thing to do.

2172
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:21,248
There were better answer

2173
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,528
But I mean

2174
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:23,808
Listen

2175
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,600
I'm glad that you got this message

2176
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,904
Across the idea that

2177
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:28,928
For 17 years

2178
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:30,720
It's pretty much been the same thing

2179
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:32,256
But the variables have changed

2180
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:36,864
The good guy went before he was so terrible

2181
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,168
The illusion of him

2182
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,192
Growing as

2183
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:40,960
Broadcast

2184
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:42,240
Is that

2185
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,544
The boogeyman always

2186
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,336
They have to

2187
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,104
You feel like

2188
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,920
He is also still relevant

2189
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:51,456
Yeah even though he

2190
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,224
He's using the

2191
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:52,992
Same exact

2192
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,808
Like he might as well have a

2193
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,576
Script

2194
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,600
With madlib

2195
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:03,744
Send whatever's new a 17 years he's been doing that exact same thing of like

2196
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,792
This person told me

2197
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:10,400
Both

2198
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,984
Very like a Verbatim to parks

2199
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,264
Again

2200
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,800
If like I said on the last episode

2201
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:17,568
It's

2202
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,848
Amazing Frog

2203
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:22,432
If you look at if you take the morality out of it it's

2204
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,456
Gorgeous Broad

2205
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,248
Andis Supra

2206
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:27,808
A propaganda

2207
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:32,416
Propagandistic a****** so congratulations on that Alex

2208
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,464
With another episode

2209
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,232
Soon

2210
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:38,048
Alex should be back in studio I guess

2211
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:42,144
I mean he's not going to be gone until the inauguration that's insane

2212
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,216
Well who knows how they might

2213
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,752
Recording this

2214
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:51,360
This is going to come out on Monday but I if I get to work

2215
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,640
Today on Monday

2216
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,432
And there's a f****** guest house

2217
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:58,016
Livid because

2218
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:00,832
Clearly right now

2219
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,624
The only thing worse

2220
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:04,416
Then the Alex Jones Show

2221
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:08,000
Is the Alex Jones Show without Alex

2222
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,536
A dumpster

2223
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,560
Starfire

2224
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,328
Anyway

2225
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:14,144
We will eventually do an episode on

2226
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,424
Sooner or later

2227
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:19,520
Yeah we do be good to use on all of the

2228
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:22,080
But

2229
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,944
This is been the most fun of my

2230
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:28,480
I hope

2231
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,760
Your your two

2232
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:34,112
I am already terrible

2233
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:39,232
Be there are plugs in the middle

2234
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:43,840
Holding

2235
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:49,472
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
