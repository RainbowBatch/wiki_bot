6
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,480
So like

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
Is it like

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,552
2 years ago

9
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,600
You tweeted all the time

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
About Alex Jones

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,672

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
Now you're sweet o

13
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
The exact

14
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,000
Opposite

15
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
Of what it is you

16
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,792
You criticized Alex

17
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:34,816
14 in the past

18
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,376
I'm just referencing Trump's dumbass

19
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,448
Okay

20
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,776
It's for a long time especially over this last weekend

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,336
NFL b*******

22
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,152
Wild thyme Flourtown country

23
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
What are we doing

24
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,200
What are we doing

25
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
It's 90Â°

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,064
Chicago at the end of September Puerto Rico

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,648
Destroyed and the Trump is pissed off

28
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,928
Colin Kaepernick

29
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
Great great

30
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
Burn It Down

31
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:07,328
It's almost like racist parody

32
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,632
Like it I know I know

33
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,936
Kind of letting things off the hook a little bit

34
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
But it's

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,728
It does at times

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
I know that this is Becky

37
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,568
But there have been times in my life where I've been

38
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
Convince the like

39
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
Ann Coulter is

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
The performance art

41
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,176
He's just doing this stuff

42
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
I can't believe

43
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,344
The people are so I can believe in God I believe this entire episode

44
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,416
Ann Coulter and

45
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
What's it

46
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,488
Jesse Jackson

47
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
Have you brought this up before and I don't know anything about Alex

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,984
We got a little mini episode

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,008
For the people

50
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,336
And the reason they were doing this is October is almost upon us

51
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
Yeah cheapest

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
95 degrees

53
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,528
October

54
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
Is because

55
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Today

56
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
We will be going

57
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
Through

58
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
Alex version of his Halloween 2015

59
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,888
So everyone

60
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
When we hit

61
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
At the beginning of November.

62
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
2015 investigate

63
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,104
Talking about Alex Jones becoming a full-on for Russia

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
So we didn't have time to go over the Halloween story

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
Glass from The Listener

66
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
I got a couple of messages

67
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:40,768
Multiple people demand

68
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
Some more.

69
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,520
Basically always Tire episode. Paul's blog

70
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
And you know what they're right there right

71
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,176
We made dacious claim that Alex Jones tells multiple versions

72
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Halloween story

73
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
With slight variation

74
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,064
To the point where I believe that most of it is alive

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,160
And we are drinking at prescription energy herbal tonic

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
Anyways

77
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:23,520
Personally don't like Halloween all that much as an adult I don't like dressing up much

78
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
I tend to go to

79
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Bar with it

80
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
Like one year I was a monk

81
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
And I shaved my head

82
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Like with the ring on top

83
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
You went too far

84
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,528
I went around with a bottle of Carlo Rossi

85
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,112
Jaguar

86
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
Whenever someone like committed a party fowl and made them

87
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,840
Some say Hail Marys and our fathers

88
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:57,312
When I was in high school

89
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,384
My parents mistakenly thought it was

90
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,272
And kept me from celebrating it in anyway because it was

91
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
Who is Eva

92
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
Pagan ritual

93
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Considering the fact that I was

94
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,536
Seven that's code for devilshit though

95
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,863
How do I

96
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
Severe mythology was based

97
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Pagan ritual

98
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,055
Indeed here is what we know

99
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
These are the only real facts

100
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
That I can

101
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Confirm

102
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
That I believe

103
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
Okay

104
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,015
Alex Jones Halloween does exist

105
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
I can confirm that

106
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
Alex Jones went to a party

107
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,647
Also true that was for his

108
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Cousin Buckley

109
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,463
It's his birthday party

110
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,559
All 18 of amethyst point

111
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,167
Eyewear escalated that number wages

112
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
So it was Buckley's birthday

113
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:02,335
And it was around Halloween and Alex Jones went to a fancy dress ball

114
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Of sorts

115
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
Vitality

116
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
Your cousin

117
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
Old-time expression

118
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
A costume ball

119
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
Fancy dress ball

120
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
They would call it

121
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
I only I only know this cuz

122
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
Okay you been calling her

123
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
They called them fancy-dress balls I really like a

124
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Theater

125
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
That's where

126
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
I'm off

127
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,223
I'm off my game

128
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,063
First version of the story this one comes to us from November 2nd

129
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
2015

130
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
Isn't the first time that Alex

131
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,791
Steve's pit to tell the story of Buckley's Halloween birthday party you know that for sure

132
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,887
What do you mean I mean has this story been just November

133
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
15 or is he been telling

134
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,007
Oh no I have no idea

135
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
From your prior I could not tell you that

136
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
But I know in 2015

137
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
The first occasion

138
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
The Department of Transportation

139
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Arkansas

140
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
He does

141
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
That is a good party

142
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975
Ain't nobody like you.

143
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Birthday party

144
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
I went to my cousin's birthday party

145
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
By the way

146
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Real good occasion to

147
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
To skip a break

148
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,431
Like I got to tell the story about Buckley's birthday party

149
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
That's fun

150
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
Captain's hat

151
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Austin

152
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
Do magic people music

153
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
So first of all I want

154
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
Keep track of the various

155
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
Details

156
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,703
Each and every go to the costume party on a boat

157
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
At this point

158
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
Kitty costume

159
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
He's not participate

160
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Vine

161
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
I'm going to give it to him

162
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
Cuz I want I'm also

163
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
This is when I was in college

164
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
I dressed up like Michael McDonald from

165
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
The series Yacht Rock

166
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
I realized I looked

167
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,415
Just enough like JD Risner

168
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,231
That I could dress up like the character Michael McDonald

169
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
Aviat Rock people go back and take clips from your Halloween stores and they're like

170
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,543
None of these are consistent picture of Jada

171
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,943
I went to the I went to the f****** Barber I had them cut like a receding hairline

172
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
You're insane

173
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
Party

174
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,599
That was going around checking the Malibu rum

175
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:59,487
I love you

176
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Who was Christopher Cross

177
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Alright

178
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
Pretty fun anyway

179
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,751
Keep an eye on the details

180
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
Flat bar to a bunch of places

181
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Come up

182
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
On the balcony

183
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
So hold on

184
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,775
There's three people a white guy a white girl and a

185
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
Suspiciously Arabic guy

186
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,991
He had a good night.

187
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,575
Buckley has rented a condo with another party

188
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,647
And then there is a restaurant that has a balcony

189
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:06,047
Most likely at the we're on the boat

190
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,703
We go to the condo

191
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,055
Then we go to the restaurant then we're back

192
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,407
I would argue that the restaurant might be Boat restaurant condo

193
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,807
Cuz you know you're not going to the party condo to shower up for the restaurant or change your clothes or any

194
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Anything like that

195
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
You're going straight through

196
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,951
You're going you're getting drunk on the boat and then you're eating to refuel

197
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
I am and you're going to

198
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:41,119
To the condo Park

199
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
Absolutely

200
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
Also

201
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
The balcony is where the

202
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,895
For this confrontation which was supposed to mean is it a private condo

203
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919
White guy

204
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
White girl

205
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
Suspiciously Arab

206
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,783
We don't know which one of these people is in play

207
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,743
What are you

208
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,071
Very clearly

209
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
What what if it is blackface

210
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
What can I draw

211
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,239
I'm running into our

212
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
The trademark too many details

213
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,103
Is $2 in dollars

214
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
Too much

215
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
Having dialogue

216
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,223
Usually means but Eli

217
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
Those two things together generally mean

218
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
You're probably make

219
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,671
Do right right

220
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,327
You want to show off and police women right here with your cultural superiority

221
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,543
And this whole cultural Jihad it's getting

222
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,407
So I'm guessing based on that uses language this is the era

223
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
But it's not the white guy who is

224
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Confronted him on

225
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,135
Balcony under a beautiful night sky where he's watching a drone

226
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,719
Right I don't I'm not 100% sure though cuz

227
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,511
Fast and loose

228
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
These here detail

229
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,167
Except for the ones that are clearly not true you saying are you showing off

230
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
For the girl right next

231
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
So could be the white guy in the white girl

232
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,079
Girls going to come into play in a minute

233
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
The white girl is not yet

234
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
I don't think

235
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
Also $4

236
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,783
Congratulations

237
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,647
The one right corner

238
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:18,047
Alright I'm just imagining one of those as well

239
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
You cap it it's white

240
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
Sitting around

241
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Great

242
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
What it's about

243
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,991
There was a blond college girl

244
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,039
So this is probably the white girl that he

245
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
He was referencing

246
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,927
Another person ever

247
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,279
Cuz he said that there were three people who accosted him about his car and they were walking

248
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:55,423
Maybe but if they were in the party than they would have to be friends of Buckley

249
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Like

250
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
You rented out

251
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
A f****** condo

252
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
Is friends with all blonde

253
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,175
When you rent out a condo

254
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
I do I do he gets around

255
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:13,599
It's not a public space anymore it's not like you posting Flyers

256
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,903
Like its PCU or some s***

257
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,951
Everybody gets laid tonight at the pit

258
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
You know

259
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,839
Yeah I was just

260
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
Cruiser back

261
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
I like that movie

262
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
OverWatch 2

263
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,775
15 years

264
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,383
I remember it well from the early days of Comedy Central when they

265
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
Have anything else they are

266
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
Zack and Jason

267
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
You love that

268
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
Movies

269
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,879
Stockholm Syndrome

270
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
Before any program

271
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
Anyway back to the story

272
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,511
Blonde college girl

273
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:59,423
What's going around saying I just didn't want to wear any costume because of my

274
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,031
I don't want to offend anybody

275
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,175
There are people going around all over the place

276
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
But they're going I'm so guilty of what I'm wearing

277
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
At the restaurant

278
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
Is wearing a Nazi hat

279
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:35,263
You might have

280
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,151
That the two of them were both at the restaurant bar

281
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
But separately

282
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,223
Asking him I don't know

283
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
What

284
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
The I mean

285
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,831
Guest if it's a high-end Austin bar it's

286
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
Your blood has a balcony

287
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Or whatever

288
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
If possible

289
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
Just be on the ground Florida

290
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,815
But at the same time is now in the course of his

291
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
Two-minute clip

292
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
We've been going over

293
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
They've gone from

294
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
322 people

295
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,471
The number of people who have complained about his costume

296
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
Is already trained

297
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,823
Completely manufactured a college

298
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383
My suspicion is

299
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,431
The characters that he introduced

300
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
Beginning he is now peppering in

301
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
And throughout the store

302
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,999
She is now repurposed as a character who has too much white guilt

303
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,607
So it could be just a case of him trying to over inflate the numbers of people

304
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Who will have

305
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,215
Confronted him about the costume

306
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,799
Actually I think there is

307
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
It is like

308
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
Over the course of this we're going to see a bit

309
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
Be flushed out so I can open my

310
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,247
Mike because he tells the story

311
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,087
A bunch

312
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,159
It's an unproductive open miking

313
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,071
I went oh no this isn't happening again

314
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
It look like

315
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
Really it's a classic police

316
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
So

317
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
Your theory that he accidentally bought a Nazi

318
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Sweetheart

319
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Is possible

320
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Especially

321
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
30s

322
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:31,743
There is a possibility that accidentally bought enough we had that I am I'm allowing as a possibility he'll wonder it was so

323
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,583
The entire the other possibility

324
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
That I am

325
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Going to enter

326
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,495
Is that these people knew who Alex was and they came up to him and be like

327
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,359
You are a f****** fascist and he thought they were complaining about his hat

328
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:53,759
That is entirely right again this goes back to the unreliable narrator aspect of Alex Jones

329
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,807
His life

330
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
The story a week later on November 9th

331
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
He revisits the story

332
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
And he also skip a break

333
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,279
To tell this neither confirm nor deny the break

334
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,839
Every time he needs to skip break

335
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
You should goes right into the

336
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Every time

337
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,215
I would love it if his advertising budget

338
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
You just fell apart because

339
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
I'm Jewish

340
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,679
Oh boy

341
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:50,079
So he is already from the Middle East

342
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,127
Yeah there's

343
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,503
There's a new live in the Middle East Alex there's a large percentage of

344
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
Jewish people who are Arabic

345
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
That's silly of Alec

346
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
Beyond that

347
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Soldiers people are from

348
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Originally

349
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
Faribault

350
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
Are berries European

351
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:18,239
European not areas

352
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,871
You're not wrong but at the same time

353
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Africa

354
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
Yeah that's possible too

355
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,759
I don't want to get into that cuz

356
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,063
I think it's time to get into that

357
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,927
Let's get this break about the right genetic

358
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:43,327
This is a week later from the first time he tells a story and already we have new things being introduced

359
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,983
Do it the are you a Nazi as opposed to is that a Nazi hadn't offended by that I'm Jewish

360
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
But it looks like an arrow through that means

361
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
It's

362
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:58,175
You bet he's already threatened he's flushed out these characters more in order to

363
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
To serve his purposes

364
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
Of the story

365
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
The context

366
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
We should know

367
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
So now you're the

368
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,119
This might be the white guy

369
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,983
And then I was going on everywhere

370
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
Another party

371
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Asterisk

372
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,063
So now we have a fourth location

373
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
So now we have the boat

374
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
We have the restaurant bar

375
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,511
We have Buckley's rented Oconto

376
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
No we don't

377
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
And we don't have an assembly the condo floor of a bar

378
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
Renting out a condo

379
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,519
So either

380
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
Misrepresenting

381
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
One of these is not a cure

382
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,919
Or both

383
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
None of this is real

384
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
It's poor Buckley

385
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:12,415
Buckley Bay not exist the other thing that I'm allowing is a possibility

386
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
Is that all of this is

387
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
True but not the stuff with other

388
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
Like that Buckley not only rented a condo also rented out the top floor of a bar

389
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,007
Hey there are you going

390
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
Get f***** on crazy

391
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
Yeah that's

392
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Possible

393
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
And Buckley likes

394
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
Party

395
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Because why

396
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
Run through wives so quickly

397
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:41,087
Abogado Alex has a lecherous man

398
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,719
Ford love Lauren Buckley

399
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
See that's my other favorite

400
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Remember how I'm supposed to

401
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
Respond to that

402
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,143
Watch it

403
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
I don't think that's right

404
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,239
And they're just people walking around

405
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:09,503
We've met on the show before personal trainer

406
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,928
No Pat Riley the personal trainer who went to Europe and probably cheated on his wife

407
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
Remember him from the

408
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,328
Horrible a dirt bikes

409
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
Outside

410
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
As well

411
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,232
The Buckley

412
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,840
Invited 400 people at the top floor of a bar

413
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:00,192
The Apparently maybe a rooftop bar but it's also open to the public

414
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,240
Cuz Alex said that earlier in this

415
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
Okay good I don't know what that means

416
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,360
I have no idea what that's me when you rent out a place

417
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,408
It's a private affair

418
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,200
It doesn't it's not a thing where you can

419
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Everyone

420
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,040
Can get out also and there's no way Buckley knows 400

421
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,112
Of different ethnicities

422
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:23,232
That's where my incredulity get straps

423
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
But also

424
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
Important to stop at hearing

425
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
And point out the Buckley

426
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
Spin the wheel

427
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,192
Steel

428
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:37,312
Afrika Bambaataa stuff you know some old school s***

429
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,896
You can see backing up there putting on like

430
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:45,760
Shook Ones Part 2 onyx

431
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,832
Just that one song from

432
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:57,536
The song from my gusset

433
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:03,680
The American anthem for shady random size pants

434
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080
Back to the back to the November 9th

435
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
In walkover

436
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:27,232
And then try to make you uncomfortable and have you submit to them

437
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
Power

438
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
So

439
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
I don't believe any of

440
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
Okay so

441
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
Now we have

442
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,544
Top of a roof

443
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
All Races

444
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,640
Creed's and backgrounds witch

445
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:50,784
Bleed red blood is not just

446
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Arab look

447
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,672
Player

448
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:02,560
Then there's another guy and a girl walking around who won't go to Costco

449
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
No no

450
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
There is

451
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:11,008
Another white guy at some point stuff is the Arab guy

452
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:17,408
In the original version there was one sad white college girl

453
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,808
In this conversion everyone's running around there's enough of them

454
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:28,160
Everyone's weirded out by a are making people uncomfortable

455
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,232
Just my socially walking up to them and say

456
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
I can't wear a costume

457
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
I have too much white

458
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,632
First of all business but if it was this

459
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,400
Parties

460
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:45,056
Yeah I would beat a hasty Retreat from this party

461
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:51,456
I had I had to have it in in college me and my buddy Nikki gift we were going crash parties

462
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736
Charismatic

463
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,784
We just go find a party

464
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,320
Insinuate ourselves

465
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,928
Almost invariably something would go wrong and I

466
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
We got to get the

467
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
F*** out here right now

468
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:09,120
That's what I would do and I was at Rooftop Bar party

469
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Where am I

470
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,080
I'm here behind Austin bar where there's

471
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,616
DJ's on the roof

472
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
S*** like that

473
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
I need a refund

474
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,504
Alex Jones being a dick in there

475
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,576
What rights are we are walking around

476
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Not wearing costumes

477
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,672
Filled with white guilt

478
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
Stop

479
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,744
In people because they want them

480
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
To submit

481
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:40,352
Does Alex Jones Theory that's the premise

482
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,936
Also you said it was the day before Halo

483
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
It was on the 30th

484
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,568
Yeah actually I'm looking back on another calendar from October 25th

485
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
The 30th is a Friday

486
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,944
Buckley's birthday

487
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,248
I was just trying to like

488
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:03,648
So get it in my head if it would make sense that people would dress up on the 30th weekend

489
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Oh yeah

490
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,488
I thought that might be a possibility where is like a Thursday

491
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
Yusuf on the Friday

492
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Or whatever

493
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
So far

494
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,704
We have two things that check out

495
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,336
And it was Friday the 30th people probably dressed

496
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
And

497
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
The other thing

498
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,176
I'm thinking

499
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
Is

500
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
Alex is not sober

501
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
Absolutely

502
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
I don't

503
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
You got to take everything

504
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,720
Sort of

505
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,512
Not at face value

506
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,096
And you think he's telling a story where he was probably f*****-up

507
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,400
And someone came up to him

508
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:52,800
What's up what's up with your paranoid

509
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:00,480
And then the next morning when he's hungover he's trying to re context relies on tourism being a dick to a stranger

510
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Later on

511
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Vaguely remember

512
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
Casting hammersley

513
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,304
Yeah my God

514
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,632
My audience is going to love that

515
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:24,032
So totally

516
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,336
Might as well throw them a little Halloween

517
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,896
The first person to story November 2nd

518
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,200
Yes second version November 9th

519
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
I got a whole week

520
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,832
Actually written down to maybe edited

521
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
It sort of

522
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
Speeds up

523
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
Okay

524
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:48,096
The rapidity of which story

525
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,192
Cuz now we go to November 11th

526
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,008
And yet again

527
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
Learning

528
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,640
To equate everything was how you been racially sliding

529
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
Mental patient

530
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
Neurotic

531
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
Does he not realize that he

532
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,160
He is talking entirely about him being racially slighted

533
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
Wearing his like

534
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,536
These people are a cult

535
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,608
Everything is about

536
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:27,008
Which is why I'm mad that I got Rachel which is why 80% of my show is about white genocide

537
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,104
You got to figure some s*** out the same time I would like

538
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,176
Tip mine on Nazi hat to him

539
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,224
4

540
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,832
Bye

541
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,648
It's because you shave the middle of your head prior to

542
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Complement

543
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,256
Because he said drooling without following it up with

544
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Mulin

545
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:55,168
Which is something that he does almost all the time

546
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,240
I don't like that at all to the story

547
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,800
Driven

548
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
And again

549
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,408
Cultural revolution

550
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,600
The restaurant bar

551
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,624
So now we're

552
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,672
Now it's not a rented out

553
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
Now we're out in public

554
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:24,096
At the restaurant.

555
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
The most

556
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
Alex Jones

557
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,520
Apologist E-Type people out there might be saying

558
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Hey

559
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,384
You know what that bar that he rented out with the PJs

560
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,712
Stop the restaurant bar

561
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,576
And it could be the restaurant absolutely.

562
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,672
The club right into a restaurant bar / Club

563
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,720
And the way he's been

564
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,560
I'm talking about these individual places have been very different

565
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,120
So now

566
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Take place

567
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,704
The top of the bar

568
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,288
Place restaurant

569
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
I mean

570
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
I don't know what point

571
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
So now the other person

572
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,048
The aggressor

573
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
Pics of change

574
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
He does not

575
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
Specify jewishness

576
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,704
He doesn't have any of those

577
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,056
The story

578
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,336
About this in the Conte

579
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,360
White guilt

580
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Not really

581
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,688
Talking about

582
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Liberal brainwashing

583
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,552
Story or at least

584
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
He's trying to get out of it

585
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,136
Now becomes him being Macho

586
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
You'll see

587
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,720
See here tells the version of

588
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
People

589
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,728
Heather was obviously

590
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,088
I'm just sick of these bullies I'm sick of their garbage

591
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,368
So

592
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
The contact that he's telling you

593
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:29,280
Here is some guy cosplay came up jumpers

594
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,840
Yeah and now it is the point is

595
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,888
But if someone with his liberal

596
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:40,288
Cultural revolution garbage comes up to flex on them and they fall apart

597
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
15 people

598
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
The Gang

599
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:50,016
They need to back up their gang mentality

600
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,552
Still beat them up

601
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,112
So the whole premise

602
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
Insanity

603
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,584
We just had one more

604
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
The story on November 12th

605
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
He was running thin

606
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
Okay on things

607
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:16,640
Used to talk about was the day that that

608
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:20,736
General stubblebine

609
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,088
Get the dumbass name right

610
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,928
That was the day where they're having like elaborate

611
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,744
White

612
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
Narrative

613
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
$30 for a car

614
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
So here is

615
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
He's at on the 12

616
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,080
Birthday party

617
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,688
I work half and Chad and I had a white person and an arrow

618
00:32:54,016 --> 00:33:00,160
And I was nice of it first but then I turned it on and I got in their face and I should watch it man

619
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,792
All right now that's very different

620
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:10,144
Yeah that's a very different sort of reminiscent of one of the version

621
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,616
That would be

622
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,712
That response how does he not know that the bad idea

623
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,784
But that response is not germane to the other version

624
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:33,440
More

625
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,976
That's totally fine

626
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,840
I'm pretty sure everybody is in the right thing

627
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
Why are you dressed up like

628
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,544
Even Alex kind of knows he's the bad guy in the story right

629
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,616
I think he has to kind of have that suspicion

630
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,688
Cuz he's preemptively defending himself

631
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,016
True to anybody complaining about him dressing up

632
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,856
In case there was a picture that

633
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,184
That might be that might actually be accurate

634
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
And also clubs are dark

635
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
Officer hat

636
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,072
Similar

637
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,192
That's true like it's not like 12:30 policeman

638
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
Kind of we're not

639
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,264
There are

640
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
But like it's not like a Klan Hood

641
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
Or something like that that's really distinct

642
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,944
Rarest Breyer hat

643
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,016
White Cami dress up like 30 clan members

644
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,344
Why can't I dress up like the Reconstruction I'm just saying

645
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
But like

646
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:40,768
You know what I'm saying it's not like the Nazis had a distinctive hat like many other groups has had over the over the years

647
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
Great hats

648
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:48,704
Medallions yeah but beyond that there wasn't like

649
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:53,312
You get what I'm saying of the Hat

650
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,872
It's not like a sombrero it's not like

651
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
A beanie

652
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Anything like that

653
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:04,064
So what if he was wearing

654
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
That's just

655
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,512
You know I'm not an option you know that's not the captain's hat

656
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,128
You don't have some moral High Ground by getting in my face

657
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,432
I suggest you turn around and walk away

658
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
Run

659
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,136
So

660
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
So

661
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,024
The implication is that the guy ran away

662
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
Yeah

663
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
And now he's in

664
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:54,240
Insisting that they think they have some sort of moral High Ground

665
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,800
All right that's the part of the cultural revolution

666
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,896
Evolve at

667
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,736
So now I am one hundred percent convinced he was wearing enough

668
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:11,136
Surprised

669
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,024
Lightning bolts right here like he was not just wearing a hat

670
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,864
I mean it's possible the only assessment I can

671
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,936
Especially in the context of now

672
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,728
When we know he supports

673
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Look

674
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,848
My assessment is

675
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
We can establish that

676
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,784
For sure I think Alex

677
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,808
She's probably a******

678
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
In the situation

679
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
100

680
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
And in order to make a

681
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,720
The point about political correctness or something or other

682
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
He's

683
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,096
He's got the colonel of the story and because it's not true

684
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
Keeps changing

685
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
Slightly

686
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
Over the period of November

687
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,472
Second to the

688
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,752
And because he thinks

689
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
It's so illustrative

690
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,848
How brainwashed and stupid the Liberals are

691
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
He has

692
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,152
Going back to the well

693
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,968
Not realizing that every time he goes back to it

694
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,016
He's reviewing more and more that it's

695
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,296
Not real

696
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,880
So congratulations on the first 48

697
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,696
You would watch the first 48 and he's

698
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,280
Multiple times cuz he's also the guy who's like

699
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:27,680
Totally convicted at the end of my lawyer is named

700
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:34,080
So anyway let's let's wrap this up

701
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,944
Halloween stories

702
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
From 2015

703
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,040
Wherein we discover that Alex dress

704
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
Most

705
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:49,184
I don't understand why these guys are so obsessed with thinking

706
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,464
They're the victim

707
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
Even as he's

708
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
Like f******

709
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,328
Insisting that he could beat the s*** out of

710
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
These people I mean it's just

711
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,472
Piece of his worldview like it is this we are the victims of all of these

712
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
Mastiff

713
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
Possible conspiracy

714
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,896
But you know also everyone else should shut the f****** about being

715
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,480
Right it's just it's pathetic

716
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:19,136
It's conservatives I'm almost to a T

717
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:24,768
Intrinsically trampoline over other people

718
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,304
It's the argument of being a

719
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
Intolerant about intolerance

720
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
It's just stupid

721
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,168
And that is where Alex Jones live

722
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,192
Yeah hayirli

723
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,008
You hear it if you if you listen to his show

724
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,800
As much as I did and all the stuff

725
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
We don't end up talking about on the episode

726
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,664
So much of it is just that boring Vic

727
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,432
Narrative

728
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,480
You know I would love to

729
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
Even

730
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
It's not even

731
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Pieocracy

732
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
It's

733
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Kennedy

734
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,672
Like it's just that they're not

735
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:57,536
That is true or not capable of reconciling reality

736
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
So they create this

737
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
This false

738
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,144
Like eight

739
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,960
The best way to put

740
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
Yeah

741
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
Kind of like

742
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,800
They think

743
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
That they're white

744
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,640
Population

745
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Listen Subway

746
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Supreme

747
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
I don't get it

748
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,040
It's almost as if they think that there's relative values

749
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,136
Queen

750
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
White supremacy

751
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,976
White nationalism

752
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
Soupremacy

753
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
He's wearing

754
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,584
It's like it's like they build

755
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
It like the thing that is amazing

756
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,216
Every single like they

757
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
Have to keep

758
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
Building all of this s*** on

759
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
Because if they admit

760
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,872
That one little thing doesn't

761
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,432
Legacy just B like

762
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
You know what I think

763
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
Chuchero guy is right

764
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,112
The entirety of this world you come from

765
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,464
Like every little thing I'm not sure every little

766
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
It's just

767
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,304
You take away one little part of it and the entire Foundation

768
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
Conceivably

769
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,472
Coming up with more and more elaborate ways to describe

770
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
Themselves

771
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
Because

772
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,568
I want to I want to play you a clip

773
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
Okay

774
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,408
Because I am

775
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,712
This is a

776
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
This is a clip

777
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,040
From the September 9th

778
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,088
Episode of this year 27

779
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,904
Physically pipe old for the episode that I did

780
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,672
With injuries

781
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,952
Unfortunately supper

782
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,744
Amex technical difficulties

783
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,816
Clips from that episode

784
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,888
Oh by the way I caused all of those I was jealous that I

785
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:50,432
Israelites that I put my energy into it

786
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
Doesn't make any sense

787
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:58,112
So in this in this clip the reason I want to play this is because I think that it's really illustrative Ava Baseline believe

788
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
White

789
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,208
And I think it is something that is

790
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,256
Valuable and important for us to

791
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,560
Just got even if we can't go through all of these

792
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,888
Spoiler alert

793
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,680

794
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984

These kids

797
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,568
But this clip starts with a

798
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,128
I'm talking about how Hillary Clinton is going around saying

799
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
Kids funding

800
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,712
For her organization

801
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
The Russia

802
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,088
Propaganda

803
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,256
Against Russia

804
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,072
That's Trump and his son

805
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,168
RNC funds to pay for their legal defense

806
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
Against

807
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
Then lying

808
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
About being

809
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,056
It's a hot mess

810
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,616
It starts

811
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,384
To just

812
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
Dealsea

We were right about the

817
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:36,671
We were right about the whole thing

818
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:40,511
Nope

819
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,727
Massive censorship identify mean the war is on

820
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
Tony Lyon

821
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:58,687

On-air of blacks and whites

How dare you pretend otherwise I called an audible and play this clip

Other things that you

869
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,791
You can do absolutely you know

870
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,095
There's one guy who doesn't make that turn

871
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:33,983
Who just can't do it doesn't have the skill

872
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,079
He scares the kids to come to his door

873
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,127
He's probably the guy who gives you an ass

874
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,431
I bet he's the guy who takes out his teeth

875
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:48,831
Every time you walk or has a bowl of spaghetti and guts or something
