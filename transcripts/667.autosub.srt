1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for snowledge b b

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
Need money

4
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
Fight.com

5
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:07,072
But the altar of Selena

6
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,400
Jordana

7
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:15,008
My bright spot today Jordan I guess is that I have decided

8
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
Your the mustard is happening

9
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,920
There are going to be details revealed

10
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
Do this differently than last time

11
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
But it was a first draft

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,976
Right alright we learned a lot of lessons from

13
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,560
Absolutely have to have a

14
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,376
Fearless inventory of failures

15
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,008
I took some time I searched my soul and I've identified

16
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:51,872
Real basic things that were done wrong right correct those of those wrongs

17
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
And make this the best ever

18
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576
Of course our gears begin on 4/20 0420 will be the beginning

19
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
That makes perfect sense and everything else

20
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,000
Stoner New Year or something

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
So your mustard is going to happen

22
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,656
Get hyped

23
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
From the government headquarters

24
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Fear the mustard is

25
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,312
Yeah I'm very excited I have

26
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,872
So many

27
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
The mustards I'm excited to try to put a new section on the website

28
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,832
Where to

29
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
The house the domestic

30
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,536
The mustard reviews there will be pictures of each mustard as well that wasn't like I failed last year this is one of the family

31
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
Pictures of myself with all the Seltzer's

32
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
No no no this year

33
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Pictures of myself

34
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Selfies

35
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,728
Mustard selfie

36
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,640
We do

37
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,992
We can do it for the gram but it's okay because that

38
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
I'm excited

39
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,136
My bright spot is by my wife

40
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
I'm legally obligated to do that we're on a podcast

41
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,680
That may be the real reason not respect for any pigs

42
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
Purchased for me for my birthday

43
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
A bicycle

44
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
I saw that

45
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,528
Did you know the bicycles are expensive now I am willing to throw out my first-ever absolute

46
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,832
Unqualified advertisement

47
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880
Not paid for

48
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
Bikes is f****** incredible is that the name of the company that's the name of the place Chicago Company

49
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,096
It's f****** amazing they

50
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Take old bikes

51
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,448
Refurbishing a few hundred bucks

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
Places Coolidge it everybody works there is like

53
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,128
Knows too much about bicycle kind of like a little bit ago recycling that's good

54
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,664
It's your birthday

55
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,784
Is the first like I've had about 10 years the last one I had or was stolen after 3 weeks

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,136
Sure

57
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Fingers crossed

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Are you wearing a helmet

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Safety First

60
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:21,631
Safety First Jordan today we have an episode to go over we are back in the past

61
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
Phone number for

62
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
July 25th

63
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
2003

64
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
A couple reasons

65
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,335
The first is that Alex was out of town for most of this week

66
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
Going to do his deposition

67
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
Connecticut Connecticut

68
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,807
Tilly deposition in can I get a lot of the money back

69
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
So it wasn't that costly although ticket emotional cost of Hangout

70
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
That was Norm pattis

71
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,279
Yasso

72
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
MasterCard commercial

73
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
But the opposite

74
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Priceless

75
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
In reverse

76
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,775
Studio for a good time and honestly

77
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
I think the

78
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Largely

79
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
Infowars content of the present day

80
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
You can

81
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
Pretty much predict everything that they're going to be talking about

82
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,783
It's going to be a fication and more

83
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Extreme

84
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
Versions of this

85
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
Labeling lgbtq

86
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
Teekyuu Folk

87
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,719
As grooming

88
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,535
That whole narrative there going to be a flying bat

89
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,607
Going to be yelling about Supreme Court

90
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,447
It's going to be Alex justifying Putin

91
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
Behavior

92
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:35,615
I don't know I'm not into it there's nothing more to say about his transphobia that we didn't already cover with his whole body

93
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:42,015
Phobia 20 years ago right now that's one of the things that I kind of find is a sticking point

94
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:48,159
Frozen the trans people the trans Community to try and wedge their f****** nightmares bulshit into the rest of our lives

95
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Scary

96
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,911
Unacceptable in every way and Shelby not tolerated

97
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
I want to go back to the past

98
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,055
Little bit of

99
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
A business

100
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
I believe little bit of an announcer

101
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,175
That is we have

102
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Crazy monkey

103
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
Coming out you are going to be on vacation on your honeymoon

104
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Quotes

105
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,159
Henrico

106
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,999
I sure will be gone

107
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
Damn then you're going to be back

108
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
And then

109
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
April 25th

110
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,423
Alex's trial in Austin begin

111
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:37,823
And we will be going to Austin I mean we don't have a choice really it's

112
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,223
Yes

113
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,551
But we have to approach it with an air of

114
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,671
More dignity I don't want you dressing up

115
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:57,023
I was like David Knight not going to happen

116
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
I'll be at we're going to be in Austin

117
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:04,447
For an extended stay over the course of the the trial and ideally

118
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Providing

119
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
Daily update

120
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,615
Ideal situation

121
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:16,223
Fiery we won't have regular episodes during that time it will be a

122
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,855
Two-week miniseries yesterday we of our adventure in Austin at the truck

123
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,439
It'll be interested yeah we've never done that before

124
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,839
No we have not charted territory it is a great wide open and we'll see if it's a complete

125
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Disaster

126
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,471
Oh yeah I mean we'll just do it till where you'll pretend

127
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
You play a clip right and I'll try and remember what it was Alex and I'll do the voice-over maybe they will talk about it like I did

128
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
There may be no clips

129
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Stuff to look forward to there's some other stuff

130
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,647
I may do it episode about Russell Brand

131
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207
Still thinking about that all things are possible

132
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,511
Yeah this is

133
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
At this month

134
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
Is that what looking out in front of it

135
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,703
Yep yep but when we look back at it'll be great

136
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
Finger store we will be dead by then

137
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
You know who knows its possibility

138
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,919

00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,959
Oh no they threatened

154
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:19,359
Legal action I mean that is reasonable and so

155
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
I have to say

156
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,967

00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
Go take a little break now

161
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,231
A list for me

162
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
And then we're going to

163
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Comeback

164
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,887
And I'm going to start the show over

165
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
F*** you

166
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
I got plenty of words for YouTube

167
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
At the end of the day

168
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
F*** you and your new world order

169
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,943
And f*** the horse you rode in on

170
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
All your s***

171
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
Maybe today

172
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

173
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

174
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
And you never see me again

175
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
That's really what I want to do

176
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
I never want to come back here again

177
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
I apologize to the crew in The Listener just

178
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Yesterday that I

179
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,447
Was legitimately having right now

180
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
I'll be better tomorrow

181
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
Is tomorrow is the past

182
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,407
You better than the present well he will be better yesterday that

183
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
And Tomorrow Comes Today

184
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
And that's not good be good

185
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,623
No so we start off here and Alex is getting a little bit introspective

186
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
About how he never does his job

187
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,023
I can appreciate a little

188
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Stories

189
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Went through the

190
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
Imprinted

191
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
We

192
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:22,495
Absolutely not there were not several hundred that he covered on Arrow

193
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
Kind of appreciate

194
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,223
One thing you could do is really gay the slow news day we're going to catch up on things to slip through the crack

195
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
100 news stories in the last 4 days

196
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
I mean

197
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,743
Explain to me

198
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
At what

199
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,791
Point you decide

200
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
I'm never going to cover more than

201
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
50 store

202
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Oh man

203
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:56,031
Right so then let's only print out 50 store what are we doing print out 200 so are you doing that for

204
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:02,431
Need more than one page you need one page that has a couple of talking points on it

205
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
A couple of headlines

206
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,039
F****** needs a vision board

207
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
Lichen

208
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,719
Front of him with with copy and pasted or like a magazine articles like a ransom note in front of him that he can just

209
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
Read off of

210
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,583
Is The Drudge report's front

211
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
Make it big

212
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,471
Alex has a story out of the San Francisco Chronicle

213
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,799
This is a big big big news

214
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
This is one of the ones you miss

215
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Right

216
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
Runoff rate

217
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,447
Borders New World Order killed

218
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
That is full name

219
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Watching if not

220
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
Liberal

221
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:30,239
Find this exact article about in the San Francisco Chronicle

222
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
Chronicle from around this time

223
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
I know what he's talking about

224
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,687
Basically if it's the former mayor of Los Angeles Richard Riordan

225
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,503
He had said that he was going to run but he wouldn't

226
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
If Arnold ran

227
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,367
Right until more liberal Republican. That's what Alex is talking

228
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
I guess

229
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,463
This is around the same time that the Bohemian Club meet

230
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:57,119
At the Grove word that maybe they wanted Arnold to run right over there,

231
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,959
Drops out before maybe he necessarily even began

232
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Campaigning

233
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
For the governorship very excited

234
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:15,039
About the recall election is about to happen at Alex's life because

235
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
This was

236
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
Wild stuff

237
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,951
Silver like 200k

238
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,279
Jerry Coleman Ram it was absolutely.

239
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,327
Mary Carey I mean yeah

240
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,399
It was one of the it was one of those things where you're like

241
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:35,263
Yeah yeah that is one of those uniquely California things whatever is much

242
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
Guy from Florida Etc

243
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
You know the rules

244
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,895
California has those completely different sets

245
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
Things really like donuts

246
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:49,599
Happen here in Illinois election of 2003

247
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
Is

248
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
Probably one of the more bizarre in

249
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Like event

250
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
Of the state politics

251
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
Ignore the wacky race

252
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
And I definitely is

253
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,543
Like I can't wait to see it through Alex's eyes

254
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
You know that

255
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
That's all he already sounds

256
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:16,223
I don't know what he thinks about Cruz Bustamante but I have

257
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,575
I hope he tries to say his name at least once I would love it if

258
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,391
I don't know who Alex Wood back

259
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,327
Put put could end up being a Coleman guy

260
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
This really

261
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,191
Gets me going because you know because a lot of really dark topics

262
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
It's sometimes hard to dwell on those too much

263
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,823
And this I think will be fairly silly

264
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,919
Alex will be very mad about for no reason

265
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
I'm so weak we have some predict

266
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Addictions that Alec

267
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
Text makes that I think are not very

268
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,647
We're on the edge of war with North Korea

269
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,887
In October

270
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:23,039
I want I want that

271
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
Pick up the idea

272
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,471
North Korea nuking us would happen and you

273
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:47,103
Still insisting these pictures of Saddam sons and the whole thing is fake which is

274
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,967
It does it does make me laugh about if it back on how a lot of people were like

275
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
North Korea has nukes

276
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
They're crazy

277
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,319
They could nuke us at any time

278
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,367
And now we live in 2022 and it's like

279
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
They still couldn't

280
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,951
Shoot of Rocket far enough to hit us with a nuke

281
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
Not a chance

282
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,791
It's 20 years later and there's no way they hit us with a nuke

283
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,119
I think you're probably right but I also think that

284
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
It is in these conversations

285
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:17,055
It's always best to approach with a little bit of a reputation no no no no no no

286
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,943
This whole California gubernatorial race

287
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
Is bringing out the demon

288
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Alex

289
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
And these demons

290
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:32,927
Are forcing him to attack one of his own his own I mean another bigot who yells on the radio

291
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,743
Michael Savage

292
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
Real conservative

293
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,655
Yasso Michael Savage I guess is talking s*** about

294
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:20,799
Considering running at 7

295
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
Michael Savage

296
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,223
He's a big old liberal so he's the spoiler he's going to come in

297
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,063
Make it so Cruz Bustamante

298
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
Using his liberal lies

299
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,183
That he's protective fly

300
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,999
Neocon property idolize

301
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
Right and they're going to be

302
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
Conservatives because it conserves

303
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,119
Is Winterport Republican

304
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Democrat

305
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Are bucking

306
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
I mean they're not demons yet

307
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:54,591
No the demons aren't really in Play You Look Silly if you were

308
00:18:54,847 --> 00:19:00,991
2300

309
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:06,367
Wi governor of California at least 500 people Electric Plant themselves the president of Texas

310
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,951
The truth is out of control

311
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,023
I just pulled this next week because I think I could like

312
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
Legitimately

313
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,887
This could be played any year on Alex's show

314
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
Be able to be like that seems out of place

315
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,343
Doesn't mean anything

316
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,927
Pheasant 2003 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

317
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
Absent all the way down to the present day

318
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,047
It's always the case where the most critical juncture

319
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:51,935
Of all time of the day we're dealing with just pick a year and he's like

320
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:58,335
Make a cake settle be the end of everything

321
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Yeah

322
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
It's it's

323
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,783
Just a shocking realization of like

324
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
The triviality of what he talks about

325
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,927
Mixed in with you very serious and real things that I felt like that big

326
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,999
It's just a little bit disheartening

327
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
You know to see if the

328
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,607
The present mirrored so clearly of the past

329
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
This is the most important thing ever

330
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,055
He doesn't know what he was talking about there

331
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,359
Come on man

332
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
It's

333
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
The United States

334
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
Liberty's what about

335
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
Wood chipper

336
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
America being destroyed

337
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:44,415
We see the size of government growing

338
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,679
We have a

339
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,304
The buildings are

340
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
Everywhere

341
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,264
Pulling around

342
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
Blood

343
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
Are walking around

344
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
George Bush

345
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
Literally

346
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
Wait what

347
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,552
I think there's such a thing as getting lost in a metaphor you know like

348
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,904
I think you can cure somebody speak so eloquently that you're like

349
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,512
Caught up in that that but the reverse

350
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,912
Caught up in the confusion I feel like he got caught up in in the story he thought he was

351
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
Who's making a metaphor

352
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,104
And then he was like actually I kind of really like the story and I also wanted to be literal movie mode

353
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,944
How many people with blood streaming down their faces saying I love George Bush

354
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
What is that

355
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
What is that an allegory for

356
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
Mine was a neocon

357
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,904
I see that's again

358
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,464
It's literally bigger to the ambulatory

359
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,816
Seems like they got blood all over their face

360
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,656
I love George Bush

361
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
That's a lot of blood

362
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,808
All right group

363
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,904
Lisa these folks who are the enemies

364
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
Basically America

365
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
Toronado

366
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,304
They're hiding as America

367
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,376
Mushroom cloud

368
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
Play runaround butchering the country

369
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
Camouflage

370
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,656
I think Alex is at the Flights of Fancy today

371
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,520
I mean he's having a little fun there's a light

372
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,616
That's for sure

373
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
He's doing he's doing character

374
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:22,528
Oh my God wait until a little bit later he gets deep into a chapter

375
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
He doesn't One Man Show

376
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,184
Enough

377
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
Kia

378
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,584
I think there's there's trouble with the enemies

379
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376
Uniform is the American

380
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Can flag I think

381
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,472
I think when you establish that is kind of your mindset

382
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,032
You basically hitches

383
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
Randomly choose who your enemy

384
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
Well I mean

385
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:53,248
It does seem like what he saying is everyone is possibly behind the attack on you personal

386
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,552
So you should never be confident unless

387
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:01,952
They also love me but even if they love me they could be lying to you and anybody who expresses like

388
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:08,352
Patriotism or love of country is probably

389
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
Strangely enough the only people you can trust

390
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
Have declared themselves king of

391
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,848
Michael Savage oh so you can't trust operative

392
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,792
Karl Marx

393
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,104
Need to come in about I mean

394
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,224
Wrote poems

395
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
The poisonous

396
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,968
This is an accusation of

397
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
Savage

398
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
Knowingly being in

399
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
On this operation

400
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,624
He's an operative he's not just somebody who's

401
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
You know

402
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,464
Not doing the right thing according to Alex

403
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,280
Misguided

404
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Conspiracy

405
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,352
He's a little silly

406
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
He's a

407
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,704
Obviously His Radio Show comes first

408
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
But

409
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,288
20 years before this

410
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
Early 80s

411
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,152
Okay the CIA came to Michael Savage while he was a Beat

412
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:02,528
I can never like man you got to get out of this might've been like rating diet books at that point

413
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:08,928
Okay well in mad you got to get out of the daycare alright get into the radio industry get famous enough to where you can run for governor

414
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
During one of the most chaotic times

415
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,536
That anybody's ever run for governor of California

416
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Then

417
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
You'll be able to

418
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
To get the

419
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,656
Conservative what is the plan

420
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Dido

421
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
It's basically

422
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
That

423
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,360
I forgot what the goal is

424
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Spirit cruises

425
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
Here's the problem right

426
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Well

427
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
Alex seems to think of

428
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,088
B great Davis kenwin

429
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
After he's been recalled

430
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
Right

431
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
But he does he's not running

432
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,208
In the recall election

433
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,000
Right because he's been recalled right

434
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,280
He is out

435
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,120
This there's a special election to replace him

436
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,656
Until Alex seems to think

437
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,704
Like Arnold is going to run

438
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Atman

439
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:59,872
Will run and suck the Republican votes away from each other out

440
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,152
Alright

441
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:06,016
Kind of the best I can do for you in terms of

442
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:11,136
Him not saying office believe so I can't remember if it was a choice or if he just actually could

443
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
Yeah I think it's

444
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
Newsom

445
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
Ranagain whatever he got

446
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
But he didn't get recalled

447
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:25,728
I do I am I am I wish I had a better understanding of that but I recalled you don't

448
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
End up in the next one

449
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,848
Davis is going to win

450
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,384
Anda

451
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
I mean he's wrong

452
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,992
There's another aspect to this

453
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Michael Savage

454
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,832
Is the fly in the ointment

455
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
It works

456
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,392
There's another guy

457
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Just like that

458
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
Real

459
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
Or political

460
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,568
Liberal agenda

461
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,552
Course

462
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Medicine

463
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,688
Is that what he did

464
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
Is it

465
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,560
This is definitely not what Alex thinks now

466
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,864
In more recent times Alex's

467
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,424
Wheatley contradictory narrative about Ross Perot

468
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,312
In the present Alex definitely it said that bro was the first attempt at a trump like president and he would have won but

469
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,872
But the globalist threatened his family so he bowed out of the race

470
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,200
It's so bizarre how you go back in history

471
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
These blatant Subs

472
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
Incentive contradiction

473
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:18,880
2003 Alex knows that Michael Savage is a knowing she'll for the globalist

474
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,184
Trying to suck votes away from a real conservative

475
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,232
In the California gubernatorial race

476
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
A few years later

477
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:30,656
How to swear that he's one of the legends of the Patriot movement even a Trailblazer for all these years he's the one who

478
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
Change the game

479
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:38,592
In 2003 Alex knows that Ross Perot was working with bush and Clinton that election in following years

480
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,920
Won't know this anymore in fact he knows the opposite to be true

481
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,480
The reason they're these absurd contradiction

482
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:49,088
Because Alex was just making up reality to suit whatever he wants to be true at the moment

483
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,416
Whatever makes his job easier and makes it more money is true

484
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,768
2003 Savage didn't want anything to do with Alex so he was the enemy

485
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,144
In later years Savage was willing to Gaston out to show and talk s*** about Obama so he became alive

486
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:08,288
Yep and 2003 Alex have no reason to support any politician other than Ron Paul sopro could be a bad guy

487
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,896
In later years Alex Ajo useful prostory could be to reinforce the idea that

488
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
The system was out

489
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,040
So he rewrote his narrative to be there bro was a noble hero who the globalist forced out of the race

490
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,088
None of this means anything to him

491
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,160
It's just an exercise in radicalizing people further to the right

492
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,000
I consistently insisting that disaster is right around the corner

493
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,584
And then offering no real solution other than tuning into Alex show tomorrow

494
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
See what you should be afraid

495
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
That's sad

496
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:39,008
Yeah I think people like Alex should not be allowed to talk about people like Ross

497
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
Despereaux just because

498
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,664
You're going to make up bulshit and it's never going to be as interesting as the reality of what Ross Perot

499
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:53,088
Vicki prospero's name out his mouth unless you're just telling interesting stories about Ross Perot witches are always

500
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,136
Hey rosborough gave Bernie Sanders a sword

501
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,928
Of course he did but what what

502
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,976
What is a more interesting story than one

503
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,560
That's not true I mean the one thing he did Ares like

504
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:07,936
Hey I'm going to get like 20 guys together and we're going to overthrow the guy you like I mean he's he's out of his mind

505
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
Prosperous

506
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
Ross

507
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,616
Do you think they're just little fingerprints

508
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
Like wow your story

509
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,736
Completely different across time wonder why that is oh wait it's

510
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,040
Super f****** obvious

511
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:27,136
So Alex thinks that Savage is going to make it so Gray Davis win

512
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,024
Michael Winer

513
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
The younger generation

514
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Conservative

515
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
Will not vote

516
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
What

517
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
He's not

518
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,904
So answer the middle says it's going to Great Davis or Schwarzenegger one of these liberals but then

519
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
The end

520
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Pacific

521
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
Everyday Baby Dave

522
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
At 8

523
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:41,632
He's a stickler for specificity

524
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:45,472
A five-year-old of Machiavelli and understand I do not

525
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
I do love that

526
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Listen

527
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,688
85 year old rocket scientist could understand this Rockets

528
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,248
95 year old that's red the prince

529
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Is going to be

530
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
Able to handle this s***

531
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,672
85 year old with a Beyond

532
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:08,768
I guess master's degree level education is going to be able to understand that

533
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,448
No no no no

534
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,240
Don't understand s***

535
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:23,104
But this is so consistent on this episode that

536
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,664
The Savages going to be this guy who ruined

537
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,712
The chances of an actual

538
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
Conservative

539
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,344
I mean I think that the writing is on the wall for the most part that like

540
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,392
There's going to be a circus

541
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:40,256
It's going to be nonsense and turtonator is probably going to win

542
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,048
Feel like everybody was kind of

543
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,120
Almost treating the idea of Arnold winning as both

544
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
An insane thought and inevitable one

545
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:53,568
You know everybody was like there's no way that Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to be our governor Arnold Schwarzenegger

546
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:58,688
I mean it's only got 40% of the vote so I guess he's going to be our governor

547
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
So

548
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,528
Alex says I don't know how to

549
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,064
I don't know how to say this

550
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
I don't

551
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
Dia de Kobe Bryant

552
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Story

553
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,024
Sexual assaults Torinos

554
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
If come out

555
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,352
This was a long time ago haha

556
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,656
And so Alex has some thoughts

557
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,496
I get a present this year

558
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,384
Call Brian

559
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
Colby

560
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
Alright

561
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,744
Are the NFL

562
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
Or any of the

563
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
They're not role model

564
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
Boys

565
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,264
It's crazy with your misogyny Trump's your bigotry

566
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,592
What are somehow both in the same sentence

567
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,664
Yeah I know I don't know how to I don't know how to handle

568
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,736
That response bananas

569
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,320
Believer

570
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:14,208
What is a knee-jerk I don't I think this woman is lying that's also

571
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,304
If I were ever credibly accused of that

572
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,352
Obviously all women are liars

573
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:27,008
But also you know I hate all black people it's a difficult

574
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:32,896
I think that if his whole thing was like I'm not going to talk about this he should have brought it up cuz then you just

575
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,456
You know showed some misogyny

576
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,992
Quite clearly

577
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:42,624
Really can't think of a worst possible take on that just not talked about it like you plan to Alex

578
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,440
Is about as bad as it gets I am just

579
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,000
Some other things that Alex

580
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
Is only talking about because he

581
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,912
Talk about this recall election at all

582
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Stop

583
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,144
Says a breathtakingly embarrassing clip

584
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,752
You have Alex rationalizing is Joyce to cover two stories that he feels are otherwise

585
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,824
Beneath him and he's totally wrong about both of them

586
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:39,456
You wrong it's it on son's death so we're fake but he's actually way more wrong about the recall

587
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,528
He's more wrong there because he's wrong

588
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Conceptual

589
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,088
Not just factually

590
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,232
Alex has decided that this thing that he's imagining will happen is a perfect summation of the way our political system is corrupt

591
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,280
But that thing is imagining wasn't

592
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,304
Real

593
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,328
Happened

594
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,936
Arnold beat Cruz Bustamante by 17% and there was no real spoiler

595
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:05,312
No other democrat or republican of the race would have greatly affected the outcome if they weren't in it

596
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
In Savage

597
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,104
Which didn't even run

598
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
He was just talking s***

599
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:14,528
The thing that Alex is imagining what happened is a perfect summation of how Alex imagines the political system works

600
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,856
But none of this is connected to reality is very bad

601
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
Seem

602
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
Like he's

603
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
Making up

604
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
Stories

605
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,024
And then being like see

606
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
That's how the stories work

607
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
What is really work like

608
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
Obviously it does

609
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,168
Well it does

610
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,520
You're just not seeing behind see you you're looking at the obvious

611
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,800
I'm looking at what

612
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Underneath

613
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,128
You know the made-up stuff

614
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
Text

615
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,944
So

616
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,248
You know there's something more prediction

617
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,552
Kind of stuff get back to a little bit of North

618
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:53,184
North Korea predicting sure you know Alex has 99% right about his predictions

619
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,744
Except for the ones that he just kind of ignores and pretends

620
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,752
For North Korea

621
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,272
Use in black uniform

622
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,880
Everywhere

623
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,048
Aperam adult

624
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,424
World War 3

625
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
What's the plan

626
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:52,064
The peanut document said that North Korea was going to launch a preemptive strike

627
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,344
Being assuming

628
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,136
I assume because they think we're going to

629
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,952
Strike them because Rumsfeld batak

630
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,512
Rumsfeld

631
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,816
Is planning to strike Korea

632
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,864
North Korea's like we can't allow that to happen

633
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,680
So they're going to preemptive strike us with missiles that again

634
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:14,080
Cannot reach our Shores whatsoever that's why there's the caveat that maybe it'll be the globalist false flag

635
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
United States

636
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:21,760
In order to make it look like North in order to get a draft in place

637
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Cuneiform

638
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
Sporting to me

639
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
Diamond

640
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,392
Pyramids on the TV

641
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:32,000
Population-wise we would need a military draft

642
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,560
Only North Korea

643
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
I can't

644
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
I guess

645
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,912
Inconceivably Alex's imagining

646
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,728
Things breaking down on like a half

647
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,520
The world versus the other half

648
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,920
Spiral Adam Tulane

649
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,528
Yeah cuz it's like wouldn't just be North Korea

650
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,600
If we dropped all the men that we can just literally

651
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,928
Occupy all of the territory will stand arm-in-arm and we will

652
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,976
Stand over all of North Korea

653
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
I don't think that's

654
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
Appliance

655
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,584
Ucan black uniforms

656
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Pyramids

657
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Step

658
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,704
And I can't believe that they work together with

659
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,520
If the Democrats 20 years later to get Trump out of office

660
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:21,920
Yeah with those fake ballast

661
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,320
Play here's where Alex does his one-man show

662
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
Nonsense

663
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:37,280
Government War

664
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,728
$200 a month

665
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,336
My little

666
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,607
This is less settled in rent

667
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
Want to join

668
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,679
You're going

669
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
It's all over

670
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
We

671
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:47,583
Two-man 22-minute act out Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous here

672
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,887
Dear God

673
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
I kept thinking

674
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,775
I kept thinking I could just like someone to just interrupted

675
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:02,431
Is not well

676
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:11,647
The captain

677
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:18,047
It's great that this new characters go get his very clear motivation

678
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:23,167
Picture of character that somebody's created to play with themselves that has gone worse than that

679
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:29,567
Add partner for himself that there is like a Clearwater

680
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,383
I want to take over my neighborhood

681
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,711
You want to help other character in my head

682
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,759
Yes there is that

683
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,087
Tell clothes would appreciate that part

684
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,159
Yeah that that was tough

685
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:50,815
That was that was bizarre brutal I'm not sure there are many instances that I can recall of Alex doing

686
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
Multiple characters

687
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,631
For that long

688
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
3 minutes log

689
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,215
It was it was something

690
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
Alex bogus calls

691
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
I had a good bit of the show is called

692
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,615
And this verse guy

693
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,943
Yes question about a story that you can

694
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,759
Very clearly tell Alex knows nothing about

695
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
Didn't go anywhere

696
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,855
It almost done

697
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,183
What's up

698
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
The guy has

699
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,959
And

700
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
They're saying now

701
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,311
England

702
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,831
Report

703
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:56,607
There's a story about Colin MacMillan is a man who bulshit nominated to be Secretary of the Navy who died by Suicide while

704
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,167
Waiting now for his confirmation by the Senate

705
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:04,799
People who knew him commented that he had a recurrence of a cancer that he's been struggling with and he thought that he'd actually

706
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
Beaten

707
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
Avails possible

708
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
Contributing factor in

709
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:15,039
Bigger picture here though you can see that Alex has absolutely no idea what this caller is talking about but he can't let that be too obvious

710
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,831
He's supposed to know every

711
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:22,207
Navy secretary nominee died by Suicide allowances never heard of

712
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,255
How its pivots by rambling about

713
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:28,351
David Kelly the UN weapons inspectors who died by Suicide recently though Alex's

714
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
Convince himself it's

715
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
Conspiracy

716
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:36,543
How much does a little hand waving tricks like this in order to obscure from his audience that he has no

717
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,847
I deal with people are talking about a lot of the time when they bring

718
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
Turn up news story

719
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:46,783
You know all these stories hours like it would be a big story it seems like it would be in at least one of his

720
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,367
200 story sex or are you at

721
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,183
I mean it doesn't mean you use that he's going to get to it but

722
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,511
What the point of having all of those tax would I sensibly be

723
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,815
Straight that he has read all of this information

724
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
Gus

725
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,911
Capable of recalling it to you should you so call it

726
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,215
Meant to show

727
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
That

728
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,007
Exact

729
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,055
It's the appearance

730
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
But he has

731
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
Question

732
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Of that

733
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:15,199
So I got to go to call who like the Ann Coulter

734
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,223
Interview

735
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,015
Very very big theme

736
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,831
On Alex's show is a suggestion of who else

737
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,135
Alex should have on screeching Groves

738
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,695
I enjoyed the time when you had and Coulter

739
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,535
Neocon

740
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
I had an idea of

741
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,607
Health Frank and might be a

742
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Play Jessie's Girl

743
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
Former liberal it'll be nice to get away

744
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,519
Think was done with the Clinton but I hearing Hillary's name being

745
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,543
Kind of pranks

746
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,823
Oh yeah

747
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,111
Al Franken

748
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,183
Yeah is Al Franken a former liberal

749
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
Yeah

750
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,351
I don't know I don't know if this is

751
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:10,751
The caller was saying that I think he was a former liberal

752
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,775
Who's going with you

753
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,543
No

754
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:17,663
I think he might have had an article about Al Franken in that stack

755
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:21,759
I think I would be a very interesting dynamic

756
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:28,159
I remember the book he had out about that which was lost

757
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:33,279
Underlying lies in the line lies tell them around

758
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
Extreme

759
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,143
Bulshit

760
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
Polemic

761
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:45,567
You know like yeah I remember he had a book that my dad have that I really enjoyed it was that why not me

762
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
It was the

763
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,615
Fictitious

764
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
Sort of

765
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,687
Travelogue of his run

766
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,479
A president and

767
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,551
The Run never happened it's just

768
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:59,647
It's just a humor book about goings-on

769
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,255
I don't want to revisit that book lest it not be as funny as I remember it being when I read it as a

770
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,839
The kid Barry ever

771
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,655
Yeah just in case

772
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,751
Yeah I think I would like to see that in Urdu

773
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,543
If it's ever

774
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:22,175
I would be I would be happy with that that could happen now be real so just call her wants

775
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:25,247
Buzzword years I want to party

776
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,807
Want to partake in the infowar

777
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,391
Alex

778
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,951
I'm a hair of your programmer

779
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,231
Your program

780
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,255
But I like to say

781
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
I can't move her hair

782
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,911
I'm just hearing everything I would like to

783
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,447
Partaking

784
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
I take all your

785
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,079
The same thing they're hearing this or from you

786
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,431
It seems like Alex. We need

787
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,479
We need a plan

788
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,063
Are you giving out all this information

789
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
Start doing

790
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,839
Real weird to call people hearers

791
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,935
All the heroes of Nashville

792
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:20,543
Definitely weird

793
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,591
Sing Alex Reed vise

794
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,871
Is a dead end

795
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,175
We know for sure that

796
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:33,599
I would like to partake in the Infowars

797
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,391
Quasi-religious speak

798
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:39,487
Alex does comeback any advice

799
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
He's just saying

800
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
Beam me

801
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
Which is

802
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,911
Maybe not possible

803
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,199
I want

804
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,879
Border

805
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,183
The Environmental

806
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,935
Become a leader

807
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,055
Commercial radio show

808
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,407
Room organization

809
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
Make

810
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:36,831
Light work

811
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
No

812
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
Secret answer

813
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,719
It's not a good answer

814
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:49,119
I don't think I can tell about this Dave character I don't know if I'd like him on Access TV or the radio

815
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,215
No hello to my heroes

816
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,263
Hear me

817
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,335
Hear me all by Heroes what is wrong with you

818
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,175
Here's how you partake

819
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,015
Yeah I figure that's a that's a

820
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:11,391
Advice that is useless to anyone except for Alex and even

821
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
When he was younger it would be useless

822
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,743
Get a massive

823
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,791
Influx of cash

824
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,863
Baja your way into a

825
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,983
Public access to make sure that you meet a weirdo for Minnesota who sells gold

826
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:32,383
Who's desperate for somebody to be his pitchman

827
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,151
Let's be honest

828
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
He's not the only guy trying to build

829
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:41,599
People with fake gold or gold guy is also philosophically a complete weirdo Liberty

830
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,695
That's super important

831
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,487
Names of philosophical Allegiance

832
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,535
With your your gold scam guy

833
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:55,167
Some of these are the pieces of advice or like maybe that's good to know Each one teach one

834
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:55,935
I'm kind of stuff

835
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Sure

836
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,751
What about having meetings

837
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,055
What about getting together and organizing

838
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,335
You know like

839
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:05,663
20 years in the future I'll tell you what that could be used against you

840
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,991
Well

841
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,295
Secret answer

842
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,599
Coming too fast

843
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
And I really

844
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,415
We think that we need to

845
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
Maybe we can

846
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
Come together first

847
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
And then we

848
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,511
We can make plans

849
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,535
I think

850
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:28,959
A police car

851
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,055
The police

852
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,071
Elected

853
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,119
Your ideal

854
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,215
You can't have meeting

855
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,543
Political meetings right

856
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,591
Enough awareness that the

857
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,151
Man is going to jam up your political meetings

858
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:14,015
Put this in order to get to the point where you can have political meetings

859
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,551
You first have to elect a sheriff

860
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:20,415
Wright County Commissioner or something like that without any kind of organizing apparently

861
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:26,047
Because it's not just like a 10000 person meeting Alex that we were talking about

862
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,327
I don't know

863
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,655
Little meetings do

864
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,263
Me to go 10,000 people

865
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,311
I don't know but that's kind of how Alex

866
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,871
You know it's got to be a big meeting otherwise what's the point

867
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,663
Obviously what he saying

868
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:46,527
His first you need to lay the groundwork for plausible deniability should anybody that you go to a meeting with

869
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,599
Cause any terrorist act then you can say to them that

870
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:55,999
No no that was an agent provocateur definitely not somebody carrying out the thing that we went to the meeting to do

871
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,279
If you have some kind of it

872
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:03,679
Matutinal support USA insurance or someone who's got your back

873
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:06,751
Okay

874
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,543
Here's how you started Terror cell

875
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,615
Just useless advice

876
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,175
Is the good way to

877
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,967
They get a sheriff elected would be

878
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,735
To organize

879
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,759
Nightstand

880
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,527
Some political Act

881
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,855
Yeah the sheriff

882
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
Refracted

883
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,927
Seems like this is just another path towards

884
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,999
I'm not being able to move is this caller said

885
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:32,351
Write a mean isn't he kind of reinforcing the idea that you can

886
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,167
Change things through electoral action

887
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,239
Thus making the need for violence

888
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
You know

889
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,055
No

890
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,359
No he's not

891
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,895
You should vote for your local

892
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,687
That comes later

893
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:50,271
That's true

894
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
The sheriff first

895
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,135
Enough people to get the sheriff

896
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,159
But you can't be

897
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:00,767
God damn it is

898
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:07,167
Also don't put up any signs for the sheriff because they could be a false flag tank

899
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,215
The current sheriff is going to come to your house

900
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,495
Jam you up

901
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,823
Migrants outfits another call this guy is an artist

902
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,967
Calling in from New York to hear from you what's going on

903
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,551
I just want to let you know that

904
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,647
We've been called the Blues Festival here in

905
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,671
Pennsylvania

906
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,999
Tri-state area

907
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,535
Check it out

908
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,303
Mocospace.com

909
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,983
The New World Order

910
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,455
The Revenant

911
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
Everything everybody

912
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,503
727

913
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,527
Hell yeah

914
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
Bulova

915
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831
Who's Bank on Poker Face

916
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,599
Poker Face

917
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,903
I found the band's website free Lady Gaga

918
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,695
Yes quite a bit

919
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:05,023
Video of them playing at that Festival there plug-in

920
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:09,375
Alex is hyping this kind of a plug on the show it

921
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,399
It's not a large

922
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,703
It seems like maybe

923
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,263
Elevated battle-of-the-bands

924
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,055
Typer typer

925
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:22,687
But everybody from 7270 did enjoy it

926
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,735
MPA

927
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,039
Paul

928
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,319
I know because

929
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,135
He said his name is the lead singer of the outfit

930
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,927
She also plays guitar and keyboard

931
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,463
His bio is

932
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,743
Is pretty sweet on the website

933
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:42,399
Paul is the heartsoul songwriting social Guru that poker face is

934
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:48,799
This biography

935
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:52,127
Songwriting social Guru that poker face is

936
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Heart

937
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,431
Camisole

938
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:57,503
, songwriting social Guru no commas

939
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,831
Salisbury Social Guru

940
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
That

941
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,903
Poker Face

942
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,743
Bad grammar

943
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:14,143
He is and always has been capable of immense inside and focus the source of his reverence and respect for

944
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,167
We're all things through

945
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:21,567
And willingness to fight against those that are unjust of his biography I am not trust

946
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,335
Sing the writing of

947
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,103
Elvis songs

948
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,151
The other people in the band have also

949
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,735
Some silly bios

950
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,551
They didn't call it no

951
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,087
But Alex

952
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:37,951
Familiar with that

953
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:44,351
Bands name out there on are just like haha surprise I called in casual about the way you made this announcement

954
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:51,775
Hey man how you feel about the world

955
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,943
In the world today I think I'll scares is right on right on

956
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,503
62 report

957
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,527
Report

958
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,063
I think I missed

959
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,623
Take me to Kissinger

960
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
America

961
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:12,767
Terrorism

962
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,583
Well I'm hearing that

963
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,143
I'm at humor of his heroism

964
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:23,519
That's pretty impressive at this rock and roll collar is asking why would he think about the state of the world and he quickly cites the report for

965
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
From Iron Mountain

966
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,311
Which is a fake.

967
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:30,943
It was a satirical piece written by a guy named Leonard Lou and mint to skewer how think tanks operate

968
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:36,831
Secret group or tasked with figuring out what the insides of a state of Peace would be for the United

969
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,463
Their ultimate conclusion was a piece is not good for the continuance of our system particularly our economy

970
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,767
And us it's not a desirable state

971
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
To pursue

972
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,071
That's the document

973
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,935
The Liberty Lobby run by racist Nazi Willis carto published the text

974
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:54,751
What time is it was real in a government document

975
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,079
And you know you be able to publish it but unfortunately

976
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,639
It's owned by somebody so they got sued by Luan

977
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,431
And ultimately settled the case out of court

978
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:09,087
Sounds like this rock and roll collar Alex and even Bill Cooper cling to the idea that the text is real because it matches

979
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:13,439
Is there worlds you really well it must be true and not a piece of

980
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,487
Satirical skewering of

981
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,023
Think that culture

982
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,863
Absolutely and if you believe it's real have I got an Irish baby for you to eat

983
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
Hey

984
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,703
What about it

985
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,543
So alligator busy

986
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,127
Pretty positive

987
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,151
Infowars

988
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,431
Fans

989
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:37,759
I think he wants to spice things up a little bit to use on Philly bags

990
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,783
People who disagree

991
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
Free to call in

992
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:50,047
We are going out

993
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:57,983
Pensacola

994
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
Florida

995
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:02,079
If you disagree with me or anything I'm saying

996
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,687
18

997
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
Attorney

998
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,647
Anything nobody disagrees called in

999
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,743
Seldom is that going to happen

1000
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,511
Almost Never

1001
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:26,911
Who's listening that disagrees with Alex in 2003 who is motivated enough to call news

1002
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,447
And that was

1003
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:31,263
You disagreed in the wrong way

1004
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,567
You have to be if you disagree

1005
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
With Alex

1006
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:38,431
Inboard extreme position you're already motivated enough to get on a phone

1007
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:41,247
Without disagreements

1008
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:44,063
He's likely to get or not going to be thoughtful

1009
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:44,831
Criticism

1010
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:47,135
Going to be like what

1011
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,927
That kind of stuff and that's

1012
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,695
That's

1013
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,743
Obviously you'd want to bathe that

1014
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,815
Into coming at you and the people who are

1015
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,095
You-know-who would

1016
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,911
Ideologically disagree with him

1017
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,983
Most likely listening for entertainment value to laugh at

1018
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:09,663
You're not going to call in and be like hey man you're pretty low

1019
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:14,527
Another caller wants to talk a little bit more about this idea of organized

1020
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,855
Pretty opposed to the idea

1021
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,879
Is Alex

1022
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,695
Gets basically like into a state of like

1023
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,767
Okay well why don't you you could go find like-minded people

1024
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
Course

1025
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095
We know where this road leads

1026
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,887
Is there anyway

1027
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
Because your audience

1028
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:31,935
The most

1029
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,703
Informative

1030
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,495
They seem to be the

1031
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,359
Cellular areas where

1032
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,383
People who live

1033
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,663
You would agree with you

1034
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,199
Can get together and

1035
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:43,967
And start

1036
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,247
That's a base to do things glow

1037
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,063
Well

1038
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,399
You guys could call local radio

1039
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:17,247
You can meet like-minded people there

1040
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,607
If you buy one of my

1041
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,799
Security response

1042
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,943
And you walk down the street

1043
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,319
Are you wearing my shirt

1044
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,303
You're going to

1045
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:11,263
Are we what are we talkin about we talk about organizing are making fresh

1046
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,871
What is exactly the the goal here

1047
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,895
Cuz if you're going

1048
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,967
To like a gun rights group I don't let your just going

1049
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,735
Tubi

1050
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,807
Engaging in gun rights activism

1051
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,879
You can probably meet some people who have

1052
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,671
Other fringy ideas

1053
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:35,071
I would assume for your own arteries are Buhler organization

1054
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:39,679
Know what you want to do together we want to get a 10 to 15

1055
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,471
So people

1056
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:47,359
Know each other's names and you don't really have any direct communication no nothing on phones

1057
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:51,455
What if a narc is wearing a for sure

1058
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,551
Possible can't do it

1059
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,415
Is so smart

1060
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:05,023
So informed there's no way they would allow a

1061
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
What I mean what would you even call

1062
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:12,959
Provocateur ticket into their ranks

1063
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,591
It worked

1064
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,383
I do have the shirt I do have

1065
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,151
Videos

1066
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
Where

1067
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,527
Educate

1068
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Small group of friends

1069
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,087
And people that you care about

1070
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,159
Show point where you know your

1071
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,351
You're trying to pull

1072
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,143
My warning

1073
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:42,911
No question

1074
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,383
That's pretty pretty abusive

1075
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:56,223
Hey your family people care about you as a person

1076
01:05:56,479 --> 01:06:02,623
Recognize follow you down there

1077
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,927
You know what I worried they're just

1078
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,463
Keep themselves they don't respect

1079
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
Yeah yeah yeah

1080
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,767
At for your mental health

1081
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,839
I think you should isolate yourself from them

1082
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:16,191
That way they'll all be together with their social group that agrees

1083
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:16,959
With each other

1084
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,287
And then you'll be alone by yourself

1085
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:26,687
Only listening to me that I've already told you you don't got to buy more anyway I mean like Mike

1086
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:33,087
I already buy the shirt and it didn't help and then there's this guy who runs a radio station

1087
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,671
Yeah that makes perfect sense

1088
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,487
Perfect recipe for roast people at church

1089
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,511
Terrible

1090
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,047
Terrible

1091
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:47,167
Suggestion really real awful all the way around

1092
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,471
Another color am I

1093
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,775
I think that guy who is the hero's guy

1094
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,799
He had a weird energy

1095
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,335
This guy has it also

1096
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,759
Call a from Minnesota

1097
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,319
A couple years now

1098
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,855
And I'm

1099
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:09,183
Real quick

1100
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
State College

1101
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,535
Something really interesting the other day

1102
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,447
Well I know

1103
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,639
Crop what is it opium

1104
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,647
Corita in Latin America but

1105
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,951
Robert Reed

1106
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,231
Liberia

1107
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:46,047
Not come up at all or not hahaha

1108
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,327
So this point yeah

1109
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:50,143
There is a civil war happening

1110
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,983
In Liberia has reason to talk about it with Alex

1111
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,311
No appeal this point so it came quite out of left field

1112
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:01,407
Hey what's the number one cash crop in Liberia

1113
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,431
Riddler vibes

1114
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,991
Scrum-half

1115
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:09,343
I don't know if he's even told me this out

1116
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,647
But he's some kind of eukaryotic

1117
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:15,999
Dialysis claims about minerals in Liberia that has nothing to do with anything

1118
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,279
Cuz I thought the caller was asked

1119
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,071
About

1120
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,863
I was just making that up

1121
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:25,471
By far the mineral with the highest production and exportation from Liberia is iron ore

1122
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,775
There's also gold mines and diamond mines

1123
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:31,103
But Liberia doesn't have a developed oil infrastructure at all

1124
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,151
The important most all of their oil

1125
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,711
Good on Alex do to catch his mistake about the opium

1126
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,783
That would have been embarrassing

1127
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,879
Soil is probably stupid Earth

1128
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,927
Just assume people have oil

1129
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,695
True

1130
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,999
Oh I think they actually do it didn't have

1131
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,047
A certain amount of like

1132
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,583
Promise or like it was

1133
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,143
Some expectations and hope that they were there

1134
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,959
Oil exploration that was optimistic

1135
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:00,287
Take but it didn't didn't

1136
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,079
Butts

1137
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,639
This caller the weirdo Riddler

1138
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,687
Huey uses AOL

1139
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:13,087
And took

1140
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,367
AOL

1141
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:20,511
Immediately

1142
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,935
And then today I turned it on

1143
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775
Look at it

1144
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:36,639
Number of American troops

1145
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,431
She's around Liberia right now

1146
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,527
4800

1147
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,855
4800

1148
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
Inverted Piper

1149
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,207
New York Times articles

1150
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,487
2302

1151
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:56,095
I want to talk about a UK article though so the top

1152
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,119
2 * 3

1153
01:09:57,375 --> 01:10:03,519
I found a guardian article from an early July 10th Bush was planning center

1154
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,543
1002

1155
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,591
That's not the source Alex exciting

1156
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:11,455
I think I was just made up that number and then attributed to a meeting with leave eggs or

1157
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,503
Probably what were

1158
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:20,671
4800 seems like a round enough number that you could pull it but also it's not 5,000

1159
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,439
So you're not like

1160
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:25,535
Guesstimating you're like all 4800 that sounds like you know exactly what you're talkin

1161
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:32,703
Trustworthy trustworthy enough I don't know I don't know where it's coming from the numbers that I

1162
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,471
Fiber

1163
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,239
Bore difference

1164
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,263
So

1165
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,359
And it has not come

1166
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,919
But apparently it was already happening

1167
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:46,015
2003 couple of profession

1168
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,295
Breakdown

1169
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:51,391
Or you with the draft

1170
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,439
Medical worker

1171
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:59,583
Do not say you see

1172
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,703
But that's all

1173
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,103
Where

1174
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,551
Uniform

1175
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,599
Weather

1176

1177

Oh my God is this guy a f******

Afraid

1194
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,879
Of what Alex is talking about with the draft

1195
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,647
Because like

1196
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,439
He's of the age but he could

1197
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
Could get drafted

1198
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:34,559
Undergrad history

1199
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:39,679

1217
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:53,663
Pathologist

1218
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:56,479

He's on the right side of that stuff in 2003

1225
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,423
Quite against these private armies

1226
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:17,983
They're bad

1227
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,775
Now that didn't stick no

1228
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,567

Little soft uneven

1231
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:34,367
Definitely uneasy it feels like we were a little all over the place on that episode

1232
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,159
I think the reason is because

1233
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:36,927
It is

1234
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,487

Gray Davis isn't going to win

01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:26,847
Nope there's going to be chaos in that race North Korea nuke us

1254
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,151
