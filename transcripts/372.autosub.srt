1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

Text Jones actually before you get your question I am excited

7
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,080
I had an update on your question from the last episode Don me after we finished recording

8
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
You asked about like songs

00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
Stick with you

10
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
You go to a nebulizer

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
Example of vodka

12
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
I just didn't come to mine okay just started talking about the Boston I stood up song by guy named Greg Brown

13
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,256
Okay Cafe when I was younger dude my Dad loved Greg brownies

14
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
This is great

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,656
Gravelly voice folk singer

16
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448

17
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
Dude somehow vacations.

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
But

19
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,080
Yeah this is album Dream Cafe that my dad would play all the

20
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
And it's just amazingly soothing

21
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
There's like a lot of

22
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
A lot of that album particularly a dream

23
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
Cafe song I've never heard that I bet I will check out my recommended songs that you have

24
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,672
Ever convicted

25
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,024
That is the first one that I am very interested it's it's very comforting

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
Take me back to a time before like

27
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
Sliding across the floor in my socks

28
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
Footloose

29
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,360
But I'm sorry your question

30
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
It was so long ago I had a question

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,344
Do what are what is like a common

32
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
That you find meditate

33
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,464
You know I'm saying like some people find meditation and making a

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,024
A sandwich like right well like the Japanese

35
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
Sure sure do you have an accident

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,448
Listening to Alex Jones

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
No I don't know maybe taking a bath

38
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,360
Yeah yeah there's a cop if you're asking just about like what is

39
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
Calming

40
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:01,504
I don't know you used making a sandwich as an example so feels bad for me to be like

41
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
I've had a lot of people who come to

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,648
Outside like I brought up that I cook the likes turkey bacon

43
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
Yeah it takes a while

44
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
The panda

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,024
Yeah baby like put it in the oven it's much quicker and

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,632
I kind of enjoy the process of it

47
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,936
Well I have a dishwasher but I wash everything

48
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960

53
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Greg Brown

Gravely

55
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,160
Voice tryouts

56
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,000
Plates with your socks and then slide all the Florida

57
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
Dishwashing by hand

58
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,168
The Anza Alex Jones

59
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,520
Dad is right in the present day because why wouldn't

00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
That's what I would say good episode

00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,344
So today we're going to be going over November 20th and 21st which is

And we will see what happens

65
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,095
Alex is not too particularly interested in a lot of these larger

66
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,191
World events

67
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
Well we'll get it.

68
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775

00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:03,871
Elevated level

77
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,967
Always screaming internally

78
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,551
Disable thank you so much you are now a technocrat

79
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
Money off that heroin

80
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,191
Freakishly large

81
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:35,103
Thank you so much always screaming internally and Sable

82
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
Disabled

83
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
One of them is an angry always screaming internally in the other ones silk like I find I find the contrast

84
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,951
To be very fun I thought you might have been laughing because you were reminded of the female wrestler

85
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,791
I was married to Marc Mero

86
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,887
Is the master of the Sable Bob

87
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
Right

88
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:04,031
So Jordan today like I said where the present day and there's some real disappointment

89
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,567
In terms of Alex Knox

90
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,967
Talking about some of the issues that you may be wanting to talk about the impeachment proceedings are at

91
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
Big deal has been pretty consistent

92
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,623
In terms of this being hike bulshit

93
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
Why won't they talk about the biotin

94
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
Bored more Stark

95
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
Angry

96
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:32,447
It's been tough for me to keep up a doing the show especially because I've been trying to take as much time

97
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,263
That I have available as possible and watch a lot of the abuse

98
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,127
History happening in front of us to Anna

99
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,455
What do matter what direction is goes there

100
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,551
Notable that should be remembered but we'll almost certain

101
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,391
Only being forgotten by the elections pretty crazy and so I've been spending

102
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
You know hours

103
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:57,279
Watching the testimony didn't have this down

104
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:03,935
Whether there's any Credence to Alex's Notions about this being bullshitted

105
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,287
All day and then also I worried that Alex is going to start talking

106
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,871
Think about it and then either you're unfamiliar

107
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
Gone down it's okay

108
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,967
I've spent a lot of time and by assessment so far

109
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,903
And also today on Thursday as we recording this Fiona Hill

110
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,303
Testified

111
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
Ebonized in targeted by Alex

112
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,887
And to her credit

113
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:40,287
She brought up the fact that all of this Soros stuff is basically a modern-day like a super rehashing

114
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:46,687
Protocols of the Elders of Zion listening I don't know if that's the butt

115
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:53,855
Nice bit to bring to the conversation and will almost certainly infuriate hours

116
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:59,231
Oh yeah but two to the extent that I have heard is that we're covering today's episode on 5th

117
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,815
I've not heard him respond to that but I imagine

118
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,911
I mean his name came up in the impeachment hearing he's going to

119
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,983
Say that this impeachment is all about him and

120
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,799
Expect more coverage of this

121
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,383
The future but it said today on the 20th through the 21st

122
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
We get

123
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
Other things

124
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
So here's another context drop from

125
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Ball player

126
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Sure is

127
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
Pointless factoid

128
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:41,471
But Rob do BF real real Charles Barkley get going for the rebound

129
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:47,103
Muscling his way into the paint that Rob do

130
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
Boxing out

131
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
Accomplishment

132
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Dino

133
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,807
I got a scholarship for basketball

134
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,599
What a f******

135
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,999
Boring thing I just said that is definitely a part of your history is pointless

136
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Make me melt

137
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,351
I'm angry at Rob do for telling me boring should about it

138
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,679
So on the 20th on Wednesday there is big

139
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Things

140
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Happening in

141
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,775
The world of Austin Texas

142
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
And Alex's

143
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
Sure to be baking soda

144
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
President

145
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,271
Taking off from Washington DC on Air Force One in beginning a trip

146
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,831
3 hour trip to Austin Texas

147
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
Where he's going to be

148
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,231
With Jim Cook one of our favorite people I know I'm one of his favorite people

149
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,279
Crazy eyes ahead

150
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
World

151
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,167
Petrovich code keys and Control Act

152
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,031
He's going to be here in Austin at one of the few app

153
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
Whole factories love

154
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
In the United States in north Austin

155
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
White towards the end of the show illegal

156
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,039
Little bit early and no s*** you are

157
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,879
So the timing and circumstances here could not be more ideal

158
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:08,255
Alex is already planting seeds in his audiences mind about Trump not valuing his true supporter

159
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,559
And so soon after he was Trump

160
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Coming to Austin

161
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,143
But he's not coming to visit the Texans

162
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,519
As they call Alex in the white house or is Alex says they College

163
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,591
He's not coming to get briefed on all the evil globalist

164
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
It's going on

165
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
He's coming to do a

166
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
PR trip to the Google factory

167
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,503
He's being accompanied by literal demon globalist

168
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Tim Cook

169
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
So that is

170
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
Really good for Alex's

171
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:41,535
If you're if you're looking to jump off that ship then the time might be now and

172
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,607
Having who stand up with the right way f******

173
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:51,007
The worst slave factories in the world

174
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
This gives Alex an amazing opportunity

175
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,895
Trump is in Austin so obviously Alex has to go

176
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:01,247
Trump is going to Google so obviously he's not there to validate Alex

177
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,319
All Alex needs to do is show up and be ignored

178
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,415
And here's the next stage of his breakup narrative perfectly staged for him

179
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
On film

180
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Are you going to Google or Apple

181
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
Apple

182
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
Excuse me

183
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
He comes to you know

184
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
You coming too

185
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Alex's City

186
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,751
Just after Rodger Stone gets convicted and did nothing about it

187
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,311
And instead of meeting up with his loyal supporters

188
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,615
Here he is glad handing with the

189
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
The anime

190
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,943
This is the perfect layup

191
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
You show up

192
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,575
You start bull horning about how he's got to pay attention to the true people

193
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:41,183
Or you show up outside their you start bull horning about how he's part of the globalist

194
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,583
Corrupted I may have slipped up there with Apple and Google because

195
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
Is Alex uses a Metrotech

196
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,727
Naturally factories in the world

197
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Yeah

198
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
So Alex

199
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,847
He's announced that he's going to protest

200
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
Stop protesting

201
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
Or is this is a fine line to walk

202
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,247
Just left about 45 minutes late song

203
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Message

204
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Play the president

205
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Protest

206
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Forestville Mall

207
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
Message to the president

208
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
And today

209
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Traveling with

210
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Tim Cook

211
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
Trump coming to Austin

212
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
He puts Alex in a precarious

213
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Position

214
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:31,615
On the one hand he's been pretending that he and Trump are basically soulmates and on the exact same wavelength

215
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
4 years

216
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,759
Alex's information has changed the course of history in trouble loves what he does and has since day one

217
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
On the other hand

218
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
None of that's true

219
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
Copying and Austin is a

220
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,927
Kind of no-win situation for Alex if he wants to

221
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
To keep up that charade

222
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:51,583
Because Alex knows that he goes to this plant his audience will expect to be greeted warmly by Trump

223
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
Play the hero it doesn't guess

224
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,519
Maybe he'll let Alex come along with the tour in Gallatin, secretly wants to do

225
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:04,383
Of course everyone knows it is Alex shows up he's going to get the same reception he does every

226
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,247
He's going to be kept out by security and reduced just yelling on the street into a bullhorn

227
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
Why would Trump allow that

228
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
Not going is not an

229
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,183
Unless I was wanted to pretend he has like a secret meeting with Trump it's um

230
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Clandestine location

231
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,303
But that's going to be really difficult as Ally

232
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,399
Yeah at this stage of his career I don't think Alex is up to trying something like that

233
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Alex has to go

234
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
And he knows when he does

235
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
He's going to be rejected

236
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
This is the perfect setup

237
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
For the delivery of a forceful message

238
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,943
Which will fall on deaf ears and make it that much easier for him to argue that true

239
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
Trump is not there guy after all

240
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
This is perfect for him

241
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
Yeah and you get the up

242
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,879
Of being you got somebody with the camera while you're being

243
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
Pushed out

244
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
You got security telling you that you're not invited in

245
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
You got the camera everybody

246
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
Can see in the in the Wingnut

247
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,911
A community that Trump is pushing him away he's pushing all of us away Alex

248
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,239
Their symbol and the Revolution begins now

249
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
Right and simultaneously there's going to be a ton of people who are there on the left let's say Pro

250
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Shrubs

251
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,063
Visit imagery that he needs out of this

252
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
Regardless of which direction he wants

253
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,647
It's almost a perfect setup

254
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,463
For everything except maintaining the status quo

255
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,535
What she is going to try and do as hard as you possibly can I assume

256
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:31,423
I'm not positive I have very mixed feelings about it but one thing that is staying with the status quo

257
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,471
Is that the globalist 37

258
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
They drink blood

259
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,591
And they're possessed by Immortal spirits

260
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,919
It's over

261
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,551
We know the blood-drinking child rapist

262
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Woodlawn

263
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,023
Gangstar

264
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
Quasi immortal

265
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
Oh boy

266
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,727
Somebody he's not allowed to use the

267
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Ever again

268
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
It's holding a lot of weight

269
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:15,455
Quasi Immortal picking beefsteak

270
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,319
Quasi

271
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,927
I don't think I've ever heard anybody use the use the prefix

272
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Quasi

273
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
Anyway other than

274
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,887
Being kind of shity

275
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,959
Make it too strongly to say it all

276
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
So Trump is a man who can

277
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
The problem is that

278
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
He doesn't

279
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Stand up

280
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
For a look like

281
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,759
I think this episode do you see a fair amount of Alex being like

282
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
I think so

283
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,391
The Republican party's main affiliation is Nazis on Google

284
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,463
Does nothing

285
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
I'll be hanging out with Jim cook today

286
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,583
Who runs the worst Factory in the planet

287
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
But

288
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,823
When it comes to saying it's coming it's very strong action

289
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
Where

290
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Turning Point USA

291
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
Walking home from

292
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Coming in

293
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
Events

294
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
And

295
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,839
Take money away from University today

296
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
The neocon never Trump has or taking over

297
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
You want to know why people

298
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
There's your answer

299
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
My super hardcore stuff

300
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,047
Supporting Hillary light

301
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:16,543
Great so I I told you that there is no way Alex would ever go against drudge and I think that's

302
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
We're seeing that

303
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:24,223
He's defending drudges waffling going along with basically that

304
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Exact line

305
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,575
Weird part in the middle of their is the bring up the turning point

306
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Yeah

307
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Because

308
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,767
The people that they're trying to keep out our acolytes

309
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
So

310
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,119
In the first part of I believe correctly

311
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,007
He's mad because Google is Alexa isn't even stopping people from assuming that Trump is a white National

312
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:52,383
It's not what he's mad because Trump isn't protecting out now white right now

313
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:59,039
They eat these not forcing Turning Point USA to allow these white nationalists

314
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
Yeah

315
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
A bunch of bulshit

316
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
So a large

317
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743
Part of this episode in order to not really talked about

318
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
The impeachment stuff

319
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,351
And not talk about anything really substantial

320
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,191
So much of it is just yelling about child abuse

321
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
And the demon

322
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
Vampires suck

323
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Can blood

324
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
A ritual

325
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
And all that stuff and I'm not going

326
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
To cover

327
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
Because I find it irresponsible

328
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,479
The score

329
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
I find it

330
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
To be corrosive and toxic

331
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,343
Even to a point where is covering it

332
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
I don't think it is

333
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
I don't think it merits cover

334
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
Yeah I think it is

335
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Atrocious

336
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
And

337
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
I resent Alex

338
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
Sport

339
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,167
Now look in the course of talking about that there is one thing that I find interest

340
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
I'm going to play this clip

341
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
It's not that gross

342
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,543
Not really gross necessarily

343
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
As I recall

344
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,639
But if tracks with something that we've been paying attention

345
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,943
To do and that is Alex's stories

346
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:04,831
Of going to Satanic rituals when he was a kid

347
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,439
And this is interesting because we learn a little bit more about that

348
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,255
Understand I've actually research this

349
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,815
Because I ran into this

350
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,847
Natalie

351
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Course

352
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Rituals

353
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
But I got

354
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
Okay

355
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
GameStop

356
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
They wanted me

357
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,655
Thank God thank God

358
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,287
Took three things first I got fooled twice what's that expression fool me once

359
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
Shame on you

360
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,991
Man York logos

361
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
Kick a little ass on my way out

362
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Ivory

363
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,695
That we just said we added that one was Satanic ritual

364
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
I think this demons

365
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,095
Even Rachel and I fought my way out

366
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Kurt Russell in

367
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:27,775
Big Trouble in Little China I feel like it's that was a real story that would have been what have you told it every single time

368
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
Did you do with that story the Safeway second is this is a satanic coven or whatever that

369
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,527
Rituals I don't think that no one's going to be armed there

370
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,135
I mean at the very least there's one ceremonial no

371
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,279
I don't believe for a second that he youthful Alex could fight his way out of a real Satanic ritual

372
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:57,727
The stakes of let it give out our way to Harpers Ferry High

373
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,543
But there are rules

374
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,847
Federal Circle

375
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,503
You could have one everybody has to fight you one at a time sure you can't gang

376
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
Third thing

377
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,879
Alex is like his so on in line with his sense of self

378
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:21,536
He has to make sure that you understand that he was tricked into going to this ritual so he could be one of the powerful ones not a victim

379
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:26,144
In the scenario even within his weird illusion

380
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,800
He has to make sure that you know that like I'm not I'm not going to be one of the ones that was big

381
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
Evil Satan

382
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,128
Recognize the strengths

383
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
And that's

384
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
That's gross

385
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
To like his psychology

386
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,112
Very clearly liked what I heard that I laughed really hard at the fighting his way out

387
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
And then I was just like

388
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,720
Tell the story I was not there

389
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
To be diddled

390
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
That's exactly

391
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,096
It is it is kind of disconcerting how very similar

392
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,680
Cuz you could totally see Trump trying to

393
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,984
Do the exact same thing in

394
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
I'm telling what it is b*******

395
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Sure just that that

396
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
I need you to know

397
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:12,224
I am always the strongest person in the room even stronger than these

398
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,368
Demons around all of these states Manning heads of state

399
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
Stronger that one

400
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,720
Can God move a mega Mountain can't move nobody

401
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Can make a mountain hike

402
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
Yeah

403
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
It's

404
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
Upsetting

405
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,888
So like I said a lot of the episode is about this

406
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,936
And I wish I could would have

407
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,032
Cut some of the clips maybe because some of them to drift into like

408
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
Real serious

409
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Is racism

410
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Surrounding

411
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
Some of these

412
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Rituals

413
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
Drink drink

414
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,016
Children's blood

415
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
I can't bring myself to do it and I think

416
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
It's too gross

417
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,880
So that's most of this episode

418
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Jesus 20th

419
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
It's

420
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
Very heavily

421
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
Too much yeah

422
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,560
I'm telling you like listening to his

423
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
Present-day episodes

424
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
Like this last week has been

425
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
A disaster

426
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
Okay to just

427
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
Do with like

428
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
3 hours of f******

429
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,616
Borderline torture report on the radio to family show okay well that's fair

430
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,456
It's not wall-to-wall that there is it also just boring

431
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:20,320
Stop in there

432
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,112
Even worth covering or like

433
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,440
I don't have clips of him saying that the impeachment is all just b*******

434
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,816
Burden

435
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
This is okay to do

436
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
I'm not saying that we should

437
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,496
Some think the state should stop him I think it's wholly unacceptable

438
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,800
And I would find it on except

439
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
For us to go over it

440
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
So we shouldn't

441
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,896
I'm it so there's not too many clip

442
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
From the 20

443
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Cuz it's a lot of that

444
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
But we do learn something about Alex's

445
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Plan

446
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,576
To go give a strong message

447
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
Not a protest

448
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,720
Wrong message it's a protest but not necessarily against Trump

449
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
Strong message

450
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,280
And that is

451
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
You know how he's been going around in a tank

452
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
Yeah turns out he bought it

453
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,448
Car

454
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
We just ran into it

455
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
We can deploy Mass

456
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,048
So he bought this like this armor

457
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
Truck like what what what

458
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,168
Your business is going under allegedly

459
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:46,592
Selling his f****** house that's what I'm f****** dictator does to years

460
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
Before they get deposed violently

461
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,504
Say it either is or it's an indication that he's f****** gaslighting is already on

462
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,832
Yeah you can buy a armored car

463
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:03,232
No that's your business is not nearly in the kind of trouble that you're pretending it is something to do because

464
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
It's not necessary

465
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,840
United Way and I put my price this out and it

466
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:12,192
It's kind of difficult to figure out exactly what you'd be paying but it's in the tens of thousands of dollars

467
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
Stores that armored truck

468
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
No I would say

469
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
At least it if you

470
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
He's also got a

471
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Amass

472
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:22,688
Sound system attached a couple of speakers on the roof

473
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,552
See you getting on the on the bargain

474
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,600
That that is you know baby

475
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
The Brandt

476
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
Okay alright

477
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,464
But this card like I looked at the range

478
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,560
Armored vehicles

479
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
The one he has

480
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
And I don't know

481
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,936
He doesn't have a sunroof you have a latch on the top of it

482
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,240
Which I imagine will probably be an add-on

483
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
To take that off

484
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,128
The chassis are all built with

485
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,200
Even if he got a pretty good deal I don't see this being

486
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,736
Like less than

487
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,808
$30,000

488
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
Which is

489
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,648
Yeah I know that's

490
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:09,536
That's troubling Behavior that's that's a red flag Behavior right there if you're around a person like that

491
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:15,936
It will be tough to be a listener the show like let's say you really believe that he needs all the support in the world right now and

492
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:21,824
You got to go buy the product and let's leave baby you bumped up your donation or you fail to him and then

493
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
I don't know where you find

494
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
Spending tens of thousands of dollars

495
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,712
On an armored truck so we can go educate people

496
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:32,064
Like it's not it was now it's so he doesn't get attacked by ants

497
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
OSHA

498
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,904
Course he needs that armored vehicles absurd

499
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,696
It's a really it's a really silly thing

500
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,768
He gets to basically expressing why

501
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
He bought it

502
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
The shop

503
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,704
Tiaras with the armored movie

504
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,544
Have an idea

505
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,360
I know that idea is going to succeed

506
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,920
Similar idea

507
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,224
The idea has never fail

508
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,016
Thanks to dodge

509
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,552
Robin given

510
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,368
The fact that we are working together

511
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,976
Building the resistance to this globalist

512
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Do

513
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,328
We did this together

514
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,424
You are you need to know

515
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,472
No it's not you are

516
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,032
How much I want to salute you

517
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
How much I want to thank you

518
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,616
For buying me an armored car

519
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,968
Damn he's very clear they're like the pr from this car

520
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:37,856
She recognizes that like it's not that interesting for him to show up and yell at people anymore so you up

521
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Escalate

522
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
Bespectacled like

523
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
Alex

524
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:46,048
Getting out the tank top of the armored vehicle with the sound system yelling at people

525
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,096
This is somehow going to be like

526
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:54,496
I'll get press out of this for sure

527
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
This'll be like a

528
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,104
They got the siren song to them to give me free press

529
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:05,760
And it does not bode well if you're willing to spend whatever price you're paying for an armored vehicle for whatever diminishing return

530
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:10,112
Kind of publicity you're going to get out of driving around in an armored car yelling at me

531
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,416
People like what do you think the next step is

532
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
Flying a plane around and yell

533
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,744
People Get Ready

534
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,584
Absolutely that's not the

535
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
Straight to Skyride

536
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,728
Bentley I don't know what else he could do to be more bombastic and more like

537
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,288
I'm sure you could come up with something but

538
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
This is like

539
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
To me this is the version

540
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,152
Of the

541
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
The cult leader

542
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,344
Everybody you must take a vow of poverty and everybody must give him all your money and then all the sudden he's wearing all these dime

543
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,720
What the f*** are you doing there's like Domino 8/8 about appearances

544
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,560
Whenever I whenever I go out into the world I have to look like a powerful

545
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,608
And I have to look like I'm this all that's

546
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,656
It does have I've done

547
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
Just so f******

548
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,008
It's not a good look

549
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,288
No

550
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:06,688
It's not a good look for him to rationalize this by being like antifa attacks me and us I need an armored vehicle

551
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Already have

552
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:13,344
Ex Blackwater security guard right I don't know what kind of protection do you need outside of that that's crazy

553
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:18,208
It's that argument doesn't really work at any argument that like I have big plans for the

554
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
PR I'm going to get out of this

555
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:25,376
I don't know that I saw a ton of coverage when he went to the Hillary of that in the armored truck

556
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:35,872
Why is he not hiring but I just think that this is not going to work for that and either and it

557
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Like if

558
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:40,992
If that's his primary motivation then obviously the next stage is something

559
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
More

560
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
Extreme

561
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,088
And I just don't know what it is I mean

562
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,864
No that's a step in the right direction

563
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,424
What can we just now getting the armored car ID

564
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,984
Cuz he's desperate now

565
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:07,104
So in the next the last one from the 20th cuz Alex leaves earlier

566
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,896
Pop a perc takes over

567
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,432
Brighten Studio

568
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
And

569
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,272
Alex like this is gross man

570
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:19,136
He's talking about Trump and how he's not against him but he's going to go yell at and then

571
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,440
Just the way he described him as Soto

572
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Ringleader

573
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
But

574
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,808
Hey Dad what are you doing with him

575
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:52,416
That's good to meet with me but if we haven't gotten relief

576
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
Do something

577
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
Do something

578
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Yeah

579
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,680
Cordova kind of movies are at a long time

580
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:07,520
Paternalistic view of the president that's

581
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,848
Good I believe you it makes

582
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:16,992
That's what they all want like we hired you to be the big strong man who does this so we don't have to

583
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,552
I don't want to have to add jatate I want

584
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:26,208
Do it for me right I mean set Steve's that when he came back and we got him an office so he can

585
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
You do these

586
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:33,376
Everybody and then not answer any questions but silent

587
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,984
Yeah it's Alex either he make the wrong move confidently than makeup

588
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,264
The Right Move

589
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Quietly

590
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:46,944
And now Alex he's daddy hanging out with the evil villain Tim Cook and you got to ask

591
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
Why would you do that

592
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,016
You're not helping us

593
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,296
I know Alex

594
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
I know think of

595
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
Yeah

596
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
Don that I think he is

597
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,184
Yeah I think I get the sense video

598
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
Dialect leaves

599
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,536
And a little clip of him out bullhorn dang it

600
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
At the Trump rally

601
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:08,960
Bi-Lo Bi-Lo

602
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:28,416
It's just like a Sizzle reel of people giving him

603
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
Finger at work

604
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
It's a boy

605
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,792
I don't know if this delivers a strong message

606
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,584
Truck but it works for

607
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,400
PR with the Giant Truck

608
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,960
So that was the main goal of it

609
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:45,568
You put out a 5-minute Sizzle reel me 34-minute Sizzle reel that just had like

610
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
Yelling at folks

611
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,408
Watch the lake 25-minute longer wives

612
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,992
Like wow isn't accurate Sizzle reel that is exactly what happened

613
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,552
Whenever they

614
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
Can really edit

615
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:00,672
Reddit properly people there who are like protest

616
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,256
Drop a man Alex Galligan

617
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
This is sad

618
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,120
And he's got that he's got the armored car in the back

619
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,936
He's popping out the top of it for a lot of Enderman

620
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,592
That is such Trump standing in front of a goddamn helicopter just

621
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,432
God you're so sad

622
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,992
So we get to the 21st

623
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,808
And Alex opens the show a little bit weirdly

624
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Sleep

625
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
For the first time

626
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Was forcing myself

627
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
Sleep

628
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Because I could

629
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,496
I was without the aid of coffee

630
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,456
Immigration slavery

631
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:00,320
What happened to The Sleep Apnea thing

632
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,136
You said that he had sleep apnea so bad that CPAP

633
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
Machine and he had to sleep sitting up right never felt longer than like an hour or two at a time what's the story

634
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,120
I don't know but I genuinely don't know I don't either

635
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:16,704
I don't know what he's lying about know what some things alike

636
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,104
I can see him lying either way too I can see him yet pathetic so he can get more money

637
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
I'm lying to make it look like

638
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,944
Keep stronger

639
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,064
And really Elevate whatever is happening in his Worlds by being like

640
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,904
Everything so serious I stayed up all night last night I never do that

641
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,488
My 27 years on are never done that Rob Badoo Badoo

642
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,816
I don't know like it it gets to the point where like

643
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,656
You listened to enough of this show if you have a critical eye looking at it

644
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,448
You will find contradict

645
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
And it just like well something

646
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
July

647
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
I don't know yeah

648
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:56,128
Cool anything could be real but the not being able to sleep

649
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,272
Checks out a bit more with the manifestations of his behavior

650
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
I don't know what

651
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Now I have no

652
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,208
Out there are certainly don't really care that much

653
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Now he's fine

654
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,840
So Alex starts complaining about how the globalists

655
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Right

656
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,632
Sure you know them

657
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
I've heard they're evil

658
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,752
They like to push the idea that one group

659
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,848
Is behind all the evil in the world like let's save the Masons

660
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,896
The Catholic hold on

661
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,432
The globalist

662
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,992
Right like to push the idea that

663
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,064
Yes that's it and cannot be

664
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,112
We'll see what they do is they

665
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
Foster groups

666
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,720
That are like hey you know what's wrong with the world

667
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Everything is a mason

668
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:51,168
Conspiracy okay now you take a step back from that you recognize that Alex is doing the same thing but with the global

669
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,240
Say that he cannot say that

670
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:59,104
He does he can't save at the globalist want to make people think that it's one Shatter Me

671
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:04,224
But he does and it's to get into a very brief

672
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,552
Discussion about how Benjamin Netanyahu has been

673
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,344
You know there is

674
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Mumbai

675
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,904
In the world

676
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,512
Push that wants to always say it's

677
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Mason

678
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:21,888
Catholic saints

679
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
It's a goblin

680
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,960
Supremacist

681
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
Secretly

682
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,128
It's just evil groups of people of every race color creed

683
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,456
Work on the same wavelength

684
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,992
Global government

685
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
Posthuman world

686
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,624
I just noticed

687
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
Today is

688
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:48,512
Yahoo it's been ruled in Israel is going to stand trial for

689
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,168
Supposedly

690
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,960
Hosting dinner

691
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,544
Over the years at his house at the government

692
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
Not

693
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,944
Pay for dinner

694
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
On charges of

695
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
Bribery

696
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,624
The Rothschilds supposedly found in Montana

697
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,696
Glass

698
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,768
Hold on Wiggly point of order

699
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,072
How is Israel

700
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
1 Monolithic Power

701
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,424
You see

702
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
I have

703
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,264
No f****** clue what it is you

704
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:37,920
He's saying that's like some people say that the Jews run the world but in reality

705
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:42,272
Netanyahu is being indicted it's all being spearheaded by the Rothschild

706
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,832
That's alright

707
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,136
Alright Alex I was getting is that

708
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
See

709
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,696
Some Jews are

710
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:54,048
This is why you don't turn to Alex for news coverage

711
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,376
This is why cuz you just leave with more questions

712
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,168
I don't know what you think I'm

713
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,216
Did you think I'm surprised

714
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:08,896
Israel's doing something he thinks is bad or not you heard anything

715
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:15,296
Supposed to be something you remember in our first episode our first episode ever

716
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
Red Alert

717
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,624
In our theme song

718
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,464
Poems from Alex talking about how Benjamin Netanyahu was

719
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,888
I'm alert

720
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
Sprint

721
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:38,848
This is not fair it's not fair you're supposed to still care at least almost 3

722
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:43,968
Years later the Rothschilds

723
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
Weird man

724
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,808
Just want you just wanted to pay off

725
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,136
Whenever he makes a prediction like

726
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,184
And then it does happen

727
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
You wanted to pay off some

728
00:38:54,976 --> 00:39:01,120
Somehow not just having be like well it's because three years ago he only cared about this because if Ben

729
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:04,704
But Netanyahu was indicted it meant that the global store about to come for

730
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
Yes

731
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,520
Even if you still believe that

732
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,824
You've got this like that Trump isn't helping us

733
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,432
Why would he scream about it being time to pray anymore

734
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
Much more be like

735
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,504
Let's just talk about

736
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
The f****** Marquis

737
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
He issues let's get back

738
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
2

739
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,648
All our enemies are demons let's just

740
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,696
Stress on that right

741
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,488
Call where they may

742
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:34,656
Good stuff so also Alex now has finally found out about the fact that their stories about Stephen Miller's emails

743
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,680
Coming out

744
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
His take on it is in

745
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,336
New York Times is a white nationalist

746
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,432
Yeah Steven Miller is Jewish

747
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,712
Pro-israel

748
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,040
His parents are leftist for anti-israel

749
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
Thought it was crazy

750
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
Growing up in that circus

751
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,608
We're allowed to have a border and it believes is not right to say white people in here

752
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,752
Call the came out 2 days ago I started last night

753
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:17,408
Stephen Miller must resign because he's a great Patriot advising the president on cut up why

754
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:20,736
I don't think they wrote that part

755
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,440
The ATL is say he is a Nazi

756
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,512
What's the proof

757
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,608
All the things he said

758
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,680
Sport academy

759
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,568
10000 emails

760
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
Surreptitiously

761
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,408
Blueprint

762
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,712
Resistance off of

763
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
Infowars

764
00:40:54,272 --> 00:41:00,416
Apparently you sent that Katie McHugh and Infowars article

765
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
Higher

766
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
I mean look

767
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:09,632
I don't want to sit here and go in-depth on this Stephen Miller Story But I recommend anybody was interested

768
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
Go ahead and read

769
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
Some of those articles dealsea

770
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
How much b******* Alex is talking

771
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
Importantly

772
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,824
Over the span of this we've heard him

773
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
Save it

774
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,408
Or indicate support

775
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,200
For the Nick Fuentes wing

776
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,016
That's trying to agitate a turning point events

777
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:30,624
He's saying that Steven Miller based in stuff on me and is great and they're calling him but

778
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
A Nazi for it

779
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,928
BC like

780
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,208
You see what he's doing

781
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,024
This is this is very clear the type

782
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,352
The type of voice he wants to defend he's choosing his

783
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
At his side of

784
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
The Schism that's for

785
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:46,496
Mercedes way far to the racist and to the right kind of like

786
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,776
Just normal Trump

787
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,592
So that's the way the ball is breaking

788
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,919
Oh man we were we were

789
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,455
Becoming truth

790
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:00,319
So I don't know if you seen this on the social media

791
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:05,695
Jordan but there's a there's a little video picture that's going around

792
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:11,839
Greta thunberg is from the time-travel South Dakota

793
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
Oh that's good stuff

794
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:18,495
We're on it yeah love it

795
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519
I got it

796
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,567
Poorly done I don't know why

797
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
Did you take it

798
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:27,455
So Alex has a take on this sad

799
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
This weekend

800
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,367
Individual saying

801
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,303
They put that out

802
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:48,959
Yeah freak you out that's what I'm all about

803
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:06,111
That's what I love give me a boring dumb story about somebody make

804
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
You mistake and then be like Siri

805
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,695
That's what they want you to

806
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:15,327
That's the problem that I have is like yeah so much should have caught that and that should have been changed

807
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,095
Fight

808
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,631
We're on it is

809
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:22,495
Like colloquially does mean we are taking care of this

810
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,031
You know it's not like

811
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,639
It's not something like we do it

812
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,175
It's one of those things

813
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
And it happened

814
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
To everybody

815
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
And I think we

816
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,015
Should be 100%

817
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
It's one of those things where you like

818
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,159
You're just not your you're not focused on the outer edges really

819
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,487
And you're just drawing this diagram out you're at the office

820
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
Cuz you're jaundiced

821
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,303
And then somebody looks down in my life

822
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,351
You just drew a dick on that paper and you're like

823
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
No idea

824
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,911
Oh God damn it I did

825
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:57,311
There is that or there is a possibility that I would even believe that somebody is f****** around internally

826
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,383
Yeah that could catch it

827
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:07,551
I don't I don't I don't see this is that big of a thing but apparently it's been Declassified that they're trying to get people on

828
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:15,487
It must be something old that's been Declassified it is now a permutation the nomenclature

829
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:19,839
Right whenever they first had the first episode of Breaking Bad they started the

830
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:26,239
This whole plan talk about breaking bad being

831
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,775
Back on it

832
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,591
I don't know how much that she'll glorifies math

833
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,383
Pretty against meth usually

834
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,407
I think yeah

835
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,223
So Alex yells more about the demons

836
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,783
And the child blood-drinking in

837
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,831
And what have you that the global

838
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,367
To-do list

839
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,183
But he is not over demonizing

840
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
The globalist

841
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:52,607
Not over demonizing them you have to understand that is it is the radicalization of these people have got more intense

842
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,167
Because once I sign onto hate of trump

843
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,751
Which we do have to

844
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,943
Then it just becomes anything attached to Trump

845
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:12,575
Is some satanic weapons

846
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,599
I don't think yes

847
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
Why did you bring it up

848
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
Don't think I know

849
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
Trump's more like a

850
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,071
Crossroads

851
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,239
Station of the group Collective conscious

852
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
Michael Rickles do

853
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:44,063
But if we don't rise The Challenge and defeat the Goblin this round

854
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:49,695
Trump is actually just

855
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
Absolutely

856
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,095
Build themselves into a

857
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
Quickly

858
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,911
Spiritually mutated

859
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,215
Bored

860
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,287
That is not discredit undefeated

861
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,871
You know what's pathetic on the service

862
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,919
Eurostar

863
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,271
Taking over the system and we'll start enslaving

864
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
People

865
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:18,879
I like how all those positive he's got a feel at the end there like

866
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:24,767
I landed that sense

867
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,863
Let me at least it came to a conclusion

868
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,423
Apparently

869
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,727
Trump if we don't defeat the globalist

870
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,055
Now Trump in effect is really just helping the globe us

871
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,359
The sorts of things you would

872
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,895
Never hear him save

873
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,431
Before this is a

874
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:46,015
Like I know it's not anti-trump but this is a massive departure

875
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,319
In the way he's

876
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,599
It feels like

877
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
He's having that

878
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,415
That identity crisis

879
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
This moment

880
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
Beds a

881
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
Would be

882
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,791
Acted out metaphorically in a movie is like a

883
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
Tube size of his own

884
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,351
Body fighting a

885
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Split apart

886
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,727
But the gung-ho Trump support doesn't seem like

887
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
Like it's making much of a case

888
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
No it does

889
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,335
It doesn't

890
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,871
Down to saying it's

891
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,431
I think it's more like the Joker card it could go either way

892
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,479
And there's like no I know it's like

893
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,063
You that's because you think now it's going the way a

894
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
Yeah that's why you think

895
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:27,999
Can go either way it's almost paying lip service to support as opposed to the way it was before

896
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,327
When he was starting to come on board with Trump

897
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,863
There was lip service

898
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,167
To the negative

899
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:41,567
As he was acclimating to being a full-throated supporter

900
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,663
Are you still mobbed-up I know you still got all that stuff going on but you know what he's

901
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,735
The mouthpiece for the type of people that we don't

902
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,039
It almost feels like the inverse

903
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,623
So you know also yesterday

904
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,927
On Wednesday there was a democratic

905
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
Debate

906
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,975
Another one

907
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
Yep

908
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,839
I was just not have much coverage of this

909
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:08,191
He complains about Joe Biden being disappointing and partake

910
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Sure

911
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:19,199
Can't pronounce Klobuchar okay that doesn't surprise me

912
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,783
Remember what a no you said that she's having a grand mal seizure on stage

913
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,599
That's good right

914
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:31,743
So there's not a whole lot of trying to remember if there's any other like actual substance

915
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,791
Sensitive critic criticism

916
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:37,375
This is really I would say one of the main takeaways

917
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,191
Okay I promise I'll play the eclipse

918
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,775
Tell us just are going to him right now Alexa got to somebody today

919
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,103
Because this was this really was

920
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,431
Exploding I'm just coming off and just a manifestation

921
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,247
Bizarreness

922
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,111
Sunshine

923
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
Cabbage

924
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,695
Talk about Hillary Clinton's Alexa

925
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,975
The light club

926
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,559
Alex continues his friend of being very Pro Tulsa

927
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,887
I don't I don't mean to be making a

928
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,959
Huge point of this if Alex didn't make a huge point of it

929
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,007
I don't know if it necessarily means any

930
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,799
The only thing that I find enter

931
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,823
First thing is like

932
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,431
A lot of the people that I find to be wildly distrustful

933
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:28,831
And who are people who claim to be in the center or I'm actually a liberal like Tim pool

934
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,415
Like those people who I find to be

935
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,695
Very right

936
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:40,095
Wing trustworthy

937
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
Find interesting about the

938
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,423
Receives to be a uniformity

939
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,519
In people I don't trust thinking that she's the best Democratic and

940
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,335
Yes which I don't know why that's the case

941
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:54,431
Like whatever different scenarios

942
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,455
Here's by

943
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
Here's the one that I'm

944
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,271
I'm riding with right now

945
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,343
Somebody somewhere knows something about

946
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,415
And they're in this circle or whatever

947
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:07,231
And they're using that knowledge to convince

948
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,047
These people who are dead and then it just becomes a right

949
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,631
I don't know if it's that I think

950
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,727
I think you could take even the first part of that out and just be like well

951
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,519
This would f*** with people

952
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:25,919
And it becomes

953
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,943
Just a way of like

954
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,479
Sowing dissension

955
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:33,343
By bolstering their candidate in a race that you don't care about

956
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,623
I don't know it

957
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,671
Just it's just weird to me how

958
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,439
That's very cute

959
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
Specific

960
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
But also Andrew yang

961
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,095
We're both like really bolts

962
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,911
Stirred by those same shorts

963
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,983
The 10 pool Sargon Dave Rubin

964
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,775
Ask types

965
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:55,103
I don't I don't know what it is but it. I don't trust it

966
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,383
No absolutely

967
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,199
I don't trust Alex

968
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:03,039
He's complaining here before this

969
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,343
Text Cliff he's planning a bit about like people saying

970
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,623
He's making stuff up

971
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,647
In order to

972
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,183
Shake your confidence

973
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,231
People are accusing him of making

974
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:16,351
Things off because they don't want you to have confidence in the things Alex is saying

975
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,655
That's what my point

976
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
But

977
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,471
You do this clip isn't about

978
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,007
It's about what

979
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:26,079
A metaphor that he makes about what these

980
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
These people are trying

981
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,383
Going to Dubai shaking your

982
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,223
Okay your bike down for this tough time tracking

983
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:36,575
The end is one of the more shocking things I've heard on the front cast

984
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,135
Do you really believe it

985
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,951
Are you making it up for you an actor

986
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,791
Could you do it show

987
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
Thing shows

988
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
Real things

989
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,263
Like what a shake-up

990
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
York on

991
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,871
They're not believing in you like do you really exist

992
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
So did that really

993
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
Analogy

994
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,207
In me like if you

995
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,999
Somebody cheating

996
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,023
Will your wife

997
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,583
And then they go

998
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,167
Your wife he's gay

999
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,215
And the gay guy

1000
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,007
Been married twice as for children

1001
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,199
Oh no no no one

1002
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:38,783
No one cheating with your wife he's gay

1003
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
Yeah

1004
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,391
Hey guys I know back in college and high school got more

1005
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,183
Wu-Tang Banner

1006
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,719
Toilet seat

1007
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
Hello.

1008
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,023
Crap

1009
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,839
What the f***

1010
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
Is he saying

1011
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,655
Like at the end

1012
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:59,007
And he does not elaborate on what he means by that any further

1013
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:05,663
I believe that a reading of that that would be possible is that he thinks that most gay people are

1014
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
Or Faking It

1015
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:12,831
I think that's the only way to read that I think

1016
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,159
Are you saying that gay people only

1017
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,231
Exist in order to lie about

1018
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:26,143
Your wife cheating on you so much for that libertarian streak of his Live and Let Live do you get assorted

1019
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,167
But you're Liars

1020
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,263
Another one of those

1021
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,359
So many more of these stories that happened to a friend that you're like

1022
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:42,783
You know a lot of details about this it is very specific hyper-specific and I I'm not I'm not interested right now

1023
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,159
Speculating about the reality or non reality of that a hypothetical allegory

1024
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,231
I am interested in his position that like

1025
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:57,631
The people that I knew who were Galleon High School we're having sex with women there for most of the time gay people are

1026
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:02,239
Or Faking It full of crap so f***** up

1027
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:08,383
I actually believe

1028
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,151
Nuts

1029
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:13,247
I can think of very few things that are more

1030
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
Bigoted

1031
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:19,647
Validating of the very existence of gay people for Less

1032
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,719
Gag

1033
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,743
Is it tributing

1034
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,535
Bulk of homosexuality

1035
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
That exist

1036
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,839
To deceit

1037
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:28,863
Yeah

1038
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:37,055
I've heard very few things on his show that our is confusing and troubling is that

1039
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
Cuz then he's

1040
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,407
But he's also saying that there are some exceptions

1041
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,223
Which I don't even I don't even I don't even know what that was

1042
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,503
In his canoe

1043
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
I don't either

1044
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,575
You don't like who is the exception

1045
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,111
Wendy

1046
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,135
What's

1047
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:55,231
Because now I'm now just like what's the f****** lying for him

1048
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,303
Because he's if he's if he's making this hard

1049
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,095
Then what are you saying

1050
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,631
Sexuality is

1051
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,215
Fluid I guess in some way

1052
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:11,615
Also that means that there's got to be a line for him of what actual gay and what's not

1053
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:12,895
Right

1054
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:19,295
What is that like I don't know but it also introduces the question of how could you possibly interact with

1055
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:25,951
People of different sexual orientations if he thinks that they're lying

1056
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,767
Any of them are default position

1057
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:34,399
To BMO you said you're gay well you're lying to how could you have a gay male employee it Infowars

1058
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,215
If you'd like if you believe this if you're not think

1059
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:43,615
But he's just trying to like with all the women how could you possibly

1060
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:47,199
Have a healthy interaction with anybody

1061
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,759
I don't know why do you Harbor these sorts of beliefs

1062
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:55,135
And the way he's so flippantly throws it in when it is absolutely not no

1063
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,183
Jermaine or necessary

1064
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,719
You could do

1065
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,999
You could make this

1066
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,303
Sort of allegory or this this

1067
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,119
This analogy

1068
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,655
Like exam 1410

1069
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:11,519
Used to be gay in order to get out of being accused of cheating wife

1070
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:15,103
Person that the action that's not a community

1071
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,895
It's not like a bunch

1072
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,199
Dive get together all the time of their likes

1073
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,479
Alright you okay

1074
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,271
You pretend to be gay this week

1075
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,855
It's universalizing something that

1076
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,159
Awful Behavior

1077
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,975
So that's f***** up

1078
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,743
Also

1079
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,279
Also

1080
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
That's just such

1081
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,631
City place to live that points to a worldview

1082
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,167
Where if somebody just

1083
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,959
Aomai

1084
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:45,055
I'm gay and you'd be like your first reaction when you are

1085
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:45,823
Prove it

1086
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,615
That's an awful way to live

1087
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:53,503
It also probably leads you to think things like conversion therapy or probably good

1088
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,527
He's just can't

1089
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
Use these

1090
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,319
Just lying he's

1091
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
He's just being rebellious

1092
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,183
Pretty bad

1093
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:05,023
So it is next clip a little bit lighter

1094
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,351
Alex is complaining about how everybody got mad at him

1095
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,143
Infer speculating about Hillary Clinton

1096
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:14,751
Health right really care too much about that cuz but he says afterwards

1097
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:15,519
Farm

1098
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:20,895
Joe Biden fine

1099
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,687
They're all fine

1100
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,711
Define here

1101
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,343
Major

1102
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,135
Naturally very dangerous

1103
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,719
Daisy Star Wars

1104
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,535
Like Star Wars

1105
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:38,815
What

1106
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,607
Star Wars videos

1107
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,399
He's very funny

1108
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
What

1109
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:54,175
I don't really like Star Wars to talk about it all the f****** time most of my shows start with the Imperial March I do think that the emperor

1110
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:54,943
Funny

1111
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:03,135
There's that one slipped on a banana peel hilarious

1112
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:07,999
By Ivan B A is hilarious to

1113
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,535
You know that

1114
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,887
I mean presided that he professes to not like

1115
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,679
Takes up a lot of his head

1116
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:20,031
Man I am backed up I don't even like to Wrecking

1117
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,311
Racking my brain

1118
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:24,639
For any moment where the emperor did anything that could be

1119
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,663
Conceived of itsfunneh

1120
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,199
I think if you think evil is funny

1121
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
I guess

1122
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,271
Fun for him

1123
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:39,487
That's the only thing that Alex can like about Darth Vader like some parts of Darth Vader are cool I like the

1124
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,791
Coldness of

1125
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
What

1126
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
I don't know

1127
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:48,447
I like most about Star Wars as a villain

1128
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:53,823
He has two of course he does

1129
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,127
God dammit

1130
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,151
How old is

1131
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,991
You would really think that like for him

1132
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,271
Based on his in

1133
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:06,623
Higher career right the rebels would be the people

1134
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391
That he

1135
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,975
Identified with the people who are up against

1136
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,583
The large empire

1137
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,935
These are the scrapie people who have the side of

1138
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:26,079
This force with them you would think that this is a one-to-one parallel to know

1139
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:31,455
You loved the emperor Darth Vader

1140
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
Woodside

1141
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,783
We are and what side he actually is on

1142
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:40,159
White and white hangs out with people like Steve pieczenik one install dictators in Jesus

1143
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,183
Yeah yeah

1144
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,999
He doesn't realize that I don't know how much you realized

1145
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,535
Entirely be just

1146
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,327
I'll just drive that he has

1147
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,655
Towards this but it it does it does feel interesting

1148
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,423
Sing Me A Little Piece

1149
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,727
It's like that we pretending to not like Star Wars

1150
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,543
And maybe I like those characters that are the ones there

1151
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,383
Polar Opposites of what I pretend is my stated worldview

1152
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,175
In my entire career

1153
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:05,759
It's not that weird though it would have been weird 3 years ago we heard

1154
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:10,367
But now it's not that weird that's out

1155
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,415
You want to be

1156
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:16,767
The guy who does a radio show for Darth Vader

1157
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,839
That's your career aspiration

1158
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,119
So

1159
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,167
Unfortunately

1160
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,471
Right now for like Greg proops

1161
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:26,751
Attack of the Clones

1162
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,287
When Alex

1163
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,079
When Alex

1164
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
Had this

1165
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,407
I'm going to go bullhorn

1166
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,711
Strongman

1167
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:40,063
Do you know maybe he's the Joker card that could go either way

1168
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,599
These are things

1169
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,391
That you would not see

1170
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,159
In the past

1171
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,207
You not see this from Alex

1172
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:49,279
When he was gung-ho full-on from supporting

1173
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,559
And this makes

1174
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,351
Slept almost made me gasp

1175
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:57,215
Because this to me is like a sign that things are really not good

1176
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:01,055
They knew 40 years ago when they came out with a cell phones that was giving people break

1177
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,615
Allergist open the power you know Trump

1178
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,663
Probably Trump still love Trump

1179
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:10,015
Look at it

1180
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,831
Bill Gates

1181
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,815
Donald Trump says during my visit yesterday.

1182
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,607
Are those

1183
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
Pro

1184
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,911
Discussion of the new

1185
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:29,215
Billion dollar campus also in Texas

1186
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,495
I asked Tim Cook

1187
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:36,895
See if he could get apple involved in building 5G in the US

1188
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,575
Hilary but boy

1189
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,671
Trump is becoming more and more like the

1190
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,951
Wow

1191
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:55,071
I I think that there is a special place for people he doesn't locking impressions of

1192
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:59,167
And it's not the people he likes if you get into mocking

1193
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
Impression territory I don't think

1194
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,215
There's coming back from

1195
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:05,823
Something that would never have happened on the show

1196
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,615
I cannot be like

1197
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,943
I don't know I feel like he might have done impressions of

1198
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,759
The past but usually it looks strong

1199
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,039
But I don't even think it's

1200
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:15,807
Impression

1201
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,343
Not more like this

1202
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,623
Embodying what do you think

1203
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
His personality

1204
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:24,767
Supposed to be

1205
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:28,863
Vibe to it

1206
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,423
But you don't do a f****** mocking impression

1207
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,191
And if somebody

1208
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:32,959
If like

1209
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,007
You're trying to support

1210
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,031
I know this is

1211
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,079
This to me is like yeah

1212
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:41,407
This is happening this is a slow up

1213
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:45,759
The escalation of the boil or whatever he's trying to bring it back down to room temp

1214
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,551
Yeah the crack in the armor for

1215
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,111
People who adore strongman

1216
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:57,279
Once you can mock them then they are not very strong though are they especially when the way you're mocking them is intending to

1217
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,559
To evoke

1218
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:01,119
Ideas of weakness

1219
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:05,215
The Listener effeminate kind of list

1220
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,751
Tentative

1221
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:10,079
Those signals that he's clearly trying

1222
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,871
And I think that we're just going to

1223
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,895
Proceed

1224
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:19,039
Unless of course drops comes out of nowhere pardons Rodger Stone on Facebook and then

1225
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,623
Yeah

1226
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,975
Until it gets everything that he wants yeah I think we're going to

1227
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:27,999
This trend

1228
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:32,095
We're going to see continued as Alex have disappointing

1229
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,143
This next clip

1230
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
Made me laugh

1231
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,679
So hard

1232
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,983
I guess famously also is in a vape shop

1233
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:41,823
Okay

1234
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:48,479
Famously shop

1235
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:55,647
You in studio today right yeah a little boy who Alex has it as his guest this guy who

1236
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,951
Tickets Twitter handle is vapeshop Patriot

1237
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:04,607
Because he videotaped himself getting yelled at a vape shop around Maga hat

1238
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:07,167
That went viral

1239
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,471
Wow here's a Alex playing a little clip

1240
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:13,055
Geico to The Vape Shop

1241
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,823
I'm getting yelled at

1242
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:22,015
Don't know who bleach why would you bleach some of the words and stuff but not all of

1243
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,831
We're doing that

1244
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,671
It is like a joke online where this happens is happening all the time now

1245
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,791
Whatever

1246
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:39,679
Alex is pissed off about the blueprint

1247
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:46,847
So funny mad at other people's errors out

1248
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,895
I don't think we did this

1249
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,663
Open

1250
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:56,575
Why didn't someone check it I was really hoping to be angry at my staff about

1251
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:00,159
You're running a radio show you can swear on the air like Why didn't

1252
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,463
Somebody look at this before you played it

1253
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
Ridiculous

1254
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:10,399
So the rest of this episode is just a bizarre Roundtable with the guy who's yelled at in vape shop

1255
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,471
Is apparently a cell phone tower installer or something

1256
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,543
Also the health Ranger Mike Adams is there

1257
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,847
And it's supposed 5G expert

1258
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,639
Mark Steele

1259
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:27,807
In this round table all right we're dealing with luminaries in their fields affectively speaking it's all just

1260
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:31,647
Insane paranoid ramblings about 5G almost

1261
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:36,511
Zero interest in trying to chase down the little references Alex makes to Mainline studies

1262
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,303
And you ain't white papers

1263
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,607
Who cares United be specific

1264
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,375
I'm not going to let

1265
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,703
However it should be pointed out that back in February marks

1266
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:49,823
Steel was on Project Camelot talking about the dangers of 5G

1267
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,359
Kerry's experts

1268
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,151
It's expanding

1269
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:58,015
Also it looking into this a little I found a Blog run by another 5G skeptic

1270
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,295
Call Danny logical

1271
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,903
The author is clear that they're worried about 5G so their criticism doesn't come from

1272
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,671
Play sbtrkt

1273
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,439
Label marks

1274
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,999
Still concerns as just outright paranoia

1275
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,815
Apparently though after Mark mates

1276
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,839
Public declaration

1277
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,119
About there being 52

1278
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,423
G transmitters in Lamppost in Gates

1279
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:19,775
Which is actually something that comes up in his conversation with Alex

1280
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,311
One of the main reasons

1281
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,871
But he's considered an expert has he found this

1282
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,663
5G transmission

1283
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,199
Lamppost

1284
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:29,759
Alright I call they're secretly doing it all right you know

1285
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,295
All right after he came out with this

1286
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:36,671
He was apparently contacted by experts associated with the bioelectromagnetic researching

1287
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,207
Another group b

1288
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,743
Concerned about 5G

1289
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,279
They wanted to come in and test

1290
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,303
That's the areas marked

1291
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,071
Plaintiff test

1292
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,119
I stayed but with very high-end technology

1293
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,655
So they could strengthen his finding

1294
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:52,543
We don't need we don't need we don't need that I've already proven it I've already proven it

1295
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,311
We don't need

1296
01:06:54,335 --> 01:07:00,479
Our technology according to this blog Mark got very mad at them and accused them of being quote charlatan

1297
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,759
Bunch of charlatans

1298
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,551
You are the ones who are liar

1299
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:10,719
The group ended up going to gateshead anyway and tested all the locations Mark allegedly tested and said quote we could not find file

1300
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,535
5G signal is coming from Street Lighting in any location

1301
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,303
We survey

1302
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:20,959
I'm not sure how much stock to put into this blog those at the kind of spirals out into conspiracy territory

1303
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,495
Because it puts things in perspective a little

1304
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,823
Even within the community of people who are worried about 5

1305
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:28,639
Mark Steele is not necessarily a trusted voice

1306
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:33,247
Is Alex were actually interested in covering 5G concerns and had any kind of

1307
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:35,295
Decent reputation for being on the level

1308
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,367
He could easily get some kind of actual experts on the show.

1309
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,135
Discuss it

1310
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,927
Instead he has his friend Mike

1311
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,999
A guy who got yelled at in a vape shop in a former Camelot guess

1312
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,023
He's also

1313
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,071
Katra Patriot

1314
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
Got yelled at in a

1315
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,911
Please get this gas selection speaks volume

1316
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,935
I don't

1317
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,471
I don't care at all for this

1318
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,495
Entire hour

1319
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,287
Oh nonsense about 5G

1320
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:02,175
Boiling you we were going to scrape the bottom of the barrel but turns out it had a hole in it so he got a guy from a vape

1321
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:06,783
So come on in your what's your name don't care your Vape Shop guy

1322
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:07,807
Next

1323
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:12,159
So naturally they have a conversation that goes on about this 5G and how it's a

1324
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:14,207
Attack on you it's going to kill everybody

1325
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:20,863
And of course it ends exactly how you would expect it to

1326
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:30,335
God gave us this information

1327
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,711
Dietary supplement can literally help

1328
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:41,343
I'm a toxic effects of 5G

1329
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:47,743
So like yeah of course it's an hour-long thing to make you afraid of all this 5G stuff with a guy who is in a vape

1330
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,767
Vape shop in a

1331
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,375
Possibly Ludacris expert from the UK

1332
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:59,007
Like okay and it'll course it leads to a you know these are real dangerous things but the things I sell to protect

1333
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:05,407
From all of those danger in how the solution was right there in front of

1334
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:10,527
Another f****** armored vehicle to get more PR you only need one arm

1335
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,063
Vehicle we're going to billboard

1336
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,623
This is so stupid

1337
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:19,231
I just tried to show incredibly uninspiring

1338
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
Like I just do

1339
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:28,447
I'm interested in this trend that you see away from Trump in the way that that Dynamic is playing out that's so much of the con

1340
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,215
Haunted the show

1341
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,239
Is either like

1342
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,543
Really really disgusting baiting

1343
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,079
Yeah bout

1344
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:36,127
All his enemies being blood-drinking

1345
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
Child kidnap

1346
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,199
And then just

1347
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,735
Some things that are

1348
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,015
Kind of interesting

1349
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,831
Like maybe the five Jesus was a little in

1350
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
Interesting

1351
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,623
More less

1352
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,927
Talked about a lot of it already

1353
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:52,255
I would just not even cover it at all if it weren't

1354
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,023
4

1355
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,303
Stuff like

1356
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,327
Is

1357
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,863
Fury the most

1358
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,935
Gay people are faking that's interesting

1359
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,983
I think what's fascinating is that

1360
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,031
I think

1361
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,311
In himself

1362
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,335
His thoughts

1363
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,871
Are very interest

1364
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,199
Like it whatever internal struggle he's having right now

1365
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,247
Is a fascinating thing

1366
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:16,319
Because I genuinely can't imagine what

1367
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:17,855
What

1368
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:22,719
Creations both sides of his brain are fighting each other with

1369
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,487
You know what I'm saying

1370
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,303
The side of him that is now anti Trump

1371
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,583
What is creating weird

1372
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,607
Conspiracy theories

1373
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
To make sense of why

1374
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,655
He would be anti

1375
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,447
Well beside this Pro Trump

1376
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,983
Weird conspiracy theories

1377
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,007
That

1378
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,799
And all of this is happening inside of his head

1379
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,103
Coming out on the show is boring bulshit

1380
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,895
Yeah

1381
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,919
Well I think

1382
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:45,759
I think that there is a lot going on in the real world that he doesn't

1383
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,295
Really want to address

1384
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,343
Bears

1385
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:50,879
You know

1386
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,183
Trump isn't coming in to save Rodger

1387
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,719
Trump is getting impeached

1388
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,279
He's got

1389
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,327
That Sandy Hook lawsuit is up

1390
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,351
Coming

1391
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,655
Can't wiggle out of it there's no way around it

1392
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,959
The Democratic debates

1393
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,983
Sure there are

1394
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:10,335
Some things that are real bad but a lot of criticism from the left is coming for those

1395
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,615
Things to in a much more

1396
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,895
Robust

1397
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,943
Real way

1398
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:17,503
There's internal criticism Within

1399
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,807
The Democratic

1400
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,367
Side that is probably

1401
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,391
More scathing

1402
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:26,463
Towards Joe Biden then Alex can even possibly be

1403
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,815
I don't think the right-wing has anything on the the rest of us when it comes to hating Joe Biden

1404
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:31,839
No it

1405
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:36,447
And so I don't think that Alex wants to address any of that stuff

1406
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,495
As he has

1407
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:43,103
Dislike well Trump is going to save us realization settling in because of

1408
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:47,455
Him going to hang out with Tim Cook because he didn't pardon Rodger Stone

1409
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,015
Because Alex is still not on social media

1410
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,807
As that sets in

1411
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,111
He's got to get away but he also

1412
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,647
Can't deal with the reality

1413
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,951
But you can't be like well Trump is getting impeached

1414
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:03,327
Keep trying sell out our foreign policy

1415
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,119
Who's got a

1416
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,655
Spend most of his time

1417
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,935
Doing his like

1418
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:11,263
Tertiary conspiracy find Pete lying about being gay

1419
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,031
Done

1420
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:12,799
Called it

1421
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:13,823
I won

1422
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:18,687
I mean they'll probably probably probably going to happen

1423
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,503
Based on the

1424
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,319
Pieces that we have on the board I wouldn't be too surprised

1425
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,623
Kind of disappointing

1426
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,903
In some ways because I

1427
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,463
A lot of the content ends up being

1428
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,999
Some of this just brought

1429
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:34,047
Conspiracy stuff is

1430
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,095
We've talked about some of the

1431
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,143
Concern to where the narratives Fall Apart

1432
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:41,983
I'm in the past I don't want to spend time to time doing it again

1433
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,287
There's those swords

1434
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,567
There's a conspiracy

1435
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,127
Blood-drinking demon globalist

1436
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,199
I don't want to talk about that cuz it's gross and toxic

1437
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,759
So there's not a ton of here

1438
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
It's worth

1439
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:55,551
Covering

1440
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,575
At the same time

1441
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,599
The real world

1442
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,903
Like if we didn't cover his show

1443
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:06,303
As all this stuff is happening people would think that he has interesting things to say exactly

1444
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,583
You know

1445
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,607
The Listener

1446
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,375
Alex's

1447
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
Boring

1448
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:10,911
He's not

1449
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,935
You doing much

1450
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,495
Everything

1451
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:19,103
F****** but Bolivia Hong Kong bolsonaro murdered a guy

1452
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:23,455
What f****** Netanyahu is getting indicted we've got brexit

1453
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:27,039
Still gonna be election the debate between Corbin and Johnson baby

1454
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:33,695
All of this s*** is going on there's not a ton of that I mean

1455
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,463
Mostly because he

1456
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,279
Yeah that's about real

1457
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,327
Yeah that was not learned

1458
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,095
No

1459
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:43,423
See I don't know I don't know what to tell you this real steaks

1460
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,447
And

1461
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:48,799
I'm excited though because I think I've done my due diligence

1462
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,079
In terms of like

1463
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
Taking

1464
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,127
Like this last stretch

1465
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,407
Text really focus on

1466
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,223
How Alex gets through the present day with

1467
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,015
You know the Rogers situation

1468
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,551
I went out with him

1469
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,575
Coming to Austin

1470
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:07,231
I think we're just going to see you gradual slide away he has let us down he's the Joker card that has gone the wrong

1471
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:10,815
Wrong way but we must still rise to the occasion it's like a globalist

1472
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,607
I think that's probably the direction

1473
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,167
You're heading and I'm going back to the past

1474
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,495
Monday

1475
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,263
That little

1476
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,031
Stretch we had

1477
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,055
Add where it was

1478
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,847
Was that that slide

1479
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,175
Because a lot of episode

1480
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,199
I don't

1481
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:32,831
No I mean nothing not that like but the entire thing but like when when it

1482
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:39,231
Yeah you know that day where it went from being this gentle well as I recalled the first thing

1483
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:43,071
Trump is the real deal or I have been fooled

1484
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,095
Exactly

1485
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,215
I don't know

1486
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:53,823
So we'll see what happens but we'll be back on Monday like I said with the past

1487
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,103
Thank God

1488
01:14:55,871 --> 01:15:00,735
Episodes of shorter like an hour and 10 or so because

1489
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:04,319
There's not much going on then

1490
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,855
I don't know I feel like

1491
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:08,415
I would love to talk more about stuff but there's just

1492
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,439
Another

1493
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,279
You know a lot of shows are only an hour all the

1494
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,327
Like through an hour once

1495
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:19,935
Yeah I don't want to I don't want I know you feel like you're letting down everybody

1496
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,471
Because we only put out

1497
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,751
5 hours

1498
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:25,311
