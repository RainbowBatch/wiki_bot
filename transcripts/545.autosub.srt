It's not okay

9
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,040
There was a lot of fun to see the response of people having a lot of crossover

10
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,880
Between audiences

11
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,696

00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,144

Typos are in an otherwise there's something that I think is really interesting

00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,495
Bears talking about but it also

75
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
Alex's position on it almost doesn't matter

76
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847

00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
As is tradition

78
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
Underselling what whereabouts.

I have some weed I don't recall that I know that I have bought weed from a lot of people over the course of my life

100
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,855
And I do know there was one person that I knew

101
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
I think it's this

102
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,511
But there was one person that I knew who shall go nameless

103
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:02,399
Who sell me weed for a while and then later I found out that he was also selling

104
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Oh

105
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215

00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,927
You're like some people who were like I just only go to this one store for my like I'm a Kohl's person

I think you have a bond that's for

114
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,215
Kohl's gets arrested less

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
And this is right in that line

126
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
Sometimes you got to hit him you upside the head with

127
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Willow

128
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
That doesn't sound true you have two left with no training would like more context on the situation

129
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:37,887

Talking about how sometimes if there's like a cow

132
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
It's being eaten by fire ants and it's

133
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:50,175
Pregnant and you got to get it to safety you got into it with stuff in order

134
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,575
I was going to go with pure zombie situation but I will accept that if there is a cow beanie

135
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,903
Away from the fire ants and got hit with a board

136
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,047

Eastman's probably to Seckman

139
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
That's talking about that that seems right

140
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,751
It's outrageous

141
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
And I have no Focus

142
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
Here we start on the 30th

143
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,407

144
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
I turned this episode off

145
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
It got very boring

146
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Wow

147
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,415
It is official mainstream

148
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,743
That the coven lockdowns are designed

149
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,303
To make us living

00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
They both said it years ago they had a plan

A few months ago they said how great the lockdowns are have them permanently

Oh wow

163
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,655
How could this not have turned out to be a banger of an episode

164
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:24,383
Without even looking I saw these things that didn't happen however

165
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,943
Speak to one of the things about our show that I enjoy

166
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
That

167
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
It is that you yourself

168
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Something like that

169
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
And most of your life

170
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
No it didn't

171
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,671
I just felt like

172
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
No

173
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
I mean you did not say

174
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,559
They want you to be prisoners in your home

175
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,655
I'm fine we been over the territory so many times but

176
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
This is just one of her to be like to know

177
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239

00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
And you have broken me

180
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,759
I don't feel broken I just don't care I'm going to choose my battles and this is what I'm just going to be like

181
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,695
Tell me what you're talkin about and then me and then woke up probably not

182
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
Because I know the only citation that he ends up giving in the first like

183
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:18,143
40 minutes of the show is a f****** editorial that doesn't say what he says it's there's a problem so I don't care

184
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,215
Anyway this is where we get really misogynist

185
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,055
You heard him bring up Stockholm syndrome there

186
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
Speaking is when we get really massaging

187
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
They were just going

188
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
4

189
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
Stockholm Syndrome

190
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,391
At least 30% of the public mainly women

191
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,975
Will go under Stockholm syndrome because it's no Authority Aryan

192
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
I can't believe it's actually happening

193
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,423
They are going to submit to the Tarrant nothing against women and every psychological study

194
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,871
Most women within minutes would start fighting for the enemy

195
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
As soon as it

196
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Was clear

197
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
They would write out their husbands right out their children help

198
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Secure dumb

199
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
I thought it was for the good of the community

200
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,511
Interested

201
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
That's why who was the house slave

202
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
Rome

203
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,959
Who were the Housewives

204
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
He brought women in the house

205
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
Get the men out in the field

206
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
And that's the system

207
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Wow

208
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,943
That's something else man I don't even know where

209
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
That begins

210
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,063
Yeah it's a lot of thoughts and a lot of them are dumb

211
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Alright so

212
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,391
Then it okay okay

213
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,719
Okay we haven't historical record

214
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
Up so many cities that were conquered

215
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
Have psychological studies from Rome

216
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:02,079
A lot of armies will show up immediately starts

217
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
Women

218
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:11,039
I'm confused as to whether or not he knows the severe number of underground

219
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:15,903
Play I don't know resistance movements that were starting to sound

220
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
I was like a locomotive maybe they went underground

221
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
The clear up Stockholm syndrome is Alex understand that isn't real

222
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
It's something that's

223
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,031
Depicted in traumatic movies a lot but in terms of real-life instances of someone exhibiting signs of Stockholm Syndrome

224
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
Evenly rare to find a real cat

225
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
Yeah what it really is is

226
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,967
The cops are bad and reasonable people are like oh yeah you guys are bad

227
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
NM

228
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
I mean

229
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,087
You can even find some similarities to the behavior with Adam St

230
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Physically violent

231
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,439
Situations you are Legos parallels

232
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
That's not what the

233
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Fiction of Stockholm

234
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Send Revenge

235
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Hit movies perhaps

236
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
Invading groups don't kill women when they killed all the men in a particular town but that's not how things have gone

237
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,127
All the women

238
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
Sometimes a lot of the time

239
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,991
An exception generally is when he's invading groups would take the women

240
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,039
Property after conquering

241
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,343
Particular group and it wasn't because these women just

242
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:23,743
Decided it'd be a good idea idea to join the other team

243
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
Let's go

244
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,351
Concubine me baby

245
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:34,495
Also it may be the case that most depictions of persons enslaved inside households in the media are often women

246
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,567
But that's also historically not something that was Universal

247
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
Princeton's William Wells Brown and Lewis

248
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:45,503
Clark are both examples of enslaved persons in the American South were men whose duties were in the house

249
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
Both of whom wrote

250
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
About their

251
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
It's that Alex could learn from

252
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
If you'd like

253
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,671
Alex is understanding of history is based almost

254
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,511
Entirely on movies and vague feelings he's gotten about history from media

255
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,583
Literally nothing he's saying is based on reality at all

256
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,887
Feels like if you just kind of assumed

257
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
Fiction reality of the same

258
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,239
That's all that's going on here man it is

259
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Grimm

260
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
His vision of what

261
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
That's that's

262
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
Shamefully chauvinistic view of

263
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,759
Yeah you know ND

264
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
It's not like

265
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Movies aren't

266
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Entertaining

267
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
Take the fact that most movies have been writ

268
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,743
Written by white men over the years is probably ruined a bit of our good historical interpret

269
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,815
I think that might have something to do with his

270
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
Ridiculous belief

271
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:37,215
Could be I could be by now but

272
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Nevermind

273
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,543
Alex has this deep historical knowledge

274
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,335
And I shouldn't be

275
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
Poopoo in him so much

276
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
Because like I mean he's got a stack of papers

277
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,503
Club just unbelievable covid-19

278
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
Just look at this

279
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
Look at this

280
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,671
The real Esther you just searched anything I'm saying.

281
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
What are the sap

282
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
Your normal

283
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,559
Were you really that great in the first place

284
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
By Sophie Rosenbaum

285
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,167
This reads like the darkest satire

286
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Written

287
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,007
This is nonsense

288
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
But here is Alex

289
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
Talking about the editorial a little bit

290
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
What are the normal

291
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
Were you really that great in the first

292
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
By Sophie Rosenbaum

293
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,063
This reads like the darkest satire

294
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Everett

295
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
But it's real

296
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,511
Pages of evil

297
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
I'm going to read the damn thing on air

298
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Bottom of the hour

299
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,679
That it says we're going to lock you in your house

300
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
When we said you can

301
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
And it's not about the

302
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
Covid

303
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
About the Earth

304
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,223
Thanks this is an article by this writer

305
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,551
How much is getting mad at an editorial and pretending it somehow is

306
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,951
The globalist admitting that they don't want anything to go back to normal and it's all about climate covid not even real

307
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
Not addressed to Alex

308
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,303
Normal normal

309
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Things to do with this if you read this

310
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:12,191
Set at Oriel it's not dark satire it's not advocating that we stay in lockdown forever

311
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
Hey to this writer expressing that the world goes back to what we're looking at is normal we run the risk of not living as ambitious Lee

312
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
We can

313
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:26,271
A better world is possible in the for things to go back to some idea of normal biking in the way of achieving things

314
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Things that

315
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Or good

316
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
From the article

317
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,415
Without normal the path forward is more open

318
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
The opportunities perhaps broader

319
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
What if there's a whole lot of amazing

320
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
Thing that stands to be lost if normal return

321
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,631
What is instead of banking on normalcy we focus

322
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,959
On that one-of-a-kind ability to adapt and evolve

323
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,519
Maybe that's the way forward instead of Simply Red

324
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
Reconciling with what wasn't trying to recreate something

325
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
That's already had it

326
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
It's day

327
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
Is an interesting

328
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,223
Position that this author brings up

329
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
It's not a unique

330
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Prospective intern

331
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:04,671
That I've read certainly is lying about

332
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Yeah I know but it's just

333
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Johnson

334
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
And it like if he's read it this is embarrassing

335
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
Yeah I bring him to be like work

336
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
Stuff about it absolutely not

337
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
Yeah

338
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
City read it on there

339
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,287
I don't know. Probably maybe after I turned it off I told they turned off his episodes

340
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
Turned out this episode was

341
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Dislike

342
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
That massage neither

343
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
The beginning was

344
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
Pretty wild

345
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
That's astonishing

346
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Because it's not a direct

347
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
Attack

348
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,719
You know you're so we're so used to misogyny being directed at women

349
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
The present

350
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
But two

351
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
Create a weird

352
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
Fictional like

353
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,423
Adam and Eve story out of all women throughout her

354
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
History

355
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
Concord psychological studies

356
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,359
I feel like this is not true

357
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
This is just not true

358
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:02,527
Cyclic how would you even think that's like like there a psychologist it's in there on the ground like

359
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
Before we hit

360
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
Studied it properly

361
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,255
I don't know but it was kind of

362
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,839
Interesting in a

363
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Today

364
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,679
Kind of got interested in like I was just going to continue

365
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
Aggressively long

366
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
Attracted boring

367
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,359
Stretch of immigrant bashing

368
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,431
In such a way that really really is like

369
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
Unacceptable

370
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,039
I'll play a little clip and then

371
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
Discuss why I needed

372
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
And then we saw Daily Caller reports

373
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
Hundreds of illegal

374
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,767
With their children and others and unaccompanied children

375
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
The airport

376
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
South Texas

377
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,655
Loading on the plane with

378
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
No i.d.

379
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
Loading onto planes

380
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,871
Bags of cash and envelopes of cash

381
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
Disappear

382
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
In the god-knows-what

383
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,295
Federal and state law

384
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,975
Lawlessness

385
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,047
It goes on and on and on

386
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
The beating up and saying like this

387
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
Horrendous thing

388
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,703
About anybody who may be an immigrant

389
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,775
Defective this isn't

390
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
Something that is

391
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
Is positive

392
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
It's not something that even interesting

393
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
This is just a

394
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Incitement

395
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Yeah like

396
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
When he's talking about these

397
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
People who are

398
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
Alleged

399
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Tubi

400
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,879
Undocumented folks were being given bags of money and then

401
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
The disappear

402
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
Interview that's only

403
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,975
We going to make the audience

404
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:52,351
Suspicious of everybody that they see that they might deem to be possibly an immigrant who might

405
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:58,751
Have a bag of cash and just disappeared in the middle of America did you responsible as hell

406
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,055
Just be like okay cool you're not see now stopped

407
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Taking forever

408
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
It's because that's what he's he's doing

409
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
That he's not saying

410
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
It's

411
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
And it's not something

412
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
They can really be

413
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,807
Distinctly discussed outside of review

414
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,623
Yeah it's not something that I have much to bring to

415
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
To the table

416
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
Other than

417
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
F*** this

418
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
Amazon accept

419
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,536
Edible we've talked a ton about like specific narratives and things

420
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
Betty deploys again

421
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Population

422
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
And what has you

423
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,704
This was just like

424
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,752
It just should be turned off

425
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
Yeah it's not

426
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
It's not even

427
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
Like I don't know how else

428
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,640
We should have a

429
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
Drop that's just a

430
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Big like

431
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
And then it says

432
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
Protocols of the elders

433
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,320
And then we just move on by

434
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Kaboom

435
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,440
There was one more thing in this is this is like

436
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
Like I was in that place

437
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,536
I think I still needed something else to kick me over the

438
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
I turn this off

439
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
And this is where I turned

440
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,448
They're waving background check

441
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,264
Foster home

442
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Where they're sent

443
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,616
Coming in no i.d. not with their parents

444
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
Years old

445
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
Buses in airplane

446
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
To be seen again

447
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,768
Not shut down

448
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,960
Open you got massive death massive numbers of dead women and children found by the thousands on the border

449
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Look it up

450
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,008
And it's just

451
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
That's not going to be a news item

452
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
Not going to be a story

453
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,272
Accompany minors

454
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
So Alex is talking about

455
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,392
People at emergency intake centers

456
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,696
Yeah then the FBI waived

457
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
Partial part of the background check

458
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,536
They need to be done for people working

459
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,888
He's lying about this story but what he brings up is still an actual issue

460
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,960
And that's where also I feel really

461
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Like I hate him

462
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:12,640
Cuz this is a real issue agree with him but I'm also not going to disagree

463
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
Fully but he is still lying

464
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,968
Right right right

465
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,528
It's true that the FBI's wave fingerprint-based

466
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Background check

467
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,904
People who are being employed to work at emergency intake sites run by the Department of Health and Human Service

468
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,696
That is not a good thing

469
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
And I don't support that

470
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
But it is not with Alex

471
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,328
This doesn't apply to people who are taking

472
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
Can people into foster

473
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,168
It's just for people who work at those sites who are quote

474
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,984
Supervised by federal employees are others who have passed

475
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
Fingerprint-based background

476
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Again

477
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,640
Not what I would say is a great idea but it's not what I want to say

478
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:49,760
Also Alex is claiming that they waived all background checks are these individuals which is not true

479
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,064
They still have to pass public records background check

480
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
But they're not using finger

481
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
The reason to do this at the

482
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,696
Expedite process which makes some sense but again

483
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,256
I probably prefer that they are on the side of caution

484
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,376
I was really curious about the story so I dug around a little more and I found this story in the Associated Press

485
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,704
U.s. waved FBI checks on staff at growing

486
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
19 migrant

487
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,056
That story was from November 2018 under

488
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Trump

489
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,200
Beyond the background checks waiver Trump also reduce need access to mental health professionals or people at the camp

490
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
Which was a mess

491
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,504
Even worse

492
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,392
In December 2018 the AP reported on news from an emergency Detention Center in Florida called Homestead

493
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
The staff

494
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Being screened for

495
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,720
For child abuse and neglect

496
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
The miami-based emerge

497
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
The Township's

498
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840
Alex wasn't mad about any of these things because Trump

499
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,912
Administration was doing it and there's no ability to score points

500
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,496
He doesn't care about the well-being of immigrants and when it's a Democrat president

501
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,568
In charge he just uses the mismanagement of emigration as a

502
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Propped

503
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
Enemies

504
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,152
10 prompt as one mistreating

505
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,688
These people Alex isn't okay with it

506
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
You support

507
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,760
And and I I don't want

508
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
2

509
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Bring these cases really simple

510
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
Census APA

511
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
Of trump

512
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
And his administration

513
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,672
You can do this as a what about

514
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,488
I absolutely don't want to do that

515
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,840
The score points on Allen there's no point in stopping my frustration with

516
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
Like this is a problem and it's

517
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
Bright

518
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,728
It's not something that is okay now because

519
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,544
Biden's and truck we need better Solutions

520
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Still monster

521
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,384
Yes and the FBI background-check thing

522
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
The aspect of it

523
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
I understand the explanation

524
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,040
It's being given I'm not sure that explanation is except

525
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
Right

526
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
I don't know

527
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,112
But I would be

528
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
I've have that

529
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
Exact same response

530
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208
In Trump's instant and now

531
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Yeah and it's

532
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
Just defensive

533
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,840
Does he Alex spend half-an-hour demonizing immigrants

534
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
In such a way

535
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,192
To potentially put people in danger

536
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
And then to use

537
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,752
Them

538
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,312
Mismanagement of immigration

539
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,640
Intake centers like this

540
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,688
Well a prop for him to use

541
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
Do attack

542
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,784
Democrats absolutely don't care what

543
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,808
Face or what

544
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
Party affiliation you have

545
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,928
If I am anywhere near those people I was screaming they will bark

546
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,464
This is the best you

547
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
F*****'-a

548
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
This is what your

549
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Going to do

550
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,120
And so you know I just got kind of

551
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Set up and I turned it off

552
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:22,336
As I I thought like there's probably more interesting stuff to talk about we've heard him talk about this kind of

553
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
A lot

554
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
That's very

555
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,456
Kind of worn out territory for Alex elderly

556
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
So there is some news

557
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
Thankfully Alex

558
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,320
The big Bombshells on 31st

559
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,464
Working on the weekend like usual down in the deep end like usual

560
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,304
While we're in the center of the Zeitgeist I barely

561
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
The slit in my chair here

562
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
Explosive

563
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
And so important

564
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Big bombshell

565
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Exclusive

566
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
Bombshell

567
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,176
So exclusive so I assume

568
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,480
It when he says so exclusive

569
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,272
I put this story at

570
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
Between 1 and 6 years old

571
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
No it's current

572
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
Okay

573
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,256
I can tell you I've talked to the highest levels of the media food chain about

574
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
Photographer

575
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,328
Situation of also talked

576
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,376
Just good personal longtime friend and confidant

577
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
Rodger Stone

578
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
Iowa

579
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
Course he did it

580
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
What's going on with the whole

581
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Take over

582
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,408
Coming up

583
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Second

584
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
Today

585
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
And yet he still getting all the

586
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
Hotels together

587
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,344
This is weird

588
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah Rodger Stone coming on to talk about a sex-trafficking incident he's definitely never engaged

589
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:50,400
Is it in his life before it broke this weekend that the justice department began investigating representative Matt gaetz

590
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,704
Ability that he engaged in a sexual relationship

591
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,008
The seventeen-year-old girl and possibly get paid

592
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,312
Travel are paid to travel

593
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
With her which would possibly cons

594
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
Institutes extra

595
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:07,296
Gates claims that this is part of an elaborate plan to extort him and as far as I'm concerned I hate Matt gaetz a real piece of political

596
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
Pickled s***

597
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
See more about this investigation before I can

598
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Come to any conclusions on the matter

599
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,232
The claimed actions are too severe and I don't want to do a disservice to the Elijah

600
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Crime by using an accusation

601
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
To score points

602
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
Gets politician I don't like total

603
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,656
According to the New York Times this investigation began under the Trump

604
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,216
From the left

605
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Haiti state

606
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:32,640
It said that this has to do with a Florida politician who had been an ally of Gates's named Joel Greenberg was he former

607
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
Tax collector of Seminole County

608
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,736
These guys currently facing charges quote

609
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,320
Including sex trafficking of a child and financially supporting people Linux

610
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,904
Intersexed at least one of whom was an underage girl

611
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,512
We will see what happens with this is more information comes out but even if he's telling the truth

612
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,536
This is all part of it

613
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,096
Extortion plot against him back gate is still a pile of garbage

614
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,144
Also like if it is

615
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,216
An elaborate plan I really hope that whoever is

616
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
Doing this

617
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
Extortion against him is

618
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,128
Are you with the things that I don't want is neither of these things

619
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
Things to

620
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:10,784
Get prosecuted with whatever crime is handled here

621
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
Urban crime is

622
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,112
The problem something is up and

623
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,928
I don't need an X

624
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,768
Extra layer of crime to hate the s*** out of Matt gaetz

625
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
If he's guilty of a crime

626
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,608
Then I hope he's prosecuted and taken care of

627
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,912
But I'm going to hate him either way.

628
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
I will see

629
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:33,824
Also Rodger might not be the best source of information for Alex on this one since he's been photographed at Mar-A-Lago with gate

630
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,176
And Joel Greenberg

631
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:43,808
According to the times websites run by Rogers Associates had published articles favorable about Greenberg

632
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,880
Tax collector shocking Sue's a mess

633
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
Shocking

634
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,952
But we'll see

635
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,280
We lost Rush Limbaugh not too long ago

636
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,376
We had another tragedy befall the right-wing

637
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
How much he died

638
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
A great guy

639
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,264
Great Patriot great talk show host Great America

640
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,336
Really

641
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,896
The remedy, to Global us we got that

642
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
Yikes

643
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,808
Doesn't eulogizing much got this message and lettie's Dad we shan't be I was more like him

644
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
Big Bear

645
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Although I think

646
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,720
Maybe our problem is the FBI is a lot like

647
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,352
Alex has his big narratives on the steps

648
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,424
Is that a lot of the prosecution's again

649
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
People who broke into

650
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
The capital of Storm 2 everywhere

651
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,712
Years ago though the right-wing is moved on from that we're talking about culture wars stuff Dan we don't need to worry about that cuz that

652
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,296
Years ago around and mop it up a little bit

653
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:52,160
Executions are falling apart and there's a Politico article that Alex can't seem to find

654
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
That goes over the

655
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
I mean we are witnessing

656
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,328
Historic times

657
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,168
Article about the case falling apart

658
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
Infed shocked

659
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,984
They're going to have to drop all the cases

660
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,568
But I asked you what the Politico article is linked to that I forgot to

661
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
Tell you about that

662
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
Child

663
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
Give me that Politico article that

664
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
They're going to have to knock

665
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,224
Gel X

666
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
These people in the left totally pan

667
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
If I can't

668
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
Find that down by stacking

669
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
I just had it

670
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112
People aren't

671
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
Panicking

672
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,744
This political article does talk about how it might be a bad look for you know Biden's age

673
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
Ministration to end up

674
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
Having to not process

675
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,120
Secutor give plebeyos to a lot of the people who

676
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,704
Work the Insiders they weren't the people who were

677
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
You know actually planning violence

678
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
So weird

679
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
I understand that

680
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
And I I think that

681
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,408
You know in terms of reality that kind of makes sense

682
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,480
Somebody who isn't in favor of

683
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,016
Incarceration

684
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,088
I do understand that and I kind of don't

685
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
It would be

686
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
In

687
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,184
Societies greater interest

688
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,232
To lock up everybody

689
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
Who went into the capital

690
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,096
In the same way that I think that you know drug offenders would be really

691
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
I think

692
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
I think that there should be

693
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
Less people in

694
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,032
Yeah I mean I do ultimate Lee

695
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
Functionally it's like

696
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
Would you're going after the

697
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
F****** mafia-like

698
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
Cool you

699
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,272
Arrested a bunch of f****** low-level

700
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,832
Meatheads you are going around looking

701
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
For protection money doesn't

702
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Matter

703
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,232
It doesn't do anything you were not doing anything to the people who f****** orcas

704
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
Castrated it and inside

705
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,608
Well I don't give a s*** about these people at all

706
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,400
People who you know

707
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,680
Might have just been a long

708
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,704
Bedwetting

709
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,824
I completely understand if I could get him probation or time served or something

710
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,432
If you've been held without bail

711
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
Think that

712
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,272
Maybe it'll be unsatisfying to some like

713
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Folks

714
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,624
We were trying to maybe run for office

715
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
On retribution

716
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,208
Shore shore shore shore

717
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:02,976
Put

718
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
That doesn't

719
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,792
I mean the people who are like

720
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
The people who plan

721
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,912
Did the Southlake

722
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,704
They're not going to get lice

723
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,752
So you planned it

724
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,568
That's the part that said coordinating in like

725
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,896
Stewart Roads as friends

726
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,480
Deep s*** that's what I'm saying is I just don't care about

727
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,552
Because all to all too many of those people are really

728
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,600
Borderline just infected with this

729
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
Is terrifying brain virus

730
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:35,232
That is destroyed them through right-wing propaganda since they were

731
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,768
F****** 6 years old

732
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,584
Alex is trying to pretend that

733
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,376
This is everybody

734
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,912
Even all the Oath Keepers

735
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,936
Since I've had like

736
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,496
Communication

737
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,616
Political articles about everybody

738
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,688
It's mostly about people who are just like

739
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,224
They just walked in

740
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,040
Dance it's trespassing but what are you going to give them

741
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:05,440
Six months in prison for that Saturday that I think that's a sensible conversation to have in terms of like

742
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,232
What it what gives us the best outcome

743
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
Compass Boise

744
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,328
Well I mean is this Society does

745
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
Giving somebody who

746
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
Epi-no passively

747
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
Police stormed the capitol 6

748
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,240
Xbox do anything for the problem

749
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,544
Probably not could make things worse

750
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,896
Yeah it doesn't like to act as a deterrent and now I wish that we would

751
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
Treat all

752
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,968
With the same kind of

753
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
The problem is not

754
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,392
The treatment

755
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,416
Equal treatment

756
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
Beyond

757
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
All recognized

758
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,840
Rockets blew up

759
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,192
Hey man don't feel don't care about Elon Musk

760
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,752
But you can't call him a loser cuz he's trying he is a loser

761
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,384
Comments about Elon Musk a little personally

762
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,712
Another SpaceX spaceship prototype explodes during

763
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,992
High altitude flight test

764
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
An immediate falling into loser

765
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
As usual

766
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,136
Are the people that point

767
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
Your fingers

768
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,720
A people that are Dewar's and said that we're the losers now

769
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,000
You are

770
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,328
Sandwiches lump in himself in

771
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
With

772
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Elon Musk

773
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,400
Can saying the people who criticized

774
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:24,032
The doers like me and Elon Musk are the losers

775
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,568
Myself in the same scent

776
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,896
Sentences somebody whose wealth is based entirely upon apartheid.

777
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,712
That's what I want to do people talk about how

778
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,528
Me and Elon Musk are losers just

779
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
Because we

780
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,600
Floydada population to make

781
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,136
I'll be told amounts of wealth

782
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:43,744
I'm in the moment it looks like it was going to go bad for us we ran away to the United States face

783
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,632
No punishment for our crimes whatsoever. Even more wealthy based off of stock manipulate

784
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,192
But no f****** reason I need to be fair like

785
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:58,848
Like I want you to hang out with Bob Chapman and made all his money on like apartheid told

786
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,176
Lived in Rhodesia

787
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:08,064
Defending Matt gaetz now

788
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
The only way that I would

789
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
Never do these things

790
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Is like

791
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:17,280
Revealing he himself committed across other people that he's built up his Villa

792
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,144
If I Congressman Matt

793
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,728
Son of a big successful billionaire

794
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,104
Wasn't well-spoken wasn't from Constitution didn't have courage wasn't a fighter

795
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
I would

796
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,688
Not give a damn about him

797
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
Yvonne told she'll I throw it away

798
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,880
Prison

799
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,952
Buddy

800
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,024
Show on

801
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,264
Yeah so just like

802
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
His pass

803
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
Yeah

804
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,384
It's weird cuz I don't know what that has to do with

805
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
You do know

806
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
No

807
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,784
It seems like that's the strategy is just

808
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
Distract

809
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,856
Read the red sheet over here

810
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
Bob Dole

811
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,696
The bowl that is the audience's attention charge over there

812
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
Despite the fact that

813
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
Of his descriptions

814
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Of

815
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,328
People who

816
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
Would drink

817
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
Adrenochrome

818
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
The only difference so far into

819
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
Description between Gates

820
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
And everybody else is

821
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,008
Dinar

822
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
Next to his name

823
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,896
Hit the son of a billionaire he's in the government he's

824
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,688
But it's also like either weird

825
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,760
Republican Republican

826
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,832
He is weird

827
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
A******

828
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,440
So Alex lies a little bit about the allegation

829
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
It's one thing for Alex

830
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,816
To take insult again

831
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
Elon Musk

832
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
Back right

833
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
Alex seems to

834
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:05,312
To be taking this a little personal at sounds right to

835
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,336
Years ago

836
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,872
17

837
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,176
Enough

838
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,528
Especially when the Democratic Party

839
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,832
And especially I'll reveal for the first time here

840
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,368
Bipoc

841
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,048
Check messages

842
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
That 5 acres in a row

843
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,800
So it's on record that you tried to set me up

844
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
You tried to

845
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,920
Put on people they got the media will give people money to say anything

846
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,224
They paid people $20,000 to say

847
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,784
I walked around the office and grab the Goldfish out of the

848
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
Fish tank

849
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,928
This is a reference to Josh Owens article from 2019 in the New York Times

850
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,000
In the article Josh doesn't allege that Alex ate a goldfish

851
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,072
Version of the claim that Alex uses a strop

852
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,352
Atlanta. Talk about the actual

853
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
Complained

854
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,448
Quote Once A co-worker stop by the office

855
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,496
With a pet fish he was taking home to his niece

856
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
It's raining circles in a small transparent bag

857
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,872
Balanced upright on a desk

858
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,176
In the conference room he emptied into a garbage

859
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
I don't know if Josh is

860
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
To claim is accurate or not but it's very

861
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,552
Clear that Alex is making this claim.

862
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,112
The Josh was paid $20,000 by the New York Times

863
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,392
Have to say this about Alec

864
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,696
The reason Alex is using this Pacifica

865
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:29,280
Eating a goldfish is so he's less likely to get in trouble if Josh Gordon

866
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,352
Set the time Spade him to say what he did

867
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,008
I was condemned pretend you was talking about a different claim made about it but it's very clear this narrative is the one that he's built in response

868
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
To Josh's article

869
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,592
If I were Josh Owens I would probably threatened

870
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
Sue Alex for

871
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,688
Yeah I don't know

872
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,992
I don't know if Josh Owens is a public figure

873
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:53,088
I don't know what Alex has no ability to

874
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
To demonstrate

875
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
The Josh got paid to lie about him

876
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,696
To say anything about him

877
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
This seems like slang

878
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Quite frankly

879
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
And I think it's

880
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,328
Clearly malicious in a tent

881
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,096
Totally

882
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
Absolutely

883
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,936
This person said something I don't like

884
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:13,824
And so I will say that they were paid to say it how are you sounds malicious

885
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
Content

886
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
There's no middle ground

887
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,432
Started

888
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,456
Sure

889
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,992
Sure

890
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,040
Sure

891
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,832
Sure sure

892
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Sure

893
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
Sure

894
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:33,536
He's he's defending Matt gaetz a little bit like he's about to say what's next are we going to investigate everybody who's did exact

895
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,304
Hollywood

896
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,680
Not that I got but I didn't do it

897
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
It's

898
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,264
It's interesting the way that Alex decides to do this

899
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
Defense 2

900
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,592
Cuz his defense seems to be like

901
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,664
Hey man cave Flixster party that's what I was thinking it would be

902
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,736
But I made some calls and

903
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,832
He doesn't even know

904
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,648
If he from all parties he was that over the years

905
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,280
And I have the same damn thing

906
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,960
Thousand dollars or I'mma say what you did to me I'm like

907
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,872
But I'm telling you man this is what happens when you're successful in your famous

908
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
And it's crap

909
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
I'm going to try to get

910
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,576
Leah Pyar restaurant cuz it's not fruit ladies and gentlemen

911
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,856
Suppose we talk about Mikey

912
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:34,976
Why you keep talking about yourself an ocelot

913
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,792
Also do not sell me on you being a

914
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:43,424
Tough guy ever again on speed dial

915
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,824
Also I'm a revolutionary is fighting against the American government I think it's an interesting

916
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:56,223
Looks to be like Matt gaetz go to wild parties and he doesn't remember

917
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:01,343
Come on you go to the party

918
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,159
You saying it's really strange

919
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,231
I just I think on the one hand

920
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
It's a strange defense

921
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,559
Something that

922
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,095
I don't know of anybody

923
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:18,239
You know it what the reality is about at this point

924
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,567
But that is Eyes Wide Shut masked and then you don't know who's that

925
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,871
It's weird but I think the reason that I'm most

926
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,895
Interested in it is it

927
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,175
Just keeps coming back to

928
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Alex

929
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,991
He keeps bringing himself back up

930
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,527
I have like there's a prop

931
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,599
Foxy that he feels almost

932
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,623
Lingering guilt

933
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,391
Somewhere

934
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,927
I don't know about that

935
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
Just weird

936
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
It's just weird

937
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,559
Alex

938
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
To give Gates summer

939
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Advice

940
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
There is

941
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,935
So much more

942
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,959
That we're going to be

943
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,495
Disgusting

944
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,287
We're going to use this to make it about

945
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
The clintons

946
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,383
About Bill Gates

947
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,455
And the minute man talks about Bill Gates

948
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
And the minute he talks about Epstein

949
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,063
They're going to drop this

950
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
Like aha

951
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
Renee

952
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:07,903
I don't know

953
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
I don't know if that's

954
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
True

955
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,743
I do think

956
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,815
Later on Alex lays out like what he saying is like

957
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:21,215
Talk about how fun

958
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,031
Yeah

959
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,055
Like Bill Gates run

960
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,847
When's the media you control off

961
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,127
Sure

962
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:31,199
Starts talking about Bill Gates he'll call off the dogs

963
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
Bulbulay

964
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
What

965
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,295
I am I am really excited

966
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,623
To see just how fast and how brutal the right-wing

967
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
Machine will destroy Gates

968
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
The moment

969
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,719
He threatens the grift like

970
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:46,047
The whenever he was talking to Tucker on that interview and he's like

971
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:50,143
You know you know how you've done this to its like

972
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,983
Oh oh man you're going to be destroyed

973
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,799
If you think that you're going to get loyalty Gates

974
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:01,919
You are making the same mistake a lot of you idiots made to end up burning

975
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,479
Like the bridge with Tucker and you'll be left

976
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,783
Hang out with Rodger and Alex

977
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,367
Oh yeah it's going to be brutal and it's going to be fast

978
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Kind of

979
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,463
Convenia to headline the other day

980
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,743
He was like before all this

981
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,791
Came out that he was planning on possibly

982
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
Retiring from conch

983
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,423
Nothing interesting is going to happen

984
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,751
In between that article and when he moves

985
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,567
Newsmax

986
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,639
I'm so in the next clip we get Alex

987
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,943
Bestowing the mantle of

988
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,223
The future

989
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,503
Of the GOP on somebody

990
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
NTB

991
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,063
Hard-pressed

992
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,695
Surprised to find out that it is not Matt gaetz catherall The Fifth Avenue L

993
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
Curious

994
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
Marjorie Taylor Greene

995
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,351
The future Republican party voted 75% of the vote

996
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
Taco Bell

997
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,471
Hillary's religion and B

998
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
Religion

999
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,519
The mark of the beast

1000
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
Kind of do agree with Alex

1001
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
XO that she is the future of the GOP

1002
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:14,111
Screeching into the atmosphere upon her Babel Tower as the rest of the world Burns or

1003
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,415
Around us to be like a

1004
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
A good thing

1005
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,999
Where is I would say

1006
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:26,655
It's a cautionary statement to say the cheese the future of the GOP I would argue that's that's probably

1007
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:31,519
A correct assessment of the biggest problem many people have ever had

1008
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:37,151
So we get to talk in a little bit more about Miss green and here's Alex

1009
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,223
Perfect example

1010
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,551
Marjorie Taylor Greene

1011
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,599
She's dumb

1012
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
She's mean

1013
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,695
Educated about of the world

1014
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:54,047
Corporate communism Monopoly for themselves

1015
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,983
Technocracy to dominator

1016
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,103
Stay away from her

1017
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,639
Because if they adopt

1018
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,711
What she saying when she won by 75 percentage points

1019
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
The highest record

1020
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,271
In ears

1021
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
Republican

1022
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,975
What was she saying

1023
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,023
Is the New World Order

1024
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,775
I definitely think Alex could be right there Marjorie Taylor Greene was

1025
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
Infowars

1026
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:41,919
All the times he said that about elected officials this is the first time I'm not going to argue with

1027
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,759
Completely making up everything he just said about her life

1028
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
Action web

1029
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,343
First let's remember that use running essentially unopposed

1030
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,159
Withdrawn from the race prior to the election

1031
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,975
How to claim that you won by a record margin

1032
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,047
Because he wants to create the impression that you was just saying it

1033
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,839
And that stuff is so pop

1034
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,143
Popular

1035
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
Everyone should adopt

1036
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,703
The most popular stuff

1037
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
Which is info

1038
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,751
Or stuff

1039
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,799
This is something that he is pulling out of thin air

1040
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:13,919
Green one erase 74.7% 225

1041
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
Point three person

1042
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:20,831
She didn't win by 75 percentage points is Alex's claiming he just doesn't know the actual details are done

1043
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,855
Don't care to be accurate

1044
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,647
That's fine though since I can

1045
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,463
Think you could be generous and assume he just meant that you one with seven

1046
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
35%.

1047
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:32,351
Say that's probably close enough and I don't expect him to actually know what he's talkin about every accurate

1048
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:37,215
What's more egregious is him trying to say the previous record for Republican running for congress

1049
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,007
Adjustment 69%

1050
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,311
Margin or the vote who knows ya

1051
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,847
Either it's completely insane

1052
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,151
Just in the 2020

1053
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,175
10 for the US House

1054
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:50,783
Florida 2nd District kneel-down want to see against independent Tim O'Connor

1055
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,111
Play 97.9 to 2.1%

1056
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:58,207
That's a margin of 95.8%

1057
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:04,607
Far higher than Marjorie Taylor greenz margin against a half-finished game of hangman

1058
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,727
Green's official margin of victory was 49.4% which is the

1059
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:16,127
The 18th highest margin of Victory among Republican house election winners

1060
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,943
Nothing wrong with that left it all out on the field

1061
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:25,343
Alex desperately craves being seen as smart and having a ton of information at his disposal but in order to

1062
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,927
Stephanie generally just make s*** up knowing that no one will listening will even care

1063
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
He'll probably just believe him

1064
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,743
Cuz he's a con man

1065
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:36,351
Yeah that would be why I also just because it's Fonda in the 2018 election Republic

1066
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,399
Can Tom Graves won the same district seat

1067
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
The green did

1068
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,727
With 76.5% of the vote

1069
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,263
Which is more than she got

1070
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:49,919
His opponent received 23.5% of the vote to that means his total vote and his margin of Victory were both hired

1071
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,455
Marjorie Taylor greens were

1072
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,527
She's actually less popular than the previous Republican who won

1073
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,831
The future of the Republic

1074
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,623
Looking for

1075
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:02,719
It's what you get when you use in Fort Worth that would happen

1076
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:08,863
We should kill half of the constituents is usually less popular than you might expect

1077
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,399
Half of the considering have a problem

1078
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,935
The other half use

1079
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,007
So we're back to defending my Gates and it just

1080
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,287
Does seem to be like

1081
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,335
Two parties man come on

1082
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,687
Rodger stone is going to have the inside scoop I've got for my angle

1083
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
My sources that talk

1084
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,319
Spell Michelle. Talk to you and yours

1085
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,415
Pretty good picture what happened

1086
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
Extortion

1087
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:38,047
Is he a Playboy was he at the parties wall girls years ago

1088
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,655
Truthfully does not remember or doesn't

1089
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,215
I know but this is extortion this is a dirty trick

1090
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,031
This is not strong

1091
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:52,895
I would say I would say that's a that's a road to conviction

1092
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:59,295
I got drunk and party that was what

1093
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,575
I would say

1094
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
That

1095
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,647
I went into this episode

1096
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:09,535
Like the I don't know enough about this case the read the Times article

1097
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,863
I read what the people who are the sources

1098
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,935
Familiar with the investigation

1099
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,727
And we'll wait and see

1100
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,751
What comes out of

1101
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,055
You don't know

1102
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,871
The more I listen to this episode the more I'm like

1103
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,407
What are you doing

1104
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,199
This is a terrible defense

1105
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,991
If this is your damaged

1106
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:29,759
Control X

1107
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,783
In the you're doing

1108
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:37,695
I got 250 killed people at those parties look so yeah I don't feel like he's trying to soften the blow

1109
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:44,095
Of something worse because it's Alex like

1110
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:44,863
Operates

1111
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,911
Or or what

1112
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,447
In the movie bachelor party

1113
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,895
Don't don't let Alex anywhere near the

1114
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,967
If this happens to her honor

1115
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,783
It doesn't matter if he doesn't remember

1116
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,087
Your honor I would like to say

1117
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,367
What make some calls like

1118
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,183
Dwell

1119
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
Big people

1120
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:11,999
And they said no

1121
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,559
Is a Playboy

1122
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,839
Doesn't like underage women

1123
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,655
Never hit this that he's signaling Ian

1124
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:21,983
Not even know if any of this is true

1125
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,799
He doesn't didn't fly with some underage woman that's made of

1126
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,335
This is a Shakedown

1127
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,383
But the question is do they have

1128
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,431
Some woman who can claim

1129
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,247
It will she was younger now she's in a 20-something.

1130
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:45,791
You're saying that he might have dated a seventeen-year-old a few years ago

1131
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,119
It's not specifically what he's saying

1132
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,215
Can you call a character witness

1133
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
For the price

1134
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,799
Execution and tell him to defend

1135
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,359
This is a mess man

1136
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
Hey Alex

1137
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,407
We want you

1138
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,967
To really defend the s*** out of that gate

1139
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,783
How confident are they

1140
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
Alex

1141
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,623
We are going to look prosecutors prosecution

1142
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,951
What are behind our back Alex

1143
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,975
Look

1144
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:21,375
A seventeen-year-old 3 years ago

1145
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:24,191
Remember

1146
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,775
God's name is holy s*** let's see if Rodger can do better

1147
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,823
What is the inside

1148
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
Poo poo

1149
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,503
I mean if you had the name the single most effective

1150
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,039
Number of the house

1151
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
In terms of

1152
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,599
For the America first

1153
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,367
Agenda

1154
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
You have to be mad gay

1155
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:47,487
Incidental that right here on this show

1156
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,047
Only weeks ago I mentioned him

1157
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,351
Very realistically as a

1158
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,887
Presidential contender

1159
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:57,215
So this is a search and destroy mission

1160
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,007
I know Matt gaetz

1161
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,055
H-2b a person extraordinary Integra

1162
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:06,943
Was a Playboy coming from you that means a lot Rodger

1163
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,783
Met several times and they're very much in love

1164
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,807
This is not the matter

1165
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,343
Gates that I know this is a

1166
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
Cheap

1167
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,135
Political trick

1168
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,183
This is an effort to derail his

1169
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
His career

1170
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,535
Put Matt gaetz his family

1171
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,351
Is among the wealthiest families in Florida

1172
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,935
Therefore the most

1173
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,471
Isn't very realistic

1174
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,543
I'm getting so suspicious

1175
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,591
The more this goes on

1176
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:37,151
Why are they doing this they don't have to

1177
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,991
They don't Their audience does not demand it

1178
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,807
Could have legitimately just said this is all b*******

1179
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:48,671
Matt gaetz has he's come out on Tucker and he said that he's being set up see let's move forward

1180
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:52,767
Now let's get to the big news of the day why are they doing I'm not going to

1181
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,047
To give this story The

1182
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,607
The time that they want me to

1183
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,679
Integrity.

1184
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
Yeah

1185
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
Wow

1186
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,263
That

1187
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,543
Broadband

1188
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:10,175
The only thing worse than having Alex defend me in court would be having Rodger defend me and Corey

1189
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:17,087
There's nothing wrong with it I'm Rodger Stone I've done it all looks like

1190
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,159
Being like that he's great makes me think this person is knocked

1191
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,975
Didn't understand it maybe that's

1192
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,767
But the bias of mine

1193
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,583
You know not everybody whose beloved by villains

1194
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,375
Is a villain themselves score

1195
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,447
Sure I mean if I was going to

1196
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,751
Put money on it.

1197
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,519
I mean I would

1198
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,311
Say that the FBI should get

1199
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,591
Records

1200
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,663
And I would imagine the boat with that New York Times story came out

1201
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,199
Rodger still got a text saying

1202
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,991
I did it what do I do

1203
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,551
That one

1204
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,575
It's likely situation

1205
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111
So

1206
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,647
Narrative now

1207
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,415
McCombs

1208
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,951
With Rodger on board

1209
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,767
That they're trying to get rid of

1210
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,303
Gates because

1211
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Skis

1212
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,351
The Heir Apparent

1213
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
To Trump

1214
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,423
Sure in the 2024 election Bass

1215
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
The guy has

1216
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,263
Norma's cojones

1217
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,591
Usually when you're young and you first get the

1218
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,871
Conversate tell you that

1219
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,431
2

1220
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,247
Resume super-smart

1221
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,527
The alpha male they're scared

1222
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,343
Yeah because he has many of the same trait

1223
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,647
He's on dacious

1224
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,439
He's bold he's a brawler

1225
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,023
Take another beating like they took in 2016

1226
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,327
So this is kind of what they're doing

1227
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,119
I think they see their

1228
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,143
Next

1229
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,191
The sense that I get

1230
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,471
Navigate still weird

1231
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,567
Yeah perhaps

1232
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,359
But I think it's even more than that

1233
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,383
Yeah I think the

1234
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,431
They feel an absence of

1235
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
There

1236
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
Sort of Idol

1237
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,271
Basically

1238
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,807
Figurehead

1239
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,391
The color lights around and I think that they're feeling

1240
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
The pressure of the

1241
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,439
That there's a crush

1242
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,975
That Trump is absent

1243
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,511
In terms of being there

1244
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:07,423
He still likes a Hayward Trump supporters he stole the real president they still need somebody

1245
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,751
They're all jockeying for position

1246
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,775
And I think that

1247
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:15,359
The sense that I get from the conversation they're having cuz I keep bacon wrapped

1248
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,407
Are conversations with a bad

1249
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,223
And at the sense that I get is that Alex really think

1250
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,015
Except Matt gaetz should be the next

1251
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,039
Person

1252
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,599
And think it's the mantle of the weirdo

1253
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,391
Conservative version.

1254
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
Wow

1255
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
And so I

1256
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,255
I guess he's interpreting this as a preemptive

1257
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,023
Attack

1258
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,303
On the part of the globalist

1259
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:39,167
If you don't what I don't believe any of that's real and I don't believe that's true but

1260
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:39,935
If Alex

1261
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,959
Does believe that

1262
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:45,055
True then it kind of does make sense why he would spend an hour on this story

1263
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,615
Still his defenses tarab

1264
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,895
Now it's not good

1265
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:53,247
It's not good I mean ultimately his defenses like why can't white men do whatever they want

1266
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,807
What can't what can't

1267
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,879
Yeah what are you going to judge him

1268
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,647
EZ's

1269
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,439
Is white neither man come on now

1270
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:07,327
You just let him do what he wants to do you're also he's Rich what are you going to punish him for

1271
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,607
What is like

1272
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,631
I don't know

1273
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:10,911
Beto

1274
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,447
What if it came out today.

1275
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,239
Had dated a 17 year old

1276
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,287
Allegation

1277
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,079
How do you think our to respond

1278
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,127
Call Enrico

1279
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,175
Yeah and that's but that's the

1280
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
The point of

1281
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,247
Not giving a s*** about whataboutism

1282
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,271
We're not going to

1283
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,807
Beat that Matt what about it

1284
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:31,135
No there there it's like their bread and butter

1285
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,439
No it's just kind of something that can be a little bit

1286
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,975
Good funny to imagine

1287
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,767
How about you would freak out

1288
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,791
Yeah

1289
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
The reality is

1290
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,399
Based on the claims that are being made

1291
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:44,959
Gates

1292
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:49,055
Says that there are tapes that prove his innocence.

1293
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:52,895
Okay should be able to come out

1294
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,479
Resolve this whole thing by and I still hate you for all the others

1295
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,783
Demand

1296
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,551
The tapes

1297
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,831
Most importantly

1298
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:01,855
Let's

1299
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,879
Ear

1300
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,415
We need

1301
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:10,815
To hear the tapes

1302
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,351
Somebody in the FBI

1303
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,911
Control

1304
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,703
Gate was about to have a devastating effect

1305
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,799
I think that's exactly right retiring from Congress

1306
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,639
The idea that they're presenting now is base

1307
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,919
Basically that

1308
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,223
There was this guy who by the way

1309
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:28,991
Matt gaetz

1310
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:32,575
Said bye-bye name on Tucker Carlson show

1311
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,135
This guy who was a former Justice

1312
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,695
Department official is trying to extort

1313
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:40,255
Gate to this family Friday

1314
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:46,655
Sure there's the allegation that they'll come out with if he doesn't pay up or whatever court has those dad

1315
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:49,983
Wearing a wire in order to entrap this person

1316
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,591
Because they were just about to nail this this extortionist

1317
00:58:54,847 --> 00:59:00,991
Short New York Times got leaked this information about the allegations that were the

1318
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,783
Righto Matt gaetz

1319
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,439
I don't know if I believe all that it seems like a defense

1320
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,463
It's being made and

1321
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
You know I

1322
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:15,327
If that's okay that should be very easy to clear this up

1323
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,351
It should be incredibly

1324
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,911
Hey man that person who used to work at the just

1325
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,935
Suburban should go to prison

1326
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:22,495
It's not hard

1327
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:27,615
It's like it's like these people don't understand that the that loss if it's

1328
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,151
It's to function at all

1329
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:29,919
Is to be applied

1330
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Equally

1331
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,735
Otherwise it is not law

1332
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,503
That is a struggle

1333
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
Yeah

1334
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,319
The New York Times Reporter

1335
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,855
Who covered this story

1336
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,903
They reached out to Rodger

1337
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,951
Send Rodger an email

1338
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,535
Part of that is because Rodger was hanging out with

1339
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,839
Level with me

1340
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,911
Just tell me

1341
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
Hayride

1342
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,543
We have a picture of you and hit him and Greenberg

1343
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
At Mar-A-Lago

1344
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,103
And how say you

1345
00:59:59,359 --> 00:59:59,871
Fallout Quest

1346
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
YouTube

1347
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,223
Rodger got me mail and he's got a response

1348
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
For the guy in this get salad

1349
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,271
Really

1350
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,063
I actually got

1351
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,599
An email from Bob

1352
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
Michael Schmidt

1353
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
The

1354
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:14,207
Reporter at the New York Times that wrote

1355
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,231
This story today

1356
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,535
I'm going to be releasing my response

1357
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,351
Because it is quite extraordinary

1358
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:23,167
They don't hold the New York Times to the same

1359
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,959
Standards they hold everybody

1360
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,263
It is amazing

1361
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
2

1362
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,823
Associated with

1363
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
Is

1364
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
Spend time with

1365
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,175
Association

1366
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,759
You know I want to hear your response

1367
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,319
Yeah you'll get a chance

1368
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,903
Touch it up a little bit because

1369
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,439
The angrier I get

1370
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:49,023
Alex is like when you get a chance

1371
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,815
Could you are gone tomorrow midnight

1372
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,863
What river talk about it

1373
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,703
I'm awake

1374
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
Florida

1375
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:02,079
Doesn't that late does not give us know anymore

1376
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:07,455
I go to bed at 4

1377
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:08,991
It's not a bad life

1378
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,039
Life

1379
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,319
For that

1380
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,343
Recluse

1381
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,671
What how many pictures with alleged Orkin

1382
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
Convicted sex

1383
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207
Text traffickers

1384
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
Can you be in

1385
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:23,071
Before people start certain point you got to let that go

1386
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,399
The congregate at Mar-A-Lago

1387
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:30,239
You know if you go there there's probably a picture of you with a perm

1388
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:34,079
Probably another thing we should put a red flag up about

1389
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,639
What I mean like it's nothing

1390
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:43,039
You know you go to you go to MOS Eisley Cantina you're going to get a picture taken of you and a Smuggler

1391
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:47,903
That doesn't mean that you're a Smuggler just because you took a picture of you with

1392
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:54,303
Right right like to hang out at the place where Smugglers, and I get that but that's how many pictures do you

1393
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
To be like

1394
01:01:55,583 --> 01:02:01,215
Look I get it one or two and then you see that picture to go who that's not going to look good later on

1395
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
5

1396
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,775
Then it's just too bad

1397
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,055
You sound like

1398
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,847
The f****** left

1399
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:12,223
Guilt-by-association all over the place and it's not good

1400
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:12,991
Anyway

1401
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,063
On the first episode do we ever

1402
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,367
We learned that it was time

1403
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,415
Victoria's

1404
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:24,255
Benjamin Netanyahu was the canary in the coal mine

1405
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,047
Riddler

1406
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:33,215
5 goddamn years later except I have to tell you it is still time to pray

1407
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:42,687
You're crying you're always appreciate that let us trade

1408
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,623
But but let's pray we got a minute have left to break

1409
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,183
Lead us in prayer for for congressman

1410
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,487
You got to imagine Rodger like

1411
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,511
You motherfukers

1412
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,279
Son of a

1413
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,839
Dario

1414
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,519
Are you first off you're telling this b******* about me

1415
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,799
Me crying while prayer

1416
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:11,615
Get the f*** out of here I think that's good

1417
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,895
For that all there is

1418
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,967
Images that I think I think that's fine that's that's the version of the story

1419
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,527
The penitent man who

1420
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,551
Dry your god king

1421
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,575
Naturally

1422
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,647
That's what you do when you go overboard with it too

1423
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,463
Garments in beating his

1424
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,767
Aziz Alex's sort of style

1425
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,559
But yeah

1426
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,583
I mean luck

1427
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,399
It's rude to be like where you lie.

1428
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,679
Prayer

1429
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,447
On my dumb

1430
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,471
Conspiracy theory

1431
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,263
Show where we're saying that Matt gaetz

1432
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:43,871
May have dated a seventeen-year-old years ago but who knows he doesn't remember his wild party is

1433
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,639
Whatever

1434
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,687
I will be mad if you asked me to pray

1435
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,479
The day before let alone

1436
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,247
5 minutes

1437
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:51,807
On the

1438
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,575
Spot

1439
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,415
We're going to pray like that

1440
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:00,255
The most articulate but I'll give it a try

1441
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,023
My dear Lord

1442
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,303
Lotion

1443
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:05,631
You who created both Heaven and Earth yo Yoo-hoo

1444

Stanford Justice and eight

1445
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,191
Injustice

1446
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:11,519
Please watch over in the struggle for his freedom

1447
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,335
Is a good man he is a Godly Man

1448
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,871
Is an innocent man

1449
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,151
He is a man of great

1450
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,431
Do not let

1451
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,711
The left-wing 8

1452
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,479

Destroy this great

That like would have more media coverage

1467
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,207
Like this seems like

1468
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,767
So bizarre Rodger Stone

1469
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,071
Praise on Aerosmith

1470
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,911
It's like they visit brotherstone still has to be a big bad

1471
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,727
Pick me up just

1472
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,775
Portray him as this sad

1473
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,055
I mean just

1474
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,591
Real pathetic

1475
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:24,223
Nonsense man as I say that out loud I think I kind of realize that

1476
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,759
Are you to cover something that way

1477
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:29,855
You might run the risk of offending people who are Christian a religious

1478
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,135
Like the idea

1479
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,183
It's not mocking

1480
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:38,559
Prayer no walking the idea that one is Rodger Stone Tucson Alex Jones Show

1481
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:43,423
It's more than that and I think that tone might not be able to be properly

1482
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:49,311
Yocan Vape

1483
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,103
Like if you are

1484
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,383
By any stretch

1485
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,687
And it hear it too

1486
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,991
The intent of the Bible

1487
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,575
I would argue that that prayer is

1488
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:05,439
Way more offensive to Christians then any article being like Rodger stone is an a******

1489
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,511
Let them do what they did to me you like

1490
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,607
Not even God is above the left-right Paradigm is that what we're doing.

1491
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,423
Your God is pathetic and shity

1492
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:21,823
Alex's God is above life repaired I mean City Super to the rice

1493
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:25,407
So Alex at the end there was talking about how we want to draft Michael

1494
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,223
Planned General Flynn

1495
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:28,991
Run for president

1496
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,039
I talked about this a little bit they did him

1497
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,575
Not quite on the

1498
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,623
What's draft

1499
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:37,951
General Flynn dictated ticket going what do you think

1500
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,511
Look I think I made it

1501
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,791
Is Claire's I can't

1502
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,327
The president runs for the Press

1503
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,631
And he has the right to make that decision

1504
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,167
And he has the luxury to make it

1505
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
In his own time

1506
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,495
The president doesn't run its

1507
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,823
Vital that we have a candidate a man or a woman

1508
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,383
Who really understands and supports and

1509
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
Whitley is committed

1510
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,719
Ready in case

1511
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,767
Hey Alex you don't suck

1512
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,791
Trump pardon

1513
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,863
I have loyalty to him for life

1514
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,143
Yeah forever got

1515
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,703
What forever to have hypothetical

1516
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:26,591
Conversations about anybody else but you have to understand that I will always give up

1517
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:30,175
The Trump is technically still president even if Gates were present

1518
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:30,943
Trump should be

1519
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,223
Yep yep

1520
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,247
Yep

1521
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,063
Becomes all too apparent there

1522
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:36,831
That the way that they're

1523
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,855
Conversing at like we're look

1524
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,623
Looking for a stand-in

1525
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,695
Yeah we need somebody to get it

1526
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:44,767
Dum Dums as excited as Trump did

1527
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:48,351
Back gate to the kind of s******* Who would wear a gas mask

1528
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,631
And then get covid

1529
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,215
Just don't have any of

1530
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
Like it

1531
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:58,335
It's very abundantly clear now that nobody but

1532
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,127
Trump has the stuff fit

1533
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
The like

1534
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
Total

1535
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
Attributes

1536
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,807
That are necessary to pull off a trunk

1537
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
Campaign

1538
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,599
You know

1539
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:13,439
Like Gates isn't going to be able to cuz he doesn't have that image of

1540
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,743
Being a successful billionaire

1541
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,047
He's an a******

1542
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:21,119
He can't pull off any kind of sexual impropriety

1543
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,959
Candle because he's too young and not enough people want to back him

1544
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,519
In order to run interference for him

1545
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:31,615
So we're probably going to wind up with Trump is the Republican candidate

1546
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:35,199
So sad and miserable for everybody

1547
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:37,503
So long as the media learn

1548
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,271
Any less

1549
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:43,391
From 2016 and 2020

1550
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,791
But it's okay Dan if the Democrats pull it

1551
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:53,119
Together and govern effectively there's no way that our right wing

1552
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,519
So Alex

1553
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:02,847
Evite's Rodger go and

1554
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,615
Who

1555
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,151
Very confused

1556
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,735
Very very very

1557
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,271
Confusing guy get

1558
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,831
Generally what they're doing

1559
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,903
I can't imagine having any time to prepare

1560
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
I'm thinking like

1561
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,695
This is the defense

1562
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,231
Looking to spend

1563
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,767
Half of the show

1564
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,303
Is

1565
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,071
Is bizarre

1566
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,375
Have a better defense tomorrow

1567
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,423
Yeah that makes the most sense

1568
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,727
Halo Roadies allegation

1569
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:36,127
And they're terrible and we're going to look into it and will have more in Rogers not available today he'll be on tomorrow to drive

1570
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,943
Rodger could be asleep who knows who cares

1571
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,735
It just doesn't matter

1572
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,503
Take your time

1573
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,575
Alex is also built

1574
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:49,695
Entire story about the everyone whose capital is getting off scot-free

1575
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:53,279
And the leaves are really mad about it is on

1576
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:59,167
Along with his lawyer is going to say you better have a lawyer Fresno

1577
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:07,359
I don't know if his lawyer is going to be helpful

1578
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
Oh boy

1579
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:08,895
AliExpress

1580
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
Executor what do you

1581
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,943
Think of the Fiasco

1582
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,855
Thought they were over-reaching they seem to

1583
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:21,183
Add everything to fit into but the

1584
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,207
Just don't say

1585
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:22,975
Support that

1586
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,767
I don't know if it was something

1587
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,815
Think they had planned because I believe that the

1588
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,607
Event was

1589
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,911
Funded somehow with antifa

1590
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,191
But

1591
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,215
I think they

1592
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:33,983
Wanted

1593
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,287
Patriots to act up more

1594
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:40,639
Then what happened and then they have continued to try to push a narrative

1595
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:45,247
Set the facts don't fit into

1596
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,527
It looks

1597
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:52,415
Two roads his lawyer that he brings along takes antifa paid to do something

1598
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:57,535
Yeah yeah yeah yeah you know I think

1599
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,815
I think the past

1600
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,583
Few years

1601
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,655
I have really taken a lot of Shine off of

1602
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,703
The legal minds of our

1603
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,751
His lawyer seems insane

1604
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,031
Yeah

1605
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:13,407
Most lawyers now starting to sound a lot more and more thing

1606
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,199
Geminiman Stewart Alex

1607
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:17,759
They just talk about how like

1608
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:22,367
Everybody on the right is good

1609
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:27,487
That's where all Angels over here and everybody on the left drinks adrenochrome and

1610
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,791
It's not really all that interesting or or

1611
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,351
Dunno doesn't bring much

1612
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,423
Stuart does have a prediction

1613
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,959
That was got put on the record

1614
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,799
Alright I'll we're looking at the summer of Rage

1615
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,847
Their speeding your timetable

1616
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,151
That's why it's important for us to understand what's coming

1617
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,175
You should expect

1618
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,967
Benedictine

1619
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,063
A couple of dollar from the world currency and kill the dollar this summer

1620
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,367
What you do have to do to become squall

1621
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,159
This week

1622
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,207
We got you nice warm strong

1623
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:00,255
That means food and fuel

1624
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,791
Mission

1625
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,327
Clean water the ability to

1626
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,631
Self-sustaining you can resist

1627
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,911
The compulsory

1628
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,447
Taking of the vaccine

1629
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,215
Normally eat

1630
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,263
I totally agree with you

1631
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,799
So yeah the dollar is going to be the

1632
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,079
Destroy this summer

1633
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,103
Look for that

1634
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,639
Everybody who believe that

1635
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,407
Take your stuff

1636
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,943
And just go into the woods

1637
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:22,527
Create a splinter Society

1638
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,831
For if you believe that

1639
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,111
Take the dollar

1640
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,903
Still has some value

1641
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,439
Pay your internet bill

1642
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:32,255
Download an episode of Alex Jones

1643
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,815
Songs from last year saying this year will be the summer of Rage

1644
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:41,215
Couple years back when he did it in the every year

1645
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:41,983
Actor like

1646
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,335
Years and years in the past USA tomorrow they're going to devalue the Dollar well

1647
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,895
Conveniently selling gold help

1648
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,687
It helps to sell gold

1649
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,735
Outrageous

1650
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,527
Oh no

1651
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,831
This summer now man I'm really worried

1652
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:01,695
Yeah I'm really worried so Stewart's whole big thing is that the government is going to starve

1653
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,743
That's his that's his new thing

1654
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,303
But he's pushing pretty hard

1655
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:09,887
It's going to be tough to win votes on a platform of star very one

1656
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,935
But we'll see how they pull it off Dan

1657
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:12,703
Counterpoint

1658
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:16,543
Yep here's a great here's a great electoral strategy

1659
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:21,663
Hey you Miss food. Food

1660
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
What's the word Estrella

1661
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,247
Trying to

1662
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,295
Triggering people's minds

1663
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,575
Anyway

1664
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,367
Come to the end of the sentence

1665
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,135
It's weird cuz

1666
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,159
I think

1667
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,183
Pink eye

1668
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,719
Obviously I'm more

1669
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,743
Interested in

1670
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,279
Non present day hours

1671
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,327
Alex Jones

1672
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,351
Uninteresting person

1673
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,887
But this

1674
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,167
This defensive gate

1675
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,191
Really did

1676
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,751
Interest me in as much as like

1677
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,287
I hate Matt gaetz

1678
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:53,151
I'm not interested in piling on him to or until we know more

1679
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:53,919
Naturally

1680
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
Alex

1681
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,015
His defense makes me suspect

1682
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,831
It really makes me think that Alex knows something

1683
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,111
That we don't

1684
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,415
And it's bad and it's real

1685
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:11,327
That's what it makes me think that any other impression we don't know that could just be

1686
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,351
Tony jerk

1687
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,631
Trying to protect your own

1688
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,167
Kind of thing

1689
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,703
No maybe there's something

1690
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:23,615
And I would say that if this is his knee jerk reaction that's probably just as Illuminating as if he does

1691
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:26,943
Know something that we don't know because his me jerk reaction is like

1692
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,479
Come on sexual assault

1693
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,247
You know like it

1694
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:32,063
It's kind of a weirdo

1695
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:35,135
Conservative exactly it is that basic

1696
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:38,207
Turner Field

1697
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,487
We know how you're going to react

1698
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,767
Back to just about every

1699
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,559
Yeah yeah it doesn't

1700
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,863
It doesn't it was not an enjoyable

1701
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,143
Bit of time to live

1702
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:46,911
Listen to this year

1703
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,935
Confusing

1704
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,751
I don't know who will check back in

1705
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,519
We'll see how things

1706
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,799
Are going of course saying

1707
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,591
