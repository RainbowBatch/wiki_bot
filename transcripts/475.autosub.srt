3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guy

00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,880

7
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,336
Yerba mate

8
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
Which I didn't even know what it was

9
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
I was responding to you making that faces I didn't recognize the

10
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,720
And I made a face at you

11
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:41,120
Oh well the theme song is always

12
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
And you still didn't run the song

13
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
And the only Interruption was mean

14
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:59,040

What's up

17
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
I feel lately have been a lot of plant self-conscious

18
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Stop.

19
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
But I

20
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
Perceivable future

21
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,224
Since you were last year

22
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
Installed

23
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
And I've installed a makeshift ladder

24
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
Vines

25
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
Bean plant

26
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400

00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
And I like it so much

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
That I've decided

33
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
Like it's the season

34
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:11,488
Recovery

35
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,048
Walls that I can

36
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
Why not why not it's garden plants not I can create basically a

37
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
I will

38
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,528
And we really seem to weigh that it's grown and how quickly it has like

39
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
Photography Empire State Building

40
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,120
More involved

Community stuff forward

42
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472

43
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,288
Please find a community garden

44
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,504
Get involved and try and donate

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,904
Whatever is grown to food insecurity

46
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,703
That's not the worst thing ever

47
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,103
I'm still in the experimental phase

48
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,407
Seedlings coming up

49
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,783
Mentioned before cucumbers have flowers on them

50
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
Female flowers on

She's about to go back to school and she's freaking out

57
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,319
Teaching

58
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,679
Is there anybody cuz nobody has any idea what's going on

59
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,263
Everybody scrambling around so she's staying up till 5 a.m. every night

60
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Last night

61
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
This morning

62
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
Call Cobra Kai

63
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
And to this day

64
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,479
Ralph Macchio is the least imposing and graceful

65
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:47,135
Martial artist screen before

66
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,327

70
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
What is this

71
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,135
Talking about watching The Karate Kid

72
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,279
40 years after the events of The Karate Kid I did not know that

73
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,495
Kicking ass and then we all learn who's the bad guy

74
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,383
It's really good

75
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:46,527
I know you are really good

76
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,343

00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Episode

79
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,327
Frazzle

80
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,799
The. Of time from August 24th to August 26th

81
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
2020

82
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
And I think there's a lot of stuff

83
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
Going on during the time. That especially

84
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,623
V the world

85
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
And

86
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
The timeframe of

87
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
The day after

88
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
Jacob Lake

89
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
Was shot by the police Kenosha

90
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
The shooting happened

91
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Also in Kenosha

92
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
So take a look at that

93
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
Time.

94
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,431
I think there's a lot of stuff that's been going around

95
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
About

96
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,391
Social media

97
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
Inspiring

98
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,767
The shooter

99
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
I saw a few references to Infowars

100
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:10,495
Until interested in that and I wanted to pay

101
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,103
A particular Focus to it

102
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
Difficult

103
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
You coming in really fast

104
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,855
Responsible

105
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:32,255
And simultaneously didn't feel like I had it in me to do episode about something else and not talk about

106
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,303
What's happening

107
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,655
I just couldn't imagine feeling and saying anything and anyway appropriate

108
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,103
Just anything would be inappropriate even though

109
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,991
Sometimes it's more important that we ourselves and up

110
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,343
Listening to that I was in

111
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
4

112
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,535

Next

115
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Then I'll probably want

116
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
The same time

117
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
That I keep saying

118
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,759
Christian Scott

119
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,391

Money off at heroin

122
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Barge

123
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:40,255
Thank you so much Jason

Take that generosity

125
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,479
Everytime I'm going to throw up

126
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:07,135
I was going to do it every time

127
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
See how long it took you to notice myself

128
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:19,167
Hey I'm trying to force you into this season

129
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,823
Well as asthma make you accept a reality for our

130
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
Bring told me if you are sitting down you are always right

131
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
So what you're going to do

132
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,015
Is it going to take that generosity to put it in a paper bag

133
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:40,415
You're going to head to the park with a few of your friends are going to drink whatever is generosity

134
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,743
To a urine donation center

135
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,815
Of your donation that they need

136
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,119
Good idea

137
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
The first time I went to a park

138
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:57,055
Drink my friends are so stupid they had a bottle of red wine peppermint schnapps

139
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,455
What are we

140
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
I realized

141
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,327
The brightness before we go

142
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:24,703
I was wondering when we were coming back

143
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,519
Forgot that it was forgotten

144
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,615
And I want to see the one of the things that happened

145
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
I wasn't drinking as much South

146
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Is there a little bit

147
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,503
Depressed about Seltzer check

148
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,575
I tried to find a couple Jelly Belly

149
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Has aligned himself

150
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,255
What songs

151
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,839
I don't know. Like there's a number of things that I

152
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,911
Found tried to order the mini can't

153
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
Something

154
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:04,127
Jelly Belly made 100 those and everybody was like

155
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:10,271
Jelly Belly sell Crystal Pepsi

156
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,463
With the

157
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,279
And it's 226

158
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,959
26

159
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:35,359
Pretty good schedule

160
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,759
Cuz you're going to get into the doldrums of Summer

161
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
What you got the strength

162
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
I think that

163
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
Viable

164
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,767
Couple highlights

165
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
San Pellegrino at a diamond

166
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Addition

167
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,959
Box

168
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:07,359
Like it's a bottle of f****** $10

169
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Just like 50

170
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
It was

171
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,343
Playing fizzy water

172
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,839
And then the other thing I wanted to bring up

173
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,655
Definitely deserves a call out cuz I have been very

174
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
Anti grapefruit

175
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
I think grapefruit sucks

176
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
However I tried the Limitless

177
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,455
Hibiscus

178
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,087
Very good 76 out of honors

179
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:54,463
Island

180
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,863
Another flavor

181
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
Conwell

182
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
Yeah I think so that's like

183
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
Fresco works

184
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,455
I don't know

185
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Anyway

186
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
South Jordan

187
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,839
Discuss

188
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,471
I think it's pretty self-explanatory

189
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,543
The show why we didn't have an episode

190
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,103
Release Alyssa possibilities isn't very long

191
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,431
But I want to explain exactly what's up here

192
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,551
I texted you about this on Thursday morning lost some respect

193
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
Really tell what direction was

194
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
Many things that were happening

195
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,559
Not necessarily surprising

196
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
Process anything

197
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,935
In a manner that would make it possible for me to commented on it in a responsible way

198
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,263
Kenosha police shooting of Jacob

199
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,847
Call me Sunday August 23rd

200
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
There's the unrest

201
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,967
Stabroek outside

202
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
Turn on Tuesday

203
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
What is 2017 year-olds militia

204
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
Fascist jock

205
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Killed multiple

206
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Protesters

207
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Kenosha

208
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
He lived in Illinois

209
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
Wednesday August 26th

210
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,327
Homicide suspect

211
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
Which Samba stuck as a police shooting

212
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
Trust is there with

213
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,847
Publix

214
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
Trust them when they say they didn't shoot

215
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
This person

216
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
In a move that I absolutely resent

217
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
The police released security camera footage

218
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
I watched it on Twitter which

219
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
F****** alphabet

220
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:06,559
Then on Thursday there was the landfall of hurricane Flora which was looking for ticket

221
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Has a storm

222
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,959
When it arrives in Louisiana it was tied with the hurricane from 106

223
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,799
Before years ago for the title of strongest to ever arrive in state

224
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
Wrecker

225
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,407
That are being broken

226
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
Earlier in soccer formation

227
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Tropical storms and hurricanes

228
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
When it came time to record an episode for Friday I realize that productive thing to add to this conversation

229
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,279
Listen and try and gain some sense of

230
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
Perspective

231
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:44,703
There's a difficulty for me professionally and that I had to do a seventeen-year-old shooter in Kenosha

232
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,495
And how there was a media talk

233
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,847
Encouraging sign of violence in the days leading up to

234
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
To the attack

235
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:58,271
Very quickly there were tweets talking about how Infowars had an article up promoting the militia that was in Kenosha

236
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
It involved with the shooting

237
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:04,671
Ernest a dude forget to point out that this wasn't posted elsewhere that

238
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Just reposted on Infowars

239
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Still bad

240
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,423
Screenshots were posted that militia trying to legitimize themselves by

241
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:21,055
And then on August 28th Media Matters released an article with the headline

242
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,383
Vigilante violence in the days before a gunman killed Kenosha

243
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
The protest

244
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:30,783
This article is fine pain analysis but it also isn't

245
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,135
Circle

246
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
In a couple of posts on Infowars

247
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
Which misses the reality

248
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,863
Extremist killing protesters probably believe in

249
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,447
Is the ultimate conclusion

250
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
This is where things get really complicated for me

251
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
Because there's still a lot that's unclear

252
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,663
To make a strong claim as I would like

253
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:04,831
At the point listen to Alex Jones

254
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,183
Alex directly contributed to this tragedy

255
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:15,071
I struggled with that because this was one of the points are my ability to retain perspective was really being

256
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,399
It feels like Alex helped Inspire this terrorist

257
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:23,007
My immediate reaction was sort of alternate

258
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,799
Pretty predictable eventuality

259
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,895
And how disheartening it is to realize that Alex was far from the only Outlet

260
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,223
From which the shooter has been getting the messages he was getting

261
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,135
I can't say with certainty if this guy was an Alex fan but I want to lay out to your house

262
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
It won't surprise me at all

263
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,887
Which is a lot of contact like he was missing from the Articles and Outlets like Media Matters

264
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,007
For months now

265
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Against left-leaning protest

266
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,383
Hurting ramble about how Vengeance belongs to God

267
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
The answer

268
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
To that riddle

269
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
Which I didn't realize was a riddle

270
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,807
Is that you one of Alex's listeners

271
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
Might be men

272
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,135
To be the instrument of God's vengeance

273
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
Impact

274
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Vengeance is

275
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
God has inched

276
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
That's always the twist

277
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
The riddle

278
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
Terroriser

279
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,223
You got strung up when you're done

280
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,807
We're going to terrorize you

281
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,623
From last April

282
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,439
Close attention to Alex

283
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,767
You'll know this is a theme but it brings up on a pretty regular basis

284
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,887
Princeton Sears him discussing how his listeners could be a tool that God uses to bring vengeance

285
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,727
Is June 30th 2020 episode

286
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Scott

287
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
How does God deliver

288
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
God delivers

289
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
Real careful that you're at

290
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
Following God's plan

291
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
And you'll know when it's time

292
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,936
Possibility

293
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
Tell you what

294
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,616
Which could be better understood as Alex

295
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,992
Essential things very difficult

296
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:46,368
People to wrap their heads around as it shows like Alex Azar

297
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Are Fascist cult religious

298
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
Programming

299
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,560
Where is the host

300
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:00,192
For running the Democratic Party

301
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
And everything

302
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,056
This is critical to understand because it's not

303
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,896
There's been a religious undertone

304
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:15,296
Current state it's just basically authoritarian brainwashing

305
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,136
Authoritarian

306
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,720
Alex wants a dictatorship

307
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,632
Is better than me literal Christian tab

308
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,424
So we should all go with the white identity

309
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,008
Most of the rest of his shows

310
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:41,152
Idiot

311
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:46,528
The heightening to religious terms also justifies whatever actions you listeners B

312
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,600
If you're up against a literal Christian devil

313
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
Really is it

314
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
So bad

315
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,512
What if you're able to convince yourself that the person you're killing is an agent

316
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
The same literal Christian

317
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
To kill them

318
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
I mean

319
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
God might even tell you to do it

320
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
I believe in you

321
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,824
They're going to figure out ways to take Act

322
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
There is no more law

323
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Did I just speak

324
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
I believe.

325
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,432
An essential piece of the project

326
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,712
You need to be doing

327
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
When you're out

328
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
You're playing this game

329
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,344
Is the dehumanization of people you want violence to be carried out again

330
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
This takes many forms

331
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,416
Because there are many aspects

332
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,208
Stew how you see someone as a person

333
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,048
Each of us has different forms of

334
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
Butterfly the different aspects of Our Lives

335
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,448
What element is the rights that you have is this

336
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:16,896
Like how an identified agents work

337
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,456
This is completely unacceptable

338
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,808
If it's being done to a group you wanted Beach

339
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
You need to justify

340
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,160
July

341
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,232
Are these men

342
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,816
Federal Marshals but most of them are u.s. military

343
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Bracketing

344
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Why you're getting grass

345
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
And then you're getting interrogated

346
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
Because you work for a foreign power

347
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
You work with

348
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
Literally trying to burn the country down

349
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
Destroy the stock market

350
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
Bankruptcy economy

351
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,296
You're a military operation

352
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:08,096
List attention in kidnapping

353
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Alex

354
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
Imagine that

355
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,456
It's because you don't have

356
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
The people enjoy this country

357
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,808
What is an effect of arguing

358
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:33,696
Test result UCR of a separate class of people

359
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
Disney humanization has another level to it

360
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,960
Tom's

361
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,520
Temperature

362
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Equating protesters to quote

363
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
Obstacles to Freedom

364
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
Considered enemies of freedom

365
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
But

366
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,272
To me that psychological

367
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
Approach because

368
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
I don't sit here and see them as my

369
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
Freedom I think if you ask them they wanted

370
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,720
I'll be free to just like anybody else

371
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Become

372
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
Unwittingly is

373
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Obstacle

374
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
Become

375
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Nicole's a Frida

376
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
When is American

377
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
In math

378
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
Willingham

379
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
Fight for their freedom

380
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
It's a trap

381
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,080
You know an optical

382
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
You're going to get run over

383
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,688
Use the cars running people over in the streets as a

384
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
The physical example

385
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:33,344
The opposition is not personal

386
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
Freedom

387
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
Obstacles

388
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:42,816
Coincide

389
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
On the road

390
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,640
This is pretty consistent as a mentality

391
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,736
People who have passionate political beliefs that are counter to Hughes

392
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
Idiot to the globalist

393
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,088
Tricked into a person has perfect ideology

394
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,488
This is at its core a convenient and cowardly

395
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
Without having to release

396
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
Explain his problem

397
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:21,216
He does this primarily because you can't argue for his positions and if you try

398
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
Really fast

399
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,616
Along with dehumanization another tactic

400
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,152
Secret important

401
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,456
Encourage violence against

402
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,528
It's a massively exaggerated mischaracterize your opposition

403
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,344
Whitney apartments on in Seattle with setup

404
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
Alex engagement

405
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
Freeway system, cold behavior in this

406
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,232
When he discussed Seattle

407
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,256
Raz Simone

408
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,168
A self-described

409
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
Warren

410
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
Videos of him running around

411
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
When was YouTube Channel show

412
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
Running around beating

413
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
People

414
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,832
Calling himself in his armed goons the police

415
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,464
Area affected by the autonomous zone is

416
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,048
In the State of Affairs has misrepresented to being with the areas under the

417
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,840
African Warlord

418
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,680
Obviously meant to paint a particular sort of picture of the audio

419
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
Does mine

420
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
Helps them just

421
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,800
Responding to test

422
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480
Is there a protest in your city

423
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,808
That's a possible outcome if you let these leftist type their way

424
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,904
At the end of July Alex engaged his behavior

425
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
Piccalilli flamboyant

426
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,536
Claims

427
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
Themes for being sent out

428
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
To get all the conservatives

429
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
But it's totally confirm now

430
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
Soros deep state

431
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
Obama controlled Hillary control

432
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,200
Will be the decoys

433
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,296
Distraction

434
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
The leadership

435
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
The

436
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
Pro human pro-america movement

437
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
In finance

438
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,704
Government in the military

439
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,984
Your targeted for death

440
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
They may launch the attack

441
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
The safety off

442
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
Finger on the trigger

443
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
13 hit squad

444
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,344
Tricom hit squad everybody

445
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
Everything

446
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
I'm coming to kill you and your fam

447
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
Becoming

448
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,608
Business nonsensical claim

449
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,912
Total confirmed

450
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
Conservative

451
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:06,848
Languages L being targeted

452
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,432
Ultimately he ends up by saying they're going to come kill you and your family

453
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,504
This is the personalization of the exaggerated threat

454
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,856
Which is meant to make the audience feel too sensitive

455
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,024
Another example of this outrageous and embarrassing style of exaggerating your perceived

456
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,352
The weekend of July 31st

457
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
August 2nd

458
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:36,032
You took some erroneous and bogus information

459
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,616
Down police stations around the country that weekend

460
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,432
Because this is the time for all good men and women

461
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,272
So wherever you are on the country but if you're in Milwaukee

462
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,576
Austin Texas

463
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
Arizona

464
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,720
You are in Los Angeles California

465
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,024
In Miami

466
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,144
These are some of the towns

467
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,424
FIFA says

468
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
Saturday night

469
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,640
Country so you should probably take them

470
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,736
Behaviorism

471
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,808
Performance

472
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,904
Ridiculous

473
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,000
Information

474
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,912
The idea of a coordinated attack on police stations around the country is very sick

475
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,824
What kind of organizational centralization

476
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,688
It's less important whether or not

477
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,624
Coordinate attacks on police stations around the country

478
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
Because if they accept that

479
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
They have to accept the other side

480
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,232
Basically an army

481
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,816
Uncoordinated marching

482
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
Together

483
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:11,008
Backflip also highlights another important aspect of inciting violence against Target

484
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
Responsible

485
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
To do something

486
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,920
You created the feeling of impending doom

487
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
I need to act

488
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,528
Now it's being expressed that it's your responsibility

489
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
Do something

490
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:29,952
Alex is directly calling for people in those cities that do something to stand up to this

491
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
In their City

492
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,120
Stop these left-wing protesters

493
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,680
It also is a problem for Alex

494
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,520
Might not be legal

495
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:48,640
This is actually something Alex explicitly recognized

496
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
Themselves

497
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:10,656
So when we was sign responsibility

498
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
To do this thing

499
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,800
It's not that the thing you're saying you know you're suggesting is a right

500
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
Sing to do

501
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,408
It's that inaction is itself a wrong thing to do

502
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,712
There's something that must be done

503
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
Responsibility

504
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:29,856
Suggest

505
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
Really f***** up

506
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:36,768
Instant there was the July 28th episode of Alex

507
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Kill list

508
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
Protester

509
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
The best thing to do

510
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,080
Quickly as possible

511
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
Again

512
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
I'm not going to pay

513
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
Everybody likes Santa Claus

514
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
Name

515
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,600
While we're here

516
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
Some days off

517
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,928
And just think about the future

518
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,744
Do they take down your country they destroy your bank account

519
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,792
A bunch of patriot leaders

520
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
What are you going to do

521
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:16,960
Cuz you always talked about when the new world order came in and when the you ended this

522
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,008
You want to go out to shoot those two blue Elmer's

523
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,288
I don't wear blue helmets

524
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,616
They show up in black uniforms and burn down your local courthouse

525
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,408
Run your life

526
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
Maurice speaks for itself

527
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,600
Because he believes them

528
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:42,048
It's pretty outrageous

529
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,096
Restart

530
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
Possibly someone

531
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,168
To sacrifice themselves

532
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704
To take out globalist

533
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
Versed

534
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
Plan

535
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,568
About you in plan

536
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,968
What we're going to do

537
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,832
We can't just sit here

538
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,880
The leadership of the global

539
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
Stop

540
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:17,376
It's not something

541
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
Suicide attack

542
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
Takeout

543
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
Expose its Global Leadership

544
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,848
Protesters

545
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,152
He wants the audience to essentially

546
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
The same thing

547
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,200
Without having to

548
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,248
Constantly talk about killing

549
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
The average sick

550
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
Obviously can

551
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,280
Which is

552
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:50,400
In order for someone to really consider the idea

553
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,424
Supposed

554
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,240
Political

555
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
There needs to be religious significance

556
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
There needs to be some kind of

557
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:06,784
Way in which this is your fault dear listener that we're even in this situation

558
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,600
Which is something a Tilex actually does

559
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
Express

560
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
You better get

561
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
You better

562
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
Engineer

563
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:55,168
If it works and it's your fault

564
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,448
Minions or something

565
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,288
Most people are not comfortable

566
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:06,688
Generally most people are violent confrontation of verse mostly because adults realize that we don't want

567
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
Violence

568
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,296
So unless it's necessary or in response to other

569
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,088
It's wrong for us

570
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136
Even Alex recognizes this

571
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,816
He acknowledges that offensive violence is wrong

572
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:26,912
Russell redefines any violence

573
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
We've gone too far

574
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
Politically

575
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,336
Offensive

576
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
Gene

577
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
Are saying

578
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
Kill kill

579
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
Kill kill

580
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,136
Bill Gates is coming with a y

581
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,440
To kill us slowly

582
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:57,120
These things that Alex is doing he's engaging with his audience designs

583
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:05,056
Says vengeance is mine but hey you might be a

584
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,920
Violence against protesters is wrong but it's fine cuz they're actually enemy combatant

585
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:19,648
If you don't fight them your city's going to Africa

586
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,512
Therefore it's your responsibility to fight back

587
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
May not be illegal

588
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:32,704
You have to create killas to protesters and someone might have to take one for the team sacrifice themselves to take out the globalist leaders

589
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
Severe

590
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
It is

591
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:41,664
Severe because we've sinned against God so we deserve to be fighting group

592
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,944
Wanamaker

593
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,784
Which is basically the same thing as killing everyone really think about it

594
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,416
We actually deserve it

595
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,328
Application for committing violent protest

596
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,400
Position

597
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:08,800
If you're a person listening

598
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,592
Do not surprise me at all

599
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,664
Protesters in America

600
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,944
In order to save the cont

601
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,040
Operates

602
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
Violence against

603
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,112
It has to do with what happened

604
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,024
When Jared Foster the protester in Austin was shot and killed

605
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,632
In order to make it a simple self-defense situation

606
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,960
Police headquarters

607
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
Rashad

608
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
47

609
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,456
We still don't know the man's name

610
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,760
Turn himself in to police and was released

611
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
White

612
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,768
Measure

613
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:10,752
Shooting

614
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:17,152
These clips

615
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,528
The more recent

616
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,320
Part of them wants to be like

617
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
Gyros

618
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,392
And then the other part of them wants to be like

619
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,928
What we didn't have anything to do

620
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,744
That so the easier thing for him to do is trying

621
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,304
FineLine that's yeah

622
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,328
Yeah

623
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
He feels he has the optic

624
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,424
6 that are necessary because there are protests

625
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,008
Audience are scared

626
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
That he can

627
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,336
You know play the self-defense card a lot more than

628
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:51,712
In other situations with a right-wing terrorist

629
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:02,976
Like when he spent

630
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
Mute store

631
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,584
That my son was going to visit my parents

632
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
Kick their ass

633
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
Unbelievable

634
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
IMovie

635
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
These acts

636
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,456
Are celebrated and rationalized

637
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,504
In a way that

638
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,296
I refuse to believe his axle

639
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
Whether it's

640
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,928
Subconscious or conscience conscious

641
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
The pattern that he operates in

642
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:42,912
It's consistently accident and justify acts of violence against people

643
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:50,080
It doesn't feel inaccurate for me to save it to the way yet

644
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,384
If they take what you saying

645
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
And one of the reasons that I

646
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,295
Just can't accept that he doesn't know what he's

647
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,599
He's doing is because Alex is disgusting

648
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,135
Very behavior in the past

649
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:08,511
What he was talking about film saying things about

650
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
Bratz

651
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
On television

652
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,655
Alex described as essentially being stochastic terrorism

653
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,471
Mudwing on TV

654
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
Will kill this guy

655
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
The CIA will

656
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Kill this guy

657
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,335
Government

658
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
Kill this guy

659
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,407
That was done

660
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687
Telegraph

661
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,015
Confidence to their

662
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
Works

663
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
Embedded in the government

664
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
People

665
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,975
Create false whistleblower report

666
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,767
The leaked information to Media

667
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Finally

668
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
Somebody else the muster up

669
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,655
The president

670
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
Kill the president

671
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
I hope somebody else does

672
00:42:55,615 --> 00:43:01,503
From that Cliff we know beyond a shadow of a doubt

673
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
To do something

674
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,487
Then the field mode was doing that

675
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,327
But what's the accusation

676
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,655
If you're aware of this tendency or this

677
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,703
Strategy someone could use

678
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,263
Greater responsibility for your actions

679
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
I want to do a

680
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,127
Excuse

681
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:32,223
If he's aware that someone saying things like

682
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:40,159
The other responsibilities messages in more careful and safe

683
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,951
If you refuses to do so

684
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:48,351
Strongly implies to me that the ultimate result of violence against

685
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,887
The desired outcome for him

686
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:54,239
Either that or despite

687
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,823
How to literally incapable of stopping yourself

688
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,359
That would make that more like

689
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
If that's the case

690
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:07,039
He's just as condemned for not removing himself from the airway

691
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:13,695
None of this is to say that the shooter in Kenosha definitely listen to Alex's show and was inspired

692
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,999
I don't know that

693
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,279
Might not be the case

694
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,303
It might be the case

695
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
I've no idea

696
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
I can't prove it either way

697
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
But

698
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,423
I'm not positive it's even the most

699
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,191
Important point

700
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:29,055
Alex is part of a media ecosystem that operates in the same way he does

701
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,639
Some independent qanon weirdos incites violence

702
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
More than him

703
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
2

704
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:39,039
Some giant names like chocolate Carlson engage in slightly stealthier incitement

705
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,111
Define Act of terrorism

706
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:49,023
That's said I'm not sure if there's anyone who's been Alex who's as explicit

707
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,303
Terrorism tendencies

708
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,119
Whether or not the shooter was a fan of Alex

709
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,679
What happened to Kenosha is exactly the effect

710
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,471
Expect to see from the way Alex

711
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
Behaves

712
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
And I'd be very surprised

713
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
If we don't

714
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,079
Oxymoron

715
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,639
I see it as a possibility

716
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,711
I don't know I'm sorry

717
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,503
I'm sorry about that

718
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,575
Apologize

719
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,183
I have a dick

720
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,559
The apology was that you had to sit there

721
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,119
I could have gone to the bathroom

722
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,191
What about employment Optical sight

723
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,751
I really

724
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,591
Had to sit with this for quite a while

725
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
To really

726
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Figure out

727
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
It's all there

728
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,527
Talk around

729
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063
Alex

730
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
So much of this was about like Alex

731
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:51,743
Posted this article about the militia in Kenosha and like

732
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
Yeah

733
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,583
He reposted someone else's article

734
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,423
There's a chance that article. Repost

735
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,751
I don't know

736
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,055
This is probably

737
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
Not exist

738
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,479
Had no idea

739
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,247
No

740
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,575
It's really hard to trace a direct

741
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,415
Between anything and I think some people are trying to

742
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,487
Yeah I see some Twitter account

743
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,535
Trying to make that argument

744
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,863
Are you understand I get it

745
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
I understand why

746
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,423
I just think

747
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,007
I know I know it's all this

748
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:39,871
Yes this is what I look at all the time

749
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
I just think of it

750
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,967
Mi 4

751
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,759
More of a

752
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
It doesn't matter

753
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
If Alex had any

754
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,623
Legitimate Direct

755
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,183
Connection with this individual executor

756
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,207
Looking

757
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
He's doing

758
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
Is

759
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:02,911
Behavior predicates something like this

760
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,703
I am struggling

761
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Is

762
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
Just the massive

763
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:11,359
Forest for the trees situation that we're dealing with here which is that

764
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,175
I don't care if it was Alex

765
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455

Posted

767
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,783
Suggested everybody go to

768
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,087
What is what we're in

769
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
Is

770
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,695
Media system

771
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,743
Popularize and propagate

772
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,559
I created an entirely false reality

773
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,095
40%

774
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,887
So whether or not

775
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,423
Alex

776
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,543
F****** zerohedge or its

777
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,335
They're all part of this thing

778
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:46,175
That is cultivating fear and using it to create chaos

779
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,247
And that chaos is going to make the order of fascism

780
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,783
Seymour

781
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
News 8

782
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,463
All of these people

783
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:05,631
Social media influencer

784
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:11,519
It's a little bit like a

785
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,055
Childhood develop

786
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,359
It's like the parents

787
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
Impact

788
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:24,575
Bill Peters do the media like Fox News and that stuff is a lot of it

789
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,415
And what's more effective is going to be those Twitter campaigns those

790
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,439
Those Facebook

791
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:36,607
The names and all that it's really easy to internalize information

792
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,423
From social media without checking any of it

793
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,727
Completely distort your understanding

794
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,775
I don't know

795
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,591
I don't have a solution

796
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,711
Kill who's killed more cops in the past 10 years

797
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
How is it that

798
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,415
Cops themselves

799
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
So

800
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:16,287
This time span from the day after Jacob Lake shooting

801
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:23,199
The day after when Alex is

802
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,479
Knows about

803
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,271
The shooting of the protesters

804
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,087
Cuz I was interested to see

805
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,647
If there was

806
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,975
A compelling argument to be made

807
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,767
His work

808
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,351
Over those days that he was doing something

809
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,143
Insights

810
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:48,799

811
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:52,127
Post-modernism

812
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,759
He posted this article

813
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,063
He said a couple of things

814
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,415
We'll see what the

815
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:08,511
Conclusion we come to is

816
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:13,375
I think kind of fundamental misunderstanding of Alex's

817
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,167
Ideas here

818
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
He doesn't

819
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,751
Care if one person goes to

820
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,567
The whole idea is a shotgun approach

821
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,639
Every protest should have one of those people who

822
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:30,015
He doesn't care about Kenosha or know wherever

823
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:35,135
I'm trying to inspire somebody somewhere

824
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,487
But based on the fact

825
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,583
Brakes of

826
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,143
Being sort of a moth to the flame

827
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:50,239
Attracted attention

828
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,943
Is that at

829
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
Does not come up

830
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:05,599
It doesn't the water of waters is out

831
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,903
Restart to on August 24th

832
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:14,303
Red Alert Red Alert Red Alert 70 days after me Alexa

833
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,119

834
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,727
Has launched even more intense

Policeman shot at

836
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,127
Car dealerships

Black lives matter sign

Porch

839
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,503
This is the globalist

840
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,039
Program of total Destruction

841
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,343
The people are waiting up for the truth

842
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:42,719
So I buy starting a show with a red alert

843
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,255
That sounds right

844
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:49,119
Obviously Alex has no idea

845
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,167
Open this episode.

846
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,471
Is where protest

847
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,799
He further doesn't seem to be

848
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
The protest

849
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,895
Instance of convenience cigarettes on his part

850
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:05,247
What's interesting is how I take a picture of complete

851
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,575
I'm using it for his purposes when in reality

852
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,415
To decide how it should be used

853
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:19,071
If you punch me in the face and I immediately forgive you and we're able to grow who that experience

854
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,119
No third-party really has the right

855
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,911
To use you hitting me for their own app

856
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,983
You hit me

857
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:31,103
Experience

858
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
To get past it

859
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
McGee Florida

860
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,455
Is it someone might think about you

861
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,479
You would think

862
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,063
Is car dealership

863
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,623
Was Bernadette that's fair enough

864
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:51,327
Abc12 in Wisconsin reported that virus cause damage

865
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:59,519
I can't blame people for being angry

866
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,823
We have some damaged windows will be okay

867
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,383
As for the actual car dealership

868
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,455
The owners of that might not have been too worried about the

869
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:14,367
According to a tweet posted by BBC he spoke to the owner

870
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,791
But if it actually gets justice of Sherburne 20 times

871
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,351
I can't find

872
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:29,727
Professional journalists reporting firsthand conversation

873
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,775
Set a really wild things

874
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,591
Embellish

875
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,407
It seems like that kind of misreporting

876
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,319
Yeah that would be

877
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,559
Collect

878
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:01,471
I would prefer Justice they're like

879
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:08,127
This mentality

880
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:13,247
Personally

881
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:17,855
Victims

882
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:21,951
More important than money or things

883
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,047
Finger bikes with stupid particular

884
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:29,119
Car dealership

885
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:29,887
August 24th

886
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,935
Reporting Center in the media's coverage

887
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,471
Tester broken out

888
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,543
Images of the cars burning with the central Focus

889
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,847
To drive up to the rampaging mob

890
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:43,967
So kind of makes sense if that's the centerpiece of the coverage it's relevant

891
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,783
Social unrest

892
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
Ben is easy to report

893
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:54,719
Yeah I don't think people emotionally aggravated by a picture

894
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
Of the burnt-out

895
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,535
Car dealership

896
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,351
With the owner standing in front of it given to big thumbs up like

897
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,215
The owner burned-out building says

898
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:14,175
Also this is a small point but this car dealership

899
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,199
Announces audience

900
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:21,855
It shows that these people are just out to destroy cars

901
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:28,511
Pictures of the fire that were posted on

902
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
If you look at

903
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,119
Dealership sign

904
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:37,471
It's a marquee for the Bradford Community Unitarian Universalist Church which isn't

905
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,239
Nextdoor

906
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:44,383
Whether or not a business had a sign on it bring this up to highlight that Alex

907
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,407
Doesn't do any work

908
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,175
Because

909
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,711
Even care

910
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
No one cares

911
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,015
It's hard to care

912
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,575
And it's easier to live in

913
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,855
Dystopia

914
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:58,463
So for the first six minutes of every hour generally a special

915
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,791
Corey doesn't do that cuz it's not on most radio station

916
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:06,911
Traffic

917
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,471
I usually skip

918
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:13,567
Skip pasta cuz it's usually someone of the terrible voice over

919
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,127
I stuck around

920
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
Stussy

921
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,063
Who are well on their way

922
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,135
Contingent

923
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:31,999
Larger

924
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
Throwing a

925
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,375
I never want to go back

926
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,935
I'm telling you what I will destroy this country

927
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,055
A million people like me

928
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:59,391
Hours of August

929
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,951

930
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,743
Come down

931
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,767
Protesters in Kenosha

932
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,815
In that report

933
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,631

938
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,895
Jessie is about to supporting

939
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,319
He was pissed about covid-19 restrictions

940
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:36,767
Here's a little section of his weird phone notification sound effect

941
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,791
But I wanted to point it out

942
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
Is the little

943
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,607
And I'm telling you right now

944
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,631
That right now would be

945
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,679
And you better be happy

946
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,519
Southern people

947

948
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,127
Goodfellas

949
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,919
Real concern

950
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,503
And nobody else is going

951
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,551
Apply the only person that has

952
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,135
Building

953
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,743
But you won't stop

954
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,143
My boy I hope you open your year

955
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Actually listen

956
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,215
This is a warning

957
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
What's coming

958
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,287
It's going to be people with smaller

959
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,567
It's going to be raw honey

960
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,847
Sunday speeches Saturday

961
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,407
30 Whelen

962
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175
Flags

963
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
It's a real

964
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,503
When you see the things that I see

965
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
I went to war for

966
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,063
I've seen

967
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,111
Ugliest dirtiest partyman

968
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:35,903
I've been in combat

969
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,439
I never want to go back

970
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,487
But I'm telling you what I will say

971
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,791
It has to be gas or Oil City

972
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
It will happen

973
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,863
Million people like

974
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:52,799
Unhinged

975
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,895
Combat

976
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:00,223
I've seen the ugliest of humanity and I was like

977
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,783
Phuc yea

978
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,111
Terrifying when you look at it

979
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,415
First

980
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,047
How to show on August 19th

981
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,167
Just faded into the background noise

982
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,263
Beginning

983
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:32,223
And honestly it's become hard for me to tell when something has me sounding like a broken record

984
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:37,855
Walking up bring up things that I talked about a ton unless there is an evolutionary shift in the narrative

985
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,391
To be fair

986
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:44,767
19th

987
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:49,887
Hey there everybody listen to The Show Must like read the news about Alex

988
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:50,655
Guys

989
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:58,079
He has been screaming about how we should be good killing everybody every single day for four months what do you do

990
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:05,247
He posted an article on Friday we've been doing this for years now

991
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,319
Protesters

992
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:14,719
In a very close proximity to Alex postic an article that endorse has this militia that was there

993
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,255
That is

994
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,559
That's not good

995
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:22,399
With this video of

996
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:25,471
Meeting

997
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,031
Completely misrepresents the bottles words

998
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:33,919
This Ranch at the supervisors meeting at nothing

999
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,479
You specifically

1000
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,759
Because of covid-19

1001
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,575
What he says that his fellow citizens

1002
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,623
That was a threat about

1003
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
County didn't reopen

1004
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,231
Businesses

1005
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,047
Recognized

1006
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,375
Threatening

1007
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:57,215
Those really good for the optic surrounding police brutality protest

1008
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,775
So we took his comments and apply them to

1009
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,055
Different situation

1010
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
Jordan

1011
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,895
Good reporting

1012
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:07,455
Dan

1013
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,223
There we go

1014
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,063
It's so insane

1015
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:16,415
But that's what I'm talking about

1016
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:18,719
System has created reality

1017
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,511
This guy is

1018
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:27,935
I paid the government that I support that I love so much as absolutely destroyed the economy in every possible way

1019
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,871
As they're pulling people off the streets and

1020
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:41,247
And do you know who I'm mad at

1021
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:46,367
You know like that's a must being say You must drive yourself mad

1022
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:50,463
You know you have to losing

1023
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,023
Like trying to control

1024
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,583
Cognitive dissonance experiencing

1025
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,007
You think you would

1026
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,287
Maybe not

1027
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:10,175
Comfortability

1028
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,711
Eventually

1029
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,783
Just like I didn't stay too long

1030
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,391
Alex spends a lot of the beginning of this show really just

1031
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,159
Painting app

1032
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,183
Dystopian

1033
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:21,951
Picture

1034
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:25,535
Of what looks like in the ground around Wisconsin

1035
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,559
Wisconsin

1036
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,119
Where

1037
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
Again scene

1038
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,055
Third world collapse or Civil War

1039
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,591
World Warrior isn't even

1040
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:39,871
Strong enough

1041
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,151
Describe it

1042
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,431
Police getting shot at

1043
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,271
Police being stopped by black lives matter, too checkpoints

1044
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:47,807
Warehouses

1045
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,391
Churches burned down

1046
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,719
Treatment

1047
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,511
In the back of the head with

1048
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,303
Brick

1049
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,607
Total loss

1050
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
How to control

1051
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,935
American flags being

1052
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:05,983
Watch

1053
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,519
Rolling guillotine

1054
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,103
French Revolution 2.0

1055
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:16,735
Alright Supply

1056
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,135
What's

1057
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,415
Head of the flag

1058
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,719
Probably the Stars

1059
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:35,935
Discusses

1060
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,751
Apparently the video of

1061
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,055
Long-haired hippie

1062
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,359
Running up with his assault rifle

1063
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,895
Menacing and

1064
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,431
Ordering the police

1065
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:51,551
And the police are so paralyzed and they do anything that they'll all be given the death

1066
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,647
Ideal right there is huge

1067
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:59,999
Because it's a central theme justification for the shooting

1068
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:06,655
Police refuse to restore justice of course I'm 17 year old from another state that Justice

1069
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
Authorities

1070
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,359
Charge of the sea

1071
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,247
Refuse

1072
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,159
Accelerate

1073
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,183
To murder

1074
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,743
17 year old

1075
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,279
Decided

1076
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,959
Tucker's words

1077
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
The five

1078
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,943
The shooter did

1079
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,343
Either he should

1080
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,671
To take these protesters out and stop being so afraid of getting in trouble

1081
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:05,023
Or he's saying that the system is setup is such that the police

1082
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:10,143
His audience understand what you say

1083
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,191
Yeah I'm trying really hard

1084
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:18,079
Very hard to remain called that needs cream because I'm

1085
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,103
VyStar

1086
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,919
It's just not going to stop intro

1087
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:30,111
Launch really just the way it's slowing me down

1088
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:34,975
Receptively

1089
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:39,583
We didn't actually cancel Friday's episode because you were too busy yelling

1090
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,887
Very very

1091
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,639
The process things in different ways

1092
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,175
Memes

1093
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,015
Meddling with plants

1094
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:09,535
So Alex these these these demonstrations on the street is property damage and

1095
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:16,191
Realizes that hey I remember project Veritas videos mentioned that

1096
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:20,287
Amber what the Democrats videos

1097
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,055
A year ago

1098
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,919
Burn the cities ahead of the election

1099
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,967
Election

1100
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:32,319
Alex has project Veritas videos straight

1101
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:36,415
He's referring to his original use by veritas

1102
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:41,023
If Bernie doesn't win

1103
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,399
I guess I could go for that

1104
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:51,263
It's a bit of a stretch to just rewrite this piece of propaganda

1105
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:03,807
Players in these narratives because he knows they don't mean anything

1106
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,855
Truth to preserve in what

1107
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:09,695
Veritas

1108
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:15,583
Alex that if someone is stupid enough

1109
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,911
Project Veritas videos

1110
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:25,311
Probably stupid enough to believe that the Bernie Sanders Democratic Party

1111
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:35,551
Organizations behind each other to make sure that if no cost would anything good happen to him

1112
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:42,463
Episode

1113
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:47,327
A car dealership

1114
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,399
It's got a boring so trying to find

1115
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,191
Some points for things could

1116
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,727
Get tired of interesting

1117
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,751
Nothing to talk about

1118
01:07:55,263 --> 01:08:00,383
Just listen to it

1119
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,479
The criminals have censured

1120
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,295
Everything USA at all

1121
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:12,415
Has killed millions of 1.4 million died

1122
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,695
Just last year

1123
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,255
TBH

1124
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,791
Block people stopping

1125
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:24,447
1.4 billion people did not die last year for million people

1126
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,727
TBH

1127
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:38,527
Were the Rus bowl like what is it happened the biggest story

1128
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:45,439
Probably way bigger than covid-19 10TV

1129
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:53,119
Approximately

1130
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:53,887
States

1131
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:59,775
Numbers

1132
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:03,359
84304 people got

1133
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:08,991
What's going on is it Alex's actually fairly close to the accurate number of how many people died in the end

1134
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,015
Tire world

1135
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,807
From tuberculosis last year

1136
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:14,879
Almost all cases are in Africa and Southeast Asia

1137
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,207
3 particularly high in developing countries were ax

1138
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:22,559
Vista Medical Care maybe properly

1139
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,095
Which leads to many of the Dead

1140
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:27,679
There is a vaccine that can be given but its efficacy

1141
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:32,799
Princeton's people living with HIV cannot use it

1142
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,591
Create a lifelong immunity

1143
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,639
Still progress

1144
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:42,783
Alex wants to use the statistic of 1.4 million people dying of teach

1145
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,831
You lying and saying it's

1146
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:49,951
Just coming in and infect everyone

1147
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:56,863
That's essentially nazi-style propaganda

1148
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,447
Statistic as Ally

1149
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,495
Somebody saying

1150
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,055
Immigrants and foreigners

1151
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:11,711
Bringing in disease is some sort of Nazi

1152
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:17,855
Next thing you know he'll be saying that his enemies

1153
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:22,719
Statistic is there a lot of people

1154
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:25,023
MTV and there's a lot of things so we can do

1155
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,303
If we prioritize the proper

1156
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:31,935
Creating cheaper high-quality tests particularly ones that can be used on infants

1157
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,703
You differ

1158
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:38,591
And that's something that the government could easily help subsidize regulations on the test manufacturers

1159
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,359
Prices down

1160
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:46,015
More money could be directed to research and breakthroughs in a better TV vaccines

1161
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,063
Or less complicated drug regimen

1162
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:58,047
How to care about the 1 million people dying

1163
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,839
He only wants to use that number as a prop

1164
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,631
The demonizes imaginary enemies

1165
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
He's a piece of s***

1166
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,191
Yeah yeah

1167
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,007
It's the only thing

1168
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,543
Everything is wrong

1169
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,335
We have no solution

1170
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:16,735
You should kill people that's Solutions

1171
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,807
Make some difference

1172
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,111
Tell me a joke

1173
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:25,439
We are actively tried to kill all of this solution

1174
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,975
With God

1175
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,071
So Alex possessed with the idea of

1176
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:38,239
Better

1177
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:44,639
Noticing there's a lot of videos of people trying to run over protesters

1178
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:51,039
Is just trying to get out of Kik

1179
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:03,071
Alex has an interesting way of looking

1180
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,863
This made me laugh out loud

1181
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,167
I'm driving down the road

1182
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,727
Forest fires

1183
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,519
Police.

1184
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,359
They're looking at

1185
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,151
I'm going to

1186
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,687
Compliant

1187
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,759
Checkpoint

1188
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,343
Well you're not going to like what

1189
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,367
Your

1190
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:39,167
But respectful

1191
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:44,031
Hey man if I saw some cops do their job

1192
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:48,383
Because I know Alex's career

1193
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:53,247
In 1999 recalled police state 2000

1194
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:58,623
In approximately 15 of the first 25 minutes of it is Alex gay

1195
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:04,511
Here's some fun clips of Alex really respecting these cops were trying to do their job

1196
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,119
Exposed

1197
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
Hopefully

1198
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:10,911
React

1199
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,191
Their conscience

1200
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:16,287
We are entering the eye of the check

1201
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,407
Is it that loving children

1202
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,823
Actually kind of hurts

1203
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,127
I'm kind of a random

1204
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:52,895
Capricious

1205
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,943
Calling them Nazis

1206
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:26,431
Pretty sad now it's his career before 9/11

1207
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,255
Did he tell me

1208
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,535
If I'm driving

1209
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,351
And there's a forest fire in front of me and I see some

1210
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:47,423
Set this checkpoint

1211
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:51,263
If they're stopped checkpoint

1212
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:57,919
Running a fire

1213
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:08,927
That is a possible interpretation of what he said yes that is one reason of it

1214
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:15,839
Cops beating of that

1215
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,119
Top surgery

1216
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:23,519
Checkpoints for your safety

1217
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:27,871
In the middle of a city

1218
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,527
Even take a step further backed up

1219
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,807
Amatis there

1220
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,831
Why

1221
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:42,719
Do they have this checkpoint at a forest fire where the cops at the continent

1222
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:51,679
Are slaves in California

1223
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
Deschutes

1224
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,239
The fire I don't know how to deal with that

1225
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,775
I guess plan options

1226
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,055
So are we back

1227
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,895
Stuff Yer and Alex's

1228
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,503
Tom Soros terrorist

1229
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,855
Ordering the police.

1230
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,415
And the policeman told by their leftist controllers

1231
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,951
Supervisors

1232
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,535
The Methodist so here's the fun

1233
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:21,375
Here you see Alex heightening and

1234
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,911
These are powerless to stop

1235
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:27,007
What's happening in Kenosha

1236
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,783
Include group

1237
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:43,391
Documentation of things like

1238
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:51,327
There's a video of the police in Kenosha

1239
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,351
Protesters

1240
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,679
It goes along with the argument

1241
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,775
Situation

1242
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:04,383
Even

1243
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:11,039
That means it's open season for vigilantism

1244
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:14,879
I recognize and realize that some people

1245
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:20,511
Prince between one side saying

1246
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,047
And the other side saying

1247
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,119
The police and the state or not

1248
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:25,887
Protesting

1249
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,679
The property probably going to get damaged

1250
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,447
So

1251
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:30,751
He his name

1252
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,311
Problem with t

1253
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,591
Gentleman Square

1254
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,407
Was that the guy wouldn't get out of the way

1255
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:41,503
You know

1256
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:45,343
Pocopson

1257
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:52,767
California China didn't have a leftist government run the real problem was that the cops

1258
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,559
Didn't

1259
01:17:54,815 --> 01:18:00,959
You know they'll let it get to that point the cops were powerless

1260
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
We're doing great

1261
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:14,015
I'll take some calls on this episode

1262
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,039
Kind of fun

1263
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,087
I don't know if

1264
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,671
I was desperate

1265
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,439
Looking for anything

1266
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,767
He's talkin this caller

1267
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:28,863
Trying to make an anti-vax argument

1268
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:32,191
Love it and it's really this this

1269
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:36,543
This is really interesting to me but this is also in that state where I was like

1270
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,311
I might

1271
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,847
Complete

1272
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,407
Anybody

1273
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:45,247
Discusses the Nuremberg code

1274
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:48,831
The precursor

1275
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:51,903
Convention

1276
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,975
Convention

1277
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,023
You cannot test

1278
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,303
Is on people

1279
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,327
How much you have in for

1280
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,887
Because of what Joseph

1281
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:02,911
Angela

1282
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:03,935
And the Nazis

1283
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,519
So what you're saying is incredibly important

1284
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:11,359
This is in response to like I said to call a rambling but

1285
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,919
Because the Nuremberg code says he can't force

1286
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,199
Experimental things on TV

1287
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:21,087
Nonsense for 100 reasons

1288
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:27,743
Should definitely be opposed to the Geneva Convention

1289
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:33,631
First National

1290
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:35,679
18/64

1291
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:40,287
Before the Nuremberg trials

1292
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:45,407
Invention that took place in 1949 after World War II

1293
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,759
He should hate them

1294
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,319
Geneva rules are based on

1295
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,903
To Any Nation sovereignty

1296
01:19:56,415 --> 01:20:01,791
The rules to including the provision of taking hostages

1297
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,327
Help

1298
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:11,263
Forcing people into armed services tonight

1299
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:15,104
And they're bound to these rules by international law

1300
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,688
That's globalism s*** that's pretty much what Muslim

1301
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:25,088
And you should absolutely hated because he's cheering for the cops to violate those same Geneva

1302
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,136
Interesting

1303
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:33,536
Enforceable universally which is to say it doesn't matter where the crime was committed

1304
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:38,144
And you know it

1305
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,472
Where are the crimes committed

1306
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:49,408
You got any knighted states Security Council

1307
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:52,736
The UN Security Council

1308
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,296
International criminal Tribunal

1309
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,392
I recognized

1310
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,464
Ineffective

1311
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,536
Define discussion for another day

1312
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:11,936
My only interest right now is this

1313
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:17,824
Based on his fetish for nationalism

1314
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,616
Each nation's responsibility

1315
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,896
Tether

1316
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,224
You can be a dance

1317
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,760
Countries taking hostages

1318
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:28,832
Torture dance

1319
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,648
Absolutely 100%

1320
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,184
If he's serious about his beliefs

1321
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,720
While we're at it

1322
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:37,024
You should be super upset about the nerve

1323
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,816
Just got here

1324
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:46,752
Local government keeps him awake but for some reason

1325
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:53,152
Well I guess I'm glad

1326
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,432
Support the Geneva Convention

1327
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:02,368
But I'm still not going to give

1328
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:06,464
To make is it Alex Jones is not a serious person

1329
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:12,608
Don't know what is allegedly because he hasn't actually sat down and bought them out

1330
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:19,264
He perfectly happy to yell but nationalism all day when it's a mask that you can use to hide his white identity police and opposition

1331
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,288
The social justice

1332
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,568
Weirdly

1333
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,128
Nationalism

1334
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,176
Obviously unpopular

1335
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:30,016
Like opposing the international

1336
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:32,064
Nationalism

1337
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
Book

1338
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,648
Ignorant piece of s***

1339
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:41,792
It's just it's just a socialism is wrong

1340
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:46,656
Fixed-income Social Security taken care of

1341
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,960
Just shut up

1342
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:55,360
Spell cloud

1343
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,920
You realize that like

1344
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,456
Alex

1345
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,992
Just some

1346
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:04,832
Dumb f***

1347
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,368
All of that

1348
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,416
F****** freaked out on weird

1349
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:11,232
Conspiracies for a while and now you yell about the devil

1350
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:17,120
You didn't know what your beliefs entail if he was up here talking about how I get

1351
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
Good

1352
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,104
And given a trial in Germany

1353
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:30,944
They committed crimes in Germany in the German government

1354
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,040
He doesn't do that because he knows how f******

1355
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
It's not

1356
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,696
There's two things

1357
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,792
They're all held

1358
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:48,608
To this weird subconscious standard

1359
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,632
Progress

1360
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,656
Becomes accepted

1361
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,216
Like

1362
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:58,848
Jeff sessions

1363
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,640
I mean his ideology is

1364
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:08,320
Do you know what I mean I mean

1365
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:12,928
Doesn't matter if they're not trying to make you

1366
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,232
They're just trying to make you

1367
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:19,328
It doesn't matter if what you're afraid of is really doesn't matter of

1368
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:22,144
Carlson is actually telling you the truth about how

1369
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,936
F****** kenosha's on

1370
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,240
Flame is that you think it is it's

1371
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:32,640
Is what's going to lead to situations where some assholes

1372
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:41,600
The time

1373
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,416
At the same time

1374
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,952
Specifically

1375
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,488
What I'm complaining about

1376
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,352
Is that Alex has ended because it makes sense

1377
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,656
It makes more sense

1378
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:58,240
Next clip

1379
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,776
No doctors

1380
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,592
Lowest

1381
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,872
Span

1382
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,152
Sure why not

1383
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,320
Doctors live less Long Live

1384
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,344
Then combat

1385
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:17,440
So you can find an article in the Scientific American from

1386
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:21,792
1850s that refutes Alex's claims and you can find a stud

1387
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,816
National

1388
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,584
6 in the UK

1389
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,376
Definitely also contradict

Top of most

1392
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:35,872
Some of the reasons are usually offered to explain this

1393
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:40,736
Because of their profession

1394
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:43,040
Live jobs

1395
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:47,136
Physical activity walking

1396
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:49,952
Tyra not to be discount

1397
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:56,096
The job satisfaction and position within Society

1398
01:25:56,608 --> 01:26:00,192
Almost everything I can find on the subject

1399
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:02,496
Feels like Transportation where you might get exposed

1400
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,056
Bachelor life

01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,160
Let's fucken hope so

1405
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:26,304
Action cycle

1406
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:33,216
Bob Marshall who's running through the primary

1407
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:35,776
Virginia Senate seats

1408
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,824
He's also a huge, so

1409
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:43,200
Boston House of delegates

1410
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,224
It's in Virginia

1411
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,064
The game

1412
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,600
Tracey Thorn beglin

1413
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:51,904
District judge

1414
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,952
Marvel Justified is opposition

1415
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:59,584
You could preside as a district judge for a marriage of two guys if you wanted to

1416
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,120
In violation of the law

1417
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:07,776
Moreover if you have a barroom fight between homosexual and heterosexual

1418
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:09,568
Wow

1419
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:15,712
His actions Marshall pointed to a 1997 study

1420
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:21,856
Decrease life expectancy between 8 and bisexual

1421
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:28,256
From 1987 to 1992

1422
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:31,584
Study of come out and said that these numbers are no longer relevant

1423
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,400
And they really like the HIV aids crisis

1424
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:42,592
Is still an issue but it's not nearly as bad

1425
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,360
Southpoint

1426
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:44,640
For some context

1427
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:48,480
The CDC reported 36.3 deaths per 100,000 people

1428
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,856
Compared to 2.7

1429
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,136
For 100,000

1430
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,160
In 2010

1431
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:00,768
How do you make improvements on understanding

1432
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:03,328
These will become even smaller

1433
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:09,984
There's a sharp decrease in hiv-aids which was the main driver of increased life expectancy in the gay bisexual

1434
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:13,056
1997 study by Bob Marshall

1435
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,848
The Defense Force out right now

1436
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:18,944
Jumpy got heat from the Press about it and he stood his ground

1437
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:25,088
Members of the right-wing

1438
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:25,856
All you got to do

1439
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,720
Confirm

1440
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:33,024
Is a district judge

1441
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,304
Dumb dumb

1442
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,584
Bob Marshall

Strickland reality

1445
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,848
Or some picketed right-wing talking points

1446
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:49,152
Kind of remembers hearing at some point

1447
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,432
Nothing means anything

1448
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,624
Single-sex

1449
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:02,976

1452
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,400

01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,424
Alex

1454
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,448

20 ft 4

1458
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,200
And I wear this

1459
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,760
Sleeping around

1460
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,160
It's really great and awesome

1461
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:35,744
In unrelated news ABC reported on Friday that at least

1462
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,400

Speech in Jacksonville Florida but actually had to cancel that

1464

Actually I lied

1465
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:55,456
Originally planned

1466
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,248
According to an MP

I can't put this more simple

1477
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,280
Just just

1478
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:44,608
I don't want anybody died but you need to be in the hospital with the right

1479
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:51,008
Time do you know what I mean like let's get him in the hospital when they

Do anything about it

1481

It's in the middle of a pandemic

1486
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,856
I felt

1487
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,648
Really intensely embarrassed

1488
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,840
When Bush was president

01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:58,752
Total

1516
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,520
Lawless

1517
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:06,432
Is it going to rain

1518
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:08,736
The fam is now that he is

1519
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,528
He got some of the videos

1520
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,552
They've been circulating

1521
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
And it's

1522
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,440
It's obvious

1523
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,464
Is marxist

1524
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,256
Agendas are now beginning to

1525
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:23,328
In our real-world

1526
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,864
When I showed up last night

1527
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,984
Garbage truck

1528
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:30,752
Just lined up

1529
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,032
Fire

1530
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,824
And then out of nowhere there's this

1531
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,616
Police Squad Show

1532
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,200
Matter militant

1533
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:39,968
Sarms

1534
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,600
Police officers

1535
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,624
Leasing

1536
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,440
Shadow

1537
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:51,488
Policing the streets

1538
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:58,144
Worried about the hour 40 mark of the program

1539
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:04,032
I realize that Alex hasn't even mentioned

1540
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:10,944
Plenty of discussion WBLS

1541
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,480
You were listening to this

1542
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,088
Test

1543
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:21,952
Is episodes from August 24th

1544
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,232
Jacob

1545
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,512
Who shot in the back

1546
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:28,608
Multiple times by Kenosha police officer while the children were in the car

1547
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:34,240
Thankfully Blake survived but according to his father he's paralyzed below the waist and it's unclear if he'll ever walk

1548
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,008
Again

1549
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:41,664
I'm not really interested in litigating the arguments about whether or not Blake has a great person or whether or not it matters if someone has a knife

1550
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:47,552
To justify this justify the police officer

1551
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,832
They're shooting someone like that

1552
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,928
There's a reason that people were protesting and some

1553
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:53,696
Which broke out

1554
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:57,280
Another on our black man

1555
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,888
The officer was shot

1556
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,936
Put on administrative leave later

1557
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:07,776
But it's clear the people weren't accepting that is an appropriate response

1558
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:10,336
Cop fired seven bullets

1559
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:13,664
Set this guy there's no reason to think that that wasn't something

1560
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:15,712
Or at least

1561
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:19,040
Incredibly negligee

1562
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,064
Denton in weapons

1563
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:25,952
Whether this was a cop trying to kill person or copies in Compton enough to shoot a person like this

1564
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:29,024
That's not someone you really want on the streets with a gun and a badge

1565
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:35,936
Kenosha's not my city so I have no right to say or should not demand their officials and enforcement

1566
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:39,776
I don't think I'd be satisfied with administrative leave as a response

1567
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:40,544
I think you could

1568
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:45,920
Probably go by the Geneva conventions and do a better job then

1569
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:50,016
Hasn't talked about that at all

1570
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:52,320
I just surprised it seems like it would

1571
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:54,112
No that's a big piece of context

1572
01:35:54,368 --> 01:36:00,512
Kind of pretending to protest it's probably a

1573
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:06,400
Flashmob organic response

1574
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:09,728
Straight up

1575
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:12,544
Sucks I believe the matter is a y

1576
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:13,824
I seen a black

1577
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:22,784
Cohoes the YouTube show called lives matter

1578
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,624
Basically ologist videos

1579
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:33,792
I just had a visceral right there videos just look like clickbait ass titles

1580
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:36,864
Are basically just be anti left-wing content your

1581
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,448
Everything it seems Progressive

1582
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:49,664
Supervisor program

1583
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:51,968
And to pull down webcast

1584
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:56,832
These guys are real s*** head makes me sad

1585
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:03,488
He posted a video from Breitbart

1586
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:11,168
You can hear the remind me

1587
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:18,848
What's the date

1588
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:24,480
Is August 30th so that

1589
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:31,136
Run away from accepted

1590
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:35,488
But I heard a rumor that situation

1591
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,792
People demanding

1592
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:42,912
I'm scared

1593
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,936
For his life

1594
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,616
Videos for

1595
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:01,344
There's a video purporting to be people trying to torture house and it's just a firework

1596
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,648
Number videos that are supposedly

1597
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:07,744
Violence in the streets that are just fireworks like this

1598
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,768
Yeah it's

1599
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:12,864
It's hard not to shake with rage whenever you see

1600
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,168
Twin

1601
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,216
Nightmares of the far-right

1602
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:18,752
Them

1603
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,544
Being the out-and-out

1604
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,568
Aggressors

1605
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,896
Nightmarish fascists with their boots

1606
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:26,688
On everybody's f****** throat

1607
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,736
And at the same time

1608
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:35,136
Them being afraid for their lives they're terrified they're the victims of his awesome

1609
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:38,720
Illinois

1610
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:45,120
Trailer for Dinesh D'Souza

1611
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:47,936
Dinesh D'Souza redpilled me in 2016

1612
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:52,544
2020 is now your turn

1613
01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:01,504
Even for you

1614
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:04,832
On the lighter side

1615
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:07,392
From the night of August 20th

1616
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:11,232
He's either in Minneapolis Minnesota

1617
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,792
Flights from

1618
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,584
Correction Wisconsin

1619
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,680
Annapolis

1620
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:23,520
Minnesota

1621
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,824
Amazing level of incompetence

1622
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,848
Completely accept

1623
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,896
Goodbye right-wing propaganda

1624
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:34,272
Celebrating ionized

1625
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:36,832
Tucker

1626
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,608
Yeah that's a good

1627
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:55,008
You're going to get what you want and if you don't ask questions

1628
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:04,480
Bring me stop my research into

1629
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:11,648
I know people I've decided to play the game where they take people were shot and going to something that they may have done in the past makes him somehow.

1630
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,696
Deserve

1631
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:20,096
Doodle on the other hand is a sociopathic monster

1632
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:25,216
August 27th

1633
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:31,104
Rosenbaum was arguing with someone

1634
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:36,736
Technically mr. Rosenbaum gave consent to be shot by militia

1635
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:38,528
Cool

1636
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:46,720
I understand about the shooting of

1637
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:48,768
Wildlife Refuge standoff

1638
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:51,328
I bet we mentioned that he kept yelling

1639
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,608
You're going to have to shoot

1640
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,656
And that might have been

1641
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,448
But someone might see that is just text

1642
01:40:57,216 --> 01:41:01,312
I feel like a difference

1643
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,920
Reaching into his jacket

1644
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,992
Find a loaded semi-automatic

1645
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,272
Like also the footage

1646
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,344
About

1647
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,648
Like it's from earlier

1648
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,696
It's not connected to the shooting itself

1649
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,352
That's that's the type of ship just like I

1650
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,632
You are given up on

1651
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:27,168
There's no point

1652
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:27,936
You're gone

1653
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,984
You're you I have no interest in talking

1654
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:33,056
Do you or existing at all

1655
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:37,920
Street

1656
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:41,504
It's going to be cover

1657
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,832
Gregory Cinema

1658
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,672
Does insane

1659
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:49,696
Play last night

1660
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,072
Crazy by the way when I tell you food

1661
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:57,376
Quality

1662
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,912
Are we back to food

1663
01:41:59,168 --> 01:41:59,680
Starbucks food

1664
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:11,712
Is really annoying

1665
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,736
I would say

1666
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,272
Patterns

1667
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,808
Very

1668
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:20,160
No they rub me the wrong way here's an example

1669
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,744
My message

1670
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:27,328
Just hoping that Donald Trump

1671
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:33,984
Or just hoping that you know like guys like myself or Alex Jones or Savannah

1672
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:35,264
How old are you

1673
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,544
Do so much

1674
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,568
We can only stay

1675
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,128
We can only cover so much

1676
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,176
It's the everyday American

1677
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,320
And do something and say so

1678
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:55,744
Bled

1679
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,536
This moment

1680
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:58,304
Alex

1681
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,328
For this moment

1682
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:05,216
Because whenever freedom is on the line sacrifices have to be made and that's where we are

1683
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:11,616
I mean this with all the disrespect of my words imply

1684
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:14,688
Don't listen to what's more we enter the breach

1685
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:15,456
On this

1686
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:17,248
Saint crispin's day

1687
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:23,648
We're going to do it guys

1688
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,744
You saying how old are you is really

1689
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,512
Appropriate

1690
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:33,888
I just took you sounds like a child why what are you doing

1691
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:46,688
Ends up getting

1692
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,016
Just take over the country

1693
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,832
Honestly I don't think

1694
01:43:55,136 --> 01:44:00,512
He gets that most of the right-wing media personas job to incite anger

1695
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,584
Any idea what do you stalk

1696
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:13,312
Size lollipop

1697
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:15,360
The cigar

1698
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,176
So

1699
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:23,040
Savannah

1700
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:24,320
Time she had important

1701
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,856
Let me tell you

1702
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,136
Did you go to record store

1703
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:27,904
No

1704
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,976
So there's a real twist

1705
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:34,560
Was

1706
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:41,216
Like a civil war out there and you know Alex you always use the word arranged when you're talking about these leftist and I was talking

1707
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:45,056
Do we see that they're deranged their demonic

1708
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:51,712
Was exactly that

1709
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:53,760
The people there are demonic

1710
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:55,296
They're evil

1711
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:59,648
This is tough because

1712
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:04,000
There was a shooting in Portland on Saturday night

1713
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,424
Unacceptable

1714
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,192
Violence

1715
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:13,472
The made of

1716
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,752
Involved into protest

1717
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,336
If it was a right-wing person who pulled the trigger arrested

1718
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:21,152
I hope they get arrested too

1719
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:23,456
Killing people is not cool.

1720
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:29,344
Generalized opposition to killing people I have no idea what the circumstances

1721
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,112
Thesaurus

1722
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,904
Comedone much more

1723
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:34,720
I do want to just save it Savannah gofucker

1724
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:37,536
Portland to report on anything

1725
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:40,096
Hangout

1726
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:44,960
The other thing I want to say is that this episode is deeply and

1727
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:47,008
Hayirli about stoke

1728
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:50,080
And heightened tensions around me street protest

1729
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:54,944
Alex

1730
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,736
Ignored the shooting of Jacob Lake

1731
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,368
Black supremacist group

1732
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,672
Interview does very clearly intended

1733
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:06,976
Protesters in Kenosha

1734
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:09,024
Potential Threat not just to some building

1735
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,072
The very existence of America

1736
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,424
City of Savannah

1737
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:18,752
It's weird and I'm almost certain it's not intentional

1738
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:22,592
Singularly focused episodes

1739
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:25,152
There's some random instances

1740
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:27,456
Getting lost in the woods

1741
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:30,272
You're talking about TV your nurses

1742
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:34,368
In terms of content he's actually dedicated time to

1743
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,416
Entirely

1744
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:38,720
List of the biggest threat in the world

1745
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:42,816
It's pretty bad in hindsight

1746
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,120
Probably

1747
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,424
I think one fundamental things

1748
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,472
It drives me insane about these people

1749
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,496
Is just like

1750
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,288
All the left-wing protester

1751
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:54,080
Foaming at the mouth are demonic

1752
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,896
One side

1753
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,456
The line

1754
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,992
Has medics

1755
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,832
And the other one doesn't one side

1756
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:07,392
Cares enough about people to have met

1757
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:10,208
And I would guarantee

1758
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,536
Through f****** clenched

1759
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,304
Teeth

1760
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,888
If one of those Patriot pay

1761
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,680
Beating assistant

1762
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,960
They would f****** get it

1763
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,544
True as well

1764
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,104
I don't know if it's right

1765
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,128
Ringside

1766
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:29,920
Of things doesn't have

1767
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:31,968
I don't want to say that for sure

1768
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:39,392
Savannah

1769
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:41,184
Those are secret antifa

1770
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:45,024
Corsair secret K-pop

1771
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:51,424
What is the framing of these people is like

1772
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:52,704
Is

1773
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:54,752
They also have to like

1774
01:47:55,008 --> 01:48:00,128
What I have to wrestle with the idea

1775
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:01,408
Involved in protest

1776
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:04,992
Yeah how do you do that

1777
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,320
People don't know is that the people in those neighborhoods are

1778
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:10,112
Actually encouraging

1779
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,512
Thank you for everything that you do

1780
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:22,656
And that's what made me realize that

1781
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:24,448
Exactly

1782
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:33,664
Going to Kentucky

1783
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:38,272
In Charlotte

1784
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:43,136
Communities understand

1785
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:46,464
Issues

1786
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,792
Sport

1787
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:51,072
Send a text

1788
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:57,472
The rest of the country Portland has a Democrat

1789
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:01,056
Essentially condoning violence against protesters

1790
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,664
I do not seem like something that they would

1791
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:12,064
Alright that's true

1792
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,648
Broad swing

1793
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:26,656
Are like better organized organized

1794
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:28,192
Nice

1795
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:31,264
But it's not a well-organized

1796
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,312
Melissa.

1797
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:38,944
They have vehicle convoys have people on mopeds they have their own press

1798
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:42,528
Can I see know exactly what they're doing they're coming to your neighborhood

1799
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:51,744
Every single day bcnu City being burned down

1800
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:55,840
Literally

1801
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:59,936
It's one of these degenerate child molesters the most of them

1802
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:04,544
Cool

1803
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:09,408
Really man

1804
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,736
I wonder what Jesus would have done is Facebook

1805
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:19,392
Let's hold on with the violetear guys but I mean

1806
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:29,120
Confirmation

1807
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:31,424
Spectrum

1808
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:37,056
Because they're friends with the proud boys

1809
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:42,944
And then he brings up something that

1810
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:44,736
Took me in a flight of fancy

1811
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:46,784
Avanza bugging me forever

1812
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,928
Chicago

1813
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:54,720
And I just asked her why not

1814
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,512
We just asked

1815
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,120
Perhaps

1816
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,312
So we can meet

1817
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,336
Portland

1818
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:14,176
U-Pick Portland because you asked

1819
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:14,944
Not good

1820
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,224
As a reporter

1821
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:19,552
Resent

1822
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:20,832
View

1823
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:23,648
How the proud boys are the best people on the planet

1824
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:26,720
And I really had no interest in anything else

1825
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:30,816
They like me

1826
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:35,424
Obvious answer like I was more surprised he said that

1827
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,448
Kind of ghost

1828
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:42,848
Chicago come on Savannah

1829
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,176
Absolutely

1830
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:51,040
I don't know

1831
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:54,624
I don't know.

1832
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,928
Assumption

1833
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,488
Listen to ameliorate

1834
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:04,608
The flight of fancy

1835
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:07,936
Me running into them and then just

1836
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:14,336
Talking about 2000's

1837
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:18,688
Kman

1838
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,480
Because roads

1839
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:24,064
Charter Charter

1840
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:29,696
Slide your way through

1841
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:33,536
Come on

1842
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:39,936
I wouldn't even pretend to even bring it up I still think Infowars is what wasn't

1843
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,704
2009

1844
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,752
Oh yeah yeah yeah

1845
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:50,432
I want to talk about

1846
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:52,480
Port

1847
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:57,856
I wonder how they respond

1848
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:01,184
Complete

1849
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:07,840
Was completely forgot I totally understand

1850
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,080
In this next clip

1851
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:24,480
This is where my mind got blown listening to this

1852
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:26,016
On the scene

1853
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:28,064
Monumental

1854
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:33,696
Weather report

1855
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,000
Broke his finger

1856
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:45,984
Selectively Obama victim

1857
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:48,544
Very wealthy

1858
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:50,080
Antifa

1859
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:52,128
A lot of the people in those videos that have

1860
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,152
Thomas and

1861
01:53:56,224 --> 01:54:02,112
So this supposed

1862
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:05,696
Too close to each other

1863
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:11,840
On August 22nd

1864
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:18,240
Hand

1865
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:24,896
Roberts

1866
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:26,176
Antifa

1867
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:28,480
Obviously he's opposed to fascism

1868
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:35,648
Someone who's hurt

1869
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,696
Even if he supports one side

1870
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:40,000
There's a press hat he's literally

1871
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:41,024
Figuratively wearing

1872
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:47,168
What's interesting to me though is that is actually there

1873
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:51,264
If that's true how's that any different

1874
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,056
Great reset

1875
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,128
She's there with

1876
01:54:56,384 --> 01:55:01,760
He's explicitly and definitively there is

1877
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:09,184
If anyone takes

1878
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,488
She's not very good at don't

1879
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:20,960
Doing it so it's okay that we are doing I also I reached out to

1880
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:29,408
To say he wasn't there for.

1881
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:34,272
How do you respond to the accusations

1882
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:37,344
I'm not working right

1883
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,696
That's fun

1884
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,256
The thing about

1885
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:47,072
So well no wise they have to have

1886
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:50,400
There has to be independent press on the ground

1887
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:52,448
They know everybody knows why

1888
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:56,032
Cuz you can't f****** trust

1889
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:57,056
Announce

1890
01:55:57,824 --> 01:56:01,152
You can't trust the national news media Source because that's not what they're for

1891
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:03,200
A lot of people

1892
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:04,480
Fila calling

1893
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:06,528
Towards certain

1894
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,296
Total

1895
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:13,440
It's just you can't rely on the information and you just can't allow info

1896
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:15,232
If I can control the narrative

1897
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:22,144
Interesting

1898
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:28,288
Is Savannah goes on to talk about

1899
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:33,408
Brick broken finger

1900
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:35,200
It's

1901
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:39,296
She's clearly only talkin about him

1902
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:41,088
And then gets into how there's

1903
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:41,856
Fake press

1904
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,440
How's this fake

1905
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:48,512
Breast settings

1906
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:51,072
And then presented as if it's something that's happening

1907
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,544
Certainly implies that

1908
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:07,456
Savannah

1909
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:08,736
Real dumb

1910
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,016
Real dumb

1911
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:12,064
She's really bad at this job

1912
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:15,648
Basically it allows us to have any cities

1913
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:17,696
Because he's forcing people

1914
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:22,560
To say okay we need your help

1915
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:28,704
If you follow what you're saying and then

1916
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:34,080
He is describing what Alex's said is the globalist plan for the last 20 years

1917
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:36,128
Call back Galion dialect

1918
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:38,432
Or the problem reaction solution

1919
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:43,296
Cedar Creek

1920
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:45,088
Which will elicit a reaction

1921
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:45,856
From the public

1922
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:50,464
Then magically the globalist will be ready with their solution which was their plan all along

1923
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:52,768
One example of this thinking and Alex

1924
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:54,816
Coronavirus

1925
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:55,584
Outbreak

1926
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:57,376
He believes that the globalist

1927
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:59,936
Created this virus and or heists

1928
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:00,960
Which is the problem

1929
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:06,336
Is problem reaction begging the government

1930
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:11,200
Vaccine microchip

1931
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:12,480
What is the solution

1932
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:16,064
From the jump

1933
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,368
Except

1934
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:22,720
Who created a solution

1935
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:25,792
This is exactly the pattern that Savannah's describing words

1936
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:27,840
If you take what you saying

1937
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,400
Is Trump allowing these protests

1938
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:34,240
To get out of control

1939
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:37,824
To come in and put down

1940
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:41,920
Solution will be an unconstitutional authoritarian

1941
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:46,272
These people are f****** stupid stupid world

1942
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:48,320
Anyone who listens to the show

1943
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:53,440
Hold on

1944
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:58,304
Compass intentionally allow me protest to escalate the situation

1945
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:01,376
That probably means that he's wanted to do something he could

1946
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:04,448
Out of control

1947
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:07,008
Any half-decent conspiracy theorist

1948
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,760
Goddamn

1949
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:22,624
Well I mean it's when you all when you don't have any creativity whatsoever

1950
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:25,952
Your enemies can only be doing your ideas

1951
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:28,512
And since your ideas are on creative

1952
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:32,608
You're just by telling me what your enemies are doing you're just saying what you

1953
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:34,912
You are only capable of Imagine

1954
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:36,704
She's not

1955
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:41,056
You're not supposed to

1956
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:43,872
Define your enemies

1957
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:45,408
The same way is your hero

1958
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:50,016
Reaction solution

1959
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:52,320
Explicitly

1960
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:54,368
Globalist

1961
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:02,560
It is well

1962
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:06,400
Purposefully killing off your citizen it's not something that's like

1963
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:08,960
Bomb trick me into eating my vegetables

1964
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,752
That's not the hegelian dialectic

1965
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:16,384
If Trump is doing this than you are just telling me that Trump is murdering

1966
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:17,920
So

1967
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:20,480
We get to Savannah

1968
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:23,040
Really weird

1969
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:28,160
This is a very important election probably

1970
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:28,928
Comfortable

1971
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,720
Because Donald Trump has been in office

1972
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,304
The last defense

1973
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,888
President Donald Trump in office

1974
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,168
Our country

1975
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:43,520
Love she's talking about

1976
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:49,920
Comfortable

1977
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:54,272
Regardless

1978
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:56,832
No one is happy

1979
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:59,648
Isn't the entire premise of Alex's show supposed to be

1980
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:03,232
The public is suffering because of the globalist

1981
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:11,168
It simultaneously soros-funded militant

1982
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:24,480
No it's almost like

1983
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,248
And yet

1984
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,296
Just can't admit it such

1985
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:28,576
Bulshit

1986
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,880
Anyway goddamnit

1987
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:34,720
So comfortable

1988
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:37,280
These are the most comfortable years

1989
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:43,680
That's why we're having the most important election

1990
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:45,728
Because we're so comfy

1991
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:51,616
So Alex Goes to Kohl's while Savannah and Gregory sarsfield

1992
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:52,896
This caller

1993
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:54,688
Interesting

1994
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:56,480
It starts off

1995
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:57,504
Alex

1996
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,528
Speed dating guy

1997
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,112
Message to get out the trunk

1998
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,904
2

1999
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:06,208
I think one of the major things he needs to do

2000
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:06,976
Is go

2001
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:08,256
Open fortnite

2002
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:09,536

02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:14,144
They're going listening

2005
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:19,264
2009 Mariners

2006
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:25,664
We're not doing this anymore

2007
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:26,944
I don't care

2008
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:29,248
I just don't care man

2009
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:33,856
Now that's a protest that I if the right-wing was just walking around show us

2010
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:40,256

You had me

2016
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:56,896
Recorded a video

2017
02:02:57,152 --> 02:03:01,248
The night before they got really popular super excited

2018
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:02,784
This is

2019
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:06,112
Thank you for taking my call I actually was on

2020
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:08,672
Teen in Kenosha shortly after Jacob Lake

2021
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,720
I was shot and I took

2022
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:27,104
There is no other conversation

2023
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,920
He wants to talk about this guy's video

2024
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:31,456
So that's cool

2025
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:33,248
Show us how

2026
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:35,296
God's name

2027
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:39,648
Can you possibly hear those two things

2028
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:41,696
And be like

2029
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:45,024
Honestly be surprised

2030
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,816
He didn't even register or what

2031
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:55,264
She's complaining about protesters being bailed

2032
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,032
I'm stuff

2033
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:58,848
Bright

2034
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:05,760
The ACLU legal observers dare

2035
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:11,136
Animal organizations

2036
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,928
What's antifa

2037
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:15,744
See who got arrested

2038
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,512
Building

2039
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:18,560
There's also the national lawyers Guild

2040
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:23,424
Your number on antifa members

2041
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:31,360
Does the power structure is behind them in this complete

2042
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:36,992
Evolution

2043
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:39,296
Alright

2044
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:41,344
I dug.

2045
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,112
Okay

2046
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:43,648
Okay alright

2047
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:45,184
Okay

2048
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:47,232
So these people

2049
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:51,840
One legal Observers

2050
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:53,120
Communist

2051
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:55,680
Are are watching

2052
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:58,752
Protesters

2053
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,848
Take him to a holding cell

2054
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:06,432
Held are for hours upon hours

2055
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:11,040
And they are saying that is because

2056
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:12,576
The power structure is behind them

2057
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:16,928
So

2058
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:21,024
To break

2059
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:25,888
The 24

2060
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:28,448
Where is all the money and all the power

2061
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:31,008
All the doll Hollywood

2062
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:34,848
Are the rebels

2063
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:37,920
You're not the rebel

2064
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:40,224
Quenching George the third is on your side you're not

2065
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,248
What are the rebels

2066
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:42,528
And we're going to win

2067
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,552
But the tree

2068
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:47,392
Devil worshiping Phil

02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:49,952
Person you're amazing give your info the producer please

Has really sucked up

2072
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:04,544
Police stand against

2073
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:09,152
Tubi

2074
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:10,944
Expression

2075
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:14,272
The kill you

2076
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:15,552
Protesters

2077
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:21,184
Keppra pick your the rebels

2078
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:23,744
So that was really bad

2079
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,768
That was bad

2080
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:27,328
Until we jump to the 25th

2081
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:30,400
The show off

2082
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,680
Existential Danger

2083
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:50,112
Are you going to let him win

2084
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:52,928
We have the truth

2085
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:02,912
Something

2086
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,568
Is Vape

2087
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:10,336
Alex's

2088
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:11,104
Continuing to

2089
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,664
To play drum pads promotional

2090
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:18,016
Trump campaign

2091
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:22,880
So I noticed this was continuing

2092
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:24,672
Kind of pinky mice

2093
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:31,072
Breaking federal election

2094
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:32,608
The problem

2095
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:34,912
According to the SEC rules

2096
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:37,472
You might be in trouble because of disclaimer

2097
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:40,800
There's no disclaimer at the end of the Avid Alex Blazek

2098
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:41,568
Clearly says

2099
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:43,872
Which is a requirement

2100
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:51,040
Political action committee

2101
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:56,672
And if it's not there needs to be a just claim it indicates who's responsible for a vet advertisement

2102
02:07:56,928 --> 02:08:00,256
Like if there's another political action committee that produce the address

2103
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:05,376
Pretty clear that the exemptions for political ads are pretty Limited

2104
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:12,288
Show me cases that disclaimers aren't necessary or instances where they wouldn't be feasible like in the case of promotional pens or Skyrim

2105
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:16,384
I bet the ad does have a disclaimer in the visual

2106
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:24,064
On the radio

2107
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,624
I'm not sure

2108
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:31,744
Cuz anything to worry about even if anyone took this

2109
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:36,352
I need to be a lot of stuff

2110
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:39,168
It was next cool if we get

2111
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:41,984
Disclaimer

2112
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:48,384
No Alex

2113
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:51,456
You told me to really kicks.

2114
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,016
FIFA

2115
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:55,808
Decoy

2116
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:57,344
Remember who did

2117
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,392
If you're in a war

2118
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:05,536
Your laughter

2119
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:20,128
But from time to time he will tell his listeners not to go after

2120
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:20,896
She gets hot

2121
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:23,200
Annotation Focus On high-priority Target

2122
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:25,760
I don't find this compelling or expelled

2123
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:29,600
Cotorrito because he also says

2124
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:33,696
Because their enemy combat

2125
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:36,768
Self-contradictory

2126
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:43,424
Music

2127
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:47,776
You spent about his violent fantasies regarding what he wants to do to let through

2128
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:50,848
Is metaphor also doesn't make any sense

2129
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:51,872
In war

2130
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:58,272
You absolutely go after privates

2131
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:08,000
Less time than generous

2132
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:14,400
Congressional research service release numbers about military casualties in up to July 2020

2133
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:16,960
2349 active service

2134
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:17,984
First persons killed

2135
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:20,288
The embarrassing renamed operation enduring

2136
02:10:20,544 --> 02:10:21,056
Freedom

2137
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:23,616
These approximately 10%

2138
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:24,896
We're officers

2139
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:26,944
Approximately 50%

2140
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:30,272
C134 and in the army

2141
02:10:30,528 --> 02:10:33,088
Private first class

2142
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:33,856
Special

2143
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,904
Before our price

2144
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:36,672
Rex

2145
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:41,536
This makes sense because typically in a person ever going to be able to fight

2146
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:48,448
I understand but I would says he's warped sneaking into soros's secret underground compound and taking them out with

2147
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:57,152
And now you understand the far-right

2148
02:10:57,408 --> 02:11:03,552
Alex is not getting fire to perform targeted assassination

2149
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:09,952
Everybody knows, the only effect

2150
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:15,840
And the only people for them to fight realistically our other private

2151
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:20,960
Does not have access to metaphorical General

2152
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:24,544
Send it

2153
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:27,872
Higher likelihood of metaphorical privates

2154
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:32,992
I just fine I find even these caveat stupid.

2155
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:35,552
Caviar caviar

2156
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,856
Hellboy

2157
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:39,904
For some reason Alex is fine

2158
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:42,720
Bringing up Jacob

2159
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:46,304
The individual that started all the latest

2160
02:11:47,328 --> 02:11:48,096
Dieting

2161
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:50,144
Wisconsin

2162
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:53,728
Just got in today

2163
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:57,568
Jacob Lake

2164
02:11:58,592 --> 02:12:02,944
His mother called him on him he's he's got a sex assault charges

2165
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:07,296
Charges dropped all these drug charges in a rap sheet

2166
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:08,832
Long

2167
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:12,928
I guess Alex is finally decided to talk about

2168
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:18,304
I said earlier

2169
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:21,376
Bearing on whether or not

2170
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:24,448
Games a transparent attempt

2171
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:26,752
Which is what Alex has to

2172
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:31,104
The only thing I want to point out is that I was lying about Blake's criminal record

2173
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:36,736
He was charged with sexual assault against an adult in July

2174
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:38,528
According to their research

2175
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:43,904
Other cases in Wisconsin court records include a traffic violation and custody disputes

2176
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:48,768
Sexually assaulted

2177
02:12:49,024 --> 02:12:49,536
Look meme

2178
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:55,424
What someone like had was 3rd degree sexual assault

2179
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:59,520
Definition of third degree sexual assault

2180
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:02,592
In Wisconsin that's not specifically a crime

2181
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:05,664
Committed against an underage person

2182
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:06,432
It is

2183
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:13,088
It wasn't intentionally misleading mean

2184
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:16,928
He doesn't know work

2185
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:23,584
If you can say to someone having a traffic violation and custody disputes is a rap sheet 80 ft long

2186
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:26,144
I guess Alex has a rap sheet 80 ft long

2187
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:27,424
Because

2188
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:29,216
Coming up for that DUI

2189
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:35,872
Alex Wood

2190
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:37,152
Justify his own police

2191
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:43,296
He's been

2192
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:47,648
He's been sued by the southern district of New York

2193
02:13:47,904 --> 02:13:54,048
Yes

2194
02:13:54,304 --> 02:13:55,328
Sandy Hook families

2195
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:56,096
Cups

2196
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:59,680
According to Alex is only could shoot him at any time

2197
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:03,264
And he'd be fine

2198
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:11,456
I just imagine how it's reporting on that

2199
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:16,576
I think you may be right

2200
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:19,392
Whether he was

2201
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:22,976
I guess he

2202
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:28,096
God I hate everybody

2203
02:14:29,632 --> 02:14:31,424
In Kenosha

2204
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,448
It's

2205
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:34,496
Seems to me like

2206
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:40,640
I'm read the article that's up on it

2207
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:43,712
Demolition tries to stop looters and rioters

2208
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:46,784
Bored.com

2209
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:48,576
Borden

2210
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:50,624
I said huh

2211
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:51,904
Weird

2212
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:59,840
Hanger with his new friends this is where I

2213
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:02,912
For one second I have to like stop

2214
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:04,448
To avoid

2215
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:08,032
Becoming the conspiracy theory of my own

2216
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:09,824
Isn't it suspicious that

2217
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:16,224
It's it's conspicuous in its absence is

2218
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:20,064
Took a second to get over but there was a

2219
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:25,696
Confusion is going on

2220
02:15:25,952 --> 02:15:29,280
Kind of weird

2221
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:31,328
Completely oblivious

2222
02:15:31,584 --> 02:15:37,728
Read his own articles

2223
02:15:37,984 --> 02:15:44,128
Because she wants to hang out with his new friend Boris really got a new class

2224
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,688
Entering the circle

2225
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:53,088
Deanna Lorraine

2226
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:57,696
Congratulations on that hire

2227
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:04,352
The bad news

2228
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:10,752
Weirdo

2229
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:19,968
Real independent contractor situation

2230
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,064
Fire Doral

2231
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:31,744
Who we saw come up on a recent episode

2232
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,584
I'm just really trying to think of

2233
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:37,632
20 years on the internet

2234
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:38,656
14

2235
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:41,216
Such a Justified shoe

2236
02:16:41,472 --> 02:16:41,984
Shooting in Miami

2237
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:47,104
So

2238
02:16:50,688 --> 02:16:52,736
The last thing they ever wanted to do

2239
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:01,696
What

2240
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:04,256
Jacob Lake

2241
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:12,704
For Infowars is somebody with

2242
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:16,032
The same patterns is Owen Shroyer

2243
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:19,360
But somehow and annoying are more annoying

2244
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:25,760
On the road but

2245
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:30,624
The last thing they wanted to do the problem is that it's not the last thing they want to do

2246
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:35,488
A lot of other things that they want to do

2247
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:39,584
Justified shooting

2248
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:45,984
Alex discusses a little piece

2249
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:49,056
Putting out a fire in the dumpster

2250
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:50,848
Guy with fire extinguisher

2251
02:17:57,248 --> 02:17:58,272
Chaka of course

2252
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:03,904
Alluded

2253
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:05,696
For sure

2254
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:11,328
Shoot them with a riot

2255
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:12,096
Shotgun

2256
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:13,376
Okay

2257
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:14,400
Seriously

2258
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:15,936
Defend your businesses

2259
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:17,216
Shotgun

2260
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:18,752
South

2261
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:20,544
CertiFit Matic

2262
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:24,384
But there're other ways

2263
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:25,920
To handle console

2264
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:27,968
It never occurs to

2265
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:30,528
Gun

2266
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:34,368
There's one other way

2267
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:35,904
That's not good

2268
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:37,184
Here's a

2269
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:38,976
This is what keeps me up

2270
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:40,768
These people exist

2271
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:42,816
Thinking

2272
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:49,472
People still

2273
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:57,920
Continue to exist

2274
02:18:58,688 --> 02:19:00,480
Continue to be ministers to society

2275
02:19:01,248 --> 02:19:01,760
So

2276
02:19:03,552 --> 02:19:04,320
Is Roundup

2277
02:19:04,576 --> 02:19:05,088
Wow

2278
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:11,488
Wow

2279
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:14,304
2016

2280
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:23,520
50 million at least that were rounding up and putting

2281
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:30,176
Bizarro world

2282
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:32,480
Appearance because you have

2283
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:37,856
Rebuilding his entire career

2284
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:44,000
Hazel guess to say all these left

2285
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:48,096
We can't be a menace to society

2286
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:50,656
Do not recognize that like

2287
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:53,216
Pretty clear

2288
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:55,264
This

2289
02:19:59,104 --> 02:20:01,408
And I don't care

2290
02:20:02,688 --> 02:20:03,456
Problem

2291
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:08,320
Really starting to feel like it's not

2292
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:09,856
There was a problem

2293
02:20:10,368 --> 02:20:11,392
Problem

2294
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:13,696
They're working with the Devil

2295
02:20:18,304 --> 02:20:18,816
Aggressive

2296
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:33,152
At the mall

2297
02:20:37,248 --> 02:20:41,856
So they're coming for Maxine Waters that I was talking about was from June 2018

2298
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:47,744
If I was trying to take a, but she made over 2 years ago

2299
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,536
Pacific connection

2300
02:20:49,792 --> 02:20:53,120
Does he require to prove causality

2301
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:55,680
A frightening recent cases

2302
02:20:55,936 --> 02:21:00,288
I don't think that either left types are really the whole into represented Waters

2303
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:06,688
Very rarely hear my left-wing friends talk about

2304
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:10,528
Right-wing Dum Dums

2305
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:13,088
Yeah

2306
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:19,744
Not responding to till I got

2307
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:28,960
Alexa

2308
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:30,240
With 80% of the vote

2309
02:21:31,776 --> 02:21:32,544
Trump's going to win

2310
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:33,568
Going to try to steal

2311
02:21:33,824 --> 02:21:34,848
What they're going to try to secede

2312
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:38,688
What's happening in the economy

2313
02:21:44,064 --> 02:21:44,576
Bali food

2314
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:48,928
Alex wants

2315
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:51,744
To talk to Q

2316
02:21:58,656 --> 02:21:59,168
Because

2317
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:00,192
It ends poorly

2318
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:02,496
Start stalking

2319
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:05,056
Really confused

2320
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:07,360
Black

2321
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:10,432
Church Someone shows up 10 minutes late and then sit

2322
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:20,672
Investigate things

2323
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:26,048
Diligent

2324
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:54,720
Massive

2325
02:22:57,792 --> 02:22:58,816
Campaign is working on that

2326
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,912
Is abrupt

2327
02:23:04,704 --> 02:23:06,496
Is a word

2328
02:23:09,056 --> 02:23:11,104
I don't understand

2329
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:13,920
Analogy

2330
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:14,688
Is racist

2331
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:16,224
Somehow

2332
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:18,784
I guess it's like that

2333
02:23:25,184 --> 02:23:31,328
Sing that all black people

2334
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:34,144
I thought it was

2335
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:35,936
It was along the lines of

2336
02:23:36,448 --> 02:23:42,592
Black churches are well-intentioned people who don't want to do the due diligence and research

2337
02:23:42,848 --> 02:23:48,224
Describe. What do you think he just said that they was said in front of the pool after 10 minutes

2338
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:54,112
To the cute are you coming late to the black church so you don't understand what

2339
02:23:54,368 --> 02:23:56,160
He came to the cube

2340
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:58,720
So he doesn't understand all that's going on

2341
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:00,000
With the intricacies of

2342
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:05,376
Song you're still you're still

2343
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:06,400
Prime's for the goods

2344
02:24:07,936 --> 02:24:14,080
Whatsoever

2345
02:24:18,176 --> 02:24:20,480
Special Report

2346
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:22,016
To the crew

2347
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:23,296
Mom's mad

2348
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:24,064
Jesus

2349
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:28,672
Special Report

2350
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:30,976
Thank God

2351
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:35,584
Explain that metaphor

2352
02:24:41,984 --> 02:24:43,264
10 minutes late

2353
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:44,800
Front pew

2354
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,504
Vicious media

2355
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:54,784
He's like hey

2356
02:24:55,552 --> 02:25:00,160
If you have something good you're still going to have these infiltrators

2357
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:05,280
Educating liberals

2358
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:07,584
Dylan wheeler

2359
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:16,032
Is a

2360
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:16,800
Freemason

2361
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:17,824
In a satanic

2362
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:19,616
Close enough

2363
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:30,112
Information

2364
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:33,952
What is entropy

2365
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:38,816
Trump is a demon

2366
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:45,216
A wake-up call

2367
02:25:46,752 --> 02:25:50,080
This isn't just some person who turns out there with her or something

2368
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:53,664
Cuz they did such a

2369
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:57,248
Good betting know it's that's not based on any kind of research

2370
02:25:57,504 --> 02:26:02,880
It's just people on the internet

2371
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:04,416
Also clearly like

2372
02:26:04,672 --> 02:26:10,816
I initially misunderstood that black church comment

2373
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:13,120
My initial assessment

2374
02:26:13,376 --> 02:26:13,888
Clear Lake

2375
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:15,680
I think he's trying to say that

2376
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:20,800
Church

2377
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:22,080
And

2378
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:25,152
There are the old-school conspiracy theorist

2379
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:27,456
You know about the Bilderberg Group and all that and whatever

2380
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:33,344
People turning into cute people to show up late and sit in the front row and

2381
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:34,624
Understand

2382
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:41,280
Or something I'm not entirely sure it's a weird metaphor that doesn't really attract think it's not as bad as I

2383
02:26:41,792 --> 02:26:44,352
Initially thought might not

2384
02:26:44,608 --> 02:26:50,752
Here's what I hear you know what here's what I think we got stuck too too far in the weeds

2385
02:26:51,008 --> 02:26:53,824
Here's my problem

2386
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:55,872
This guy's just never been to a black church

2387
02:26:56,896 --> 02:27:02,016
So that's all that's my problem before we even get into the meaning of duplicity

2388
02:27:02,272 --> 02:27:03,552
He is never been

2389
02:27:03,808 --> 02:27:04,320
Yeah

2390
02:27:04,576 --> 02:27:10,720
So this episode Mal descendants

2391
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:12,768
Submit the cues

2392
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:14,304
I hate them

2393
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:20,704
Don't mind I don't care at all

2394
02:27:23,008 --> 02:27:25,312
McHugh people to his Revenue stream cell

2395
02:27:25,568 --> 02:27:26,080
I don't care

2396
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:32,224
Alright

2397
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:43,232
Watch a show

2398
02:27:43,488 --> 02:27:44,256
Successful

2399
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:47,584
Country and western

2400
02:27:48,864 --> 02:27:50,400
Music music

2401
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:53,472
Multi-talented

2402
02:27:53,984 --> 02:27:55,008
Country music

2403
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:56,544
Comedian

2404
02:27:58,848 --> 02:28:00,640
Channels weird

2405
02:28:00,896 --> 02:28:01,920
Here's a joke

2406
02:28:05,504 --> 02:28:06,016
Dakota

2407
02:28:08,064 --> 02:28:08,832
South Dakota

2408
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:22,656
Campaign for Texas governor basically entirely on his

2409
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:23,936
Supposition

2410
02:28:28,544 --> 02:28:31,872
Also second side note South Dakota is basically a rectangle

2411
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:34,176
If you wanted to make a rectangle

2412
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:35,200
And save itself

2413
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:36,224
Dakota

2414
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:36,992
Do that

2415
02:28:37,248 --> 02:28:42,624
Also maybe these other states don't make all these dumb s*** shaped like their state cuz they're not painfully insecure

2416
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:45,440
Also

2417
02:28:45,696 --> 02:28:49,792
Texas waffle maker isn't Maiden America

2418
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:51,328
Also

2419
02:28:52,864 --> 02:28:53,632
I've seen that joke

2420
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:54,912
Kill two men

2421
02:29:04,128 --> 02:29:05,664
Watching the future

2422
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:11,040
Murder on the line like that just wondering what am I doing with my life

2423
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:16,672
Is talking is the guy who I mean obviously

2424
02:29:16,928 --> 02:29:18,208
Comedian so I don't know

2425
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:20,256
Exactly how much

2426
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:24,352
Commentary to take literally like some of it being f****** around

2427
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:26,400
No

2428
02:29:26,912 --> 02:29:27,936
Everything's literal

2429
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:34,336
That's the way I'm going to take funny funny can be pretty subjective there's a lot of things I think are funny but I can handle

2430
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:35,360
Look at

2431
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:36,384
I get

2432
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:37,408
Did this is an attempt

2433
02:29:37,664 --> 02:29:40,992
To be funny and maybe some of the different sense of humor

2434
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:44,832
To track sometimes now I don't know

2435
02:29:45,088 --> 02:29:46,368
So anyway Chad

2436
02:29:49,184 --> 02:29:49,952
Peter strzok

2437
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:51,232
The FBI agent

2438
02:29:57,632 --> 02:29:58,144
How to take the flight

2439
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:02,752
That's the effect of an anti-bullying campaign

2440
02:30:03,264 --> 02:30:05,568
The stand

2441
02:30:09,152 --> 02:30:10,432
Playground I can tell you that

2442
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:12,992
Call me a bully

2443
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:20,928
They're about out of them anymore

2444
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:25,792
True patriot

2445
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:27,072
My boys right now

2446
02:30:27,584 --> 02:30:28,608
Mission

2447
02:30:29,376 --> 02:30:30,656
To stand up for yourself and take

2448
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:33,216
Them

2449
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:34,240
Winit

2450
02:30:35,264 --> 02:30:37,056
It's a debate when you're talking about

2451
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:38,080
Bullying in

2452
02:30:41,664 --> 02:30:43,968
Throughout history

2453
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:46,272
Have the funniest people

2454
02:30:46,784 --> 02:30:51,904
They have not been the comedians that everybody

2455
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:59,072
Then why A2 from the 25th

2456
02:30:59,328 --> 02:31:00,096
Yeah

2457
02:31:00,352 --> 02:31:04,448
Remember when I video on around me that chicken place when I was younger people

2458
02:31:07,776 --> 02:31:09,568
He makes a start

2459
02:31:09,824 --> 02:31:10,848
Confession

2460
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:13,664
I just completely casually

2461
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:25,696
Autumn the third time doing it

2462
02:31:26,208 --> 02:31:26,720
GameStop

2463
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:29,792
Down the article

2464
02:31:40,544 --> 02:31:41,568
An idiot

2465
02:31:42,336 --> 02:31:48,480
That's not even technically

2466
02:31:52,064 --> 02:31:54,624
Alex is a murderer

2467
02:31:54,880 --> 02:32:01,024
The Austin Statesman

2468
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:06,656
Apparently they should have said that Alex was a murderer

2469
02:32:19,712 --> 02:32:25,856
Confirm

2470
02:32:26,112 --> 02:32:31,232
Alex

2471
02:32:31,488 --> 02:32:32,000
Confirm

2472
02:32:33,792 --> 02:32:35,072
Some people said that

2473
02:32:35,328 --> 02:32:36,352
Alex

2474
02:32:37,376 --> 02:32:39,680
It's almost like this is what happened

2475
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:45,824
Bullied enough when they're growing up you know what I'm saying I'm sick of these anti-bullying campaign

2476
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,360
To keep bullies from being bullied

2477
02:32:47,616 --> 02:32:53,760
Give me 5 minutes on Spotify

2478
02:32:55,296 --> 02:32:58,368
Probably now we get to the 26

2479
02:32:58,624 --> 02:33:01,952
Night

2480
02:33:02,208 --> 02:33:06,048
Shooter killed two people

2481
02:33:08,608 --> 02:33:09,120
I was pretty

2482
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:13,216

He doesn't do any work

2490
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:47,264
Hillary said the Bible should not concede under any circumstances

2491
02:33:49,312 --> 02:33:51,616
It's a recognition that because of the way this election is

2492
02:33:51,872 --> 02:33:56,224
Clearly going to be a mess

2493
02:33:56,736 --> 02:34:00,832
Be ready for the possible legal challenges that could arise like back in 2000

2494
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:02,624
Is there like

2495
02:34:03,136 --> 02:34:04,928
There must be a

2496
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:06,464
Clinton signal

2497
02:34:07,488 --> 02:34:13,632
You know like like you know it's like this news I don't want to deal with somebody hit the

2498
02:34:13,888 --> 02:34:20,032
Clinton signal guess what Hillary Clinton sheet we can talk about something else going on today

2499
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:21,568
That's not important

2500
02:34:21,824 --> 02:34:24,384
Local news

2501
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:27,200
Hillary Clinton is a National City

2502
02:34:29,248 --> 02:34:30,016
Internal speaker

2503
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:32,832
Numbers go

2504
02:34:34,368 --> 02:34:34,880
Things are going

2505
02:34:39,744 --> 02:34:40,256
They're damn

2506
02:34:40,768 --> 02:34:41,536
Demoralizing

2507
02:34:43,072 --> 02:34:45,888
That does not mean 168 long days

2508
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:47,680
The longtime the short time

2509
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:48,960
Raconteur

2510
02:34:52,032 --> 02:34:53,056

2511
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:55,104
Star War

2512
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:58,944
Release a new more deadly virus

2513
02:34:59,200 --> 02:34:59,968
Resubmission

2514
02:35:02,528 --> 02:35:05,344
I sincerely don't think Alex's where the fact there was a

2515
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:08,928
The shooting night before in Kenosha at the beginning of the show

2516
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:13,536
He's opening the program rambling about secret internal Trump

2517
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:22,496
More diseases to throw it off

2518
02:35:23,008 --> 02:35:26,848
In the early morning hours for shot in Kenosha

2519
02:35:27,104 --> 02:35:31,200
The shooter was a seventeen-year-old in town from Illinois

2520
02:35:31,456 --> 02:35:34,016
And there was some kind of Duty

2521
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:34,784
You didn't leave

2522
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:36,832
Protect businesses he had no connection to

2523
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:38,112
Enter process

2524
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:40,928
Kill two people

2525
02:35:43,488 --> 02:35:46,304
You left town was only arrested back in Illinois the next day

2526
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:51,680
It's really really suspicious that I wasn't talking about this right away cuz it should be his tops

2527
02:35:51,936 --> 02:35:53,472
And yet there isn't a hint of

2528
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:55,520
Very weird

2529
02:35:56,288 --> 02:35:59,872
But Alex has other things on his mind

2530
02:36:00,384 --> 02:36:04,480
May not work on social media

2531
02:36:04,992 --> 02:36:06,272
Live coverage

2532
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:08,320
Tonight

2533
02:36:08,576 --> 02:36:09,088
They don't want that

2534
02:36:09,856 --> 02:36:10,624
The way you do it

2535
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:13,184
He's with this new URL

2536
02:36:14,976 --> 02:36:17,280
URL

2537
02:36:17,792 --> 02:36:18,816
Censored by Jack

2538
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:20,352
Come

2539
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:24,960
I mean this is the whack-a-mole game

2540
02:36:25,216 --> 02:36:30,080
Earnest of the sites

2541
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:32,896
Another URL

2542
02:36:33,152 --> 02:36:36,224
Eventually people like Alex's new site

2543
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:42,624
It's a little bit like antivirus soft

2544
02:36:43,392 --> 02:36:46,976
You're always going to be losing cuz they have the initiative

2545
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:49,792
They're always creating a

2546
02:36:50,816 --> 02:36:52,096
Motivation to

2547
02:36:52,608 --> 02:36:54,144
When texting people

2548
02:36:57,472 --> 02:36:59,008
And being able for his links

2549
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:03,872
To be spread around despite him being kicked

2550
02:37:06,432 --> 02:37:07,456
Into the show

2551
02:37:07,712 --> 02:37:08,992
This is when the first

2552
02:37:09,248 --> 02:37:09,760
Mention

2553
02:37:10,016 --> 02:37:11,296
Shooting comes up

2554
02:37:11,808 --> 02:37:13,088
That's all just about self

2555
02:37:13,344 --> 02:37:13,856
Defense

2556
02:37:14,624 --> 02:37:16,928
The Earth shaking

2557
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:19,744
I'm holding on

2558
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:21,280
Kenosha Wisconsin

2559
02:37:22,304 --> 02:37:23,584
Response by the media

2560
02:37:24,608 --> 02:37:25,120
And the fact that

2561
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:25,888
Young man

2562
02:37:28,704 --> 02:37:29,728
Auntie

2563
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:35,872
And then he shot and killed two people

2564
02:37:40,992 --> 02:37:41,504
F*** you

2565
02:37:45,344 --> 02:37:45,856
With a weapon

2566
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:48,160
Better man had a pistol in his hand

2567
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:48,928
Lowe's

2568
02:37:49,952 --> 02:37:50,464
Mobile

2569
02:37:53,536 --> 02:37:55,840
Imagine someone chasing you down the street with a pistol

2570
02:37:56,352 --> 02:37:57,120
You turn around and shoot

2571
02:38:00,448 --> 02:38:01,728
Governors calling for his arrest

2572
02:38:01,984 --> 02:38:03,008
The police

2573
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:06,592
Running down the street in the shooting

2574
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:08,896
First Skywalker

2575
02:38:12,736 --> 02:38:14,784
From really any relevant conversation

2576
02:38:15,296 --> 02:38:15,808
About

2577
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:20,672
Stop being scared skateboard

2578
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:25,536
Because the preceding incident of someone dying

2579
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:29,888
Super Morelos

2580
02:38:31,424 --> 02:38:37,312
Honestly 250 patients are the arguments like this

2581
02:38:37,824 --> 02:38:40,896
To me this situation

2582
02:38:41,152 --> 02:38:42,432
Elementary level

2583
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:44,480
Some people got shot

2584
02:38:44,736 --> 02:38:46,528
So the first question is who shot

2585
02:38:47,296 --> 02:38:49,344
He was a seventeen-year-old.

2586
02:38:50,368 --> 02:38:51,904
The next question is why

2587
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:54,976
These people

2588
02:38:57,024 --> 02:38:59,072
So question

2589
02:38:59,328 --> 02:39:00,352
Weekend

2590
02:39:00,608 --> 02:39:02,656
Why did you

2591
02:39:05,216 --> 02:39:07,520
It's obvious because

2592
02:39:08,544 --> 02:39:10,848
That's just the focus on the initial incident

2593
02:39:11,872 --> 02:39:12,896
From everything we can tell

2594
02:39:13,408 --> 02:39:14,944
Is that the victim

2595
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:18,784
Which logical Quest

2596
02:39:21,344 --> 02:39:23,136
I don't know

2597
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:25,952
Unfortunately

2598
02:39:27,488 --> 02:39:29,280
To ask him branch

2599
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:32,096
Send the first one is why was the shooter there

2600
02:39:32,608 --> 02:39:34,656
That's a tough question

2601
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:37,216
He clenches there to protect businesses

2602
02:39:37,472 --> 02:39:40,032
But he's not from Kenosha is from Antioch Illinois

2603
02:39:40,544 --> 02:39:44,896
Antioch is in Northern Illinois

2604
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:48,224
Centrum personal connection

2605
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:49,760
In between the two businesses

2606
02:39:50,016 --> 02:39:54,624
It appears that the answer to that question why he was there

2607
02:39:57,952 --> 02:40:00,000
Across state lines

2608
02:40:00,256 --> 02:40:01,280
Cano properties

2609
02:40:01,536 --> 02:40:02,304
Just seems weird

2610
02:40:03,072 --> 02:40:04,864
I would say that it sounds unbelievable but

2611
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:05,888
17

2612
02:40:06,912 --> 02:40:08,448
Next question

2613
02:40:08,704 --> 02:40:09,728
How did he have a gun

2614
02:40:10,496 --> 02:40:15,360
In order to legally possess purchase or carry a gun in Illinois where the shooters from you have to have it

2615
02:40:15,616 --> 02:40:19,456
Card or a firearm owner's identification card

2616
02:40:19,968 --> 02:40:23,808
In order to get when we start the person has to be 21 or over or have any

2617
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:28,160
Possessing acquire firearm

2618
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:32,512
That tells us that it's hypothetically possible for him to have a gun

2619
02:40:33,024 --> 02:40:36,352
Did not have a permit to begin with

2620
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:38,144
So it appears that him just

2621
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:39,680
Having a gun is illegal

2622
02:40:40,192 --> 02:40:44,032
You couldn't have like he couldn't receive the permit to carry weapon in Wisconsin

2623
02:40:46,336 --> 02:40:51,712
This is why in addition to first-degree murder he's charged with possession of a dangerous weapon under the age of 18

2624
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:58,624
If you trace out the causality Chamber of the first shooting there immediately at least two very serious reasons why the shooters

2625
02:40:58,880 --> 02:40:59,904
Position

2626
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:00,672
Be carrying out

2627
02:41:00,928 --> 02:41:01,440
Shooting

2628
02:41:01,696 --> 02:41:06,304
You have no reason to be in Kenosha other than a desire to build

2629
02:41:07,072 --> 02:41:09,120
And he had no legal right to be carrying an arc

2630
02:41:09,376 --> 02:41:10,144
15

2631
02:41:10,656 --> 02:41:15,008
For me these two aspects of the story make arguments about self-defense you a little bit Halo

2632
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:18,080
And how did you that you know we don't know what happened

2633
02:41:18,336 --> 02:41:21,920
Before the first video picks up where the shooter is being chased by the first

2634
02:41:22,688 --> 02:41:25,504
I don't know if there was an inciting incident to that

2635
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:27,808
Who might have been an instigator of

2636
02:41:28,064 --> 02:41:28,832
Whatever happened

2637
02:41:29,344 --> 02:41:30,880
So I don't know I don't

2638
02:41:31,136 --> 02:41:34,976
Care about this I don't care about is the

2639
02:41:35,232 --> 02:41:37,280
The arguments that

2640
02:41:38,304 --> 02:41:39,328
Attempt to Center

2641
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:40,864
Victims

2642
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:41,888
For the cross

2643
02:41:44,448 --> 02:41:49,568
It's an uphill battle if you're trying to make that argument see the evidence

2644
02:41:49,824 --> 02:41:51,360
It would be required to just

2645
02:41:57,504 --> 02:41:59,552
It's like one of those things

2646
02:42:00,064 --> 02:42:02,624
I know they're saying they're saying it all over

2647
02:42:03,136 --> 02:42:03,648
It's in

2648
02:42:03,904 --> 02:42:04,416
Homes

2649
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:05,440
10 garages

2650
02:42:05,952 --> 02:42:06,976
And it's on f****** TV

2651
02:42:07,488 --> 02:42:09,280
It's not a garage

2652
02:42:09,792 --> 02:42:10,304
I get it

2653
02:42:10,816 --> 02:42:11,328
I just

2654
02:42:12,864 --> 02:42:14,144
No one will say it to my face

2655
02:42:14,656 --> 02:42:15,424
Do you know what I mean

2656
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:18,240
Like they're all saying

2657
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:20,544
Alex is saying this s***

2658
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:23,616
Alex would not sit down across for me and say that s*** to my face

2659
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:26,432
You know you just what

2660
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:28,992
Coward

2661
02:42:29,504 --> 02:42:30,016
Static

2662
02:42:30,272 --> 02:42:31,552
And it drives me insane

2663
02:42:32,064 --> 02:42:36,928
On the 24 Alex was about

2664
02:42:37,184 --> 02:42:42,048
Lisa being policed by the protesters and stopping the police

2665
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:46,144
We're unable to do stuff and this continues after

2666
02:42:47,936 --> 02:42:48,448
Because

2667
02:42:48,704 --> 02:42:52,544
Those barriers existed to justify this preemptively

2668
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:54,080
And now that it's happened

2669
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:55,872
The payoff to

2670
02:42:56,128 --> 02:42:57,152
The man

2671
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:03,040
Go to the police with his hands up

2672
02:43:03,296 --> 02:43:04,064
Trying to get

2673
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:08,160
They won't

2674
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:15,840
When the police Stand Down

2675
02:43:16,352 --> 02:43:18,400
Thousands of people going through neighborhood

2676
02:43:18,912 --> 02:43:20,192
Burning down houses and businesses

2677
02:43:21,216 --> 02:43:21,728
Robin

2678
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:23,776
You're going to have the vacuum filled

2679
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:26,848
With citizens and you're going to ask

2680
02:43:27,872 --> 02:43:28,384
Stop

2681
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:32,224
Anyway

2682
02:43:32,480 --> 02:43:35,552
Alright let's just do this one real quick

2683
02:43:37,856 --> 02:43:38,624
Were there

2684
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:40,928
Full f****** body armor

2685
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:43,232
Carrying automatic weapons

2686
02:43:43,744 --> 02:43:45,536
And they're they're just being

2687
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:47,072
Handcuffs

2688
02:43:47,328 --> 02:43:47,840
Bye

2689
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:49,632
People wearing

2690
02:43:50,912 --> 02:43:52,192
Improvise

2691
02:43:52,448 --> 02:43:53,984
Protecting soros's beer

2692
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:56,288
This is

2693
02:43:56,544 --> 02:43:57,312
This is pathetic

2694
02:43:59,104 --> 02:44:02,176
Is filled with nothing but

2695
02:44:02,688 --> 02:44:03,968
Edit f****** disgusting

2696
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:05,760
Can't tell me that

2697
02:44:06,016 --> 02:44:09,600
It's alright alpha males and then

2698
02:44:09,856 --> 02:44:14,464
Cry all the time when they won't let us kill them where they were

2699
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:17,024
The cops aren't need to be protector

2700
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:18,304
F*** you.

2701
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:24,704
F*** you know what's really interesting now like

2702
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:33,408
Ida wants to talk more

2703
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:34,176
About

2704
02:44:34,944 --> 02:44:36,480
How he has a new URL

2705
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:40,832
Galaxy more focused on

2706
02:44:41,088 --> 02:44:42,368
Whatever

2707
02:44:43,136 --> 02:44:43,904
Tolerance of the

2708
02:44:44,416 --> 02:44:44,928
Criminal

2709
02:44:45,952 --> 02:44:46,976
Has conjured a nightmare

2710
02:44:51,584 --> 02:44:52,608
Legend learning yesterday

2711
02:44:53,376 --> 02:44:55,168
Any video from Bandit video

2712
02:44:56,192 --> 02:44:59,520
Build platform millions of Musa day you're sharing it

2713
02:45:00,032 --> 02:45:01,568
He's just doing

2714
02:45:01,824 --> 02:45:06,176
These new URL that are able to

2715
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:12,320
Talking about shooting

2716
02:45:17,184 --> 02:45:19,744
Sexy

2717
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,328
Yeah

2718
02:45:24,864 --> 02:45:26,400
Advertisement

2719
02:45:26,656 --> 02:45:30,752
Propaganda videos to be able to get on social media

2720
02:45:31,008 --> 02:45:31,520
Is easy

2721
02:45:31,776 --> 02:45:32,544
Existential

2722
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:34,336
His need to just

2723
02:45:34,592 --> 02:45:35,360
Justify the shooting

2724
02:45:38,176 --> 02:45:39,968
Contrast that to somebody who's

2725
02:45:40,224 --> 02:45:40,736
F******

2726
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:42,272
Businesses

2727
02:45:43,808 --> 02:45:45,344
20 or 30 more time

2728
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:46,368
You know

2729
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:51,744
Types of people pleaser good guys

2730
02:45:53,792 --> 02:45:55,072
The focus almost entirely on

2731
02:45:55,328 --> 02:45:57,632
Shooter and what he is

2732
02:45:57,888 --> 02:45:58,912
Experian

2733
02:46:05,567 --> 02:46:08,383
I thought they already shooting hunting chasing him with guns

2734
02:46:10,943 --> 02:46:11,455
Fungi

2735
02:46:12,223 --> 02:46:13,503
With a gun in his hand

2736
02:46:16,831 --> 02:46:17,599
Because he was physically

2737
02:46:23,999 --> 02:46:24,767
Walling off part

2738
02:46:27,327 --> 02:46:27,839
Forearm

2739
02:46:29,119 --> 02:46:31,679
It's just

2740
02:46:31,935 --> 02:46:35,775
Poor guy is getting me messages

2741
02:46:36,031 --> 02:46:37,567
It's no concern or care about

2742
02:46:37,823 --> 02:46:39,103
For Dad

2743
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:42,431
If you want to entertain this

2744
02:46:42,687 --> 02:46:43,711
I will give you this

2745
02:46:44,735 --> 02:46:46,271
The seventeen-year-old

2746
02:46:46,527 --> 02:46:47,807
Did not do this in a bag

2747
02:46:48,063 --> 02:46:48,575
Vacuum

2748
02:46:49,087 --> 02:46:53,951
This wasn't something that he would just self-generated this idea

2749
02:46:54,207 --> 02:46:54,719
Of course

2750
02:46:54,975 --> 02:46:55,487
He is

2751
02:46:55,743 --> 02:46:58,303
Just as much a gun as the guns

2752
02:46:58,559 --> 02:47:01,119
He was fired by all of these people

2753
02:47:01,375 --> 02:47:05,983
If you want him

2754
02:47:06,239 --> 02:47:08,031
You're still the bad guy

2755
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:11,615
So

2756
02:47:11,871 --> 02:47:16,735
How does an interesting relationship

2757
02:47:18,783 --> 02:47:24,159
That is an interesting

2758
02:47:24,671 --> 02:47:28,511
They're they're always be

2759
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:32,863
Stablish

2760
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:39,007
Order police by the ACLU much like

2761
02:47:39,263 --> 02:47:40,287
2

2762
02:47:40,543 --> 02:47:42,335
Justice

2763
02:47:42,591 --> 02:47:44,383
The protesters in Portland

2764
02:47:47,967 --> 02:47:51,295
Something like this

2765
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:55,135
I have to justify that

2766
02:48:00,767 --> 02:48:02,815
Round circular

2767
02:48:03,583 --> 02:48:06,655
The police never arrested

2768
02:48:21,759 --> 02:48:24,831
Virtue signal by arresting him for

2769
02:48:25,087 --> 02:48:26,111
Noblesville

2770
02:48:26,367 --> 02:48:26,879
Whatever

2771
02:48:30,463 --> 02:48:33,023
Good news

2772
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:34,047
Whatever

2773
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:37,631
He killed reportedly two white people so it's not going to be as bad

2774
02:48:38,911 --> 02:48:40,191
My God the whole country Woodburn

2775
02:48:43,775 --> 02:48:45,823
F*** you

2776
02:48:48,127 --> 02:48:51,967
Race

2777
02:48:52,223 --> 02:48:58,111
Is the sentence f****** Psychopaths

2778
02:48:58,367 --> 02:48:58,879
That is

2779
02:48:59,135 --> 02:48:59,647
F******

2780
02:49:00,159 --> 02:49:00,671
Beyond

2781
02:49:00,927 --> 02:49:01,951
That's crazy

2782
02:49:02,207 --> 02:49:06,559
Alex

2783
02:49:06,815 --> 02:49:07,327
How

2784
02:49:09,375 --> 02:49:11,423
Talking about how you know

2785
02:49:11,679 --> 02:49:12,703
Urine Wisconsin

2786
02:49:13,727 --> 02:49:15,263
Jacob Lake your black

2787
02:49:16,543 --> 02:49:19,359
Keebler way more likely to be shot if they're white

2788
02:49:21,407 --> 02:49:22,943
Police officers

2789
02:49:24,735 --> 02:49:25,503
The trigger the slightest thing

2790
02:49:26,015 --> 02:49:28,319
They said all the police in Wisconsin long history of

2791
02:49:31,647 --> 02:49:32,415
Statistics showing

2792
02:49:32,927 --> 02:49:34,719
In Wisconsin you're more than double likely

2793
02:49:35,231 --> 02:49:35,743
Statistically

2794
02:49:36,255 --> 02:49:37,023
Timmy shot

2795
02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:38,047
Like the black

2796
02:49:42,655 --> 02:49:44,447
Thousand

2797
02:49:45,215 --> 02:49:46,239
Are more than twice as likely

2798
02:49:46,751 --> 02:49:47,519
BS

2799
02:49:49,055 --> 02:49:49,823
BS

2800
02:49:50,335 --> 02:49:51,615
He's completely made up

2801
02:49:51,871 --> 02:49:55,455
JustFab

2802
02:49:56,991 --> 02:49:58,783
You can find some 26 about demographics

2803
02:49:59,039 --> 02:49:59,551
Come shooting

2804
02:49:59,807 --> 02:50:00,831
If you look at

2805
02:50:01,087 --> 02:50:02,879
Wisconsin in 2018 for white

2806
02:50:04,159 --> 02:50:07,231
6 out of 100,000 are killed in a shooting

2807
02:50:07,743 --> 02:50:09,023
A black people that number

2808
02:50:09,279 --> 02:50:10,559
Is 25.5

2809
02:50:11,327 --> 02:50:13,631
Maybe I was just talking about Elise related shooting

2810
02:50:14,911 --> 02:50:20,287
Associated Press reported killed in police shootings in Wisconsin

2811
02:50:22,847 --> 02:50:23,615
Three were black

2812
02:50:23,871 --> 02:50:24,639
To work

2813
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:29,759
That sounds like a situation where

2814
02:50:30,783 --> 02:50:32,319
This is not adjusted

2815
02:50:32,575 --> 02:50:33,343
Population

2816
02:50:33,855 --> 02:50:38,463
According to the 2018 census numbers Wisconsin population is 87%

2817
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:42,047
80%

2818
02:50:42,559 --> 02:50:48,703
Means that population is 87% of 68%

2819
02:50:48,959 --> 02:50:50,495
Police shooting

2820
02:50:50,751 --> 02:50:52,287
Which is disproportionate to population

2821
02:50:52,543 --> 02:50:53,055
Distribution

2822
02:50:53,823 --> 02:50:56,383
The number for police shootings

2823
02:50:56,895 --> 02:50:58,175
Not match population

2824
02:50:59,711 --> 02:51:03,807
6% of the population

2825
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:09,439
Population sees the same percent of the population represents approximately 12

2826
02:51:09,695 --> 02:51:10,463
Percent of police shooting

2827
02:51:12,255 --> 02:51:14,559
Shut up

2828
02:51:15,071 --> 02:51:20,959
Nothing to back up the both of you throwing around it's just pathetic attempt to argue that you shouldn't have to care about police brutality Direct

2829
02:51:21,215 --> 02:51:22,239
The groups who are white

2830
02:51:23,007 --> 02:51:25,055
So very boring at this point

2831
02:51:25,311 --> 02:51:26,079
If I don't

2832
02:51:26,335 --> 02:51:28,895
Like the reality I will just say it

2833
02:51:30,431 --> 02:51:31,711
Make some calls

2834
02:51:33,247 --> 02:51:37,087
The gun store

2835
02:51:41,951 --> 02:51:42,463
To buy guns

2836
02:51:46,815 --> 02:51:50,143
Makes

2837
02:51:52,191 --> 02:51:54,495
And that is the if you want to buy gun

2838
02:51:55,007 --> 02:51:56,287
You have an obligation

2839
02:51:56,543 --> 02:51:57,055
2 train

2840
02:52:05,759 --> 02:52:08,575
You're going to have a really hard time finding that in a lot of Market

2841
02:52:14,463 --> 02:52:14,975
Good stuff

2842
02:52:15,231 --> 02:52:15,743
Stop

2843
02:52:17,279 --> 02:52:17,791
Coming in

2844
02:52:18,303 --> 02:52:20,351
Ammunition going to be back until probably about

2845
02:52:21,119 --> 02:52:22,399
Book about February or March

2846
02:52:22,911 --> 02:52:23,679
A lot of preparedness

2847
02:52:24,191 --> 02:52:25,215
Forgetting ammunition info

2848
02:52:25,983 --> 02:52:27,263
Maybe be able to train and use it

2849
02:52:31,615 --> 02:52:32,639
Seriously

2850
02:52:42,367 --> 02:52:42,879
Scared of gun

2851
02:52:43,391 --> 02:52:44,671
Sound sound

2852
02:52:44,927 --> 02:52:46,207

Thank you probably minimizes that a little bit

2854
02:52:51,583 --> 02:52:55,167
I think is really weird is it like Alex should be

2855
02:52:55,679 --> 02:52:57,471
Yelling about how there's no

2856
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:59,519
Well he doesn't have a permit

2857
02:52:59,775 --> 02:53:03,103
You don't have a concealed carry for sure

2858
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:03,871
Oh that's

2859
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:10,527
Kristen brand

2860
02:53:10,783 --> 02:53:11,551
People fear

2861
02:53:11,807 --> 02:53:16,415
About

2862
02:53:16,671 --> 02:53:18,975
So why is it like now

2863
02:53:19,231 --> 02:53:19,743
Get a guy's

2864
02:53:24,095 --> 02:53:25,631
This makes no sense that is

2865
02:53:25,887 --> 02:53:27,423
That is weird

2866
02:53:27,935 --> 02:53:29,471
I guess cuz he doesn't sell guns

2867
02:53:32,287 --> 02:53:37,151
But in the same way baby

2868
02:53:37,663 --> 02:53:39,455
Big guns are flying off the shelves

2869
02:53:39,711 --> 02:53:45,855
I'm doing my job because celebrate

02:53:46,111 --> 02:53:52,255

I don't know

2872
02:53:58,143 --> 02:54:01,983
Episode

2873
02:54:04,287 --> 02:54:04,799
No no

2874
02:54:05,055 --> 02:54:05,823
Interesting guy

2875
02:54:06,079 --> 02:54:06,847
Ali Alexander

2876
02:54:07,103 --> 02:54:07,615
You bet

2877
02:54:09,663 --> 02:54:11,199
Really think Alex is trying to hire him

2878
02:54:17,087 --> 02:54:19,391
Catholics believe in

2879
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:21,439
Church on Sunday the Sabbath

2880
02:54:23,487 --> 02:54:23,999

About the restrainer

2883
02:54:33,727 --> 02:54:36,287
Do it

2884
02:54:36,543 --> 02:54:37,311
Yeah

2885
02:54:41,919 --> 02:54:47,295
Number of churches across like all sorts of denominations

2886
02:54:48,319 --> 02:54:49,855
Temple Run

2887
02:54:52,927 --> 02:54:59,071
Close

2888
02:54:59,327 --> 02:55:05,471
I know this is a social Gathering we are doing the potluck later but let's not forget the reason for the season to make sure that

2889
02:55:05,727 --> 02:55:06,751
The hell to say

2890
02:55:07,007 --> 02:55:13,151
I know

2891
02:55:21,087 --> 02:55:23,135
This train has been Unbroken

2892
02:55:24,159 --> 02:55:26,719
Nobody's had to take a smoke break and forgot

2893
02:55:26,975 --> 02:55:30,815
Left the door unlocked nobody is f***** up one time

2894
02:55:31,071 --> 02:55:31,839
0 engine

2895
02:55:32,095 --> 02:55:34,399
Nuclear weapons

2896
02:55:34,655 --> 02:55:35,679
It's very it's very weird

2897
02:55:35,935 --> 02:55:42,079
Complaining

2898
02:55:42,591 --> 02:55:44,639
Sephora

2899
02:55:45,151 --> 02:55:47,711
This is just like you guys are

2900
02:55:47,967 --> 02:55:48,735
They're f****** assholes

2901
02:55:49,247 --> 02:55:53,855
I don't want to get super religious

2902
02:55:58,463 --> 02:56:04,095
Now he is Satan and now he is

2903
02:56:14,591 --> 02:56:15,871
Alright okay

2904
02:56:16,639 --> 02:56:17,151
Alright

2905
02:56:18,175 --> 02:56:20,223
I'm fine with this show

2906
02:56:20,479 --> 02:56:24,575
Here's how I allow info

2907
02:56:24,831 --> 02:56:26,879
They are allowed to sit

2908
02:56:27,135 --> 02:56:29,439
And talk the same way that they normally are

2909
02:56:29,695 --> 02:56:31,487
However they are both

2910
02:56:31,743 --> 02:56:32,767
Thanks

2911
02:56:33,023 --> 02:56:38,399
So when they say something stupid like that everybody gets together in a throwaway f****** but a lot of

2912
02:56:38,655 --> 02:56:44,543
Every fathers trans rights

2913
02:56:45,055 --> 02:56:51,199
Bipoc causes and it has to be

2914
02:56:51,455 --> 02:56:57,599
Alex's.

2915
02:56:58,111 --> 02:56:59,903
I mean I would say

2916
02:57:00,671 --> 02:57:03,743
I resent that

2917
02:57:03,999 --> 02:57:05,279
Episode

2918
02:57:05,535 --> 02:57:06,047
Because

2919
02:57:10,143 --> 02:57:16,287
Don't call them both elves okay there's multiple races of elves come on now. You got the jharkhand

2920
02:57:16,543 --> 02:57:22,687
Elves you got the elf on the circumstances of the world

2921
02:57:22,943 --> 02:57:23,967
Operating Within

2922
02:57:24,223 --> 02:57:27,039
I mean

2923
02:57:27,295 --> 02:57:30,879
There are obviously things happened since

2924
02:57:31,135 --> 02:57:37,279
Responding more Sense Media Matters

2925
02:57:41,375 --> 02:57:42,655
When people talk about

2926
02:57:42,911 --> 02:57:43,679
Dance Connection

2927
02:57:43,935 --> 02:57:44,447
Into

2928
02:57:47,519 --> 02:57:48,799
So I assumed

2929
02:57:49,311 --> 02:57:50,079
Blow up

2930
02:57:50,335 --> 02:57:51,615
In the future,

2931
02:57:52,127 --> 02:57:53,407
If you look at just

2932
02:57:53,663 --> 02:57:54,431
This section of

2933
02:57:54,687 --> 02:57:55,199
Time

2934
02:57:56,479 --> 02:57:57,759
It's really interesting to me because

2935
02:57:58,015 --> 02:57:59,295
When I asked myself

2936
02:58:01,087 --> 02:58:01,855
Do I think

2937
02:58:02,623 --> 02:58:03,135
There is a

2938
02:58:03,391 --> 02:58:04,671
Like an actual connection

2939
02:58:06,463 --> 02:58:08,255
I don't know I don't think so

2940
02:58:08,767 --> 02:58:09,535
Like I don't

2941
02:58:09,791 --> 02:58:12,351
I think Alex is that interested in it

2942
02:58:12,863 --> 02:58:15,423
The events that are happening in Kenosha

2943
02:58:15,679 --> 02:58:17,983
Side of what he does all the time

2944
02:58:18,495 --> 02:58:19,263
Yeah

2945
02:58:19,775 --> 02:58:20,799
Feel like

2946
02:58:21,055 --> 02:58:23,871
He behaved in any way differently

2947
02:58:24,127 --> 02:58:24,895
Then he does

2948
02:58:25,407 --> 02:58:25,919
All the time

2949
02:58:26,175 --> 02:58:27,967
Yeah at the same time

2950
02:58:28,991 --> 02:58:30,271
Who's showing the 24

2951
02:58:30,527 --> 02:58:31,807
Intensely

2952
02:58:35,135 --> 02:58:37,951
Answer things that he says

2953
02:58:38,207 --> 02:58:41,279
To be able to get involved

2954
02:58:41,535 --> 02:58:42,815
And

2955
02:58:43,071 --> 02:58:46,655
100

2956
02:58:46,911 --> 02:58:49,727
Makeup buttering out to break

2957
02:58:49,983 --> 02:58:51,775
Are there a lot of things like that.

2958
02:58:54,079 --> 02:58:54,847
I think

2959
02:58:56,127 --> 02:58:59,199
Things are things that you could make a solid argument

2960
02:58:59,967 --> 02:59:00,991
Maybe the shooter

2961
02:59:04,063 --> 02:59:06,623
Yeah I don't know I think that case is thin

2962
02:59:07,647 --> 02:59:08,671
That being said

2963
02:59:08,927 --> 02:59:09,695
They don't know

2964
02:59:10,207 --> 02:59:11,487
A sentence beginning

2965
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:12,767
That's really all that important

2966
02:59:13,279 --> 02:59:15,071
I think his behavior

2967
02:59:16,095 --> 02:59:16,863
Is disgraceful

2968
02:59:19,679 --> 02:59:23,519
And it it fits the larger pattern beginning

2969
02:59:23,775 --> 02:59:24,799
He's those behaviors

2970
02:59:25,055 --> 02:59:27,871
More likely to create outcomes like that

2971
02:59:28,127 --> 02:59:28,639
Right right

2972
02:59:29,151 --> 02:59:30,431
I just see that

2973
02:59:31,199 --> 02:59:32,479
We have

2974
02:59:33,759 --> 02:59:36,063
Allowed and sat by while the most

2975
02:59:36,319 --> 02:59:39,135
Profitable media Enterprises in

2976
02:59:39,647 --> 02:59:40,927
The world are

2977
02:59:41,439 --> 02:59:42,207
Stochastic Terror

2978
02:59:44,767 --> 02:59:45,279
That's why

2979
02:59:45,535 --> 02:59:47,327
So

2980
02:59:49,631 --> 02:59:50,655
To me it's just like

2981
02:59:52,703 --> 02:59:53,727
Who you want to blame it on

2982
02:59:57,823 --> 02:59:58,335
You know

2983
02:59:58,591 --> 02:59:59,615
As it is for the

2984
02:59:59,871 --> 03:00:00,895
To agree posted that

2985
03:00:01,407 --> 03:00:02,687
Militia article

2986
03:00:03,967 --> 03:00:05,759
If this happened two weeks from now

2987
03:00:06,015 --> 03:00:06,783
Then maybe

2988
03:00:07,039 --> 03:00:09,599
Carlsen would have posted

2989
03:00:10,111 --> 03:00:13,695
It has nothing to do with individually these people are absorbed

2990
03:00:13,951 --> 03:00:15,231
Information from

2991
03:00:15,487 --> 03:00:16,511
Because they're all getting it

2992
03:00:17,535 --> 03:00:21,887
Picture of the

2993
03:00:22,143 --> 03:00:25,471
Ecosystem is far more important than the Chicago plant

2994
03:00:25,727 --> 03:00:30,335
And because I mean there was a time

2995
03:00:30,591 --> 03:00:33,663
Be far more confident in tracing

2996
03:00:33,919 --> 03:00:36,223
Prince

2997
03:00:36,479 --> 03:00:38,783
That's not really the case

2998
03:00:39,039 --> 03:00:40,063
So much

2999
03:00:40,319 --> 03:00:42,879
It's like

3000
03:00:43,135 --> 03:00:49,279
Dick could have got me directly from the goddamn

3001
03:00:49,535 --> 03:00:55,679
If you want to deal with stochastic terrorist believe it on Truck 2

3002
03:00:55,935 --> 03:00:57,471
And the thing that I think

3003
03:00:57,727 --> 03:01:00,031
But I keep coming back to on

3004
03:01:00,287 --> 03:01:04,639
Is that these articles in the people who were trying to make

3005
03:01:05,151 --> 03:01:05,663
I get it

3006
03:01:05,919 --> 03:01:06,943
I don't think they're wrong

3007
03:01:07,199 --> 03:01:07,711
I think it's in

3008
03:01:07,967 --> 03:01:09,503
Complete and I think

3009
03:01:10,015 --> 03:01:12,063
I think that's a better conversation to have

3010
