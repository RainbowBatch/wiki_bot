00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:32,768

6
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:45,568

Playing the game correctly

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,328
In that they want to torture you

26
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120

8 or 9 on Thursday 8 p.m.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
On Thursday

41
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
Whoa but here's the thing it's

42
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Kind of b*******

43
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
What

44
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:56,128
Yeah because Alex Jones wasn't Manning a lot of it so you have like him doing his own show

45
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,456
And then periodically they drop him Special Report

46
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,856
Does pre-taped losing his mind at 3 in the morning

47
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
See him gradually get

48
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
More and more one

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Very drunk

50
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,280
Yeah even when

51
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
Beyond what humans can do

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
He's at

53
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,448
27 hours and they're still seven more to go

54
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
Hot

55
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
In the background of the video just like map

56
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,568
The nature of David Knight like

57
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
David Knight should have read him a story

58
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,296
You want people to stick around

59
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,648
Paul Joseph Watson who's in London

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
Until like he could just man some off-hours really that weird for him

61
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,728
He may be a robot sleep at the other way it doesn't matter

62
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,288
You have these things in like

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
Rob do staring at the

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
The camera with his eyes

65
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
The nature of a Telethon

66
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Is

67
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
This

68
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
Tension of candy maker

69
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:11,136
Yeah that's why Jerry's telephones back in the day were fun because celebrities

70
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Frazee hours

71
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
Any black guys on his last few

72
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
And Alex didn't engage with that

73
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,631
As a genre of the telephone

74
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
But you did

75
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,703
Adhere to the ohfuck

76
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,751
Let's try and products as hard as we can

77
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,591
Good every hour they played a 10-minute thing

78
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,151
Of him just it was just Alex

79
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Free tape

80
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,295
We like to joke around

81
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,135
Is the globalist

82
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
It was a disaster

83
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,487
It was so embarrassing but

84
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,839
The Telethon did include appearances from our friend Mike cernovich

85
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,655
Greg who's now an official Infowars employee

86
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,679
Wonderful

87
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
I'm so glad that

88
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,543
Sevierville is really enjoying together into a gelatinous

89
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
Choose of monstrous

90
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,663
A lot of my theories are starting to come together about these consolidation

91
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
We have

92
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,759

93
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,063

102
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
Anfo

103
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,151

108
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
So you have that at the rebel media

109
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,975

You have

114
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
Game over here

115
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679
Rebel media up in Canada

Did the Canadian companies

117
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,543
They're influencing our politics as a foreign company

118
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
I don't know it's very murky.

119
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,199
Be people the rebel media

120
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
The southern

Baked Alaska

122
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,319
They are getting paid

123
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,647
By some organization Weatherby Rebel Media or

124
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Some other

00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
Organization

00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
Counter protest

127
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
In Berkeley

128
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,375
Like they're getting paid for their coverage and organization of these

129
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
Anti antifa riot

130
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
That are going on in Berkeley

131
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
Actually paper

132
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
Exactly

133
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
And if put and it's swell

134
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,343
It's so obvious and overt that it's almost

135
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
Blase to call out

136
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,743
Your company is paying you to incite violence

137
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
You're not a paid protester you're a journalist

138
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,887
It's kind of that we're development office

139
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
F******

140
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
It's terrible

141
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,775
But he also had appearances on the telephone from our friends

142
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311

Yep explicable how to destroy the world

145
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,807
I had no idea that that was the Playbook

146
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:26,207
His team he was on

147
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
Find appearance by comparison

148
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:38,239
Why is Ron Paul doing I don't know

149
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
I think he is

150
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Ignite

151
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Is what I would say

152
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
He's like

153
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
He's like an aw-shucks

154
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
I'll do it for you Alex

155
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
You just seem like a good ol fella I think that's a piece of it gets a lot of mileage out of his sort of cartoon

156
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,159
Okay old man voice

157
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
Cuz I think the people were like a little bit

158
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,511
He's not he's not up to something he's just

159
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
Quirky old man

160
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
I think there's some of that but here's the most

161
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,703
Originally supposed to be a 30 hour marathon

162
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
That would end

163
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
At the end of The Alex Jones

164
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Show

165
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
On Thursday

166
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,383
Yes he has a 4-Hour show

167
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
Start at the beginning Go 24 hours

168
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
I guess it was maybe supposed to be 28

169
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,855
Or maybe it was supposed to include the 325 live after Alex who cares

170
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
The Anchorman

171
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
On Thursday

172
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
He did the whole thing

173
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,143
He did the last hour

174
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,615
Is it there at all

175
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,687
He still hasn't put it up I know

176
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
I was

177
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,879
And I realize that my mouth was making the words I was trying to say no picture

178
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:04,511
Which is not good 30th power this Marathon episode

179
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,351
It was all a crock of s***

180
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Jon rappoport

181
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
Report was boring we don't need to go over it

182
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
It's

183
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
Toothless in many ways

184
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
To play it was really all about

185
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,599
Insanely about selling products out of context drop

186
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Alex Jones

187
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
Marketing pitch

188
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,911
A person was wearing my shirt

189
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,727
I think the Paul Joseph Watson

190
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
T-shirt is great

191
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
For women

192
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
Dudes don't wear dudes on their shirts

193
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
It's gay

194
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Obviously

195
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919
That's what are you playing

196
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
Basically

197
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
You don't want

198
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
Alright whatever Alex

199
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Are you all right

200
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
I just

201
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,679
As if you were going to take a note

202
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
I don't even understand that

203
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
That

204
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Toxic masculinity

205
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
Cauliflower

206
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,407
Don't worry dude space on your shirt like what about all the

207
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Face on there

208
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,367
Now admittedly Paul Joseph

209
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Blick

210
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
I've never seen

211
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:43,583
I'm guessing that's why

212
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,143
Episode where Alex Jones

213
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Very

214
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
Clothes like very was

215
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
Toeing the line

216
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
Call Joseph

217
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,687
He's really good-looking male I think I think that that was Gavin McGinnis you think

218
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:05,087
Washed overtimes material

219
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
I guess that would apply to pjw

220
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
16 years

221
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,351
I'm not saying that for other reasons not that one

222
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,679
Our episodes

223
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,079
Recovering the Wednesday and Thursday episode of The Alex Jones program contained within the

224
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Gotcha

225
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
So

226
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
Mostly Wednesday

227
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
Cuz Thursday is a little weird

228
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
But I want to start with Thursday

229
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,623
Cuz this is our 26 of the marathon and then we're going to go back

230
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,183
To Wednesday and we'll touch back on Thursday a little

231
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
I want to start with this

232
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,303
Because podcast

233
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Just because

234
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
I want to start with this topic

235
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
Because it makes

236
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Me so happy

237
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
On Thursday

238
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
An article came out in BuzzFeed

239
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
A guy named Charlie warzel

240
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,199
He have been doing amazing coverage on Twitter of Alex Jones custody

241
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
City battle

242
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,063
And it turns out he has been researching Alex Jones has passed

243
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
In the way that you and I

244
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Head really wanted

245
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,303

LinkedIn

247
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,567
So we were about to go down this path

248
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,223
Cuz this guy did it for us an amazing piece of Journalism

249
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503

But that would be really cool on Thursday this article came out

253
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
And of course

254
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
There's a lot of news in the world

255
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Alex Jones

256
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
That's take up

257
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,335
A bunch of his program to talk about it

258
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,919
He's going to talk more about

259
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
Jones related

260
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
Turn on Alex Jones

261
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,575

264
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,071
But I want you to see what he's focusing on

265
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
In this clip

266
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
I think it's I think it's pretty important

267
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
Kristoff BuzzFeed

268
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,751

269
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151

By BuzzFeed

276
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
I read this article.

277
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
And it's literally

278
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
95%

279
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:26,047
I guess make it look like it's real

280
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
Little stories in there

281
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,191
Totally made-up

282
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
Yorkie

283
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:44,991
They didn't talk about my dog

From Shipping loves you so much

287
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,191
I have a fake voice

288
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,847
I've openly said I criticize it

289
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,943
I don't want to be

290
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,679
Voice I have a raspy voice I've been to

291
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,807
He wants to be a

292
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
Wasn't wasn't high voice

293
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,927
And screaming

294
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
Had to go to specialist

295
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:06,655
A bird

296
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447

00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:14,847
Big dicks

298
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:26,111
Why are you picking on little old Alex Jones look at all of my problems

299
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,183
Choosing one paragraph from BuzzFeed

300
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
To discuss

301
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,279
Disgusting during the Obama years

302
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,351
Others close to Jones during the time said that

303
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
Rolling audio

304
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,423
Against the broadcaster was insecure

305
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,519
Two former colleagues that Jones Reserve his greatest resentment for Rush Limbaugh

306
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
The jealousy was so intense that Jones began to

307
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
The creep his now-famous Crush

308
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Gravel-voiced

309
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
From the talk show Legend

310
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,503
We spent weeks getting everything just right in the studio

311
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,783
Former employee recall

312
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,343
Then he'd go for a drive and hear rushing

313
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,159
I need my voice to sound something like that

314
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,487
And so we completely re-engineer the sound to make him gruffudd

315
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
So

316
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Listen

317
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
Who cares

318
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
It's the most

319
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
Irrelevant thing in this entire article

320
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
These

321
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
Infowars employees that they got to speak to them

322
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
Or all anonymous

323
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
FaceTime lifetime non-disclosure

324
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,695
I'm so he can deny Flatley everything that these people say

325
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,511
Panino's but they won't come out no ice

326
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,583
He knows it'll never get proof cuz then those people

327
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:46,751
It's not what I feel like

328
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,823
It's a thing you can willingly enter

329
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
The part of

330
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,431
Anyway

331
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,271
Is there a moral Authority

332
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:05,439
Good points has nothing to do with some more stuff from this article

333
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,231
I want to close out this clip because

334
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
I am so funny

335
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,455
Lost control

336
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Sexier

337
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
Shed

338
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
Re-engineer the sound

339
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
To make me rough

340
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
I don't like my voice

341
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
Voice

342
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
The only people who like my voice

343
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:29,919
Get ladies wet they said on speakers while I scream about the globalist

344
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,503
He's going I just did like a 45-minute

345
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,295
Bit about my voice

346
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Israel

347
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
Polyps

348
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,183
Probably isn't going to engage with like the

349
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
The meat

350
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:46,303
Criticisms even like the article

351
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,399
Itself is called Alex Jones will never stop being Alex Jones

352
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,799
That's it

353
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
About not about how he's fake

354
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
It's about how he can't stop himself from being himself

355
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
Right

356
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
His Own Worst Enemy

357
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Essentially

358
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,575
The real problem is that he's too real

359
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
This voice stuff Ergo I'm going

360
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
How to reduce

The next week he brought Alex in for a meeting

381
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
Just secure Jones a spot on the station

The first it sounds first on a response

384
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
So

385
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:16,416
All of his complaints about people like taking shortcuts that and all this

386
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
Isn't it

387
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:24,352
Hire these made a lot of good moves

388
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,960
ISM into a whole lot more than most absolutely all of it comes from his dad

389
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
That's super f***** up

390
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:36,640
The more we learn about his growth is

391
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
Daddy issue

392
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Mommy is

393
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,992
Here's a little thing about a personality

394
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
That is back in the

395
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
Kjfk days

396
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Remember Jones

397
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,184

00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:03,520
And an Austin Chronicle article from July 2006 multiple Public Access producers

402
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
You claim quote

403
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,616
That Jones has used both ACAC policy

A legal Maneuvers to intimidate them

405
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
Or get them thrown off the air

406
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
He claims the globalist

407
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
And AC DC

408
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344
Is always back

409
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368

An early Jones critic and frequent Target of Joneses early Ranch set not the big one

412
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,960
And for Alex it was

413
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
Was always

414
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
Always about you go

415
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,080
When he got that validation there was no going back

416
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
That's on someone who was

417
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,176
Involved with him early on

418
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
Quote

419
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
This

420
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,856
Is a nice confirmation of something we've discussed and a theory we've had

421
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
Yes

422
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
Sometimes he'll say he has sources

423
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,048
He's been told a piece of news has been confirmed but we wouldn't have that information

Later we find out that it was because a week earlier we had to call her on-air who theorized about something and Alex repeat

428
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
It's true

429
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,408
It's true we figured it out

430
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
Literally seeing that

Believe that every country that believes in Islam is the house of Islam

And everything outside of it is

00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
The house of War

438
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,472
And there needs to be war on all of these

439
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496
These places

Repeatedly

Nothing

443
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,504
He never said it before that guy on the street

444
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,808
It's crazy you don't

445
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,344
Things that key like that

446
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
That he likes the people

447
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440

Professor and researcher at the University of Washington accidentally stumbled upon Infowars digital footprint

Yeah that's great that's perfect

454
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:24,576
She found that a specific rumor that Navy Seals have carried out the attack was largely attributed

Unlink

456
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,416
Second only to YouTube

457

At the time we thought this was pretty insignificant

458
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,280
Countryside but things look very different

459
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
In hindsight

460
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,120

Call myself out

464
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,456

00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
2013

475
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
Wow

476
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,360
Another source puts that number closer to 10 million dollars

477
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,688
And this was before the popularity Jones and Infowars enjoyed today

478
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
The store camp

479
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528

Two former employees

487
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
Alleged that Jones would instruct

488
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,936
Staff to find products that were failing

489
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,752
And convince them to whittle their margins to almost nothing

490
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,544
In exchange for the Infowars endorsement

491
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,848
Quote Alex's business model was

492
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,176
Are these companies that a low rate in lock-in exclusivity

493
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
The former staffer said

494
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,272
Noting that attaching the Infowars brand to a Prada

495
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,344
Often destroyed a seller's future prospects to go Maine

Stream

497
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
For some employees

498
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,208
The shift from what they saw is acris

499
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,000
A crusader journalism

500
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,072
The content marketing for colloidal silver with jarring

501
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,400
Quote it became a moral issue issue for me one said

502
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680

503
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
Okay well f*** that guy

504
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
No he quit

505
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,872
Quit because it went from equipped because he was like

506
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:31,552
Is all about the conservative ideals in the fight against global

507
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:36,160
But I think you could make a much better

508
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,440
For being involved in

509
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
At that point

510
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
Then once again

Colloidal silver

512

Like that's unacceptable

513
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:48,192
Having a conservative beliefs and believing that this guy is on the Vanguard of that

514
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:53,312
It's understandable know he's conservative beliefs

515
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
You know like it's

516
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,200
No I'm not going to be on the east side

Order I don't know

519
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
The point

520
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
More former staffers

521
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:11,232
Suggested that this influx of money inspired the greatest change in Jones demeanor

Quotes

523
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,072
It's become less about affecting change

And more about being Sensational and making money one ex-employee explain

525
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
It didn't start out that way

526
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,056
He was a lovely person to hang around for a long time but that soon if accurate evaporated

527

Punching out walls

Two former employees recall that after an employee left the company Jones would call a staff

Pull up YouTube videos of their work

543

Quote Jones rewards the people who buy in all the way one former employee said

547
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,984
But there's an expectation

548
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
Not to contradict

549
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
Him or the message

550
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664

Ocean isn't going to reward

558
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
People that buy

559
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,192
I used to work at Groupon and if we had a meeting after someone last

560

And they were like making fun of how bad their work was

00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,176
That kind of environment is hostile

564
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,456
That's abuse

565
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:12,320
And the idea that the implication is that when you leave we will do this to you

566
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,368
Keep people in line that's cult Behavior

567
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:24,352
Though

568
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:28,448
Union implications of that

569
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,984
That's different than just like

570
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,872
Will restock the shelves because it is

571
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,688
Sort of creative work in terms of Infowars

572
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,528
Even if you are creative

573
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
Right it's different than stock

574
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,088
Anyway

575
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Here is a quote

576
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,464
That really gets into the last paragraph summary

577
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,744
Amazing

578
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
But this one is about

579
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:58,144
It sorta validates a lot of the theories we have about the political landscape right now

580
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,680
According to one person

581
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,728
Some president for Studio on election

582
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
The 2016

583
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,104
Jones boasted of having 18 billion km in

584
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
Quotes

585
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,664
Now Jones is probably exaggerating

586
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,992
The Source said

587
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,296
Serious influence if you can get them voting

588
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
Alex doesn't have list

589
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
Get followers

590
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
The audience Jones

591
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
Spent decades building

592
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208
It finally made its presence known

593
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,024
Hit Rally's on social media and finally at the poles

594
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,352
Quotes that rule vote for Trump nobody saw coming

595
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
The Source continued

596
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,168
It wasn't only Alex

597
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:34,752
But I think you can describe a significant portion many first-time voters

598
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,032
Of those votes to him

599
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Quote

600
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,360
He's like the girdles of 2016

601
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408
Another longtime Jones Associates

602
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
He really want the election

603
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
Trump

604
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
Why we are here

605
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,952
Like

606
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:59,840
Weeds that noise out pretty quick the article also goes on to say that he probably didn't want to drop to win

607
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Because then

608
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,424
Liberals in charge we got a defense

609
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,032
Conservatism

610
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,312
Because Trump won

611
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,128
You have to shift his his shift has been

612
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
Jarring

613
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,224
Almost certainly due to that

614
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,992
Extra

615
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Influence

616
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,552
And extra visibility

617
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,624
That's where all of these lost his lawsuit since

618
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,976
President we had the the Liberals to rail against

619
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:32,352
None of this s*** will be coming on if we be getting sued by Hillary

620
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,680
I mean Google

621
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
If

622
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,544
That I mean

623
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
It's much more

624
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,456
Like I don't think there's any surprise

625
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
To the timing of

626
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Giovanni's

627
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,552
Once once

628
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
People started watching

629
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,392
No actually it did that's not I don't think

630
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
Certification

631
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,000
I think that the timing of the lawsuit coincides with

632
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,304
The closure of the

633
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Court case

634
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
They had to do with

635
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888
The children

636
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
In Twin Falls

637
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
Idaho

638
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:13,824
That case that case and recently

639
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
They wanted a retraction

640
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:21,760
Alex did his b******* because he's influential

641
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,040
What's happening at the

642
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
Same time

643
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Very public custom

644
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
Yes

645
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,416
Gotcha and I think it's very unfortunate time

646
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
Let's marry

647
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:33,536
Stevens

648
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
What's in this article

649
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:38,144
Go back to Alex returning from breaking

650
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Send to any of it

651
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
Suddenly sounds different

652
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,408
Coronavirus

653
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,040
Either they're there their leader of there

654
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,088
He's referring to like private message

655
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
Messages between

656
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,416
BuzzFeed writers they were joking about the ID

657
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,560
It's probably inappropriate but at the same time it's not like

658
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,608
Inappropriate

659
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656
Just goofing off in private message

660
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,472
Yeah it does you mean like normal people are doing every

661
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,496
Single goddamn Day on

662
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
Sure

663
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
For several months

664
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,920
College my first job

665
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,344
To make something up

666
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,672
Is that I'm not an actor

667
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:46,240
I didn't want Obama to be defeated in 2012

668
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,288
That

669
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
My voice is Trey

670
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,384
The producers

671
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:59,296
Voice is annoying time

672
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:11,840
Where would you think about record

673
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
Rush Limbaugh

674
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
Went deaf

675
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,384
No that's at work

676
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,432
High pitch low voice

677
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:32,832
Weaver mobile

678
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,792
Graph filter

679
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:55,616
Who cares why are you fighting this battle

680
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
Look

681
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
Nobody

682
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,808
Valise

683
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,624
An interesting or important thing in that article

684
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,928
If it was if it was anybody else I would

685
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,976
This is a diss track

686
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,304
From dealing with the reality of the article

687
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,424
I think this is 100% the thing he is most angry about

688
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,008
You guys are saying that I wanted to change my voice

689
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
Just sounds like that guy

690
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,336
F*** you

691
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:31,968
Part of it that's that and then I think the other part is just that it naturally fits into his narrative he's already

692
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,504
Spinning about like people think

693
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,552
You've actor with the kids

694
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,368
His lawyer said

695
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
It's because I go this

696
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:46,048
Matches good finding pieces of things that fit what he's already doing and then just sort of incorporate

697
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
Bring them in

698
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,120
He's kind of like a bulshit

699
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Black hole

700
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:55,008
But just put a black hole

701
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
Yeah absolutely

702
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
So

703
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
He goes on another like

704
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:04,224
A couple minutes talking about his voicemail least like 10 minutes covering that nothing about this

705
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,016
Substantial

706
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:10,112
A lot of his Thursday show

707
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
Now let's go

708
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:19,072
Somebody said my voice doesn't sound right yeah among many other way worse than

709
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:25,472
Gas discussing whether or not my voice clips from The Joe Rogan

710
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,568
Podcast you guys know what I sound like what I'm not on Infowars

711
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:36,992
We've got this BS Mike cernovich, then talk about voices great

712
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
Every guest

713
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:43,136
Discussing what their voice sounds like cernovich coming in to talk about how my list is real

714
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,928
It's insane

715
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,424
Israel is everybody else's that cuz they're made

716
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,496
Bromley real American made

717
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,288
Headed teeth removed

718
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,944
Melt it down and then rebuilt into teeth and put them back in his company these are Americana.

719
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,344
Exactly that's what's important about Rappaport

720
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
George Washing

721
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:18,976
Wow

722
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
These Anza

723
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,840
The b******* but let's go National Treasure 3

724
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
Let's get those

725
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,216
I am still seriously waiting for National Treasure

726
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,032
I'm very excited for to eventually come out

727
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:38,432
Is there only two there is National Treasure in the National Treasure Book of Secrets

728
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,224
I've actually sort of written aspects

729
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,112
4-quart Lisa outline do with Nicolas Cage

730
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
Also known as Benjamin Franklin gay

731
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
In the movie

732
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,488
Is that a character's name

733
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:57,888
It's real tight there I guess that must have like just broke in my brain to the point where I just skipped

734
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
That's Nicolas Cage

735
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
His name

736
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,752
In every movie Nicolas Cage is in

737
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,080
Nicolas Cage

738
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,664
You find that the Napoleon never died and was actually taken

739
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,968
Are you from space

740
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:16,320
He's been planning ahead like he's going to take over America

741
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
But the secret

742
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,648
In order to like a plan

743
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
How to stop him

744
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,488
Are underground in Arlington

745
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,144
So in order to get to these plan I love you got to become president and then faked his own death

746
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,544
To get underground at Arlington Cemetery get the plans and stop space Napoleon

747
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,568
To become president

748
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:42,176
Regardless of the rest of that

749
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:48,576
Treasure three should have absolutely has to become president but as a con

750
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,952
Becoming president is incidental to his plan somehow

751
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,512
Anyway

752
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,048
President 60 Seconds

753
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,840
Yep I want

754
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,168
First of all I would love it if that was the point

755
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,264
Even if it's not I need a third when I love those movies so much

756
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,544
But let's go back now

757
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
2 Wednesday

758
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
The Telethon

759
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,408
Wednesday

760
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
12

761
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,712
A clock set for 11

762
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,248
Central Central

763
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
Alex Jones

764
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Take them things off

765
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,600
He starts off Wednesday show

766
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,880
Very weird

767
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
Very weird

768
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,976
This is the opening of the the Telethon

769
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah

770
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:32,352
Something really strange

771
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,120
And Alex

772
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,936
Add the trend that I think

773
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,728
Is going to Blossom

774
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,264
In the coming weeks and months

775
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,568
And that is

776
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
That wasn't ever

777
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:47,200
I got this to say Trump is really going office trajectory more more

778
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,280
Here's the deal

779
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,072
Trump is draining the swamp

780
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
Polly Pocket

781
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,704
He's like fighting the big Crime Boss

782
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,104
Power level down

783
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,248
He's looking in the eyes of the devil

784
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,856
He is slowly becoming them

785
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,672
100% first 30 days

786
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:33,792
Was it 95%

787
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:42,752
Havoline quick lube

788
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,040
These are real things

789
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:01,440
Getting big bag of small businesses they arguing that

790
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,352
So you can't

791
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,144
Bring up that

792
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,984
What is Obamacare

793
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
What I want to plan a visit before the house-passed know about that guy

794
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,992
He's not yet jerking off about how do you feel

795
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,064
Break cuz I'm broke on the Thursday show

796
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,880
Or was it

797
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,464
Whatever

798
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,488
Get into it

799
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,096
Send it

800
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,168
So in that saying

801
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
First of all it's amazing

802
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,984
Restarting to give Levi

803
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,032
Track frame to get off the Trump

804
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:54,175
Bandwagon

805
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,503
The things that he's still holding water for things that aren't real

806
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,087
Nothing.

807
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
That's

808
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
One true thing

809
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,927
In that list of stuff you saying

810
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
He's done

811
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:12,095
Like I guess I didn't see that we withdrew from the

812
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,167
Little Rock

813
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,519
But it's it doesn't Kate and there were a lot of people who want that it probably will

814
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:24,895
Happen if it hasn't already

815
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,687
We're not working at better deals with China

816
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,783
Unless you consider all the trademarks they've given Trump personally

817
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,647
Beyond

818
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Panthers

819
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,695
It's just it can't

820
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:42,815
Cuz it's impossible and stupid came out and said they would consider it a hostile Act

821
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
It would be

822
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:50,495
It doesn't get more hostile than building a f****** wall across a border

823
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:56,895
India and Pakistan are really good friends because of that giant wall on their f****** border

824
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,271
So the other thing that sort of a chav

825
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,831
Build a new wall

826
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:09,183
Shut up

827
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,255
Commercial credit score

828
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,559
Play Dragon versus

829
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,351
Space Napoleon is a great

830
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
Is a great movie

831
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,935
The true comedy of it though is that like

832
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,983
I've talked to a number of people who support Trump

833
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:27,103
Support about the building wall is they think it will block drugs

834
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,383
Coming into the country

835
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,943
Not realizing the drug dealers have lots of boats

836
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
An airplane

837
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,247
And most of the drugs.

838
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:38,367
Get smuggled into the country don't come through the Border like that

839
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:44,767
And build a taller wall and there's tunnels underneath the Border it's insane

840
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:51,423
I like lasers

841
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,519
Electric fence

842
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,799
If you want a 6

843
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
Cesspool

844
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,871
That is

845
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
Impossible

846
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,687
On the Mexico United

847
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
Dig

848
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
What

849
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
20 miles Underground

850
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,903
Set off a nuclear warhead

851
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,207
And hope volcano show up ever

852
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:14,975
Every single f******

853
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
On the ground

854
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
Otherwise

855
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,327
You're not building a

856
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
F****** wall

857
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,423
Also the idea that it's going to stop

858
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,775
What motivates a lot of people cuz the opiate crisis

859
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:32,383
By the way they're reducing funding for that

860
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:38,783
You see that overseas helping people with the LPR type of drug control office

861
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,063
55%

862
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,111
The budget

863
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,903
That was proposed

864
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,743
Hayirli dismantle a lot of the organization

865
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,023
Responsible

866
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,327
For helping fight the opioid crisis

867
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
Kissimmee country

868
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,655
So everybody who supports

869
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,935
You need to look at

870
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,959
The f****** mirror

871
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
Trump doesn't give a s*** about opiate

872
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,055
He doesn't care of your family they're struggling

873
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
You don't care that yourself

874
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639
He cares about bigotry

875
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,919
He cares about

876
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,199
Symbolic

877
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
Hatred

878
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,527
Yep hears about this idea of promoting

879
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,855
Fear but Above All Else

880
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
What does

881
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
He care about

882
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Dan

883
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,511
White nationalism making his own f******

884
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,351
That's true

885
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
Out of Alex Jones

886
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,191
Making a lot of money out of fear

887
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:32,287
I think that there is a part of these may be inspired by Alex a little bit

888
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,359
The only thing I want to say about the

889
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,919
Okay and this I think it's a discussion

890
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,247
Themselves

891
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,063
See that's kind of my thing I want to

892
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,367
I I want have compassion

893
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
Right

894
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
Because

895
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,999
It's very clear that all of these

896
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
These people who voted for

897
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Where

898
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
Deluding themselves

899
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,119
Into thinking he was at

900
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
Very very

901
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,959
Yeah and no matter how many times we told him

902
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,495
He was the thing they thought he was

903
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
They didn't believe

904
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
They have

905
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,919
Begin to know that he's not that thing

906
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,967
Just like just like Alex Jones

907
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,295
He's gotten off track for what we thought he was going

908
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:20,415
Has kind of a Bellwether starting to turn on you

909
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,695
Them shitz

910
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:26,303
Until I think it's also an indication that he knows that something bad's,

911
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
Like

912
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
Well

913
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,399
He's his sources rdt Junior

914
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:34,495
Will not work

915
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,823
Rodger Stone all the f****** time

916
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
Give

917
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,127
In big trouble

918
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,455
He's a big escapes this one I mean

919
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:49,343
I mean he's a slippery dude he survived a lot of political just feelings

920
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,623
Seeking Asylum

921
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,647
Rather than

922
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
Actually doing it

923
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,743
If anybody is smart they will take

924
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,095
Now let me ask you a question

925
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,655
One smart

926
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
No

927
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:10,847
They really smart people working behind the scenes that we are unaware of

928
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,943
Here's here's the one thing though

929
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
Right

930
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,295
They are getting f***** by Trump and the Republic

931
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,831
Can today voted for faith

932
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,135
First

933
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,375
There is no there's no middle ground

934
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
Devote

935
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,935
For the people

936
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,983
Who are going to murder them

937
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
Right

938
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,567
I want to feel compassion

939
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,871
And for them because I don't want people to get

940
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,407
Pray time

941
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,967
The same time there is that part of my brain that

942
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
F***

943
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,343
We're going to die

944
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,487
It's not like it's a it's not a situation where they've only doomed themselves they've doomed the rest of us

945
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,791
Themselves more ice

946
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,375
Look for you and I are people who are in a position where if

947
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,679
You know we have pre-existing condition

948
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,703
The most

949
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:13,055
Point where our mental health especially will go off the rails

950
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:13,823
Real hard

951
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
If we don't have

952
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,383
If we don't have

953
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,407
Certain protection

954
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:22,015
Here's the thing I know that I sound maybe a little optimistic

955
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,111
That with the outpouring of attention

956
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,903
People calling

957
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,183
Senators

958
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:34,047
I I don't think there's any way that a bill including that stuff would ever pass

959
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,703
I don't think so either all of the stuff that I don't think has happened or what happened

960
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:45,311
Hold on

961
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,639
I'll be goddamned if I'm terrified by like 9

962
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,455
A little bit

963
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,527
Do you think that Alex Jones is just dipping his toe

964
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,063
In the water of trump

965
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,879
Denial

966
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,231
I don't

967
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,559
I don't think he is he's really into coil

968
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,863
Eddie goes on to say a little more right here

969
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:13,215
The Gorgon

970
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:18,335
Just remind everybody

971
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Redundant

972
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,175
Last year on November 8th

973
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,735
Absolutely not

974
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
Absolutely

975
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
It's still

976
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:52,895
How he can be so good and do so much good

977
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,711
So much to expose political correctness

978
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,671
And then start going sideways it makes it even worse cellular gut-level dozen

979
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,999
Well I mean like let's talk about him exposing political correct

980
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,327
In the past Donald Trump has threatened to sue people over joke

981
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:16,703
In the past

982
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,519
Convicted for laughing

983
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:27,967
Totally f***** up

984
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,271
Let me give a tiny discrepancy

985
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,575
I'm totally against

986
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,391
This woman being convicted or jailed

987
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,439
But that's different than Trump

988
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,535
Suing somebody about making a joke about

989
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:45,887
In this case you can hide behind a very cowardly explanation that this lady was

990
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,911
Was disrupting

991
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,959
Senate proceedings or something like that

992
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:53,567
I know it's dumb but you can make

993
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
Consider that are

994
00:50:56,127 --> 00:51:00,991
You are superb

995
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,039
Whereas with shop he's literally

996
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:09,439
Talked about suing newspapers that publish bad things about him ranked priebus was on a TV

997
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,975
You saying that they're talking about

998
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,791
Opening things up so you can sue the Press

999
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:20,191
Percent of the First Amendment

1000
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:20,959
The most

1001
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:24,543
The negative stuff we talked about with political correctness

1002
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,335
This is Way Beyond

1003
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,383
Be saying don't say tranny

1004
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:35,295
Compared to I'm going to sue you for writing something I don't like

1005
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,135
I'm going to sue you for saying tranny instead of

1006
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,415
Right

1007
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
Bucked up

1008
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,255
It's so simple

1009
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,303
Both sides need to protect

1010
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,351
Right because all you have to

1011
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:54,495
To do is like the religious liberty ship that they wanted like you should be allowed to

1012
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,055
Discriminate based on

1013
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
That is

1014
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,359
Good for you

1015
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,175
America is

1016
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,223
Always a Christian Nation

1017
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:09,855
It's the same Obama expanding spying in space

1018
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,135
It's all good because then

1019
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,207
Right right that kind of

1020
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,767
Obviously

1021
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,815
Stop

1022
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,839
Divorce Yourself

1023
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,887
From your b******* ideology

1024
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,703
You don't want the

1025
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,983
He's religious freedom bill.

1026
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,287
Nope because an even worse

1027
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:32,127
I don't believe in any of that religious bulshit

1028
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,247
But you don't want me you it's like you don't want to do a religious freedom Bill there

1029
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,527
Cuz then

1030
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,551
Take over

1031
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,343
Bucking we can do the same shift

1032
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,463
Do you write English

1033
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,047
This is me

1034
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,839
This is never going to pass the course

1035
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,375
Like it is

1036
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,423
Well I know that

1037
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:01,055
That is the wildcard

1038
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,335
This wouldn't be into this

1039
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:05,151
Because it does it would violate the Civil Right

1040
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,991
It's so mad to me the bullseye are not like

1041
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,783
They don't understand that fine distinction

1042
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
It is

1043
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
You passed this

1044
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,367
This religious liberty

1045
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,415
Implicit inside

1046
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,975
If you're a business

1047
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,999
And your beliefs

1048
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,535
Is the black people

1049
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,327
You can just say no black

1050
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,631
Yep that's where we will be

1051
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,655
If this passes

1052
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,447
If the exact same logic

1053
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,239
This is not a slippery slope

1054
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,543
This is just the application

1055
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,311
Of the lodge

1056
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,383
Take the replace with

1057
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:42,783
Is lgbtq now you have Jim Crow laws is absolutely discriminatory will never it will never pass

1058
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,647
Attorney generals have come out across the country sayings

1059
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,671
That if it does

1060
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,695
Get implemented

1061
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,975
We will immediately

1062
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:56,095
Brighten so it will be a huge fight and there's no way that can pass and if it does

1063
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Again

1064
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,399
Bedlam

1065
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,679
It will be fire in the

1066
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:05,311
That's the thing I kind of I am a little surprised we're not already at fire in the

1067
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,615
Cuz we got this nice wine

1068
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,919
Because we have

1069
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,199
Many

1070
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
Distractions

1071
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,991
To keep us from

1072
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,439
The time will come

1073
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
Yeah it's on

1074
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,999
See that's the thing though

1075
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,959
I agree with you

1076
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,263
I agree with you that it will never pass

1077
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,055
And that they will Channel

1078
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
They will do all of

1079
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
But it does

1080
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,455
Our reality has been

1081
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,735
Eroded so much

1082
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,039
That I don't

1083
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
Have faith

1084
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:54,207
Any see this is the exact conversation that was happening in the lead-up to the election in right after the election

1085
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,535
The idea of resisting normalization of trump

1086
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,887
Our reality becoming so f***** up

1087
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,959
Before that were Unthinkable are now

1088
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:06,751
Alright

1089
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,287
Normalization

1090
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,847
In your brain what you have to do

1091
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,895
Cuz you have to think about empaths

1092
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,687
Time what would it look like if

1093
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,735
This individual event happen

1094
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,039
Yeah try and hold on to that

1095
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,647
If you do that if you evaluate the things that are happening on a daily basis

1096
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,439
By putting it into like

1097
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,463
Let's play

1098
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,255
Even during Bush's gears

1099
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,071
I'll give you give you go back to that and say like

1100
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,375
Does this happen to under Bush

1101
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,911
I'll be f***** up

1102
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,935
He'll be crazy but

1103
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
Feels

1104
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,287
How weirdly normal people are being anesthetized

1105
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
Do the

1106
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,871
Super f***** up where

1107
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,407
Will be our undoing

1108
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,943
People just accepting Things Are

1109
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,247
Does normal

1110
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:53,087
Freedom bill is normal

1111
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,647
Take away people's Health Care

1112
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
Which is

1113
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,463
Lie about the budget

1114
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,511
But they're going to be proposing

1115
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
Exclusively about the wrist

1116
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,375
People that died

1117
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,911
So billionaires

1118
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:10,495
200 million more dollars it's 200 million more dollars that they

1119
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,519
Do anything

1120
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,847
If you have a billion f****** dollars what else do you need

1121
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,407
They also want to get rid of the estate tax

1122
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:20,991
Stuff like that

1123
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,551
Being able to become the next

1124
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,575
Old money

1125
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,343
It's like

1126
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,623
You know everybody

1127
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:30,975
Fetishize is the idea like the Carnegie's than the Rockefellers and stuff like that

1128
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,255
As opposed to

1129
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,815
I don't know Mark Zuckerberg who has money

1130
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:38,655
It is the distinction of royalty versus

1131
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,959
Basically

1132
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:46,335
Or something like that what it is about

1133
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,615
Next phase of the game

1134
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:50,431
For you and me it's making enough money to stay alive

1135
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,735
For most people that is the case

1136
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,783
We're engaged in a struggle

1137
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,623
We have jobs that allow us

1138
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:00,927
You know I'm

1139
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951
Broke

1140
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,231
For the most part

1141
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:06,303
Whereas if you're rich

1142
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,607
You know you maybe want to buy a nicer house

1143
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,655
Maybe want to buy a nicer car

1144
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,447
When you're really rich

1145
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,239
Legacy

1146
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:21,407
And that's that's what it is for them it's not good I don't have to worry about ever being poor and not being able to worry about

1147
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,735
Buck I can't pay my Internet bill to have something else

1148
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:31,391
It's like Eman Alex Jones make comparisons to videogames all the time but it is kind of like that you're playing

1149
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,255
In that

1150
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,303
No matter how good a thing is

1151
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,583
We get used to it and that be

1152
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
Is the Baseline

1153
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,935
Call Waterworks

1154
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:46,239
Next Level Up

1155
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,519
It's still

1156
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,287
Do they

1157
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,567
The things

1158
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
Always

1159
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,359
Boggles my mind

1160
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
About

1161
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
These rich people

1162
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,431
Is that

1163
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,967
Have they ever read it

1164
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,527
Where rich people

1165
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,319
Go to far

1166
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,623
And then everything's fine for

1167
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:06,207
Well my conflicted not know that everytime rich

1168
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
Take one step two

1169
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,023
How far all the sudden

1170
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
Verify

1171
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,655
And I think is that they have read those

1172
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,191
They've taken lessons

1173
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,471
In terms of safeguarding

1174
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,031
From those things

1175
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:26,431
Falling people like Marie Antoinette other people who have been f***** over by screwing

1176
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:31,295
Unfortunately naked lessons you can learn

1177
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:35,135
Depressed people are.

1178
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,183
Push down even more

1179
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,767
It's always

1180
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,095
Like

1181
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,143
Wytheville VA

1182
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
With this type of

1183
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,727
Situation

1184
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,287
I believe in

1185
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,567
Calling your

1186
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,103
Sure I do

1187
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,407
We're at the

1188
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,711
Now where it's clear that

1189
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:00,991
Theme

1190
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,319
Represent the House of Representatives is entirely purchase

1191
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,367
Yeah like that's the obvious

1192
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,951
There's no other conclusion to make

1193
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:14,047
Democrat

1194
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,471
Is that the way worse part of it

1195
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Is

1196
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Well

1197
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:26,079
They don't they don't represent their constituents

1198
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:26,847
.

1199
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,895
They are

1200
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,199
Yeah I know so

1201
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,271
Important is calling your representative is

1202
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:37,343
At this point don't take 40,000 people

1203
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,623
And March down

1204
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,415
Wacker

1205
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,463
Take 40,000 people

1206
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,743
To your nearest billionaire

1207
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,279
And surrounded f***

1208
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:52,191
Yeah bringing cops National Guard

1209
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,983
Hard to protect one billionaires house

1210
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:58,591
Maybe people just sitting around there I mean

1211
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:01,407
Isn't that very it's not the best

1212
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,943
Optic 4 what the

1213
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,711
Country is

1214
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,527
I mean it

1215
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,295
Sodium

1216
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,063
Tire country

1217
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,855
The entire

1218
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,391
Nationalize military

1219
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,439
Comes down on regular

1220
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:17,535
Well here's the f*****-up thing I think more likely than the National Guard what you'd end up with

1221
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,607
Feels like something like Blackwater

1222
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,239
Please for the Keystone Pipeline

1223
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,591
They're willing to

1224
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,615
To torture and murder us

1225
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,919
I think the biggest

1226
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,735
Problem is that it still hasn't

1227
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,271
Really touched White

1228
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:41,343
Yep it really I like the Keystone Pipeline

1229
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,647
100% the cops

1230
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,183
Murdering

1231
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
Peaceful protest

1232
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,631
Doing everything that can be doing things that just

1233
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,703
Luckily didn't leave UMass death

1234
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,287
Which they very easily could

1235
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,591
And the whole wide world

1236
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,871
Sub-freezing temperature

1237
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:07,967
Absolutely

1238
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:13,599
If you saw the news

1239
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,863
Tomorrow cuz they're brown

1240
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,167
Everyone

1241
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Sitting here

1242
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,031
Supporting them

1243
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:32,799
As much as I

1244
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,567
Possibly

1245
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:40,223
It's sort of like I donated money I did I did everything short of going there and getting my ass

1246
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,247
F****** Frozen

1247
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:44,319
Eventually it's going to start happen

1248
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,855
Two people

1249
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,903
And it leads me to my next

1250
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:48,927
Point

1251
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,951
I think after this week

1252
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,487
Should move on cuz we're blowing real hard

1253
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:58,911
We got to get back

1254
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:05,311
You and me complaining about politics and maybe it will be as the show evolves and people donate more we could do this every day

1255
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:10,687
Right but for now it's still an Alex Jones podcast

1256
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,967
Hitachi off and

1257
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,015
Is going to happen

1258
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,039
Is there will be

1259
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,671
Decapitate style archetypical def

1260
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:23,487
Have to embolic deaths that will happen

1261
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:26,047
Symbolic

1262
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:29,375
And unfortunately

1263
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,423
It's b******* that we can't take

1264
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,215
These people like Alton Sterling

1265
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:36,287
Eric Garner people who've been killed

1266
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,311
By the police

1267
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,919
Motors that they are absolutely that should be enough

1268
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,687
Should be more than

1269
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,455
But

1270
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,247
Or the Sandy Hook

1271
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,295
Sure children were murdered

1272
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,855
And we couldn't turn that into a rallying cry for

1273
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,623
For gun control

1274
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,647
Yes I mean like

1275
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:54,975
Like the word complacent

1276
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,535
Are we too far gone

1277
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,583
Like once once I saw that we couldn't

1278
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,119
Anyting

1279
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
I was like

1280
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:05,471
We will never have you know one of the reason

1281
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:09,055
We can't turn Sandy Hook into anything is because of people like Alex

1282
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,383
Usos

1283
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:19,039
The doubt into whether this really happened right.

1284
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,599
Want to take our guns

1285
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
Is fake

1286
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,415
Sedan

1287
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,719
It's all a plan all along

1288
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,511
Do you have these people I think

1289
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,279
Again

1290
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,815
But a nice bow on it

1291
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,095
Yep why we do this show

1292
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,911
Yeah it's in order to fight back against these sorts of things

1293
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:38,751
Yeah people like Alex Jones

1294
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
Complacency

1295
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,543
There's a lot of

1296
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,871
More stuff that we should be doing and I hope we will be doing

1297
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
But for now

1298
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,687
This is as much as we can do

1299
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,247
Got to go to work

1300
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:52,063
F****** capitalism got to feed my cat bro

1301
01:03:55,391 --> 01:04:00,255
Baldwin's first mine bones

1302
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,303
Alright

1303
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:03,839
It's just

1304
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,863
Nesquik

1305
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:11,263
Anyway very appropriate

1306
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,567
About people calling themselves the resistor

1307
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,615
I bet he loves us

1308
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:20,223
Let's go ahead and start

1309
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,671
7 months ago

1310
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,071
Calling themselves

1311
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:35,839
LaRosa's

1312
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,399
I'm Stephen Colbert

1313
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,495

No but for less or less literally say that

1319
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,319
If you're listening to this

1320
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:59,903
You are the resistance

1321
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:05,279
He's quoting himself ever said that

01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,263
You are the resistance

1326
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:25,247
T-Mobile band

1327
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:34,463
Harmony / Porsche

1328
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:45,471
Weather

1329
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,519
Does it matter

1330
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,663
In the closet.

1331
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:03,135
The Paramount is growing Global movement in the world

1332
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:06,207
Against unelected

1333
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:13,119
Is over whistle dog with one

1334
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,935
We have been allowed to celebrate

1335
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:21,055
So long is Beacon direct to people and internet communities

1336
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:25,407
It's like people who on Stormfront

1337
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,479
I don't know if it's intentional on his part

1338
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,503
But there is

1339
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,039
There's a piece of that

1340
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:31,807
That will

1341
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,111
Lodge directly in their brain

1342
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135

We don't have to

1345
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:42,303
All the time

1346
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,887
You see people with just straight-up Neo-Nazi regalia

1347
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,167
That's what's going on

1348
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,239
Nationalism is one thing

1349
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,567
What is happening right now is not nationalism

1350
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,151
Beyond white nationalism

1351
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:59,711
Christian supremacist

1352
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247

Yeah so he talks about

1357
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,279
This like coming out of the closet

1358
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
Stuff

1359
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815

01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,167
God I hate

1363
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:25,055
Hating people who are different than co-opting or terminology and ideas

1364
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:28,127
You know how miserable it is to have to

1365
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:28,895
Heidi Riggs

1366
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:34,015
Have to live a lie everyday people don't judge you

1367
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:37,855
It's the worst feeling in the world which is why we should come out

1368
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:43,999
Also had to hide their very existence for so long

1369
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:49,631
I hate it because it's so miserable to be in the closet all the time

1370
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,935
Understand

1371
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,727
For one goddamn second

01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,127
Also this great Paul Joseph Watson

1374
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:06,527
Send report about dear white people and what would happen if someone made a dear black people

1375
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,831
What would happen

1376
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:13,439
Somebody made a dear black people Birth of a Nation

1377
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:16,767
It was called A Song of the South

1378
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:24,447
It's all just about how white people are the people who suffer the most race

1379
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,263
Betty White this next clip is

1380
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,799
Back to the resistance

1381
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,103
Idea

1382
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,663
Historical lineage of Arctic line to nothing

1383
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,735
And it is Alex Jones

1384
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,319
Just a line Oak Cliff

1385
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,111
No because it goes back to the fifth

1386
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,951
Explain the sort of waves

1387
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
Nationalism

1388
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
And stuff like that

1389
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,815
He also

1390
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,351
Really can't figure out

1391
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,887
Housekeeping plan

1392
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,959
Going off the coffee

1393
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,799
Placing people in the wrong

1394
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,103
Wave

1395
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,919
But also I'll come at the end of this

1396
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,687
Explain

1397
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,991
Why alot of these figures he's throwing in our

1398
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,015
Are dumb

1399
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:14,111
Include

1400
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
Jerome corsi

1401
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,439
And the Pappy Shannon

1402
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:24,095
Scientifically historically Hangout

1403
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,911
Truth

1404
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,959
Phyllis Schlafly

1405
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,007
60 years ago

1406
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,295
Murderer

1407
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,975
Phyllis Schlafly specifically was working to

1408
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,743
Pose glass

1409
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,327
Book

1410
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,655
She publishing brought her into Providence was again

1411
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,679
Rights for women

1412
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:03,263
Absolutely was about how if we end up in the

1413
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:06,335
It's going to ruin a lot of privileges

1414
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,223
You wouldn't be able to

1415
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,527
To raise your children which

1416
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:15,551
Hundred percent

1417
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,343
If there are women who don't want to work

1418
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,879
And want to be homemakers

1419
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:22,719
Are in an economic situation where that is possible

1420
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,999
I don't look down on that

1421
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
I don't think

1422
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:33,983
To choose like if we want to be a stay-at-home

1423
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,311
Wyoming dude that's like buying a shirt with Paul Joseph Watson face

1424
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,359

01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:44,991
Like her with her whole thing was let's not allow women who want

1426
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,015
To do that to do that cuz

1427
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,807
Cuz it's going to ruin it for the rest of

Subway

1431
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:58,815
He's starting his lineage

01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,607
That's where he's starting his lineage

1433
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,167
Is Phyllis Schlafly and Barry Goldwater

1434
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,447
Area

1435
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,471
Monster's Ball

1436
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:10,335
The first wave

1437
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:16,223
Paul's in the Ronald Reagan for the second wave

Horrible Nazi

1442
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,055
Garages

1443
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,431
You can appoint

1444
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,527
Very very very exciting time

1445
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:54,623
He couldn't keep his way

1446
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,903
Straight you like lapan

1447
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,695
In the fourth wave she's actually third

1448
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,655
Spoken to people who are in England

1449
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,191
About Nigel farage

1450
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,727
Most people there know him

1451
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,287
Completely failed politician

1452
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,847
Like he's run for office multiple times and

1453
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
Just been like

1454
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,663
He would be like

1455
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:22,015
I would I would guess a more discredited version of Ross

1456
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,831
That's sort of wheelhouse

1457
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,391
Or the Buffalo Bills

1458
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:34,559
Buffalo Bills

1459
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,399
This being is under between his legs

1460
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,935
You think she's pretty

I get I get what he's trying to

1463
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:49,151
But unfortunately really reinforces the idea that there is a cabal

1464
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,687
I hate to use the word

1465
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,455
The ball cuz I'm

1466
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,223
Very against

1467
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:52,991
Did most count

1468
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,551
But of the conspiracy

1469
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,599
You might even say

1470
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,623
And his

1471
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
Is

1472
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,415
Leanings

1473
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,975
Britain and France

1474
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,511
Putin in Russia

01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,279
Trump here

1476
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,839
What he's doing is combining

1477
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,863
But aren't nationalism

0 weird globulus anti-global

1481

Yeah exactly from all around the world have come together to say that all around the world

1482
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,175
We shouldn't have these leaders

1483
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:28,575
And they all are related to each other

1484
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,855
Which is so weird

1485
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,927
Signal we don't want the UN we want our own you

1486
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:39,327

Immediately and I'm like

1495
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,911
This isn't

1496
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,679
Retaining this is

1497
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:20,031
Hurting me yeah I loved it but it still

1498
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,823
Myself

1499
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,687
Like I'd like

1500
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:31,039
An incredible admiration for what they had achieved

1501
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,599
I can only watch one every 3 months

1502
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:37,439
Was just like him

1503
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,047
Sorry sounded like Alex Jones

1504
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,911
Handmaiden

1505
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:50,751
Going like

1506
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,031
Yep yep

1507
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,359
I will watch that

1508
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,383
Eventually going to need

1509
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,991
If you guys want to treat me a password

1510
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:07,903
This excerpt is what I would describe as anti-sexism sex

1511
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,463
It's

1512
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,231
Alex

1513
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,255
Talking

1514
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:16,095
About to Hillary Clinton

1515
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:20,959
Record numbers of women

1516
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:25,567
Yeah we do

1517
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,359
It's what's between their ears

1518
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,431
A vagina

1519
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,271
And the Bravada at the hubris of the elite the try to sell

1520
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:36,575
A drugged-out evil crone

1521
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,367
With all of her evil record

1522
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,439
It's like it's like

1523
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,719
They wouldn't

1524
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,511
It's

1525
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,327
It's not about what's

1526
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,095
Between your legs

1527
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,631
It's that you're ugly

1528
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:58,335
Great I like ladies it's your face that I do

1529
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,175
Did you look at the breakdown of the vote

1530
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,199
It was white with

1531
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:07,551
It wasn't like women overwhelmingly voted

1532
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,831
A drop that's not fair

1533
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,111
White women over

1534
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,391
Whelming Lee voted for

1535
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:16,255
Turned out white is more important than gender

1536
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,047
What are we doing

1537
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
World

1538
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:22,911
Happening are we sure we want to keep living here I don't know

1539
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,703
Quip

1540
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:29,567
He goes on to you know how Alex Jones is really into just headlines and not the subs

1541
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,847
Love it

1542
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:33,663
This is basically going to characterize

1543
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,943
Explained

1544
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:35,967
He doesn't

1545
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,503
Just think of the news that way

1546
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,063
Evariant

1547
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,343
Oh that is

1548
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,463
Put a package labeled

1549
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:59,007
What's a very negative world will be back the 30-hour special transmission

1550
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:05,407
So if we saw a box

1551
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:08,735
Obviously

1552
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:13,343
No I'm trying to call on us at all this guy who has a history of being a con artist

1553
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:17,695
He said he was a patriot

1554
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,279
What

1555
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:25,375
Look what kind of responsibility what world we live in

1556
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,399
You know

1557
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:32,543
It's even more pathetic because Pandora's Box wasn't labeled all the worst things in the world

1558
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,759
We went for the bugs that said kill us all

1559
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:45,343
Skip this next clip because he's really just lying about poll numbers

1560
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,183
The poles were skewed 30 points

1561
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,207
Send Clinton favor

1562
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:55,071
About the

1563
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
Steve

1564
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,887
The bias exists in pool

1565
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:01,215
And generally what they do is that they give

1566
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:03,775
Liberals like at 3% margin

1567
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,055
Added onto

1568
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:05,823
The poll numbers

1569
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,359
Because of

1570
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,639
Voting

1571
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,663
Registration

1572
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,431
Discrimination

1573
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,015
Point number is

1574
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,039
Patently absurd

1575
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
Like that

1576
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,415
Patently absurd no matter

1577
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:26,047
You if you have been alive and you seen any election there's never been enough

1578
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:32,703
Trump had a massive landslide

1579
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,263
He was the

1580
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:38,847
Victory despite the fact that it was nowhere near

1581
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:40,895
So now

1582
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,687
30

1583
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,759
At this point in the show

1584
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,807
We get into what will be

1585
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,087
A massive narrative

1586
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:49,855
Of the show

1587
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:54,719
Right

1588
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,487
News about it

1589
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:59,839
This is dealing with the idea that Obama stole money

1590
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,375
From Fannie and Freddie

1591
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,167
In order to fund Obamacare

1592
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,215
There has been

1593
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:08,031
Some new Breaking pieces to the story

1594
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,567
How can there be new brick

1595
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,103
Pieces to something that is

1596
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,639
Absolutely made up

1597
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,455
Because our man Jerome corsi has been

1598
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,223
Digging

1599
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,015
He's been digging into it

1600
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:25,183
This is going to take up a little bit of the rest

1601
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:25,951
Of

1602
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,511
Wednesday's episode

1603
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,047
It's all bulshit

1604
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,583
Right

1605
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,119
Fully

1606
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,959
You can listen to

1607
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
Open

1608
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,007
Without saying

1609
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:45,663
What do you mean how would you even steal money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

1610
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,199
Well it's

1611
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:49,759
It's actually pretty interesting the truth of the situation

1612
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:53,087
And I'll get into it after he establishes his why

1613
01:19:54,879 --> 01:20:01,023
I got some other Hillary Clinton

1614
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,887
Give us credit

1615
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
They don't

1616
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:18,688
Courtyard

1617
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,272
Here it is

1618
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:26,368
MarketWatch

1619
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,000
We broke this

1620
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,792
Dismiss bro

1621
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:35,584
First two days ago

1622
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,032
Ears. Decourcy article from yesterday

1623
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:46,848
Treasury secretary confirmed infowars.com

1624
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:52,480
On Obama stamps of Fannie and Freddie Mae close to 300 billion

1625
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,784
Manchester document said in a release

1626
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,856
Obama

1627
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:06,048
Wait

1628
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,912
And here's the original article

1629
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,472
February 27th

1630
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,288
That's two months ago

1631
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,104
Exclusive literally Rob

1632
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:21,408
Obamacare

1633
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,320
Steve mnuchin clip later

1634
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,648
Okay and we'll discuss exactly what that was covering

1635
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,672
When he gets to it

1636
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:35,744
Back in February we covered it when the first

1637
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,512
It was pitching the

1638
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,280
Meredith

1639
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,328
Different thing

1640
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:41,632
At that point it was about lawsuit

1641
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:44,192
Government had

1642
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,216
Be housing market

1643
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:48,544
Add to the crash in the Bible

1644
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,384
There were obvious that none of them wherever public punished

1645
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,432
For and we should

1646
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:58,528
A lot of these liberal organizations like

1647
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:03,648
Getting people housing and that sort of thing getting a lot of money out of lawsuit

1648
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,952
No

1649
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,512
That was broke

1650
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:11,328
In February that was the lie that they spun them

1651
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,888
Now there's an entirely different narrative

1652
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:17,216
It's being pitched off that sound but using the same

1653
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:20,544
Bulshit that we talked about then

1654
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,312
They just

1655
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:27,712
Repurpose for this new bolts watch Montgomery stuff how they complete

1656
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:31,808
Same Colonel to make a new story once the first one

1657
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:36,160
Bogus right there doing the same thing with Fannie and Freddie

1658
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:36,928
Fitbit deals

1659
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,208
Resorts

1660
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,744
Like how Roadrunner cartoon

1661
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,536
You keep using the same background check

1662
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,584
Right

1663
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:46,912
New narrative is that Obama is whole cloth

1664
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,960
Stealing from Fannie and Freddie

1665
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,984
Are there profit

1666
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,032
In order

1667
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,336
To prop up Obamacare

1668
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,104
And he did this

1669
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,128
2012

1670
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,408
Because Obamacare was going

1671
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:00,736
Phelan 2012 which that even makes no troops

1672
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:05,344
Also it's based on an interview that Steve mnuchin did

1673
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,624
I wish

1674
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,440
Maybe we should just go ahead and play that clip from later

1675
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,208
Does he have some con

1676
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:16,864
I feel bad talking about it without it but she doesn't get to the actual clip for like 3 hours

1677
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:21,984
Just love that Obamacare is going to fail narrative or it's like it's going to fail

1678
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,800
Wait are you saying is going to fail because

1679
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,824
You're going to

1680
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,848
To defund it

1681
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,128
Forcing it to fail

1682
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:28,896
Yeah

1683
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:29,920
You know if you guys

1684
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:34,016
Works on is a fret you guys could work on it like you could make it

1685
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:40,416
Little bit later

1686
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,440
Yeah

1687
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:47,840
That's why I was just pushing towards the next clip

1688
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:50,144
My agreement with your rage

1689
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,424
Fitbit 2

1690
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,448
Like what

1691
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,728
Further down the road

1692
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,008
GM's up playing the music

1693
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,312
Does not say what you think

1694
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:04,992
On Fox Business

1695
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:18,048
Obamacare

1696
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,888
In the second year of the program before was even implemented fully here it is

1697
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:25,728
Twitter and it has been for a long time

1698
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:44,672
Oh I understand

1699
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:59,264
Infowars.com

1700
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,568
I don't know Alex is as

1701
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,592
Strategic Reserve cut off

1702
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:08,992
So here there was a more interesting line of questioning Those About to follow that we bail.

1703
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,856
Yeah I found some good resources

1704
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:16,160
That indicates that they're not saying what Alex

1705
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:20,512
They're saying but just because it's so much more fun this way

1706
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,304
I found

1707
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:26,144
Breitbart telling them they're wrong

1708
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:31,520
So you you looked for the batard they made upon which to hoist

1709
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:38,176
All of this stuff is backed up by other non Breitbart sources but just because I want

1710
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:44,576
Only use their weapon against them and they all right I'm going to quote entirely from Bart about how this is

1711
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,368
Wrong

1712
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,392
So

1713
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:52,768
About that clip and Alex Jones is believed that this proves that Fannie and Freddie

1714
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,536
Money was

1715
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,840
Obamacare

1716
01:25:56,864 --> 01:26:02,752
The confusion appears to have Arisen because of the way Bartolo Romo where did your question that was the interview

1717
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,800
Treasury

1718
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:09,920
The treasury put out a statement Wednesday however that makes clear that mnuchin's answer was not meant to

1719
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,456
Confirm any particular connect

1720
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,736
In between Obamacare

1721
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,528
And the profits of Fannie and Freddie

1722
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,320
Because money is fungible

1723
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,344
Which means

1724
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,392
They can be moved around

1725
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:22,464
Here's the same as $1 there that's all

1726
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,488
Demon dollars

1727
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:24,768
Dollars

1728
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:31,680
Yeah it is all money coming in be used in different

1729
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,448
You can use it

1730
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:38,336
To pay for a different thing treasuries receipts of those profits fund everything the federal government does

1731
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,360
From border patrol

1732
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,640
Military operation

1733
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,944
The National Endowment for the Arts in public

1734
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,224
So

1735
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,504
Basically what that is

1736
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:50,880
What that is explaining is that the money that comes in from Fannie and Freddie because of a settlement

1737
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,160
And because of the relationship

1738
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:52,928
But ended up having

1739
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:56,000
What happened in 2008

1740
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:00,352
Government and it's just money that the

1741
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,376
Uses the funded

1742
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:04,448
Mercy

1743
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,472
Postal Service

1744
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,776
No but the Postal Service doesn't make money

1745
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,592
In the past

1746
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:16,224
So the postal service has many times

1747
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:17,504
Surplus

1748
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,040
Okay

1749
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,320
Like

1750
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
Chesapeake

1751
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,112
Come

1752
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:29,024
More Postal Service like it was used to pay for all the brick has posted a surplus in the past when the baby

1753
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,048
Boomers were

1754
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:35,424
Do out numbering the their parents

1755
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,984
Like they kept putting it into other stuff

1756
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,288
Money that comes into the government is

1757
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:43,104
Put out into the things that the government does

1758
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,640
Now let me read

1759
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,664
Let me read

1760
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,432
Description

1761
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,712
Again from Breitbart

1762
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,992
Of what happen

1763
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
2008

1764
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:57,440
The companies were taken over by the US government 2008 when officials feared their collapse could further destabilize the housing and fine

1765
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
Financial Market

1766
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:01,024
Treasury provided hundreds of billions of dollars of fun

1767
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,048
Meanwhile the federal housing

1768
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:02,816
Finance

1769
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,352
The fhfa

1770
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,632
Became their conservator

1771
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:12,288
Under the original agreement with the US Treasury both companies were supposed to pay a dividend equal to 10% of their taxpayer-funded

1772
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:15,616
As well as a fee on the hundreds of billions more

1773
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,896
The treasury had pledged

1774
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:18,688
Freetress

1775
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:22,016
For years however neither company earned enough to pay the dividend

1776
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,296
Which force them to draw even

1777
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,832
More from their bailout fund

1778
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,368
Just to send the money back

1779
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,136
To Treasury

1780
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,416
I was at the dividend

1781
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,976
This circular draw as it came to be called

1782
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:31,744
Threatened

1783
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,304
To put the companies

1784
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,608
Slowly eating away at the remainder of the

1785
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,376
The treasury back

1786
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,424
In mid-2012

1787
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,472
Treasury and the fhfa

1788
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,240
Agreed to change

1789
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,520
The terms of the bailout

1790
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,824
So that Fanny and Freddy would no longer have

1791
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,592
The fix dividend

1792
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,640
Ending the need for circular drawers

1793
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:52,224
Instead it company would have a flexible dividend obligation

1794
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,528
That would rise and fall with their profits

1795
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,576
Because the new dividend is equal to

1796
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,856
To the positive net worth

1797
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:58,880
Of each company

1798
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,928
Small Capital cushion set

1799
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,952
The decline each year

1800
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,000
It's known as quote the net worth

1801
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:11,168
At the time the net worth sweep was implemented Treasury Department officials noted that in addition to ending the circular drawers

1802
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:15,264
The arrangement would facilitate the eventual wind-down of the companies by

1803
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,032
By preventing them

1804
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,056
Abusing Prophets

1805
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:20,128
Recapitalise policymakers design to save

1806
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:22,176
More stable mortgage Finance system

1807
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:27,552
Do you mean very similar to what is going wrong with the Grease 2

1808
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:30,624
Sure

1809
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:34,464
Morgan Morgan

1810
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,256
Finance reform legislation

1811
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:39,328
Capitol Hill

1812
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,120
Instead they remain.

1813
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,400
Conservatorship

1814
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,704
Supported by taxpayer backing for more than eight

1815
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:47,520
A situation that nearly everyone involved in mortgage

1816
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,544
Good Finance reform

1817
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,312
Regardless

1818
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,080
Undesirable

1819
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,616
So we're in a situation

1820
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:52,640
Where

1821
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,664
Because of

1822
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,736
How bad things got and how bad it could have gotten

1823
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,760
If we didn't

1824
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:58,528
Make a chain

1825
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,088
Ram 2000 12

1826
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:03,136
Situation where

1827
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:05,184
Fannie and Freddie Gibbs the f****** government

1828
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,464
Billions of dollars

1829
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,280
200 billions of dollars a year

1830
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,304
Out of their profits

1831
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,072
In order to

1832
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:14,400
To sustain themselves based on the bailout that was made in 2008

1833
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,704
This story that they're claiming

1834
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,240
Is some kind of

1835
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:22,592
Is that money comes back to the government

1836
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:25,152
Some of it probably did go to Obamacare

1837
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,712
Yeah cuz you got to pay for that song

1838
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,528
Well that money is

1839
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,320
It's fungal ball

1840
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,112
Well no not just that

1841
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:36,160
The money that's coming back to the government

1842
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,952
Is the money we gave

1843
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,232
Yeah

1844
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,256
If the loan

1845
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,280
We didn't give them

1846
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,584
I mean it's supposed to be alone

1847
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,888
We gave them a great interest rates

1848
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,448
Interest rate one that you could

1849
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,216
Could say was

1850
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,264
Possibly

1851
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,312
Yeah that's how money

1852
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:56,384
This is Jerome course he's reporting

1853
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:58,176
Busted by

1854
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,200
Breitbart

1855
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:01,504
How f*****-up is that

1856
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,808
How f***** up is that

1857
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:04,832
Breitbart

1858
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,880
Of all places it pointing out

1859
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:09,440
The Infowars is making a conspiracy theory

1860
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,256
Breitbart

1861
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:17,376
Hello this is Keith Banning

1862
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:24,032
Shut up I realized

1863
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:27,104
No I don't know what it is you know what I wanted to go against

1864
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,384
Type with Steve Bannon

1865
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,152
Men's physique

1866
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,176
So I went with that

1867
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:32,224
But I realized I've never heard him talk

1868
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,016
I don't think

1869
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:38,368
Overheard him talking. Orson Welles

1870
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,208
Dead yet so anyway

1871
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,232
This is

1872
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,000
Bulshit

1873
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:46,560
Yeah this whole story is complete b*******

1874
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:48,864
If you look into it a tiny bit

1875
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:55,264
And there is that kernel of truth that we talked about on the 25th he's not as explicit about the car

1876
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,848
Kernel of truth anymore

1877
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,384
Sound even worse

1878
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,432
Yeah or even scarier but he doesn't

1879
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,064
What do you mean I mean we're still taking them

1880
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,832
Like

1881
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,136
They're still taking that money

1882
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,952
And they're using it to pay for

1883
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,000
And there's no end in sight

1884
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,024
There's this

1885
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,560
Will be Assisted Living place

1886
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,096
Until this

1887
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:22,656
But that wine.

1888
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,192
And it's not it's not

1889
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,008
Thank God it's not

1890
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,568
Play worse shape if

1891
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,592
If the

1892
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,896
You know the government stopped

1893
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:33,920
Yeah

1894
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:36,992
It's not it's not an ideal situation to be in

1895
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:40,320
But the alternative is still much worse

1896
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:42,368
Much like we talked about with Tetris last night

1897
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:47,488
It's a situation where you have to accept a negative outcome sometimes

1898
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:52,352
These were just completely independent

1899
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,888
Huge housing loan

1900
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,168
Loaning businesses

1901
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,704
Bratz

1902
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,240
Watch people suck that up

1903
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:01,824
And now we can't have nice things on the list of our problem

1904
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:08,224
So he's going to get back to this narrative a bit and he's going to bring in Jerome corsi

1905
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,040
To lie a bunch of

1906
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,064
Before we do

1907
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,344
I want tickets back

1908
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,880
To the other day

1909
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,672
We were talking about

1910
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,464
Outed

1911
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,768
Donald Trump's son

1912
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,560
Cernovich

1913
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,864
I think

1914
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,144
Got intense

1915
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,704
Blowback

1916
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,472
You mean like

1917
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,776
Keep f****** should have

1918
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,824
I think he probably got

1919
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,616
Much like the elephanta feet

1920
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:37,152
Female bladder

1921
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:39,200
I think crnkovich probably like a man

1922
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,992
You can't do that fit

1923
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:42,784
Cancel it

1924
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:45,344
I don't know how to fake a list

1925
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,880
Mike Tyson

1926
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,696
I'm going to eat your heart

1927
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,720
A ferocious

1928
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,000
I love pigeon

1929
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:55,584
My defense is impregnable

1930
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,656
I'm just ferocious

1931
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:02,240
That was that was

1932
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,776
There's nobody said before a fight

1933
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,056
Yeah

1934
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:09,152
That sounds well let's not go that far

1935
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,432
In terms of like

1936
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:16,064
Hyping yourself up for about I'm going to eat your children

1937
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,880
Right I mean music convicted rapist

1938
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,416
But I mean

1939
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:21,952
In terms of prefer

1940
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,232
4 minutes so

1941
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,512
Anyway this next

1942
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,048
Eazy-E talks about cernovich

1943
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:33,728
And the Soros group put out its articles

1944
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:40,896
Come together

1945
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:44,224
You do

1946
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:48,064
Don JR says he should be

1947
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:58,816
So before we get to his actual like walking back his cernovich

1948
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,120
Paul Joseph Watson

1949
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:03,936
In the past has been documented as basin

1950
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:07,520
Stories on Anonymous direct messages on Twitter

1951
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,288
B roll

1952
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:12,640
Surprised

1953
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:13,920
In the past

1954
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,200
Jerome corsi

1955
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:15,968
Has

1956
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,760
Publish multiple book

1957
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,552
I'm sure they end up as best sellers

1958
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,832
But have been shown

1959
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,904
Completely made up

1960
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:24,672
Based on

1961
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,696
Terrible sourcing

1962
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:28,000
Multiple books

1963
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:30,560
About Obama's birth certificate being fake

1964
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:32,864
And what about John Kerry it is with

1965
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,400
So like

1966
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:36,192
Those are not surprised

1967
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,472
Alex

1968
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,496
They are not

1969
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:41,568
If any of them win a Pulitzer Prize

1970
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,104
For real-time to do

1971
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:47,712
Just pack up and suck a muffler at that point

1972
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:52,832
I'm resisting the call of the woods almost every

1973
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,880
I got it

1974
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:58,976
Define

1975
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,280
Every every generation

1976
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:02,816
Regeneration

1977
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,096
Like it like

1978
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:06,144
Very similar stuff happened in 1960

1979
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,680
So what's going on right now

1980
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,216
It's just more

1981
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,264
That wasn't quite the last generation

1982
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:16,640
Closest corollary to our time is it in the last days

1983
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,664
Nixon

1984
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,992
Whenever we had all of the Vietnam War protests

1985
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,528
We had so many people be

1986
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,296
Beat

1987
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,064
For protest

1988
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,856
We had all this

1989
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,392
Sure president was

1990
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,952
Is blatantly corrupt

1991
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:31,744
Committee

1992
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:36,352
The template for what's going to happen

1993
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,632
Exactly right

1994
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,936
Which arrives that

1995
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:41,728
So I keep thinking you know what

1996
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,544
Maybe we are over at overreacting

1997
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,312
Maybe are in

1998
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:47,616
Oceans are strong enough to protect us

1999
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:51,200
Second that

2000
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:52,736
Just f****** driving

2001
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:58,624
And just hoping that I get to the woods far enough away where it's like

2002
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:04,512
Number one if it up and come pick me up

2003
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,560
True thoughts generator

2004
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:07,840
That's fine

2005
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:09,888
I have an ID

2006
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,424
Solar

2007
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,472
Exactly

2008
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:17,824
Thoughts about your idea about generational

2009
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,616
Yes

2010
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:22,432
I'm not sure if we survived

2011
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,200
The 70s

2012
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:30,368
I'm just not sure that the right outcome necessarily happen

2013
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,672
I think that it got to a boiling point

2014
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,208
And then things got drawn back

2015
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:35,744
As opposed to being pushed over the edge

2016
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:38,048
We could have gone a lot farther

2017
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,120
Assuring

2018
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,144
Progressive

2019
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,704
Movement as opposed to going back

2020
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:49,568
I don't think that

2021
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,640
Here's what I'm saying I don't think that is a demonstration

2022
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
Strength of our system

2023
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,456
Or anything like that

2024
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:58,272
Institution

2025
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,040
Degenerates

2026
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:02,112
Always feel the things are falling apart

2027
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:04,416
Every generation has that kind of narcissist

2028
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,464
The last

2029
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,000
Right

2030
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:09,792
People

2031
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,328
Should have some insight

2032
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:13,120
Do that be like well maybe it's not

2033
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,144
But at the same time

2034
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,936
Eventually one of those Generations

2035
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:22,336
Inevitable

2036
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,432
Our American history has never been the same sense

2037
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:30,016
Almost everything that's happened since then has been a backlash

2038
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,088
Almost all of the conservative values

2039
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:33,856
And all of the

2040
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,648
Conservative s*** that goes on

2041
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,928
Is indirect

2042
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,208
Response to that

2043
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:43,840
The fear that they have

2044
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,864
That they sell

2045
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,168
The colonels of the hippy chick

2046
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:47,936
It still exists

2047
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:50,496
In terms of homosexuality drug use

2048
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:51,776
Fringearts

2049
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,080
Stuff like that he's the stuff that they

2050
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,360
Use as Boogeyman

2051
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,640
And to be like

2052
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:58,688
That's not American values

2053
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:01,760
Blah blah blah

2054
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:06,368
Communal living is b*******

2055
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,416
The Civil War

2056
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:09,440
Never end

2057
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:13,280
Sure cuz we've been fighting the Civil War

2058
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,840
No worries ever end

2059
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:16,864
Think about it

2060
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,400
Civil War hasn't ended

2061
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:21,216
Literally the Korean War hasn't did according to

2062
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,496
North Korean

2063
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,544
B

2064
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,128
Yeah B WWII hasn't ended we still have Nazis around

2065
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:35,296
All of this and I wake up some days and afraid of nothing

2066
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:38,880
All this is still going on it's not done in the

2067
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,416
The same way though because we never

2068
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,952
Finish the deal.

2069
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:52,960
We have blue balls

2070
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:59,360
All we have to attend Alec Baldwin speech

2071
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:03,200
Brought over tons of Nazis because we knew that they had braid expert

2072
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:05,248
Even certain areas

2073
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,832
Big because we never really finish any

2074
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:11,392
Anything we leave it open in our chicken

2075
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,672
Are all here

2076
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:16,768
They're all here

2077
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:22,400
In no uncertain terms

2078
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:25,472
You're looking for a final.

2079
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,264
I'm not

2080
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,288
How do you

2081
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,056
Finished

2082
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,616
Like if you're if you're

2083
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,384
Progressive

2084
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,664
How do we win

2085
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,688
There's no win

2086
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:38,016
Well here's the only going to

2087
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:38,784
Create

2088
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,856
More of this backlash

2089
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:45,184
Say just in the case of World War II

2090
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:48,512
It's b******* because I do also recognize

2091
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,560
The pieces of our culture that have advanced be

2092
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,328
Because of nausea

2093
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:53,632
Moon

2094
01:40:53,888 --> 01:41:00,032
There's a lot of stuff that we have benefited from because of them but I'll World wouldn't be the same

2095
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:02,592
We didn't forgive some of them because of their genius

2096
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,384
You don't you don't make peace with your friends

2097
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:06,176
Right

2098
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:11,808
In a perfect world I think what you would have done is all the people who were responsible for the atrocities

2099
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,112
People who work directly the one

2100
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,392
Being like

2101
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:16,928
Gas Em Up

2102
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:18,464
Yeah those

2103
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,488
You would kill all the

2104
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:22,048
You have trial for them

2105
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:24,096
And you would summarily execute all of them

2106
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,120
But then

2107
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:31,520
The people who were still sort of under the sway of the ideology you do everything you could do

2108
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:32,544
To re-educate

2109
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,336
And not like a brainwashing

2110
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,200
Brainwashing however it is

2111
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:41,504
It would be a process

2112
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:45,088
You know I'm not saying put them in a camp and D brainwash them

2113
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:45,856
But like

2114
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,648
Provide

2115
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:52,768
I'm not

2116
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,376
Internment

2117
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:59,680
Concentration

2118
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:04,544
Provide provide people who are under negative sway with the information

2119
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,872
Send with the reality of like these dudes are not your enemies

2120
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,432
This Nazi ideology is something you got

2121
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,712
Swept up into

2122
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,480
And and just

2123
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:13,504
Deconstruct

2124
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,272
Every

2125
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:16,064
Part of the ideology and

2126
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:24,000
But like it's the same way with the truck and it's the same thing

2127
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,816
Time and if someone actually believe him or likes him

2128
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,096
It's not going to help

2129
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:31,424
I think that's

2130
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,704
Different isotopes differ

2131
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
Confirm my

2132
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:35,264
Argument based on which

2133
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,312
You said is that it's very similar to

2134
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,080
To the way that we

2135
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,872
Deal with the drug

2136
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,176
In that rather than

2137
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,200
Creating the city

2138
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:43,968
Situations 2

2139
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:44,992
Deescalate

2140
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,296
+ 2

2141
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,064
Educate

2142
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,904
Avoid using the word

2143
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,184
Re-educate

2144
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:55,232
Rather than using those

2145
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:58,048
Rather than using those

2146
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,840
We go for the punishment

2147
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,144
Like with the drug war

2148
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,704
What we should be doing is building more rehab

2149
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,520
We are doing is building more prisons

2150
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,568
Snowy is it should be a two prong Things Are

2151
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,592
Bmore rehab

2152
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,360
I am van

2153
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:13,152
More oversight

2154
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:15,968
Doctors who are really Lucifer

2155
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:20,320
And those are the things that are going to go away because

2156
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:22,624
Trumps

2157
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:28,768
In the Philippines is doing great things about drugs

2158
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,048
Where he just

2159
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:32,864
Kills drug users is a literal

2160
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:36,448
Murderer murderer

2161
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:41,824
Murder president of the Philippines

2162
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,872
Has said in public

2163
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,152
I have

2164
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:48,224
Kill the man was at least

2165
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,808
He said he's murdered people

2166
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,624
That's some real dick

2167
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:58,208
Was invited to the White House

2168
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:03,584
That's that's one of those hypocrisies

2169
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,144
Look how many times have we had

2170
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,680
Doughty leaders

2171
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:08,960
Sure how many times

2172
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:13,824
What is

2173
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,848
Dumb face

2174
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:17,152
Has a picture with him shaking hands with

2175
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,176
Saddam Hussein

2176
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,248
The lobster

2177
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,016
F******

2178
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:23,808
That's toast

2179
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,088
Brooklyn Bridge Park

2180
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,904
The point there is that

2181
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,768
We we spot off of it but I agree with you

2182
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:34,048
In that

2183
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:35,840
It is

2184
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:41,728
I don't I don't quite know where

2185
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:42,496
Your argument

2186
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:46,080
Because you're your point to the WWII

2187
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,432
Kill the people

2188
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:52,224
No kill kill someone

2189
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:54,272
Like I don't think

2190
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:57,856
The executions of Nazis that we did do

2191
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:58,880
For wrong

2192
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,160
No

2193
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:04,256
Outcomes were wrong necessarily

2194
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:06,048
I think a lot of people have to die

2195
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:06,816
Because of the thing

2196
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,352
Having a lot of

2197
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,120
People died big

2198
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:11,168
I think a lot more people

2199
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,448
Should be executed

2200
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:13,472
Because of crimes

2201
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:15,008
Against Humanity even people

2202
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:15,776
On our side

2203
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:17,824
In the history of the world

2204
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:21,920
But I'm saying that Rumsfeld we never do

2205
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:23,712
Second Clinton

2206
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:28,064
Like I'm not it's not it's not right left how many civilians has Obama

2207
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:33,184
In the Iraq War we killed more civilians in rehab

2208
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:38,048
Much is he is a a politician in art world

2209
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:39,584
Goodwill

2210
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,352
Yeah I think

2211
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:43,168
And did a lot of berries

2212
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,216
You can't take away the war crime

2213
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,264
He's every single one of them

2214
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:50,848
My foot my further point is we never do a good enough job

2215
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,896
Dealing with the people who are

2216
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,176
Bhldn two-

2217
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:55,200
Belief system

2218
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:57,248
Yeah is that is super Danger

2219
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,832
In the wet in the same way that we never really dealt with Nazis

2220
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,624
American Nazis

2221
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,928
During World War II

2222
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:05,696
And it led

2223
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:08,512
Two people going underground in creating Network

2224
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,280
And now

2225
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:13,632
Neo-nazism popped up and now it's being funneled into

2226
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:19,008
Semitism was

2227
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:23,360
A hugely popular thing in the United States in the late twenties and thirties

2228
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:28,224
One of the people one of the big Boogeyman for our the Great Depression

2229
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:29,760
Juice

2230
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:30,528
Thanks

2231
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:36,928
Things that is very important to remember is Hitler

2232
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:41,024
We would be on his side because a lot of his ideas work

2233
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,072
Cribs from American intellectual

2234
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,888
If you knew that there were a ton of

2235
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,936
Weird Networks

2236
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:50,240
America

2237
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:54,592
That just to put a button on my .38

2238
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,872
So we can get moving

2239
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:56,896
I just

2240
01:46:57,152 --> 01:47:01,504
I haven't been on I wasn't on last rhinos

2241
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:08,416
If you want the day before 4 hours ago

2242
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,952
But my point is

2243
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:10,976
When

2244
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:11,744
These

2245
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,328
Harmful ideologies pop-up

2246
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:17,120
Is a harmful ideology

2247
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:21,728
There's no there's no location on map

2248
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:23,264
Has existed

2249
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:25,824
That there is

2250
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:28,384
When you talk about small government

2251
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,408
Talk about States

2252
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:32,224
Right about a lot of things

2253
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,760
You have a very

2254
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:35,808
You can have a robust argument

2255
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:36,576
There you can have

2256
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:39,136
People on the other side that Believers thing

2257
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:44,512
Edit

2258
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:47,584
When when I talk about harmful ideology

2259
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,608
I'm talking about

2260
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:51,168
I mean now it's definitely the alright

2261
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,448
They're going to

2262
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,472
Need to be

2263
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:54,496
Corrected

2264
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:56,288
In the future

2265
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:00,384
Militant liberal friends

2266
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,432
I don't think they have any of those

2267
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,992
I don't think there are any

2268
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:08,832
In the past there were.

2269
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,368
There were

2270
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,392
Other groups

2271
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:13,184
That were in that

2272
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:16,512
And I'm into Atherton

2273
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:19,072
The Alex Jones

2274
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:20,608
People want to come down on me

2275
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:23,168
I would say exactly the same is true

2276
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,984
People in al-Qaeda

2277
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,264
Or people in Isis

2278
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,544
People who are

2279
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,824
Militant religious

2280
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:31,616
Then

2281
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:36,480
Exactly

2282
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:39,040
Those folks who have

2283
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:41,088
The mentality is that we need to

2284
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:41,856
The busts

2285
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:44,416
In terms of like

2286
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:45,696
To get them in

2287
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,488
And kill them all or we need to

2288
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:53,888
Brainwash them into our liberal way of thinking when they land

2289
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:58,496
All I care is they don't have a worldview that's based on bigotry

2290
01:48:58,752 --> 01:48:59,264
Image-based

2291
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,544
Not in fact

2292
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:03,616
Like those are the parts of it that are really troubling

2293
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:08,480
The Nazis were not operating on a fact-based system

2294
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:10,784
Everything that was going on.

2295
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,064
The probe Vietnam

2296
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,600
Folk in the 60

2297
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:16,672
We're operating on a very

2298
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:18,208
Non fact-based

2299
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:20,256
Now the hippies were too

2300
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:22,304
Also a lot of

2301
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:25,120
Turn on fact we're about

2302
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:26,144
Aquaria

2303
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:27,936
Therap

2304
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,264
Dependability of free love

2305
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,288
Curology

2306
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:37,408
Virology is our way out of it right that's not harmful

2307
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:39,712
Non fact-based sister

2308
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:42,784
I think they system it only leads

2309
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,344
Do you f****** more people and buying a crystal

2310
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,880
That's not really nigguh

2311
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:49,952
I think I think you've stumbled onto what

2312
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,744
I would say like

2313
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,792
The way that the way that you put it

2314
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:55,840
Kind of click something

2315
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:58,656
My Philosophy

2316
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:01,984
No here's here's what I would

2317
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:04,032
Based on what you

2318
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,312
You just said I had

2319
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:06,848
A little a little brain clip

2320
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:08,640
It is not

2321
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,920
Progressive

2322
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:10,944
Conservative

2323
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:12,736
Liberal

2324
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,320
Right now our fundamental

2325
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:17,344
Differences

2326
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:18,880
AR

2327
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,416
Reality

2328
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:22,976
Yeah one side

2329
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:28,352
One side is delusional Democrats and liberals all over the

2330
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,400
Besides our

2331
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:32,960
Reality versus non real

2332
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:36,544
That's what we are really that's why

2333
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,568
These Warriors have been

2334
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:41,920
Finished no because we're not we're not we're not fighting the right War

2335
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:43,968
You and I are fighting distract

2336
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:50,880
Conservatism or liberalism or progressivism or anything like that

2337
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:53,440
We're fighting a war with a man who is

2338
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,720
Creating reality

2339
01:50:57,024 --> 01:51:03,168
Reality the same time because I don't want to appeal the curtain back too far but like

2340
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:05,472
One of the reasons that I feel

2341
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:07,520
So convicted in my

2342
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:12,128
Fighting Alex Jones on his non reality-based system

2343
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:12,896
I'm right

2344
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:15,456
Good dogs

2345
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,016
The reason is because

2346
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:20,576
Like it wasn't a buzzfeed article and I couldn't

2347
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:21,600
Talking think

2348
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:22,368
I could not

2349
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,160
Think that Accord is more accurate

2350
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,952
He is a girdles of 20

2351
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,512
Absolutely

2352
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:29,536
Not about

2353
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:31,584
Russia Taking Over America

2354
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,352
It's not anything

2355
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,656
Alex Jones

2356
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:35,680
Is

2357
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,472
Propaganda

2358
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:40,032
Of the American win

2359
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,848
Of a very dangerous Global movement

2360
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:43,616
It's happening right

2361
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,664
And it's going to continue

2362
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:47,712
And it's not like you said

2363
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,480
Liberal

2364
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:49,504
Republican

2365
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:51,808
Conservative it's not about any of that

2366
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:52,576
Anyway

2367
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:55,136
We got too far down the rabbit hole with guitar

2368
01:51:55,392 --> 01:52:01,536
Let's finish this clip we're in the middle of I don't know

2369
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,328
Richest sources

2370
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,120
And that

2371
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,704
He's right source of info on what he says

2372
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:14,080
He is not Services stores I have to do one of the sources he hasn't in the White House at 6.

2373
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:19,968
Information night

2374
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:23,040
Is the two obviously

2375
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:37,632
It's probably

2376
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:42,752
And so they give it to the big evil Alex Jones

2377
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,544
Evil doctor

2378
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:51,456
He's got three number one New York Times bestseller

2379
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:57,344
Yeah that's not a credit

2380
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:01,440
His propaganda is effective

2381
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:05,280
John Junior wasn't

2382
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:21,664
Like with this new story the one about Fannie and Freddie

2383
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:23,456
He's like that's not our

2384
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,480
Our sources

2385
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:25,504
Treasury

2386
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:28,064
Right every single thing

2387
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:30,880
Throughout the entire course of this

2388
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:33,184
Is based on that tiny clip

2389
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:38,048
It being interviewed by Maria Bartiromo

2390
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,376
I'm not sure I'm saying her name right

2391
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:42,912
You know what I say

2392
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,192
Let me confirm

2393
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,984
I want

2394
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,032
No no it's a Bartiromo

2395
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,080
Play

2396
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:56,480
What are the characters in a comedy Bang Bang ongoing storyline

2397
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:59,552
I was complaining it with one of the assassins

2398
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:00,576
Creed characters

2399
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,880
Bartolo Romeo

2400
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:06,976
I was I was complaining it with pitcher Bartolo Colon

2401
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:08,768
Coloma

2402
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,560
It smelled like Cohen

2403
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:11,584
Anyways

2404
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:17,984
Complaining complaining it with Bartolo some Sonu

2405
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:24,384
Because our dumbass Marathon we are

2406
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:27,968
Like his big thing that he wanted to talk about

2407
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:29,248
Fannie and Freddie

2408
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:31,296
It's completely

2409
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:32,064
Compass bumper

2410
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:33,600
It's just nonsense

2411
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:38,464
It's b******* it's no good

2412
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:39,488
But it's going

2413
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,512
To be the new Naruto

2414
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:44,096
If I started to try as I listened to the show

2415
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:47,424
What are the things I'm trying to do is contextualize what he's saying

2416
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,448
Yeah cuz every

2417
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:50,496
Throws up so much b*******

2418
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:51,264
I'm like

2419
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,312
Is this going to be at a varsity

2420
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:57,920
The storyline is this going to be a Jay-Z storyline or is it going to be a waypoint

2421
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:59,968
You know what

2422
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:05,088
Editori working as his editor at the same time

2423
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:16,096
Yeah you would be the guy going through it like no this is your real a story besides characters

2424
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:19,680
This is going to be I think one of his really Maynard

2425
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:26,336
And yet because he's going back to it from two months ago

2426
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:28,128
He thinks that enough time has passed

2427
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:29,664
But no one remembers

2428
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,688
The b*******

2429
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:34,272
He's probably right except for us cuz we're walks

2430
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:36,832
I think he's going to

2431
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:38,112
To try and use the

2432
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:44,512
Credibility really reinforced

2433
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:46,816
Because the Google story is sort of falling apart

2434
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:47,840
They're going to do list

2435
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:49,376
Waypoint

2436
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:52,448
No there's no wait

2437
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:57,824
Right now I think the varsity storyline

2438
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,104
Are going to be

2439
01:55:59,360 --> 01:55:59,872
This

2440
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:01,664
And

2441
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:04,480
Framing a Hamdi ulukaya

2442
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:06,272
As a member of the Federal Reserve

2443
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:13,184
I like this angle

2444
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,744
Freddie Mae and Freddie Mac

2445
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,792
Freddy Freddy Freddy

2446
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:20,096
Because

2447
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:23,680
It is concurrent with the Obamacare repeal

2448
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:25,984
So your narrative

2449
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:28,032
Just kind of slides in with the main

2450
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:31,872
Screen GOP is failing

2451
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:34,176
And then you come in on your back

2452
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:34,944
And thanks

2453
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:35,712
The reason

2454
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:36,480
Failing is

2455
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:37,504
As they were

2456
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,272
Stealing money

2457
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,040
From these p

2458
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:42,624
Americana

2459
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:43,392
Is not going to

2460
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:44,672
I do that

2461
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,440
That is

2462
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:46,720
I think you're right that is

2463
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,256
Accidental but I also think

2464
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:54,656
That's one of the big reasons that has considering like this before

2465
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:59,520
Before we even knew the boat was going to go down

2466
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,432
Considering

2467
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:10,784
Even before the vote

2468
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:16,160
I mean we'll see how it plays out

2469
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,696
Right now you listen to

2470
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:21,792
I want you to know something very strongly of migraine

2471
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:25,376
The point

2472
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:28,192
But you know what

2473
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:29,216
You know what

2474
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:29,984
Know what

2475
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,520
Don't stop f****** life

2476
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,408
Serious business

2477
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:38,688
You know why

2478
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:39,712
Alex Jones

2479
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,040
We need to expect

2480
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:45,600
We need to respect that and I wish

2481
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,136
Press play

2482
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:54,816
I need you to escape from this character playing right now

2483
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:59,936
One day there'll be a way for me to start playing clit with my brain

2484
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:03,008
But for now I have to get out of here to press the button

2485
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:07,872
So what'll happen if you should just get a lapel mic that's real situation there

2486
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:09,152
Bi Rapaport

2487
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:13,504
The report set

2488
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:16,064
Donate to the show

2489
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:28,864
Forever

2490
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:42,176
The one on billion dollars

2491
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:51,392
Infowars is right

2492
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:54,976
Horses

2493
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,352
Trump

2494
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:05,472
Make some reliable

2495
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:11,616
New York

2496
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:15,968
And I've Been Told.

2497
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:17,760
Getting into Fannie Mae Freddie Mac

2498
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:21,856
The Muslims

2499
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:23,904
Liar

2500
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:29,536
Call far you'll be destroyed

2501
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:32,608
It sucks there I want to actually roll this back

2502
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:35,424
Because like I kept in a super long break

2503
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,192
At the end

2504
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:37,728
It just wasn't

2505
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:38,752
Hilarious

2506
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:40,800
Stop

2507
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:43,616
The Muslims back off

2508
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:52,064
I just love that

2509
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:54,880
No way

2510
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:55,904
Not not a fan

2511
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:58,464
Mnuchin is not an easier name

2512
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,792
No not at all

2513
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:02,816
Can pronounce mnuchin

2514
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:06,912
Prickly everytime. Everytime

2515
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:13,312
He's he's done enough that it is very obvious

2516
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:19,456
Is mispronouncing a little guy's name on purpose

2517
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:22,272
And he keeps calling him

2518
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:28,672
Just to just to recap by member of the Federal Reserve

2519
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:31,488
Not he's the guy who he slandered

2520
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,072
It's not on the board of the Federal Reserve

2521
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:36,608
Every committee guy

2522
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:39,424
In the upstate New York area

2523
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:41,472
Total War

2524
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:43,520
So

2525
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,544
You know he's been threatened

2526
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:48,896
Turtle dovin to

2527
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:52,480
Turning on Trump a little bit

2528
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:53,504
As beginning he was

2529
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,272
Sandy's

2530
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,928
Very 70% now

2531
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,208
The video game

2532
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:04,512
But really close to saying

2533
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:06,816
When you look in the abyss the abyss look back

2534
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:07,584
Look back

2535
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:08,352
Shakespeare

2536
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:15,264
Great America

2537
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,872
Don't Give me liberty or give me death

2538
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:24,224
Makes super confusing

2539
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:26,784
Obstacle

2540
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:29,344
Sometimes

2541
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:30,624
Will Shakespeare

2542
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:37,024
I just love Trump economy of Americana and

2543
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:40,608
Bringing jobs back and I just get chill

2544
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,656
It makes it worse

2545
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:52,640
About somebody

2546
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:56,480
People aren't doing what he says that's been

2547
02:01:57,504 --> 02:02:02,368
Because they just weren't letting the government moves

2548
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:10,048
Dealing with

2549
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:14,400
Stop he can't deliver

2550
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:26,176
Yeah you are

2551
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:28,992
So like this is the way that when

2552
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:30,016
You are

2553
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:30,784
Dumbass

2554
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:31,552
Sleater-kinney

2555
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:32,576
You're proposing things

2556
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:33,344
To go against

2557
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:35,904
Some of our most basic American values

2558
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:37,952
But yet you have

2559
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:39,232
All three branches

2560
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:42,048
Is the government locked up and now the Supreme Court

2561
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:46,144
And yet you can't get s*** done this is the way you pitched the narrative

2562
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:46,912
That like

2563
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,448
This is why

2564
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:50,752
Right cuz there's globalist behind the scenes

2565
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:55,872
It's the cult leader it's the cult leader predicting Doomsday

2566
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:57,152
So then

2567
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:58,688
It's

2568
02:02:58,944 --> 02:02:59,968
I made a mistake

2569
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:03,040
Shred-it doomsday is 2 years

2570
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:03,808
I missed

2571
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:04,576
The two in the

2572
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,600
Exactly

2573
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:10,976
Sorry scripture is Caustic decode I have a broad stroke

2574
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:13,024
Right but the details

2575
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:16,608
The devil is in the details in this situation is coming to

2576
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:17,888
2 years from now not today

2577
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:22,240
You know Trump is going off the rails

2578
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:24,032
Become a globalist

2579
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:26,848
Is like

2580
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:28,896
I love this guy

2581
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:30,176
And now

2582
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:31,200
He's the alpha

2583
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:31,968
Email

2584
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:33,760
He's the alpha male who can do anything

2585
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:35,296
Always

2586
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:36,320
Always

2587
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:38,624
Everybody else's

2588
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:42,208
Whippet chicken never hold the person

2589
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:44,000
But that and Alex

2590
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:45,536
Also

2591
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:46,560
Cuts into his

2592
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:47,328
Entire narrative

2593
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,608
Because he

2594
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:49,888
He's done so much

2595
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:50,656
Groundwork

2596
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:51,424
And laying

2597
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:56,032
Trump is a singular man

2598
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:59,360
The globalist so if he

2599
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:01,152
He starts to get corrupted

2600
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,992
What is the idea that

2601
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:07,552
The finger man isn't enough

2602
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:10,112
Yeah

2603
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:13,184
I mean what you would do is you would go

2604
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,208
Straight towards

2605
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:18,048
Because it sure seems like Putin is a singular man enough to do this s***

2606
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,072
Right

2607
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:21,632
That maybe what happened maybe

2608
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,656
God dammit

2609
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:24,960
Imagine that imagine if

2610
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:27,008
Alex Jones switches to like

2611
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:29,568
Well it's Putin the whole time

2612
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:30,592
He's already had

2613
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:32,128
Alexander Dugan.

2614
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:33,664
And he's been on RT like

2615
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,432
He's he's

2616
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:36,736
Got the groundwork laid for being like

2617
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:39,808
The only real anti globalist is

2618
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:43,136
So this next clip Alex Jones is trying to read

2619
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:45,184
Frame Trump like inasmuch as

2620
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,208
He's turning against him

2621
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:47,488
He's trying to reform him

2622
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,328
Is my ear can tell in this clip

2623
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,864
He's trying to frame him as

2624
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,168
A tolerant immigration reform

2625
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:57,984
But it did

2626
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,800
Yeah it doesn't it does not pass me by

2627
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:03,104
Was always

2628
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,640
Immigration

2629
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:16,928
For single moms but we killed half our kids in this country

2630
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:19,488
Population

2631
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:26,656
We're

2632
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,568
So

2633
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:36,384
Just a lot of Christians

2634
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:48,416
Did you see the

2635
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:55,328
That Muslims aren't allowed in the country.

2636
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:15,808
Soccer

2637
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:20,672
Ridiculous agree with that last point that is

2638
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:24,256
Like if you want to put Wikileaks on trial you will end up on

2639
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:30,144
Now is very much like

2640
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:32,960
We're deciding who can and who can't

2641
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:34,240
Be called news

2642
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:35,264
Yeah

2643
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:41,920
Cuz of that very same thing

2644
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:44,480
Like if you are advocating that and your ally

2645
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:45,248
Text Joan

2646
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,296
Imagine what happened

2647
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:48,832
If you are

2648
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:50,624
Alex Jones and it's a

2649
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,392
Liberal progressed

2650
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:52,160
Politician

2651
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:55,488
Like you're fake news

2652
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,768
You're the problem

2653
02:06:59,072 --> 02:07:02,912
Could very legitimate

2654
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:05,216
That idea of of trump

2655
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:05,984
Immigration

2656
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:06,752
Stuff is just

2657
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,568
Bulshit revision

2658
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:11,872
Revisionist history from a month ago

2659
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:15,200
Yeah

2660
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:20,832
Meanwhile Alex.

2661
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:22,624
Keeps harping on like the idea that like

2662
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,416
The problem is no one has a memory

2663
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,208
Yeah you don't

2664
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:30,304
You don't remember what you said

2665
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:33,376
GOP person now who says like

2666
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:35,680
Oh what are liberals protest

2667
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:36,448
Sing about you know

2668
02:07:36,704 --> 02:07:42,848
Whatever Obama was President we never did that

2669
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:47,200
Obama in effigy

2670
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:49,504
Now I want I want to say

2671
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:51,552
In terms of validating

2672
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,344
Isaac

2673
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:56,416
Complaining

2674
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:57,952
Protest when Obama

2675
02:07:58,464 --> 02:07:58,976
Came into office

2676
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:01,024
Personally maybe they did

2677
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,816
Maybe they were tolerant

2678
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:04,864
And God bless them for it

2679
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:07,936
Projecting that to the

2680
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:10,240
Society is not okay

2681
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:11,264
Because

2682
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:14,080
When Obama was elected

2683
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:16,640
2

2684
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:19,200
Ever been to a gun show

2685
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:20,480
No I have

2686
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:21,504
Please don't

2687
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,528
Tell me anymore

2688
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:24,576
Asterisk

2689
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:28,928
Kill me before Obama was elected

2690
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,744
Frequently at gun shows that I have been to

2691
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:37,120
Blowgun

2692
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:38,656
Because I wanted to

2693
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:40,448
Shoot paintballs at my friend

2694
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:45,312
I think I also bought like some sort of a

2695
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:46,080
Stun gun

2696
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:47,104
Tell me my friends good

2697
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,384
Chucky's daughter while we were drunk

2698
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,664
Great

2699
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:54,016
It was full of Obama

2700
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:58,880
At Target and then also weird posters of Obama

2701
02:08:59,136 --> 02:09:01,184
Photoshopped Obama into

2702
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,976
Like weird old

2703
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:04,256
Insulting racist

2704
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:09,632
Tribal pictures

2705
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:11,424
I don't know like

2706
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,448
It doesn't work

2707
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,728
Big picture

2708
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:20,128
But those people individually might be okay told me this whole thing about how we win

2709
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:21,664
Mama was elected everybody hope

2710
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:22,688
You would do well

2711
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:26,784
And she absolutely did not remember all the races schicchi

2712
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:29,856
Herself set

2713
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:30,624
Emailed me

2714
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:33,184
Like so it's so f*** you

2715
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:37,536
Do mammary like

2716
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,352
Genuinely

2717
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:43,936
There there wasn't narrative during the Trump campaign

2718
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:45,728
There was part of people were like

2719
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:47,776
You know Trump is lying

2720
02:09:48,288 --> 02:09:49,056
You know he's lying

2721
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,616
So maybe he's lying in a good way

2722
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:54,944
Play baby when he does get elected

2723
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:55,968
He's going to go

2724
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:56,992
Too bad

2725
02:09:57,248 --> 02:10:03,392
Was pro-lgbt

2726
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:05,440
He's never believed

2727
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:14,144
He's just a f****** opportunist believes in his own brand being pushed in his family make more

2728
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,960
There's that there was that liberal narrative

2729
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:21,568
Well you know what if he enriches himself but we also get single-payer healthcare

2730
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:22,592
Looking great

2731
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:30,272
The problem is he was lying to everybody in the deal with the devil never works

2732
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:33,088
Butthole has interest

2733
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:38,208
Whenever he was whenever he was elected and on that

2734
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:40,000
Inauguration Day

2735
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:43,072
New s*** was going to go bad

2736
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,912
Sure just because of that that didn't mean that I didn't

2737
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:51,520
Like I'm like

2738
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:54,592
Imagine if

2739
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:56,896
Pretty good okay dude

2740
02:10:58,688 --> 02:11:02,528
Could have happened conceivably he doesn't believe in anything

2741
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:05,088
Maybe we find out that he just gives a s*** about

2742
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:06,368
Do whatever he wants to do

2743
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:11,232
You know it's possible like I genuinely hope the president succeed

2744
02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:14,816
The problem I have is that there's no possibility of that

2745
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:19,168
He's a monster and he's trying to f*** himself using the Republican Congress

2746
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:21,728
Traffic monsters

2747
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:28,896
Well the problem 2 is that

2748
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:31,200
Well the problem is it like

2749
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:32,736
The world is so complicated

2750
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:34,272
And we're deeply entrenched

2751
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:36,064
In such a weird situation

2752
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:38,624
Like even the best person

2753
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:40,416
Comfortable coming into office

2754
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:41,952
Will inevitably do

2755
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:45,024
Monster is just based on the last

2756
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:46,304
5070

2757
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:52,448
The Transit Avenue gotten us in a position where you can't extricate yourself

2758
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:54,496
Some situations where you're going to

2759
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:55,264
Do end up murdering

2760
02:11:57,312 --> 02:12:00,128
Now it's just an Obama Obama if

2761
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:01,152
He was not

2762
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:02,688
Faced with those

2763
02:12:02,944 --> 02:12:03,456
Decisions

2764
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:04,480
Wood

2765
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:05,504
Like right now

2766
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:07,296
If you were talking to Obama

2767
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:09,088
From 20 years ago

2768
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:10,880
NSAID okay

2769
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:12,416
Would you ever kill

2770
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:14,976
Nothing

2771
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:17,280
Not a problem

2772
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:19,328
He would absolutely like if you ask me

2773
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,608
Of course not

2774
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:22,144
I would never ever

2775
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:22,912
Miraculous ability

2776
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:25,728
And then you get into that political

2777
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:28,032
Your entire life

2778
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:28,800
I could be

2779
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:30,080
Batter up

2780
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:31,104
So you have to

2781
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:36,224
My party your lesser of two evils

2782
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:37,248
Is killing

2783
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:41,344
Still going to do some

2784
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,368
Really bad stuff

2785
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:45,440
And then when you get a corner

2786
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:53,376
Uno

2787
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:54,400
A fuk note

2788
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:55,168
The cat

2789
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:55,936
So

2790
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:57,984
It's not gone well

2791
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:58,752
But

2792
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:04,640
A office pool in my head because there is no

2793
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:05,920
Where I live

2794
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:08,480
Like this for me is

2795
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:09,248
Which

2796
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:15,648
Doomsday scenario is going to win out

2797
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:22,048
You're really going to do cuz you know that

2798
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:26,144
Edgewater

2799
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:27,936
How to start a war with each other

2800
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:32,032
Or is it going to be any number of different possible doomsday scenarios and I feel like

2801
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:38,176
Likely

2802
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:38,944
Yep

2803
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:39,712
You know

2804
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:40,736
I do

2805
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:42,528
So Jordan you might be asking

2806
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:44,064
What would I be at

2807
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:46,112
You might be asking why the f***

2808
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:47,648
Are they doing the 30-hour

2809
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,184
Marathon route

2810
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,232
I knew the answer to that question

2811
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:54,816
I've never asked myself

2812
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:56,096
Less of a question than that

2813
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:58,400
Possibly a different name

2814
02:13:59,168 --> 02:13:59,680
Then

2815
02:13:59,936 --> 02:14:00,448
The truth

2816
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:02,496

They're 41 minutes into their Marathon we are at two and a half hours

2822
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:30,912
Recover that BuzzFeed article for like half an hour

2823
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:33,472
F*** you voice in my head

2824
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:47,808
Lester's online email on Facebook

2825
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:52,672
At the grocery store

2826
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:56,000
At the golf course

2827
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:08,288
Globalism destroy Alex Chao

2828
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:13,152
Tell the truth

2829
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:15,968
How fun would that conversation be

2830
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:17,504
At the store

2831
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:21,856
It can be 11

2832
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:22,880
24

2833
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:25,184
8 look

2834
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,976
Globalism is on the rise

2835
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,816
Ugh

2836
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:31,840
Starting to play with

2837
02:15:32,096 --> 02:15:37,216
Dollar bill or okay I'm

2838
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:40,288
Backed I'm going to pay with fiat currency

2839
02:15:41,824 --> 02:15:47,968
This is distributed by the Federal Reserve Bank suing Alex

2840
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:51,296
Fear ID

2841
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:53,344
But if used by the globalist

2842
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:59,488
Code not scan that I am a sovereign citizen

2843
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,792
Alright we're getting to that

2844
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,336
You see news we broke

2845
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:17,152
A week before a month before a year before

2846
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:22,528
CVS Wall Street Journal

2847
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:28,672
You generally do the news that they've broken a little bit later I wonder why

2848
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:32,768
Cuz it debunked could you give me contacts for a lot of times you'll feel like

2849
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:33,536
Oh.

2850
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:36,352
A lot of weirdos

2851
02:16:36,608 --> 02:16:40,960
Islam in the world and they they dig into stuff in to find out

2852
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:41,728
Oh no

2853
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:44,544
Come true at all ever fact-checked

2854
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:45,824
Before

2855
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:48,896
Alex Jones

2856
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:49,920
Afterwards

2857
02:16:50,176 --> 02:16:51,200
Yeah it's it's

2858
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:56,832
It's a really fun game to see if you could

2859
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:58,112
If you could predict

2860
02:16:58,368 --> 02:17:00,416
The Narrative that they would spin

2861
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,440
Based on

2862
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:03,488
Wild while you're saying

2863
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:10,912
Write a story give me a fake story I'll give you the Alex Jones

2864
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:14,752
A fake story with Alex Jones Menorah real story that

2865
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:16,288
You give me a fake

2866
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:18,336
Real story

2867
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:19,872
You give me

2868
02:17:21,408 --> 02:17:25,248
Do you give me just like a world news story and I'll transmit Alex Jones

2869
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:27,040
Alright

2870
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:30,624
Kids

2871
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:33,440
Religious-based attack in

2872
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:37,024
That's so fucken easy

2873
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:41,120
What is it just doing this

2874
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:47,520
Somalia has been placed with Black Hawk Down controls we all know that

2875
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,568
Absolutely

2876
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:52,640
I know this to go back to Barry Goldwater it's in a white paper

2877
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:53,664
We all know this

2878
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:55,200
Are these kids

2879
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:59,040
They're part of a globalist Hillary Clinton

2880
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:00,576
Saul Alinsky base

2881
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:06,208
Are the kids even real but they're in a sex-trafficking operation we all know that

2882
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:08,256
It's in that white papers you check out

2883
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:11,584
Hillary Clinton's connection to Haiti at all in there

2884
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:14,656
They are real they are real it is very unfortunate

2885
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:17,728
And I've already forgotten what the actual story

2886
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:24,640
You got Alex Jones here's my ears my ears are my dream Heroes

2887
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:27,456
Each other now about your fake

2888
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:30,016
Real world new story

2889
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:35,648
What I heard when you were telling me that story that you were fake

2890
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:37,184
What I heard

2891
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:41,024
Was the country Somalia

2892
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:44,608
Various things through history I heard there were kids involved

2893
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:47,424
Kid trafficking

2894
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:51,776
But Alex wants to promote or as a narrative

2895
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:53,312
The little things

2896
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:54,592
She does

2897
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:55,616
Made

2898
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:56,384
Now

2899
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:58,688
Remember what you say

2900
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:03,808
Like

2901
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:06,880
I guess I guess dream would be like imagine

2902
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:09,440
Instead of giving people that headline

2903
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:11,232
You give them the headline

2904
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:12,256
With every

2905
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:14,560
Information you needed

2906
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:17,120
Like the headline to that is

2907
02:19:19,424 --> 02:19:23,776
Radical sect of American influence Christians

2908
02:19:24,288 --> 02:19:26,592
Murder children because they have

2909
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:29,664
The lgbtq tendencies that they've showed

2910
02:19:30,176 --> 02:19:31,200
They were very young

2911
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:35,296
The angle that alt right people would take on this story

2912
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:37,600
Is that it is this kind of globalist

2913
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:38,368
Conspiracy

2914
02:19:38,624 --> 02:19:40,672
But instead it is not it is

2915
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:42,208
Purely religious Bass

2916
02:19:42,464 --> 02:19:44,256
Christian ideology that

2917
02:19:44,512 --> 02:19:46,048
Has been twisted and warped

2918
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:48,096
Now that's the headline

2919
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:50,656
I do Alex Jones

2920
02:19:50,912 --> 02:19:52,704
I can't really sign off on this cuz

2921
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:55,264
I'm still thinking about those poor kids in Somalia

2922
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:57,056
Does kids

2923
02:19:57,568 --> 02:19:58,592
There's always

2924
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:01,408
Somalia

2925
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:02,176
Good morning

2926
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:04,224
Word

2927
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:04,992
Forward

2928
02:20:13,952 --> 02:20:16,256
Loading up the 300 billion dollars

2929
02:20:16,768 --> 02:20:18,816
Lose

2930
02:20:20,864 --> 02:20:21,376
Didn't publish

2931
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:24,960
Athletic Club

2932
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:28,032
Exactly as we said

2933
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:31,616
Infowars getting credit

2934
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,944
They didn't say that at all

2935
02:20:36,736 --> 02:20:38,784
Super fun and it was sort of a call back to things that

2936
02:20:39,296 --> 02:20:39,808
Keep happening

2937
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:43,648
Entire clip Jerome corsi was on Skype Style

2938
02:20:51,328 --> 02:20:53,632
Being complimented by Alex

2939
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:56,704
If you want to talk

2940
02:20:57,984 --> 02:21:03,360
We'll get there in a minute

2941
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:09,760
A fish person at the side of the page with human terror Terror

2942
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:12,832
So I mean

2943
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:13,856
The implicit

2944
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:18,464
He's also got some nice Twitter action like to give a shout out to our friends

2945
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:19,232
A name

2946
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:25,632
Who posted a picture of a mythological chimera

2947
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:28,448
Realize that was the nope

2948
02:21:28,704 --> 02:21:33,312
Are you with the idea of a chimera was but I didn't realize the mythical creature

2949
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:35,104
3 heads

2950
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:36,640
B body

2951
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:37,408
Dragon tail

2952
02:21:38,688 --> 02:21:39,200
Yes

2953
02:21:39,712 --> 02:21:40,736
One of the most important things

2954
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:41,504
That you need to know

2955
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:42,784
Is that the reason

2956
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:44,320
The people

2957
02:21:44,576 --> 02:21:45,600
And the mainstream media

2958
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:46,624
Attacking

2959
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:47,392
Infowars

2960
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:51,232
To know I need to know

2961
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:52,256
I think Alex

02:21:53,536 --> 02:21:55,328
I mean I have my ideas but

02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:58,912
Here's Alex is David

2965
02:22:07,872 --> 02:22:14,016
Spell regular

2966
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:25,792
It's so fun because Jerome corsi is on Skype

2967
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:30,656
He's just like

2968
02:22:30,912 --> 02:22:33,216
Violinist bloated face Jerome corsi

2969
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:39,616
But that's the problem there is that if you put if you put

2971
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:41,920

Isn't there not paying attention

2976
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:54,464
I'm scared of

2977
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:55,488
This trend

2978
02:22:55,744 --> 02:22:57,792
Did Infowars is a big part of paper

2979
02:23:01,888 --> 02:23:04,192
I'm going to f*** around and right away paper

How would you feel if somebody wrote a black book huh

02:23:17,504 --> 02:23:19,808
There's a great show that got bought by comedy

2984
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:24,416
Yes during the Dylan Morin

2985
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:26,720
Who we saw together who you thought was s***

2986
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:29,280
He was alright

2987
02:23:29,536 --> 02:23:30,048
I don't just

2988
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:32,608
It was it was it wasn't

2989
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:34,912
Babies are upset

2990
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:38,496
Jerome corsi might

2991
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:39,520
Hot in Here I Go

2992
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:42,336
Actually I just remembered

2993
02:23:42,592 --> 02:23:43,104
He dumb

2994
02:23:46,432 --> 02:23:52,320
They're scared of them

2995
02:23:53,088 --> 02:23:56,416
Because we are a focal point

2996
02:23:56,672 --> 02:23:58,464
20 minutes

2997
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:04,352
Especially

2998
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:10,752
Mukbang basically Delta donate

2999
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:23,040
Good morning

3000
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:26,880
Illegal

3001
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:34,304
Register to pay for legal of him saying like what he said right before that

3002
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:44,032
Research paper fact checker

3003
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:48,640
You have someone who's like

3004
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:49,920
Tries to tell you

3005
02:24:50,176 --> 02:24:52,736
This will get you sued

3006
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:54,016
Their radar is

3007
02:24:55,552 --> 02:24:57,856
So I mean like there's no way

3008
02:24:58,112 --> 02:24:58,880
Legitimately

3009
02:24:59,904 --> 02:25:00,416
I took

3010
02:25:00,928 --> 02:25:02,208
An hour of my day

3011
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,000
Working on this Fanny Friday

3012
02:25:04,512 --> 02:25:05,792
Yes and I found

3013
02:25:06,048 --> 02:25:07,328
A bunch of documents

3014
02:25:07,584 --> 02:25:09,120
I found a bunch of stories

3015
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:10,400
That were wellsource

3016
02:25:10,912 --> 02:25:11,424
About

3017
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:12,960
How dare

3018
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:16,032
Interpretation their version of it is wrong

3019
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:18,592
Then I found a Breitbart story

3020
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:20,128
Specifically

3021
02:25:20,384 --> 02:25:22,432
Was about how Infowars is wrong

3022
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:23,712
That's

3023
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:24,480
Shwayze

3024
02:25:26,272 --> 02:25:29,344
To imagine the world fired is there fact check

3025
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:30,624
Selfie

3026
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:34,720
Imagine a world where Breitbart has more editorial credibility

3027
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:37,280
Emphatically more

3028
02:25:37,536 --> 02:25:39,072
Credibility

3029
02:25:39,328 --> 02:25:40,864
Breitbart

3030
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:42,656
In terms of the narrative APUSH

3031
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:49,568
To agree with Alex Jones a hundred percent of course that is a step too far even for them

3032
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:54,176
Which I think is why Alex is selling it as they told me

3033
02:25:54,432 --> 02:25:58,272
Because that story from Breitbart came out before this broadcast

3034
02:25:58,528 --> 02:25:59,552
So I think that it's like

3035
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:06,208
He's trying to sell the like even the right of turned against us on there yeah which is good for him

3036
02:26:06,464 --> 02:26:08,000
Cuz if he's eventually going to turn it in

3037
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:14,656
Then that's a great angle to start even break

3038
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:16,704
Are now wings of Troy

3039
02:26:17,216 --> 02:26:19,776
Yeah like if you start distance

3040
02:26:20,032 --> 02:26:21,568
Yourself from Trump then you have to

3041
02:26:21,824 --> 02:26:22,336
Start disting

3042
02:26:22,848 --> 02:26:23,616
Yourself from

3043
02:26:23,872 --> 02:26:25,920
Probably because

3044
02:26:26,176 --> 02:26:28,992
You understand

3045
02:26:29,248 --> 02:26:30,016
In a very literal

3046
02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:32,320
Has sex

3047
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:33,344
With dban

3048
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:35,904
We talk all the way

3049
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:37,952
All the way

3050
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:44,608
Gonzo's nose but right up his ass I think you're actually wrong because in these earlier Clips he's been

3051
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:45,888
Talking about how

3052
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:47,424
The turn came

3053
02:26:47,936 --> 02:26:48,704
When Trump

3054
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:49,984
Took van in office

3055
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:50,752
Security Council

3056
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:53,056
About how like

3057
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:54,080
Open till

3058
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:56,384
71 days or whatever

3059
02:26:56,640 --> 02:27:02,528
Geology and then that went away

3060
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:05,088
Turn the light yeah I think he's still on Bannon

3061
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:06,624
Okay like I don't

3062
02:27:07,136 --> 02:27:09,184
I'm not sure what the disconnect from

3063
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:09,952
Breitbart

3064
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:10,976
I have to be in order for him

3065
02:27:11,232 --> 02:27:11,744
Who cares

3066
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:15,584
I'm not going to war games this for him be that he is

3067
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:16,608
F****** riffing

3068
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,656
And anything goes while he's

3069
02:27:19,168 --> 02:27:19,680
Randomly talking

3070
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:21,472
I think the bottom line is that

3071
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:22,752
He's acting like

3072
02:27:23,008 --> 02:27:23,776
Our 30

3073
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:24,544
35

3074
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:29,920
Of this telephone

3075
02:27:30,688 --> 02:27:31,456
After

3076
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:34,528
Turdly long

3077
02:27:34,784 --> 02:27:37,088
Just on Skype

3078
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:39,648
She finally lets Jerome corsi talk

3079
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:41,184
Aaron play this play

3080
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:42,976
4C is going to lay out

3081
02:27:43,232 --> 02:27:44,000
His sort of

3082
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:45,536
Version of what

3083
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:46,304
Pistorius

3084
02:27:48,352 --> 02:27:50,656
Bat Cleanup in case there's any

3085
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:51,936
There we haven't gone over

3086
02:27:53,472 --> 02:27:59,616
This is hard news this is hard power structure

3087
02:27:59,872 --> 02:28:06,016
And this is why the Republican establishment is out to get us as well because they're part of it

3088
02:28:07,552 --> 02:28:09,344
Broken

3089
02:28:10,368 --> 02:28:13,440
What our trip is going to story we've been working on because it's

3090
02:28:13,952 --> 02:28:15,232
Yeah we found out that

3091
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:20,096
Fannie and Freddie the two mortgage Giants government-sponsored entities

3092
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:23,168
August 2012

3093
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:29,056
All the profits from Fannie and Freddie

3094
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:30,592
And confiscating them

3095
02:28:31,104 --> 02:28:33,152
Call the net worth sweep

3096
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:34,688
It's complicated

3097
02:28:40,064 --> 02:28:43,392
Congress the house specifically had refused

3098
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:44,672
The fund

3099
02:28:45,184 --> 02:28:45,696
The

3100
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:47,232
Insurance

3101
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:53,888
Premiums the subsidies for low-income

3102
02:28:59,008 --> 02:29:00,032
Wasn't going to work

3103
02:29:01,824 --> 02:29:07,968
What the

3104
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:13,088
Into paying the Obamacare

3105
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:19,744
Insurance subsidy they gave you and using paper

3106
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:26,144
How's the money

3107
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:32,544
Be able to pay the insurance company

3108
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:37,920
Deputies ascribe

3109
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:43,552
That nefariousness to the wrong Source Republicans refused

3110
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:45,344
To do the thing that they were supposed to

3111
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:49,696
Just a reminder cuz we talked about this like an hour and a half ago

3112
02:29:49,952 --> 02:29:51,744
Even for the listeners I want it

3113
02:29:52,256 --> 02:29:55,072
I want to point out that you talkin about

3114
02:29:55,328 --> 02:29:56,608
Is the thing called the net worth

3115
02:29:56,864 --> 02:29:57,632
Sweep and

3116
02:29:57,888 --> 02:29:58,912
Started in 2012

3117
02:29:59,168 --> 02:30:03,520
He said those things Jerome corsi said those things explain that to you

3118
02:30:05,312 --> 02:30:06,336
Read this paragraph

3119
02:30:06,848 --> 02:30:07,360
A little bit ago

3120
02:30:08,384 --> 02:30:12,736
In mid-2012 treasury in the fhfa agreed to change

3121
02:30:12,992 --> 02:30:15,552
Dividend

3122
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:17,856
Ending the need for circular drawers

3123
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:18,880
Instead

3124
02:30:19,136 --> 02:30:19,904
Each company whatever

3125
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:20,928
The flexible dividend

3126
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:21,696
Obligation

3127
02:30:21,952 --> 02:30:24,000
That would rise and fall with their profit

3128
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:25,792
Because the new dividend

3129
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:29,120
Is equal to the positive net worth of each company

3130
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:32,192
Lhasa capital

3131
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:33,984
Set to decline each year

3132
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:35,776
It is known as the net worths

3133
02:30:36,544 --> 02:30:37,312
The net worths

3134
02:30:37,568 --> 02:30:38,080
Is

3135
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:38,848
Sweeping up

3136
02:30:39,104 --> 02:30:40,640
Part of their net worth

3137
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:41,664
Based on

3138
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:43,200
How much they make each year

3139
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:45,504
It's not anything nefarious

3140
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:47,808
Eating order to make sure these companies

3141
02:30:48,064 --> 02:30:48,576
Don't

3142
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:49,600
End up

3143
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:50,624
Droid

3144
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:53,184
By their repayment to the government

3145
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:54,464
Like like

3146
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:57,280
It's how Fox and NBC in the likeness

3147
02:30:57,536 --> 02:30:58,304
Their highest rating

3148
02:31:02,656 --> 02:31:08,800
That's a fun, I enjoy the work

3149
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:11,360
Say you enjoy it with that

3150
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:14,176
I enjoy it

3151
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:18,016
I failed I need I need come I like I need to

3152
02:31:18,272 --> 02:31:21,088
Constructive feedback as much as anybody else Charlie

3153
02:31:23,136 --> 02:31:23,648
I like puns

3154
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:24,416
Look

3155
02:31:24,672 --> 02:31:26,208
I'm a lot like Alex Jones

3156
02:31:26,464 --> 02:31:28,768
In which I am willing to admit when I am wrong

3157
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:30,304
And I will retract

3158
02:31:32,864 --> 02:31:37,472
I am going to tell you I'm going to give you the

3159
02:31:37,728 --> 02:31:39,264
Most generous birth

3160
02:31:39,776 --> 02:31:41,568
I'm going to let you have a lot of baby

3161
02:31:41,824 --> 02:31:42,336
Because that clip was

3162
02:31:42,592 --> 02:31:43,104
So boring

3163
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:46,176
It was so boring Jerome corsi

3164
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:47,456
Can't do it

3165
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:49,248
How is he part of this

3166
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:50,784
He's worse than David.

3167
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:53,344
These people are so bad

3168
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:55,136
Because his name rings out in races

3169
02:31:55,904 --> 02:31:58,720
People really liked the idea that he was all neighbor

3170
02:31:59,488 --> 02:32:01,024
Who loved his work in this way

3171
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:02,816
With boat like that

3172
02:32:03,072 --> 02:32:06,656
They love Jerome corsi

3173
02:32:06,912 --> 02:32:08,192
He held your work a 25

3174
02:32:08,448 --> 02:32:10,496
He has credibility

3175
02:32:10,752 --> 02:32:12,288
He has b******* liar

3176
02:32:12,544 --> 02:32:14,848
Credibility

3177
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:17,408
A show every transition 2/3

3178
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:19,712
Copper dalada

3179
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:25,600
We already talked about a lot of the BuzzFeed coverage and I picked up a lot of Thursday

3180
02:32:27,648 --> 02:32:28,160
I have

3181
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:29,952
Cut a number of clips

3182
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:32,512
That are just good clean fun

3183
02:32:32,768 --> 02:32:38,144
Thursday I wish that he'd stayed up all night and really been involved

3184
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:41,728
He went to bed

3185
02:32:45,056 --> 02:32:45,568
Same time

3186
02:32:48,384 --> 02:32:49,408
There's some really

3187
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:50,688
Really dumb s***

3188
02:32:52,224 --> 02:32:55,552
So why do they want to the stories he's telling is about

3189
02:32:56,832 --> 02:32:57,344
Doesn't even matter

3190
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:58,880
It doesn't even matter

3191
02:32:59,392 --> 02:33:05,280
Is a tertiary piece of news one of the stories he's telling is about

3192
02:33:05,536 --> 02:33:10,656
Enter Alex Jones story right here David Rockefeller who is dead

3193
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:17,824
Naturally what he's up to beyond the grave

3194
02:33:18,336 --> 02:33:24,480
I'm still pretty pissed off at Janet Reno why not

3195
02:33:24,736 --> 02:33:30,880
I cut out a lot of that

3196
02:33:33,952 --> 02:33:38,816
There aren't a lot of ideas because he thinks they come through like German Transylvania

3197
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:39,584
M stock

3198
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:41,888
They are Leo

3199
02:33:42,144 --> 02:33:42,656
That means

3200
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:43,424
That there

3201
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,192
First of all vampires

3202
02:33:44,704 --> 02:33:50,848
Little different but Illuminati stuff Illuminati

3203
02:33:51,104 --> 02:33:51,616
It's insane

3204
02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:55,200
No

3205
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:56,224
Walk back that

3206
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:58,784
The Bavarian Illuminati

3207
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:01,600
That's two words right next to each other that will always be

3208
02:34:02,112 --> 02:34:03,136
I love the variant

3209
02:34:03,648 --> 02:34:05,184
I love Illuminati

3210
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:09,792
Open off

3211
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:15,424
Here's the first clip I'm going to play from the Thursday show

3212
02:34:17,728 --> 02:34:20,544
Joulumaa francophone

3213
02:34:21,056 --> 02:34:22,336
Zapata

3214
02:34:25,152 --> 02:34:26,432
Yes you do like

3215
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:27,712
I love French

3216
02:34:27,968 --> 02:34:28,480
You don't really

3217
02:34:28,992 --> 02:34:30,272
I do I do

3218
02:34:31,808 --> 02:34:32,320
It took many years

3219
02:34:32,576 --> 02:34:33,856
The French in high school

3220
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:35,392
Conversant

3221
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:36,672
Fluent

3222
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:41,792
I understand if you ask me

3223
02:34:42,048 --> 02:34:42,816
To speak back to you

3224
02:34:43,328 --> 02:34:44,096
Nah

3225
02:34:44,864 --> 02:34:46,144
J'adore le francais

3226
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:51,008
I do I will never be able to

3227
02:34:51,264 --> 02:34:51,776
To get

3228
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,312
Phrase

3229
02:34:55,872 --> 02:34:56,384
The French

3230
02:34:56,896 --> 02:34:57,408
Archie's eating

3231
02:34:57,664 --> 02:34:58,176
Surrender monkeys

3232
02:34:59,456 --> 02:35:03,040
It will never Escape my brain good turn of phrase don't believe

3233
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:04,576
I don't believe any of it and if

3234
02:35:04,832 --> 02:35:10,208
Historically the French of one far more victories in battles and all that s*** but goddamnit if

3235
02:35:10,464 --> 02:35:11,232
Cheese-eating surrender mug

3236
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,584
Well at this point the French elections still has not happened

3237
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:16,864
This it probably will have

3238
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:23,008
But try we are we are we are prior to what could be the end of the year

3239
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:24,800
And the world but we're both

3240
02:35:25,056 --> 02:35:26,592
Firmly on the side of macron

3241
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:31,712
As opposed to the alternative

3242
02:35:32,224 --> 02:35:36,576
I'm not I'm not super in his camp but the alternative is a disaster

3243
02:35:37,856 --> 02:35:39,648
Alex Jones is super into lappin

3244
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:42,464
And here is some thoughts about her

3245
02:35:43,488 --> 02:35:44,256
Her dad

3246
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:47,328
Oh no not her dad her dad

3247
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:55,264
So she destroys

3248
02:35:56,800 --> 02:36:01,408
We're doing the ss70

3249
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:02,432
Paratrooper

3250
02:36:02,688 --> 02:36:03,456
Indeed

3251
02:36:17,792 --> 02:36:19,584
It's got to be sweet victory

3252
02:36:20,096 --> 02:36:22,400
Sweet sweet victory for

3253
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:23,936
Jean-Marie Le Pen

3254
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:25,216
Let me ask you a question

3255
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:27,264
Did he support Vichy France

3256
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:29,056
Let me tell you a little story

3257
02:36:29,312 --> 02:36:30,080
I think this is

3258
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:33,408
This is a tiny piece of his troubled history

3259
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:35,968
Jean-Marie Le Pen is

3260
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:37,760
A f****** monster

3261
02:36:38,016 --> 02:36:39,040
Listen to this

3262
02:36:39,552 --> 02:36:40,064
This is

3263
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:42,112
This is from a nice Guardian article

3264
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:45,184
Admittedly

3265
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:46,720
A tiny piece

3266
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:47,744
Right

3267
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:48,768
Is Monster it

3268
02:36:49,024 --> 02:36:49,536
Right

3269
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:50,560
Marine Le Pen

3270
02:36:50,816 --> 02:36:52,864
Who took over the party the national front

3271
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:54,144
The front Nacional

3272
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:54,912
Fascist

3273
02:36:56,192 --> 02:36:57,216
She took a look alike

3274
02:36:57,728 --> 02:36:58,240
They are fashion

3275
02:36:58,496 --> 02:37:00,032
Party in 2011

3276
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:01,824
It is running for French press

3277
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:02,848
The next year this is

3278
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:06,944
Public relations

3279
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:08,992
Drive to detoxify the party

3280
02:37:09,248 --> 02:37:11,552
And move away from it the jackbooted imagery

3281
02:37:11,808 --> 02:37:13,088
Anti-Semitic

3282
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:14,112
Which are

3283
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:14,880
Very real

3284
02:37:15,392 --> 02:37:17,184
After gears

3285
02:37:17,696 --> 02:37:19,232
With anti-semitic undertow

3286
02:37:19,744 --> 02:37:24,608
After years of working alongside her father in April last year

3287
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:29,728
In a total spiral of strategy somewhere between scorched-earth and political suicide

3288
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:32,032
Intern attacked his daughter

3289
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:33,568
Criticism of his gas

3290
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:34,336
A comment

3291
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:38,688
You want to know what those were

3292
02:37:39,712 --> 02:37:43,040
You already said

3293
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:44,320
Gas chamber,

3294
02:37:45,088 --> 02:37:47,136
If Marie Le Pen

3295
02:37:48,672 --> 02:37:49,440
Who sang Jones

3296
02:37:49,696 --> 02:37:50,464
Say those gas

3297
02:37:51,488 --> 02:37:54,048
I don't need to know what those gas chamber, dar

3298
02:37:54,304 --> 02:37:55,328
Because the worst

3299
02:37:55,584 --> 02:37:57,120
Is they start with

3300
02:37:57,632 --> 02:38:01,728
Good for gas Chambers and it even gets worse from there like that's the best

3301
02:38:02,752 --> 02:38:03,520
Scenario he said

3302
02:38:05,056 --> 02:38:08,896
Jean-Marie Le Pen the former leader of France's far-right front National

3303
02:38:09,152 --> 02:38:12,992
Has once again been convicted of a crime

3304
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:17,600
Paper saying that used to kill Jews in the Holocaust

3305
02:38:17,856 --> 02:38:19,136
Detail of History

3306
02:38:19,392 --> 02:38:25,536
There we go

3307
02:38:25,792 --> 02:38:30,144
No big deals actually not as bad as some other people within the front

3308
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:32,448
Because they are people who say that like

3309
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:34,240
There's no way zyklon-b was

3310
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:37,056
Reviews

3311
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:39,616
Well he was still here

3312
02:38:40,384 --> 02:38:42,432
Do the politician

3313
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:45,248
He was a monster but he wasn't going to tell all the

3314
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:48,064
Yeah he was he was the head knot

3315
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:48,832
Some function

3316
02:38:50,112 --> 02:38:50,880
You can say that

3317
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:55,232
I'm doing

3318
02:38:55,488 --> 02:38:58,304
Jerome corsi

3319
02:38:58,560 --> 02:38:59,072
Kia

3320
02:38:59,328 --> 02:39:03,680
He interned attacked his daughter's criticisms of his gas chamber, saying quote

3321
02:39:05,472 --> 02:39:08,032
You're only betrayed by your own

3322
02:39:08,544 --> 02:39:11,872
Then in an interview the same month with the River Roll

3323
02:39:12,128 --> 02:39:14,176
Notorious far-right weekly

3324
02:39:14,432 --> 02:39:15,456
Jean-Marie Le Pen

3325
02:39:15,712 --> 02:39:17,248
Defended Philippe Patek

3326
02:39:17,504 --> 02:39:23,648
The leader of France is not

3327
02:39:23,904 --> 02:39:29,024
Treason after the war so he's a guy who

3328
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:31,584
Call you knew that

3329
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:37,984
We were getting to

3330
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:38,752
Marine Le Pen

3331
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:42,336
What's a fascist

3332
02:39:42,592 --> 02:39:44,128
Father

3333
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:45,408
I knew that

3334
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:47,456
She and her father disowned

3335
02:39:47,712 --> 02:39:48,224
Agreed

3336
02:39:48,992 --> 02:39:51,296
But from everything that I've read about

3337
02:39:51,552 --> 02:39:55,136
Separate

3338
02:39:55,392 --> 02:39:56,672
Like whenever she said

3339
02:39:57,184 --> 02:39:58,720
He has no strategy

3340
02:39:59,488 --> 02:40:01,536
That was the thing that I glommed onto

3341
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:02,816
Yeah because

3342
02:40:03,072 --> 02:40:06,656
Estratex

3343
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:08,960
I disagree with him

3344
02:40:09,472 --> 02:40:09,984
Doing it

3345
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:11,520
This is unmarketable

3346
02:40:11,776 --> 02:40:12,288
Exactly

3347
02:40:13,568 --> 02:40:14,080
I don't

3348
02:40:14,336 --> 02:40:16,128
I don't disagree with advertising

3349
02:40:16,384 --> 02:40:17,664
Two children

3350
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:18,432
Smoking is

3351
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:19,968
I disagree with

3352
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:22,272
How old your advertising to children

3353
02:40:23,296 --> 02:40:29,440
Brightly colored

3354
02:40:29,696 --> 02:40:31,744
To smoke when I do that again

3355
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:35,072
He did

3356
02:40:35,328 --> 02:40:37,632
Globalism

3357
02:40:37,888 --> 02:40:40,192
So is a

3358
02:40:40,448 --> 02:40:41,216
F****** monster

3359
02:40:41,472 --> 02:40:42,240
History

3360
02:40:42,496 --> 02:40:44,544
I don't want to take away from whatever

3361
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:47,104
Military service he has I don't know about

3362
02:40:47,616 --> 02:40:48,640
Who gives a f*** Zack

3363
02:40:48,896 --> 02:40:52,736
He's a month incidental to the fact

3364
02:40:52,992 --> 02:40:53,504
The back

3365
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:54,784
He has

3366
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:56,320
Publicly

3367
02:40:56,832 --> 02:40:58,624
And very emphatically

3368
02:40:58,880 --> 02:40:59,904
Supported

3369
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:00,928
The Nazis

3370
02:41:01,184 --> 02:41:02,208
In WWII

3371
02:41:02,976 --> 02:41:05,280
The front desk and out is

3372
02:41:05,536 --> 02:41:06,304
Apart of that

3373
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:10,656
He was the absolute party for a very Worthy

3374
02:41:10,912 --> 02:41:12,704
Is now the leader of it although

3375
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:14,240
Recently she stepped down

3376
02:41:14,496 --> 02:41:15,776
After the first part of Eli

3377
02:41:16,288 --> 02:41:18,848
The first round down as before

3378
02:41:19,104 --> 02:41:19,872
National leader

3379
02:41:20,128 --> 02:41:21,152
As a PR move

3380
02:41:21,408 --> 02:41:22,432
Because she realized

3381
02:41:22,688 --> 02:41:25,504
I can't detoxify yourself

3382
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:26,528
The party

3383
02:41:26,784 --> 02:41:32,928
Even though she still believed every single most of it but instead of

3384
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:33,696
Semitism

3385
02:41:33,952 --> 02:41:34,720
The big front

3386
02:41:34,976 --> 02:41:36,512
Now is anti-islam

3387
02:41:36,768 --> 02:41:39,072
Show me the flavors change

3388
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:39,840
The same dish

3389
02:41:40,096 --> 02:41:40,608
Basically

3390
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:43,936
I'm glad no racist

3391
02:41:44,704 --> 02:41:45,472
Can can grow

3392
02:41:46,496 --> 02:41:48,032
That least I can have some evolution

3393
02:41:48,288 --> 02:41:49,568
This next clip

3394
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:50,848
Just like

3395
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:53,664
After Islam

3396
02:41:54,944 --> 02:41:56,480
I mean there won't be one we'll all be dead

3397
02:41:57,760 --> 02:41:58,528
Quest

3398
02:41:58,784 --> 02:41:59,296
And again

3399
02:41:59,552 --> 02:42:00,064
You think so

3400
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:01,088
I don't know

3401
02:42:01,344 --> 02:42:04,416
This is what I keep thinking about like this idea

3402
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:06,720
Cuz there's always going to be another

3403
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:09,280
Like this this is the thing that I keep coming into like

3404
02:42:09,792 --> 02:42:11,328
Everyday

3405
02:42:13,632 --> 02:42:15,424
Volt range

3406
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:17,728
Through my head are so varied like

3407
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:19,520
Sometimes it's anger

3408
02:42:19,776 --> 02:42:21,568
Sometimes it's best Kaiser

3409
02:42:21,824 --> 02:42:25,664
What correctly submitted this podcast

3410
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:30,016
One of the one of the things that I keep coming back to and I really can't

3411
02:42:30,272 --> 02:42:31,040
Figure it out.

3412
02:42:31,296 --> 02:42:32,320
I've sat down

3413
02:42:32,576 --> 02:42:33,856
I've been in the bathroom

3414
02:42:34,112 --> 02:42:35,392
I've been vacant

3415
02:42:35,904 --> 02:42:37,440
Think about like

3416
02:42:38,464 --> 02:42:39,744
What what is like

3417
02:42:40,512 --> 02:42:42,048
What's the positive end

3418
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:45,376
Cuz with the endgame realistically is probably a map

3419
02:42:45,632 --> 02:42:47,424
If you look at the real world

3420
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:50,752
But like if the positive end game that Alex

3421
02:42:51,008 --> 02:42:53,056
Seems to be pitching against the globalist

3422
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:56,128
Let's say we take the globalist

3423
02:42:56,384 --> 02:42:58,944
Are we then living in a Utopia

3424
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:02,272
What is the what is the world after the global

3425
02:43:03,808 --> 02:43:04,320
And I don't

3426
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:08,160
I don't think he has a coherent vision of it

3427
02:43:08,416 --> 02:43:10,976
Free market market exist

3428
02:43:11,232 --> 02:43:13,792
We're going to end up in the glass ceiling

3429
02:43:14,048 --> 02:43:19,424
We're going to end up in the same situation we were in with exploitation

3430
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:21,472
What's an implicit part of

3431
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:22,752
Capitalism

3432
02:43:23,008 --> 02:43:23,520
Free capitalist

3433
02:43:24,032 --> 02:43:24,800
Well that we thought

3434
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:26,336
Regulate

3435
02:43:26,592 --> 02:43:27,104
Can't

3436
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:29,920
Govern without regulation you end up with slavery

3437
02:43:30,432 --> 02:43:32,736
That's just how it works can't like even in our own car

3438
02:43:32,992 --> 02:43:33,504
Country Within

3439
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:36,320
Very recent memory we had

3440
02:43:36,832 --> 02:43:38,368
Child workers in mine

3441
02:43:38,624 --> 02:43:39,392
Right because

3442
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:41,440
Industries weren't regulated

3443
02:43:41,696 --> 02:43:43,488
That's just kind of how it works

3444
02:43:43,744 --> 02:43:45,280
So you get rid of

3445
02:43:46,048 --> 02:43:46,560
And then

3446
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:49,120
Nations have sovereignty

3447
02:43:50,144 --> 02:43:50,656
But

3448
02:43:51,168 --> 02:43:54,496
I don't know if that really gets us to where we want to be

3449
02:43:54,752 --> 02:43:58,080
Coherent vision for where they want

3450
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:02,688
They how they don't like me

3451
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:07,552
So things were idyllically better in the past

3452
02:44:07,808 --> 02:44:08,832
Things that drives me

3453
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:10,624
Saying about

3454
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:11,392
Labor Day

3455
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:13,184
Is that people

3456
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:14,720
Never celebrate the fact

3457
02:44:16,256 --> 02:44:17,536
Thousands of people died

3458
02:44:18,048 --> 02:44:18,560
Sherp

3459
02:44:18,816 --> 02:44:20,096
For you to work

3460
02:44:20,352 --> 02:44:20,864
8 hours away

3461
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:24,704
There

3462
02:44:25,216 --> 02:44:25,984
Herter's

3463
02:44:26,496 --> 02:44:28,032
Because people wanted to go from

3464
02:44:28,288 --> 02:44:30,336
10 hours a day 6 days a week

3465
02:44:30,592 --> 02:44:31,104
2/8 hours

3466
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:31,872
The day 5 days

3467
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:33,664
Thousands of

3468
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:34,688
People have died

3469
02:44:35,456 --> 02:44:37,248
Their words legit riots

3470
02:44:37,504 --> 02:44:38,016
The murders

3471
02:44:38,272 --> 02:44:39,040
Absolutely

3472
02:44:40,576 --> 02:44:43,136
Governments were overthrown

3473
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:47,744
We've we've destroyed so many things just so labor

3474
02:44:48,256 --> 02:44:50,304
Has even the slightest bit of

3475
02:44:50,560 --> 02:44:51,072
Control

3476
02:44:52,096 --> 02:44:52,608
We reckon

3477
02:44:53,632 --> 02:44:55,168
Anyone take it away

3478
02:44:55,424 --> 02:44:57,728
Yeah the the argument against

3479
02:44:59,264 --> 02:45:00,032
People always come

3480
02:45:01,824 --> 02:45:02,336
Anecdotal

3481
02:45:02,592 --> 02:45:03,104
Real stories

3482
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:06,688
And I had to wait like

3483
02:45:06,944 --> 02:45:08,224
The week for this guy

3484
02:45:08,736 --> 02:45:09,504
Does using a union

3485
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:11,808
Brightright

3486
02:45:12,064 --> 02:45:15,648
These lazy Union guys

3487
02:45:15,904 --> 02:45:16,672
Argument

3488
02:45:16,928 --> 02:45:19,232
And I was trying it like I told my dad I was like

3489
02:45:19,488 --> 02:45:20,000
Yeah

3490
02:45:20,512 --> 02:45:21,024
You

3491
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:21,792
Stand though

3492
02:45:22,304 --> 02:45:23,328
That those guys

3493
02:45:24,096 --> 02:45:25,120
Those very same guy

3494
02:45:26,912 --> 02:45:27,424
Died

3495
02:45:28,448 --> 02:45:29,728
And even though you're not in the

3496
02:45:29,984 --> 02:45:30,496
Union

3497
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:31,264
You been

3498
02:45:32,288 --> 02:45:36,384
Only work 8 hours a day

3499
02:45:38,176 --> 02:45:39,200
They are always

3500
02:45:39,456 --> 02:45:40,224
He's fighting against

3501
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:40,992
You

3502
02:45:41,248 --> 02:45:43,040
You just don't know you're always

3503
02:45:43,296 --> 02:45:43,808
Fighting against

3504
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:46,112
Well yeah that's that's

3505
02:45:46,368 --> 02:45:49,184
Basically the reality of the world is that

3506
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:50,976
Like the river fight

3507
02:45:51,232 --> 02:45:52,512
Fight happened in the past

3508
02:45:52,768 --> 02:45:56,096
To create systems where people can survive

3509
02:45:57,376 --> 02:45:58,400
Time goes on

3510
02:45:58,912 --> 02:45:59,680
Forget about the fight

3511
02:46:00,192 --> 02:46:00,704
And you forget

3512
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:03,008
The fight led to the current state.

3513
02:46:03,264 --> 02:46:04,543
That were in are you started

3514
02:46:04,799 --> 02:46:05,567
Become complacent

3515
02:46:07,615 --> 02:46:08,639
Right

3516
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:09,919
It's just b*******

3517
02:46:11,711 --> 02:46:13,247
As is happening now

3518
02:46:13,503 --> 02:46:14,015
And that's going

3519
02:46:14,271 --> 02:46:18,111
To keep happening all that she's going to get rolled back and we're going to realize we need

3520
02:46:18,367 --> 02:46:20,159
Need to fight again

3521
02:46:20,415 --> 02:46:23,743
We just should have never let it go away

3522
02:46:24,511 --> 02:46:25,535
The rich are

3523
02:46:25,791 --> 02:46:26,303
Always

3524
02:46:26,559 --> 02:46:27,071
He's fighting again

3525
02:46:27,839 --> 02:46:29,631
And we're only fighting again

3526
02:46:30,655 --> 02:46:31,167
When we get put

3527
02:46:31,935 --> 02:46:32,703
Right

3528
02:46:33,471 --> 02:46:39,615
They are always like even there are raised their tax rate up to 90

3529
02:46:39,871 --> 02:46:40,383
Percent

3530
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:41,407
No one speaks

3531
02:46:41,919 --> 02:46:44,479
Yeah no one ever thought that it was that high there like

3532
02:46:44,735 --> 02:46:49,087
The rich should be taxed at a progressive tax rate nobody's like well after

3533
02:46:49,599 --> 02:46:50,367
F****** the Great Depression

3534
02:46:50,879 --> 02:46:51,647
90%

3535
02:46:52,159 --> 02:46:52,671
It is

3536
02:46:52,927 --> 02:46:54,207
It is never

3537
02:46:54,463 --> 02:46:55,231
Talked about

3538
02:46:55,487 --> 02:46:56,767
That even from that

3539
02:46:57,023 --> 02:46:57,791
F****** day

3540
02:46:58,559 --> 02:46:59,839
They were already working

3541
02:47:00,351 --> 02:47:00,863
Under my nuts

Day one they have

Always been fighting

3545
02:47:08,543 --> 02:47:11,103
Don't win because we're not always fighting

3546
02:47:13,151 --> 02:47:13,919
It's,

3547
02:47:14,431 --> 02:47:14,943
But

3548
02:47:15,455 --> 02:47:15,967
Jordan

3549
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:18,015
Let's let's have some fun

3550
02:47:18,783 --> 02:47:19,295

Fun

3553
02:47:22,623 --> 02:47:24,415
It's I'm excited now

3554
02:47:25,183 --> 02:47:25,695
Weird

3555
02:47:26,463 --> 02:47:30,815
It's one of those

3556
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:32,863
When I heard this I was like

3557
02:47:35,167 --> 02:47:36,191
Cuz it kind of Entry

3558
02:47:36,447 --> 02:47:36,959
Response

3559
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:37,727
Do

3560
02:47:38,751 --> 02:47:40,287
Stephen Colbert talking about

3561
02:47:43,871 --> 02:47:44,639
But boy

3562
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:46,943
Cock holster that sort of stuff

3563
02:47:47,455 --> 02:47:51,295
It's also sort of in response to these ideas that his anti

3564
02:47:51,551 --> 02:47:52,831
Adam Schiff

3565
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:54,367
Was homophobic

3566
02:47:54,623 --> 02:47:57,183
He's kind of parceling all that together

3567
02:47:57,439 --> 02:47:58,463
Write this

3568
02:47:58,719 --> 02:47:59,231
This is

3569
02:47:59,487 --> 02:47:59,999
So

3570
02:48:00,255 --> 02:48:00,767
F****** we

3571
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:02,815
So weird

3572
02:48:04,095 --> 02:48:04,607
And

3573
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:09,471
I just don't know what to say Beyond it's weird

3574
02:48:12,543 --> 02:48:13,567
Putin's but boy

3575
02:48:16,895 --> 02:48:18,687
Budget mean you're bashing

3576
02:48:18,943 --> 02:48:19,967
Gay people

3577
02:48:20,223 --> 02:48:26,367
Universal you're on bottom is what that means

3578
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:40,191
Liberal Society

3579
02:48:40,703 --> 02:48:41,727
What

3580
02:48:42,495 --> 02:48:48,639
Okay

3581
02:48:48,895 --> 02:48:52,223
Gay harassment

3582
02:48:52,479 --> 02:48:58,623
Liberal establishment Hollywood

3583
02:49:07,071 --> 02:49:07,839
But the liberal

3584
02:49:08,095 --> 02:49:13,727
I think he recently just learned about RuPaul's Drag Race

3585
02:49:13,983 --> 02:49:20,127
Or something like that something popped up on his gebo and he was like

3586
02:49:20,383 --> 02:49:21,919
Oh my God

3587
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:22,943
Queer eye for the

3588
02:49:23,199 --> 02:49:23,967
The Straight Guy

3589
02:49:24,735 --> 02:49:26,783
The straight

3590
02:49:28,575 --> 02:49:32,671
I don't know and we're not nearly done with this business.

3591
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:34,975
Done with gay harassment

3592
02:49:36,767 --> 02:49:40,607
It's so obvious what he's talking about

3593
02:49:45,215 --> 02:49:47,007
The term gay harassment

3594
02:49:47,263 --> 02:49:48,543
Harkins into your mind

3595
02:49:48,799 --> 02:49:49,567
Or home Erasmus

3596
02:49:51,103 --> 02:49:52,127
You would think

3597
02:49:52,383 --> 02:49:53,663
It would be legitimate

3598
02:49:54,175 --> 02:49:54,943
It is like it

3599
02:49:55,455 --> 02:49:59,039
I was at a bar and it came up and grab my balls and was like

3600
02:49:59,295 --> 02:49:59,807
You like this

3601
02:50:00,063 --> 02:50:01,599
That's right

3602
02:50:01,855 --> 02:50:07,999
If gay dude treated you like many straight dudes treat women have nothing to do

3603
02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:08,767
Do with your gender

3604
02:50:09,023 --> 02:50:11,839
Maybe what you talked about it

3605
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:13,119
It's not what he's talking about

3606
02:50:13,375 --> 02:50:15,423
The societal idea that people force you to

3607
02:50:15,679 --> 02:50:16,191
Except

3608
02:50:16,447 --> 02:50:17,215
Dave Chappelle

3609
02:50:17,727 --> 02:50:18,239
Or whatever

3610
02:50:18,495 --> 02:50:20,543
And he's going to speak more on it and it's

3611
02:50:20,799 --> 02:50:21,567
F****** weird

3612
02:50:22,079 --> 02:50:23,103
It's so weird

3613
02:50:23,359 --> 02:50:25,663
I don't understand how someone can

3614
02:50:25,919 --> 02:50:27,199
Feel victimized

3615
02:50:27,711 --> 02:50:29,247
By someone else's

3616
02:50:29,759 --> 02:50:30,271
Expression of the

3617
02:50:31,039 --> 02:50:31,551
But Alex

3618
02:50:31,807 --> 02:50:32,319
Does

3619
02:50:34,367 --> 02:50:35,647
I like I said

3620
02:50:35,903 --> 02:50:37,183
Describe it other than weird

3621
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:39,487
Cuz it's not really bigger than it is

3622
02:50:39,999 --> 02:50:40,767
But if that's not

3623
02:50:41,535 --> 02:50:47,167
It's more confused

3624
02:50:47,423 --> 02:50:48,447
Bigoted is

3625
02:50:48,959 --> 02:50:49,983
You know what your

3626
02:50:50,239 --> 02:50:54,847
Do a situation he's like somebody who's by

3627
02:50:55,103 --> 02:50:59,455
I don't want to put in his mouth

3628
02:50:59,711 --> 02:51:00,223
But like

3629
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:03,551
It's a hundred percent

3630
02:51:03,807 --> 02:51:04,831
Definitely Morgan

3631
02:51:05,087 --> 02:51:06,623
Fuse then

3632
02:51:06,879 --> 02:51:08,159
You nailed it I think

3633
02:51:08,415 --> 02:51:10,719
In that like bigotry often

3634
02:51:10,975 --> 02:51:11,999
There's intent

3635
02:51:12,255 --> 02:51:12,767
Involved

3636
02:51:13,023 --> 02:51:16,863
There's like one just like our Ivy versus our livers

3637
02:51:17,119 --> 02:51:19,167
The stupid what

3638
02:51:21,727 --> 02:51:23,775
And stupid is your just receiving

3639
02:51:24,031 --> 02:51:24,543
Cuz you don't

3640
02:51:24,799 --> 02:51:27,615
Understand this is confusion versus bigot

3641
02:51:27,871 --> 02:51:29,919
Yeah he's really on the side of

3642
02:51:30,175 --> 02:51:32,223
Computer now that's not to say he's not a big

3643
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:37,343
Because he certainly has we've already proved that meant

3644
02:51:37,599 --> 02:51:38,111
Wrestling is

3645
02:51:38,623 --> 02:51:39,391
Confusion

3646
02:51:40,927 --> 02:51:41,439
Listen to rest

3647
02:51:42,719 --> 02:51:43,487
Put up with

3648
02:51:44,767 --> 02:51:50,911
Along with

3649
02:51:51,167 --> 02:51:52,191
Company trailer

3650
02:51:52,447 --> 02:51:55,519
Driving to the middle of neighborhood

3651
02:51:58,335 --> 02:52:01,407
I mean we got to stop we got to stop already

3652
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:04,223
I've lived in Chicago for 7 years

3653
02:52:04,735 --> 02:52:05,503
I've been to like

3654
02:52:05,759 --> 02:52:08,575
I think five years are going to Pride and

3655
02:52:10,879 --> 02:52:13,183
Naked people f****** each other in the street

3656
02:52:13,439 --> 02:52:13,951
Never

3657
02:52:14,207 --> 02:52:16,511
Nevers there's never ever been nude

3658
02:52:16,767 --> 02:52:20,095
I've even been to the naked bike riding that hasn't been that too

3659
02:52:20,351 --> 02:52:26,495
But there's there's never been nudity there are like shirtless greased up dudes and stuff but that's not the entire parade

3660
02:52:26,751 --> 02:52:30,335
Hetero hetero

3661
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:31,615
There would be naked Sherpa

3662
02:52:32,895 --> 02:52:35,199
But there's also like Civic organizations

3663
02:52:35,711 --> 02:52:39,039
Just joining in celebrating it's not like

3664
02:52:39,295 --> 02:52:41,855
It's not all gay by all means

3665
02:52:43,391 --> 02:52:43,903
By the way

3666
02:52:44,415 --> 02:52:45,439
This premise of

3667
02:52:45,695 --> 02:52:47,231
Your neighborhood doesn't

3668
02:52:47,487 --> 02:52:48,767
Want this parade

3669
02:52:49,535 --> 02:52:52,095
Parade never go through neighborhood

3670
02:52:52,351 --> 02:52:56,191
Chicago Gay Pride Parade goes down Halsted Street

3671
02:52:56,447 --> 02:52:56,959
Which is

3672
02:52:59,263 --> 02:53:00,287
Street of Lakeview

3673
02:53:03,103 --> 02:53:04,895
I'm in Belmont and

3674
02:53:05,151 --> 02:53:08,479
Hallstatt

3675
02:53:10,271 --> 02:53:12,831
But people live there

3676
02:53:13,087 --> 02:53:13,599
Essentially

3677
02:53:13,855 --> 02:53:17,439
It's not it's not a neighborhood in in the sense that most people in America

3678
02:53:17,695 --> 02:53:18,207
Think of it like

3679
02:53:18,463 --> 02:53:20,767
Residential

3680
02:53:21,023 --> 02:53:21,791
Because I grew up

3681
02:53:22,047 --> 02:53:22,559
In a

3682
02:53:22,815 --> 02:53:23,327
Small town

3683
02:53:23,839 --> 02:53:25,631
And I have a pride parade

3684
02:53:28,703 --> 02:53:30,495
Yeah and so if you are somebody

3685
02:53:30,751 --> 02:53:31,263
Who grew up in a

3686
02:53:34,591 --> 02:53:35,615
And somebody's telling you about

3687
02:53:37,151 --> 02:53:39,711
To you that doesn't mean what it does to us

3688
02:53:45,599 --> 02:53:47,135
To you that means

3689
02:53:47,647 --> 02:53:49,439
I saw a marching band with

3690
02:53:49,695 --> 02:53:50,719
Dick's everywhere

3691
02:53:50,975 --> 02:53:51,743
That's what it's

3692
02:53:51,999 --> 02:53:53,279
That's what your mental

3693
02:53:53,535 --> 02:53:55,327
A version of a parade is

3694
02:53:55,583 --> 02:53:57,119
Is like the high school track

3695
02:53:57,375 --> 02:54:01,983
Field has the band is going around Circle

3696
02:54:02,239 --> 02:54:05,055
With your Narrative of what the

3697
02:54:05,311 --> 02:54:06,079
Pride Parade

3698
02:54:06,591 --> 02:54:08,383
It never connects to what

3699
02:54:08,639 --> 02:54:09,151
Actually

3700
02:54:09,407 --> 02:54:09,919
Because you never

3701
02:54:10,431 --> 02:54:15,295
My only complaint that I've ever had about the pride parade is like

3702
02:54:16,063 --> 02:54:16,575
Gay enough

3703
02:54:16,831 --> 02:54:19,647
Like I've always left the pride parade being like

3704
02:54:20,671 --> 02:54:21,951
I didn't see a single deck

3705
02:54:22,719 --> 02:54:25,023
I don't know what's going on here

3706
02:54:25,279 --> 02:54:28,863
I think a lot of people were co-opting

3707
02:54:29,119 --> 02:54:32,447
Little bit like I am like the stuffy old dude but I'm

3708
02:54:32,703 --> 02:54:35,519
Not a part of the community

3709
02:54:36,799 --> 02:54:39,871
It was gay or back when I was a kid

3710
02:54:40,383 --> 02:54:43,455
I don't know why but I do to me

3711
02:54:51,135 --> 02:54:52,671
What was it back in

3712
02:54:52,927 --> 02:54:54,463
2015

3713
02:54:55,999 --> 02:54:57,023
This Supreme Court

3714
02:54:57,535 --> 02:55:01,631
Made the ruling about gay marriage the day before pride and Chicago

3715
02:55:01,887 --> 02:55:05,983
I remember and it was such an awesome party but even then

3716
02:55:06,239 --> 02:55:06,751
It wasn't

3717
02:55:07,007 --> 02:55:08,287
Just people f****** on float

3718
02:55:08,799 --> 02:55:14,943
Like it wasn't. It was a wonderful celebration and everyone hugging each other it was just great

3719
02:55:15,199 --> 02:55:16,223
It was

3720
02:55:17,503 --> 02:55:20,063
But it was a human

3721
02:55:20,575 --> 02:55:21,599
Pride day

3722
02:55:21,855 --> 02:55:22,367
Where

3723
02:55:22,623 --> 02:55:24,927
It wasn't about being gay it was about

3724
02:55:25,439 --> 02:55:25,951
Accepting

3725
02:55:26,719 --> 02:55:32,607
Everybody now Alex is going to get into other parade we skipped over the fact that he said

3726
02:55:32,863 --> 02:55:33,375
Trump

3727
02:55:34,143 --> 02:55:34,911
Equals but

3728
02:55:35,679 --> 02:55:36,703
Watching

3729
02:55:37,727 --> 02:55:40,287
Call I want

3730
02:55:40,799 --> 02:55:42,079
Cuz it's coming back

3731
02:55:42,335 --> 02:55:44,383
But for now is going to get into

3732
02:55:44,639 --> 02:55:45,407
Two more parade

3733
02:55:46,175 --> 02:55:46,687
Tinker bat exam

3734
02:55:48,991 --> 02:55:53,087
A normal parade for the military

3735
02:55:57,439 --> 02:56:03,583
So like it is for children

3736
02:56:03,839 --> 02:56:05,119
Patrick's Day Parade

3737
02:56:05,375 --> 02:56:06,655
Drunk as assholes

3738
02:56:06,911 --> 02:56:08,959
Throwing s*** around

3739
02:56:09,215 --> 02:56:13,311
Every time I've gone on the street

3740
02:56:13,567 --> 02:56:17,151
Not granted baby at the Gay Pride Parade people pissing on 32 but the

3741
02:56:17,407 --> 02:56:18,175
Every time

3742
02:56:18,431 --> 02:56:20,223
I've never seen a dick cuz everyone has been

3743
02:56:20,735 --> 02:56:22,015
Directions go in an alley

3744
02:56:26,623 --> 02:56:28,415
Street pissing everywhere

3745
02:56:28,671 --> 02:56:32,255
Marches work military marches computer good

3746
02:56:32,767 --> 02:56:34,303
Auntie Patrick's Day

3747
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:35,583
In a bathroom that I

3748
02:56:35,839 --> 02:56:36,351
Ever seen

3749
02:56:37,119 --> 02:56:40,703
Super cool is it at if you live in a big city they have

3750
02:56:41,215 --> 02:56:41,727
Blotters

3751
02:56:43,007 --> 02:56:43,519
Like blogs

3752
02:56:43,775 --> 02:56:44,287
Keep track of

3753
02:56:44,799 --> 02:56:45,823
You know calls to the

3754
02:56:46,079 --> 02:56:52,223
The police look at it I've actually done some research on this I don't have to

3755
02:56:52,479 --> 02:56:53,759
But the numbers for like

3756
02:56:54,015 --> 02:56:54,783
The Blackhawks

3757
02:56:55,039 --> 02:56:55,551
When

3758
02:56:55,807 --> 02:56:56,831
I want they want

3759
02:56:57,087 --> 02:56:58,367
The Stanley Cup to write

3760
02:56:59,647 --> 02:57:00,671
Actually do it

3761
02:57:00,927 --> 02:57:02,207
The Cubs win the World Series

3762
02:57:02,463 --> 02:57:04,255
Was shockingly devoid of tons

3763
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:06,303
That one was

3764
02:57:08,607 --> 02:57:09,631
It's a once-in-a-lifetime

3765
02:57:16,031 --> 02:57:19,359
You know it's celebration

3766
02:57:19,615 --> 02:57:21,663
Saint Patrick's Day

3767
02:57:21,919 --> 02:57:22,943
Consistently they have

3768
02:57:23,199 --> 02:57:23,967
Way more crime

3769
02:57:28,063 --> 02:57:29,599
That premise is flawed on

3770
02:57:30,111 --> 02:57:30,623
Now let's get back

3771
02:57:42,399 --> 02:57:42,911
Used wife

3772
02:57:43,935 --> 02:57:48,543
Your friend

3773
02:57:53,151 --> 02:57:54,431
Get a room

3774
02:58:19,007 --> 02:58:25,151
Hotel

3775
02:58:26,943 --> 02:58:32,063
I am so pissed off because at this point at this point my recorder

3776
02:58:32,319 --> 02:58:33,087
Bike glitch

3777
02:58:33,599 --> 02:58:34,623
And I am I lost

3778
02:58:34,879 --> 02:58:37,695
The next thing citycell

3779
02:58:37,951 --> 02:58:38,975
About these dudes

3780
02:58:39,231 --> 02:58:41,791
In a hotel lobby grabbing their asses

3781
02:58:42,047 --> 02:58:45,375
They're doing it just to show off for you

3782
02:58:46,655 --> 02:58:50,239
Let's play

3783
02:58:50,751 --> 02:58:56,127
I just want to have one experience with a dude like that

3784
02:58:57,151 --> 02:59:00,991
Definitely sounds like

3785
02:59:01,247 --> 02:59:02,015
Pac-Man watch

3786
02:59:02,527 --> 02:59:03,039
But he's using

3787
02:59:04,575 --> 02:59:05,855
The parade stuff is in the

3788
02:59:06,623 --> 02:59:09,439
Enter now he's using this idea of

3789
02:59:09,695 --> 02:59:10,463
You go out with you

3790
02:59:10,719 --> 02:59:11,487
Your friends and

3791
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:16,863
You know this guy a couple and they're just kissing the whole time

3792
02:59:17,375 --> 02:59:20,703
That is rude and you're like Cheese's

3793
02:59:22,239 --> 02:59:24,799
Making out if we agree that that's rude

3794
02:59:25,311 --> 02:59:28,639
Whether it's a guy or girl or two guys or two girls

3795
02:59:29,919 --> 02:59:30,943
You name

3796
02:59:31,455 --> 02:59:33,247
I'm not sure the point he's making

3797
02:59:33,759 --> 02:59:35,295
I don't think government

3798
02:59:35,551 --> 02:59:37,087
I think he's trying to track

3799
02:59:37,343 --> 02:59:37,855
Back that

3800
02:59:38,111 --> 02:59:39,391
To Gay Pride Parade

3801
02:59:39,647 --> 02:59:41,183
In terms of being like

3802
02:59:41,439 --> 02:59:45,279
That's the equivalent of thousands of people making out in the street

3803
02:59:46,303 --> 02:59:46,815
Yeah

3804
02:59:50,911 --> 02:59:53,471
And all of these people are enjoying themselves at

3805
02:59:54,495 --> 02:59:57,311
Yeah that's right that's what it is

3806
02:59:57,823 --> 02:59:58,591
Yeah yeah

3807
02:59:58,847 --> 02:59:59,359
Now hold on

3808
02:59:59,871 --> 03:00:03,967
His rant isn't done I told you my recorder glitched out a tiny bit I walked that Chuck

3809
03:00:04,223 --> 03:00:05,759
But it picked up immediately

3810
03:00:06,015 --> 03:00:07,039
Here's the end of this

3811
03:00:08,319 --> 03:00:09,343
Around

3812
03:00:11,135 --> 03:00:12,159
Hopping around

3813
03:00:16,511 --> 03:00:17,535
41

3814
03:00:21,887 --> 03:00:23,679
And when I say something

3815
03:00:24,703 --> 03:00:26,751
Shifting globulus but boy

3816
03:00:36,735 --> 03:00:41,855
Is very clear

3817
03:00:45,951 --> 03:00:49,535
Lindsey Graham

3818
03:00:49,791 --> 03:00:50,559
Congressman

3819
03:00:51,071 --> 03:00:52,095
Peter Schiff

3820
03:00:53,887 --> 03:00:56,191
Just for fun

3821
03:00:56,703 --> 03:00:57,215
Trump

3822
03:00:57,727 --> 03:00:59,263
Has become the Butt Boy

3823
03:00:59,775 --> 03:01:03,615
Of John McCain and just to be clear his name is Adam Schiff not

3824
03:01:03,871 --> 03:01:10,015
Peter Schiff

3825
03:01:10,271 --> 03:01:11,807
Cousin

3826
03:01:12,319 --> 03:01:14,111
I just

3827
03:01:14,367 --> 03:01:19,487
I don't know if f****** love that like if I want to be homophobic

3828
03:01:19,743 --> 03:01:23,583
You nailed

3829
03:01:27,935 --> 03:01:32,799
I'm just on the back burner come on the idea of like gay people exist in public

3830
03:01:33,055 --> 03:01:33,823
And I'm sick of it

3831
03:01:35,871 --> 03:01:36,383
Horrible

3832
03:01:36,639 --> 03:01:40,735
I wanted to be homophobic

3833
03:01:40,991 --> 03:01:42,271
Say all the s*** I just said

3834
03:01:43,807 --> 03:01:46,111
So we got via two more Clips Jordan

3835
03:01:46,367 --> 03:01:48,159
The first one is

3836
03:01:48,415 --> 03:01:50,207
Another narrative that he was trying to pitch on

3837
03:01:50,463 --> 03:01:51,231
Thursday show that is

3838
03:01:51,487 --> 03:01:51,999
Stupid

3839
03:01:52,255 --> 03:01:55,327
And then the last one is one of the most unfortunate

3840
03:01:55,839 --> 03:01:56,351
He just said

3841
03:01:57,119 --> 03:01:57,631
Trump

3842
03:01:57,887 --> 03:01:58,399
Is

3843
03:01:58,655 --> 03:01:59,679
The Butt Boy

3844
03:02:00,447 --> 03:02:00,959
Of John McCain

3845
03:02:01,215 --> 03:02:01,983
And the

3846
03:02:02,239 --> 03:02:04,799
Globalist

3847
03:02:06,847 --> 03:02:07,615
I don't want to

3848
03:02:11,199 --> 03:02:11,711
He said

3849
03:02:12,223 --> 03:02:14,527
Trump is the Butt Boy

3850
03:02:14,783 --> 03:02:15,551
It's going to get worse

3851
03:02:15,807 --> 03:02:16,831
That's my favorite thing

3852
03:02:17,087 --> 03:02:17,599
It's going to get worse

3853
03:02:17,855 --> 03:02:21,439
Compass the butterfly of John McCain

3854
03:02:21,695 --> 03:02:24,255
Isn't that in the mainstream white papers huh

3855
03:02:24,511 --> 03:02:25,023
Hold on

3856
03:02:25,279 --> 03:02:26,303
Wait for it cuz

3857
03:02:26,815 --> 03:02:28,095
Be a coiled spring

3858
03:02:29,119 --> 03:02:31,423
The next clip I play after this one

3859
03:02:31,679 --> 03:02:33,471
It'll that's when we can really tee-off

3860
03:02:33,727 --> 03:02:35,775
But this one is another dumbass narrative

3861
03:02:36,031 --> 03:02:37,567
Who's pitching it's about Bill Nye the Science Guy

3862
03:02:38,847 --> 03:02:40,639
Bill Nye the Science Guy

3863
03:02:40,895 --> 03:02:44,735
LG TV out in the second

3864
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:50,879
They said the chromosomes determine the sex

3865
03:02:54,975 --> 03:02:55,999
The chromosomes

3866
03:02:58,047 --> 03:03:00,095
No it's in your mind

3867
03:03:03,167 --> 03:03:08,799
So here's the thing that's going on there he thinks that bill gender identity with

3868
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:11,871
Basically

3869
03:03:12,127 --> 03:03:14,175
What's the same time

3870
03:03:14,431 --> 03:03:17,247
This episode that Bill Nye put out in the 90s

3871
03:03:18,015 --> 03:03:21,343
Yay

3872
03:03:21,599 --> 03:03:22,879
Yeah

3873
03:03:23,391 --> 03:03:23,903
Heater

3874
03:03:24,159 --> 03:03:27,231
There was a meme that was starting to go around on the right-wing Reddit

3875
03:03:27,743 --> 03:03:30,559
About trying to point out that Bill Nye is a hypocrite

3876
03:03:30,815 --> 03:03:33,887
Because he said

3877
03:03:34,143 --> 03:03:35,679
But if you actually look at

3878
03:03:35,935 --> 03:03:36,703
The quote that they

3879
03:03:36,959 --> 03:03:38,751
You think it was not a quote

3880
03:03:42,335 --> 03:03:44,383
And then further they didn't actually watch

3881
03:03:44,639 --> 03:03:45,151
The new episode

3882
03:03:45,407 --> 03:03:46,175
Cuz

3883
03:03:46,431 --> 03:03:47,711
Is from

3884
03:03:48,223 --> 03:03:51,295
The human sexuality episode of Bill Nye Saves the World

3885
03:03:51,807 --> 03:03:52,831
Is news

3886
03:03:53,599 --> 03:03:56,159
Science is the process by which we understand nature

3887
03:03:56,415 --> 03:03:58,207
By which we understand our place in the world

3888
03:03:58,463 --> 03:03:59,231
How we all fit in

3889
03:03:59,743 --> 03:04:00,767
We used to think it was

3890
03:04:01,023 --> 03:04:01,791
Pretty straightforward

3891
03:04:02,303 --> 03:04:03,583
X and Y chromosomes

3892
03:04:03,839 --> 03:04:04,351
For males

3893
03:04:04,863 --> 03:04:05,887
Two x's for free mail

3894
03:04:06,399 --> 03:04:07,679
The Ouija board combination

3895
03:04:07,935 --> 03:04:08,959
In the real life

3896
03:04:09,471 --> 03:04:12,031
Even for people with just two sexes

3897
03:04:13,055 --> 03:04:14,591
Hormones can vary widely

3898
03:04:15,103 --> 03:04:15,871
So can Anatomy

3899
03:04:16,383 --> 03:04:20,223
That's what makes someone male or female is not so clear-cut

3900
03:04:20,991 --> 03:04:22,527
So even in his new episode he's

3901
03:04:22,783 --> 03:04:23,807
Discussing how science

3902
03:04:24,063 --> 03:04:24,575
Has progressed

3903
03:04:25,087 --> 03:04:25,599
The night

3904
03:04:27,135 --> 03:04:29,695
Giving you the scientific explanation for what

3905
03:04:29,951 --> 03:04:33,279
But even when I was in high school I understood there were people sometimes who have three

3906
03:04:33,791 --> 03:04:35,839
From xxy

3907
03:04:36,095 --> 03:04:39,167
There are there are people like that

3908
03:04:39,423 --> 03:04:40,447
Even tribal

3909
03:04:40,703 --> 03:04:42,495
Group understood intersex

3910
03:04:44,543 --> 03:04:46,847
You got look into Native American

3911
03:04:47,359 --> 03:04:48,639
Understanding the culture they have

3912
03:04:48,895 --> 03:04:49,407
They have

3913
03:04:50,687 --> 03:04:51,199
7

3914
03:04:54,783 --> 03:04:55,295
And maybe that wasn't

3915
03:04:55,807 --> 03:04:56,831
Science

3916
03:04:57,087 --> 03:05:01,439
Punk Bill Nye for this Bill Nye

3917
03:05:02,463 --> 03:05:03,231
Said ones

3918
03:05:04,255 --> 03:05:05,023
In the night

3919
03:05:05,535 --> 03:05:06,559
And at that time

3920
03:05:06,815 --> 03:05:07,583
It reflected

3921
03:05:07,839 --> 03:05:08,607
What he thought

3922
03:05:09,375 --> 03:05:11,679
Or what the prevailing scientific knowledge at the time

3923
03:05:11,935 --> 03:05:12,447
Yep

3924
03:05:13,471 --> 03:05:14,495
Amazingly

3925
03:05:15,007 --> 03:05:16,031
Overtime

3926
03:05:16,543 --> 03:05:17,823
It has been revised

3927
03:05:18,335 --> 03:05:18,847
And revise

3928
03:05:22,687 --> 03:05:23,711
Is something that reflects

3929
03:05:24,223 --> 03:05:25,503
The scientific knowledge of

3930
03:05:26,015 --> 03:05:27,551
Wolf

3931
03:05:28,831 --> 03:05:30,879
Alliance crab doesn't matter

3932
03:05:31,135 --> 03:05:34,463
One of the most important pieces of Sia

3933
03:05:34,975 --> 03:05:36,255
Is a lot of it's Up For Debate

3934
03:05:38,047 --> 03:05:39,839
YouTube

3935
03:05:40,095 --> 03:05:41,375
Experiments and that's how you come up with

3936
03:05:41,631 --> 03:05:42,143
With a theorem

3937
03:05:42,399 --> 03:05:42,911
Or

3938
03:05:43,935 --> 03:05:44,447
Like

3939
03:05:45,471 --> 03:05:48,287
It's never a hard-and-fast rule some piece of evidence

3940
03:05:48,543 --> 03:05:49,567
Mike show up in the

3941
03:05:49,823 --> 03:05:53,407
Future that changes the experiment it might change what your

3942
03:05:53,663 --> 03:05:54,687
Sanding and then

3943
03:05:54,943 --> 03:05:56,223
Everything gets reevaluate

3944
03:05:56,479 --> 03:05:58,527
Right

3945
03:05:58,783 --> 03:05:59,807
That's the myth

3946
03:06:00,063 --> 03:06:01,343
That I get from

3947
03:06:01,855 --> 03:06:02,367
Right-wing p

3948
03:06:02,623 --> 03:06:03,135
People

3949
03:06:04,415 --> 03:06:05,183
All the time

3950
03:06:05,439 --> 03:06:05,951
Which is that

3951
03:06:06,207 --> 03:06:07,231
If you

3952
03:06:07,487 --> 03:06:08,511
Believe something

3953
03:06:08,767 --> 03:06:09,279
That

3954
03:06:10,047 --> 03:06:11,071
And now it's different

3955
03:06:11,839 --> 03:06:12,351
That means

3956
03:06:12,607 --> 03:06:13,375
You're that

3957
03:06:13,887 --> 03:06:15,167
You don't believe in any

3958
03:06:15,423 --> 03:06:16,191
Right as

3959
03:06:16,447 --> 03:06:19,775
Supposed to invalidate your passport

3960
03:06:20,031 --> 03:06:22,335
Invalidate your current

3961
03:06:22,591 --> 03:06:24,639
You're a flip-flopper of the highest order

3962
03:06:24,895 --> 03:06:28,223
Where is if you are if you are just a physical

3963
03:06:28,479 --> 03:06:28,991
That's right

3964
03:06:29,247 --> 03:06:30,271
Then you say

3965
03:06:30,527 --> 03:06:31,551
Force equals mass

3966
03:06:32,063 --> 03:06:32,575
Acceleration

3967
03:06:33,087 --> 03:06:34,111
And that's true

3968
03:06:34,367 --> 03:06:35,391
But it's true most

3969
03:06:35,903 --> 03:06:37,951
And then came around

3970
03:06:38,207 --> 03:06:39,487
And he said equals MC

3971
03:06:39,743 --> 03:06:40,255
2 squared

3972
03:06:40,511 --> 03:06:42,047
Which is a very

3973
03:06:42,303 --> 03:06:43,071
It's a

3974
03:06:44,607 --> 03:06:46,399
It's a kind of connotation of that say

3975
03:06:46,655 --> 03:06:47,167
Formula

3976
03:06:47,423 --> 03:06:48,703
It doesn't invalidate

3977
03:06:49,215 --> 03:06:49,983
The prior

3978
03:06:50,239 --> 03:06:50,751
Force equals mass

3979
03:06:53,567 --> 03:06:55,615
So it is not that I don't

3980
03:06:55,871 --> 03:06:57,151
I think that that prior stuff

3981
03:06:57,407 --> 03:06:57,919
Supplies

3982
03:06:58,175 --> 03:06:59,711
If that now it is Morse

3983
03:06:59,967 --> 03:07:00,479
Specific

3984
03:07:00,735 --> 03:07:01,759
And now it is more a

3985
03:07:02,527 --> 03:07:04,063
And that is what scientist

3986
03:07:04,575 --> 03:07:06,111
Striving for More Acura

3987
03:07:06,623 --> 03:07:08,159
Not striving for changing it

3988
03:07:08,415 --> 03:07:09,951
Mine back and forth on this

3989
03:07:10,207 --> 03:07:10,719
Send SMS

3990
03:07:11,231 --> 03:07:13,279
If that within the available information

3991
03:07:13,535 --> 03:07:14,815
We have this is our

3992
03:07:15,071 --> 03:07:15,839
That's amazing

3993
03:07:16,095 --> 03:07:17,119
And I'm not a scientist

3994
03:07:17,375 --> 03:07:19,423
Then I'm not like that that part of my brain.

3995
03:07:19,679 --> 03:07:23,775
Don't really work all that well but I know a lot of people who are of that

3996
03:07:24,031 --> 03:07:25,055
Some friends were doctors

3997
03:07:27,615 --> 03:07:28,639
All of them

3998
03:07:29,919 --> 03:07:30,687
The essence of

3999
03:07:30,943 --> 03:07:32,479
What they're into is that like

4000
03:07:32,735 --> 03:07:34,783
Time everything can change

4001
03:07:35,807 --> 03:07:38,623
And everyone I know who's ever done a study is

4002
03:07:39,135 --> 03:07:39,903
What we're looking at

4003
03:07:40,159 --> 03:07:40,671
This

4004
03:07:40,927 --> 03:07:42,719
We're not beholding to the outcome

4005
03:07:42,975 --> 03:07:45,023
Proven wrong

4006
03:07:45,279 --> 03:07:46,047
That's even more

4007
03:07:47,071 --> 03:07:53,215
So there's nothing better than being proven wrong because then you'll learn some everybody thinks that science is like

4008
03:07:53,471 --> 03:07:54,495
Really stuffy

4009
03:07:54,751 --> 03:07:55,263
Right

4010
03:07:55,519 --> 03:07:57,567
It's all about

4011
03:07:57,823 --> 03:07:59,103
Equation

4012
03:07:59,359 --> 03:08:01,663
And it's not it and in the same way that logic

4013
03:08:01,919 --> 03:08:02,687
Seems really

4014
03:08:02,943 --> 03:08:03,455
Dry and itchy

4015
03:08:03,711 --> 03:08:04,479
It's not right

4016
03:08:06,015 --> 03:08:09,087
There's an art to both things

4017
03:08:09,343 --> 03:08:09,855
Darrell live

4018
03:08:10,367 --> 03:08:12,159
They're alive they're not static

4019
03:08:13,183 --> 03:08:16,511
Anytime saying

4020
03:08:16,767 --> 03:08:18,047
That ideology

4021
03:08:20,095 --> 03:08:22,399
Yes cuz we can take Alex Jones as belief

4022
03:08:22,655 --> 03:08:23,423
It's back to

4023
03:08:23,679 --> 03:08:25,215
Back when he was in the nineties

4024
03:08:25,727 --> 03:08:26,751
And his beliefs are stay

4025
03:08:27,263 --> 03:08:28,287
Right about the global

4026
03:08:29,823 --> 03:08:30,335
So he is

4027
03:08:30,847 --> 03:08:31,615
Frame of reference

4028
03:08:31,871 --> 03:08:32,895
Everything has been

4029
03:08:33,151 --> 03:08:33,663
Set

4030
03:08:33,919 --> 03:08:35,967
Sent Bill Nye made that first episode

4031
03:08:36,223 --> 03:08:37,247
Now culture has

4032
03:08:37,759 --> 03:08:38,271
Grown

4033
03:08:39,039 --> 03:08:41,343
Information knowledge has grown around

4034
03:08:43,391 --> 03:08:43,903
Belief

4035
03:08:44,159 --> 03:08:44,927
That no

4036
03:08:45,183 --> 03:08:46,719
There is a group of evil people

4037
03:08:46,975 --> 03:08:47,743
Destroy us all

4038
03:08:48,511 --> 03:08:49,023
I've used this

4039
03:08:49,535 --> 03:08:50,303
Eugenics

4040
03:08:50,559 --> 03:08:51,327
System in all this

4041
03:08:51,583 --> 03:08:52,863
That has never changed

4042
03:08:53,119 --> 03:08:53,631
Threatened

4043
03:08:53,887 --> 03:08:54,399
Him

4044
03:08:55,167 --> 03:08:56,447
It don't look like people are

4045
03:08:58,495 --> 03:08:59,775
Flip flopping around

4046
03:09:00,287 --> 03:09:00,799
I meant stupid

4047
03:09:01,055 --> 03:09:02,847
Looks like a

4048
03:09:04,127 --> 03:09:06,943
The climate denier argument is always like

4049
03:09:10,271 --> 03:09:12,575
And now they say were Heating and you're like

4050
03:09:12,831 --> 03:09:13,599
No that's

4051
03:09:13,855 --> 03:09:15,135
Your you're

4052
03:09:16,159 --> 03:09:17,951
Misrepresenting what they said beat

4053
03:09:18,207 --> 03:09:19,487
Because you didn't understand it

4054
03:09:19,999 --> 03:09:22,047
Right you dismissed it out of course

4055
03:09:22,303 --> 03:09:24,863
And then now it doesn't seem like they're saying

4056
03:09:25,119 --> 03:09:25,631
The same thing

4057
03:09:25,887 --> 03:09:26,911
Even though you did

4058
03:09:27,167 --> 03:09:32,543
Bother to look into it because you've already dismissed it looks like someone is

4059
03:09:32,799 --> 03:09:35,615
Saying the exact opposite thing

4060
03:09:35,871 --> 03:09:38,687
The science look at the map

4061
03:09:38,943 --> 03:09:40,991
Like the math is always

4062
03:09:42,783 --> 03:09:43,295
But anyway

4063
03:09:45,087 --> 03:09:45,599
Throughout

4064
03:09:45,855 --> 03:09:46,367
This

4065
03:09:47,391 --> 03:09:48,159
30 hour

4066
03:09:48,671 --> 03:09:49,183
Broadcast

4067
03:09:49,439 --> 03:09:49,951
NRA

4068
03:09:50,207 --> 03:09:50,719
30 hour

4069
03:09:57,631 --> 03:09:58,655
Spouted a bunch of bull

4070
03:09:59,423 --> 03:10:00,447
And like

4071
03:10:00,703 --> 03:10:01,215
Like I said

4072
03:10:01,471 --> 03:10:03,263
We don't need to know what I want Roy or did

4073
03:10:04,287 --> 03:10:05,567
We don't need to know what

4074
03:10:05,823 --> 03:10:09,407
Lionel did what it did Millie Weaver have any

4075
03:10:10,687 --> 03:10:11,711
How about Lee Ann McAdoo

4076
03:10:11,967 --> 03:10:13,759
How about your dearest love

4077
03:10:14,527 --> 03:10:15,807
I don't know I don't remember

4078
03:10:16,063 --> 03:10:16,831
I didn't see

4079
03:10:17,343 --> 03:10:17,855
If she was on

4080
03:10:20,159 --> 03:10:23,743
Tell if there were some ladies there were some like

4081
03:10:25,023 --> 03:10:25,535
Weirdo

4082
03:10:25,791 --> 03:10:26,303
Ladies

4083
03:10:26,559 --> 03:10:28,351
The hits special

4084
03:10:28,863 --> 03:10:31,423
People in the world

4085
03:10:31,935 --> 03:10:33,727
I don't know why I remember his name but there's a guy

4086
03:10:33,983 --> 03:10:34,495
Gerald Ford

4087
03:10:35,263 --> 03:10:35,775
Use another like

4088
03:10:36,031 --> 03:10:36,543
Frequent

4089
03:10:38,591 --> 03:10:39,615
Yeah it's a good name

4090
03:10:39,871 --> 03:10:41,919
But there are other like there were some lady

4091
03:10:42,431 --> 03:10:42,943
Pokemon

4092
03:10:43,455 --> 03:10:44,479
Female Ron Paul

4093
03:10:44,991 --> 03:10:47,295
What have you restarted

4094
03:10:47,807 --> 03:10:49,599
We started this episode with that buzz

4095
03:10:50,111 --> 03:10:52,927
B******* and then once we got to the actual

4096
03:10:53,439 --> 03:10:54,463
Alex Jones broadcast

4097
03:10:55,999 --> 03:10:56,767
You started spout

4098
03:10:57,535 --> 03:10:58,047
Dumb

4099
03:10:59,583 --> 03:11:00,095
Misgivings

4100
03:11:00,351 --> 03:11:02,143
News about Trump

4101
03:11:02,399 --> 03:11:02,911
Spine

4102
03:11:03,167 --> 03:11:04,447
And him but he's moving away from

4103
03:11:05,727 --> 03:11:07,775
That is last clip that I'm going to play

4104
03:11:08,799 --> 03:11:09,567
I want this on the Run

4105
03:11:12,383 --> 03:11:13,407
Eyebrow razor

4106
03:11:13,663 --> 03:11:15,199
I was going to walk this back and

4107
03:11:17,247 --> 03:11:17,759
But there

4108
03:11:18,271 --> 03:11:18,783
Is my party

4109
03:11:19,039 --> 03:11:19,551
King shot

4110
03:11:19,807 --> 03:11:21,599
Perhaps the most important thing

4111
03:11:21,855 --> 03:11:22,879
I think you said

4112
03:11:23,135 --> 03:11:24,159
During that 30 hour bra

4113
03:11:26,975 --> 03:11:27,999
And tell the truth is

4114
03:11:30,303 --> 03:11:30,815
Trump

4115
03:11:34,911 --> 03:11:35,679
Is the

4116
03:11:36,703 --> 03:11:37,983
Johnson holster

4117
03:11:38,751 --> 03:11:41,311
Neocon Democrats

4118
03:11:43,103 --> 03:11:44,127
Trump is

4119
03:11:45,663 --> 03:11:46,943
The Johnson holster

4120
03:11:47,199 --> 03:11:48,479
Russell complex

4121
03:11:49,247 --> 03:11:51,551
Good luck walking that back

4122
03:11:52,575 --> 03:11:54,367
Sucking their dick

4123
03:11:55,391 --> 03:11:57,183
Oh he was just using a euphemism

4124
03:11:59,743 --> 03:12:00,255
So what

4125
03:12:02,815 --> 03:12:03,839
Colbert said caca

4126
03:12:04,095 --> 03:12:07,167
Something like that

4127
03:12:07,423 --> 03:12:08,959
The cock holster for the military dust

4128
03:12:09,983 --> 03:12:12,031
Boy there's no walking that back though

4129
03:12:12,799 --> 03:12:14,079
Doesn't seem like it pretty much

4130
03:12:14,335 --> 03:12:14,847
Sad

4131
03:12:15,359 --> 03:12:16,127
Donald Trump

4132
03:12:16,639 --> 03:12:17,151
Your friend

4133
03:12:20,223 --> 03:12:20,991
His mouth

4134
03:12:21,247 --> 03:12:22,271
And Amos open

4135
03:12:23,551 --> 03:12:24,319
To be inserted

4136
03:12:25,087 --> 03:12:26,111
With the

4137
03:12:26,367 --> 03:12:26,879
Kenai

4138
03:12:27,647 --> 03:12:28,927
The respective penises

4139
03:12:29,439 --> 03:12:30,463
You don't think the military

4140
03:12:30,719 --> 03:12:33,279
Military

4141
03:12:34,559 --> 03:12:35,583
I would assume the 30

4142
03:12:36,351 --> 03:12:37,887
So in contacts

4143
03:12:38,143 --> 03:12:39,935
That cock holster,

4144
03:12:40,191 --> 03:12:41,471
Yes I'd like to put that

4145
03:12:42,751 --> 03:12:43,519
In juxtaposition

4146
03:12:43,775 --> 03:12:44,543
This

4147
03:12:45,055 --> 03:12:45,567
But you said

4148
03:12:46,079 --> 03:12:46,591
Back in

4149
03:12:46,847 --> 03:12:47,359
In February

4150
03:12:54,783 --> 03:12:56,063
21 years

4151
03:12:56,831 --> 03:12:58,111
Maybe friends last 10

4152
03:13:00,415 --> 03:13:02,207
But it's not the same as it is with Trump

4153
03:13:03,743 --> 03:13:05,279
Firebreather

4154
03:13:06,047 --> 03:13:06,815
So

4155
03:13:07,071 --> 03:13:08,351
Energetic

4156
03:13:09,119 --> 03:13:10,655
Sonic show real

4157
03:13:10,911 --> 03:13:13,727
And he's having results so amazing

4158
03:13:14,495 --> 03:13:15,519
But it just makes me

4159
03:13:16,799 --> 03:13:18,591
Me and dear to trap I'm ready to die for

4160
03:13:24,223 --> 03:13:24,735
Jeremiah

4161
03:13:25,247 --> 03:13:29,343
Fire breathing cutting Trump

4162
03:13:31,903 --> 03:13:33,695
I'm ready to die for Trump

4163
03:13:33,951 --> 03:13:37,279
Trump is America you dumb dumb sonofabitch

4164
03:13:37,791 --> 03:13:38,303
Oh boy

4165
03:13:38,559 --> 03:13:39,327
What are

4166
03:13:39,583 --> 03:13:44,703
Set powder and a half months ago

4167
03:13:45,727 --> 03:13:46,495
So stupid

4168
03:13:49,823 --> 03:13:50,591
They're also

4169
03:13:51,103 --> 03:13:54,943
What kind of things go there's no other way to describe it at this point

4170
03:13:55,967 --> 03:13:57,247
I mean it's

4171
03:13:58,527 --> 03:13:59,807
It's the question

4172
03:14:00,063 --> 03:14:00,575
Is

4173
03:14:00,831 --> 03:14:01,343
Not

4174
03:14:02,111 --> 03:14:02,623
Will they

4175
03:14:03,391 --> 03:14:03,903
It is

4176
03:14:04,415 --> 03:14:05,695
When will people

4177
03:14:05,951 --> 03:14:06,463
Who voted

4178
03:14:06,719 --> 03:14:07,487
A trump realized

4179
03:14:09,535 --> 03:14:10,303
Peacock holsters

4180
03:14:10,559 --> 03:14:11,839
Of the military-industrial

4181
03:14:12,607 --> 03:14:13,631
It'll just be gradual

4182
03:14:13,887 --> 03:14:14,911
And you know

4183
03:14:15,423 --> 03:14:16,191
Call Jones Isabel Weather

4184
03:14:17,215 --> 03:14:19,007
So

4185
03:14:19,519 --> 03:14:20,799
Jackboy

4186
03:14:21,311 --> 03:14:22,335
Like that's rough

4187
03:14:22,591 --> 03:14:23,615
That has

4188
03:14:26,175 --> 03:14:29,247
Do you think

4189
03:14:29,503 --> 03:14:35,647
Totally I think it touches right

4190
03:14:35,903 --> 03:14:40,511
Intense me about this then that about how Trump

4191
03:14:40,767 --> 03:14:42,815
Because of the globalist influence

4192
03:14:43,583 --> 03:14:44,095
Trainwreck

4193
03:14:46,143 --> 03:14:49,471
Trump is a cock holster of the military-industrial complex

4194
03:14:49,727 --> 03:14:50,751
Is him betray

4195
03:14:51,263 --> 03:14:52,287
Yeah

4196
03:14:52,543 --> 03:14:53,055
He is a

4197
03:14:53,311 --> 03:14:53,823
Hypocrite

4198
03:14:55,103 --> 03:14:58,175
And now I really think what I want my summation

4199
03:14:59,199 --> 03:14:59,967
Because of

4200
03:15:00,223 --> 03:15:00,735
Twist

4201
03:15:00,991 --> 03:15:01,503
Of that last

4202
03:15:01,759 --> 03:15:02,271
Flip

4203
03:15:02,783 --> 03:15:03,807
She's a bad proper

4204
03:15:04,575 --> 03:15:06,111
Yeah he's a propaganda

4205
03:15:06,367 --> 03:15:07,647
But he is disloyal

4206
03:15:08,159 --> 03:15:08,671
Hurt

4207
03:15:08,927 --> 03:15:15,071
I think he's an emotional guy never let feelings get involved

4208
03:15:17,375 --> 03:15:19,679
Like you're a sex worker right you know you don't kiss

4209
03:15:22,751 --> 03:15:25,055
Also I love

4210
03:15:25,311 --> 03:15:29,151
I love the imaginary self-righteousness of

4211
03:15:29,407 --> 03:15:31,455
It's homophobic to say caca

4212
03:15:33,503 --> 03:15:34,527
Johnson holster

4213
03:15:34,783 --> 03:15:37,599
That's not homophobic at all it's the

4214
03:15:37,855 --> 03:15:39,135
Word not

4215
03:15:39,647 --> 03:15:40,159
Intense

4216
03:15:44,767 --> 03:15:48,095
I generally thought cuz he's a guns guy generally thought like

4217
03:15:48,607 --> 03:15:54,751
I didn't realize that

4218
03:15:55,007 --> 03:15:59,103
Problem with metaphors when your second amendment

4219
03:15:59,359 --> 03:16:01,151
Brixton the beat

4220
03:16:01,407 --> 03:16:01,919
Yeah

4221
03:16:03,199 --> 03:16:03,967
Alex you suck

4222
03:16:06,527 --> 03:16:08,575
Mike cernovich is a mistake

4223
03:16:09,087 --> 03:16:09,599
It is a big

4224
03:16:09,855 --> 03:16:11,135
Your team sucks

4225
03:16:11,647 --> 03:16:14,207
I think I think bailing on Trump is not a bit

4226
03:16:14,719 --> 03:16:16,767
I think the sooner he does at the better for

4227
03:16:17,279 --> 03:16:19,327
I would say he should have done it

4228
03:16:19,839 --> 03:16:20,351
Before now

4229
03:16:22,399 --> 03:16:22,911
Before the

4230
03:16:23,679 --> 03:16:29,823
If if he was as brilliant as he said capable of seeing the future as well as he can I know that

4231
03:16:31,871 --> 03:16:33,151
He should definitely bail on Trump

4232
03:16:37,503 --> 03:16:39,039
I think it's a mistake now

4233
03:16:39,551 --> 03:16:40,831
Because he's gone too far

4234
03:16:41,087 --> 03:16:41,599
You think so

4235
03:16:41,855 --> 03:16:42,879
Yeah I mean

4236
03:16:43,135 --> 03:16:44,671
F****** heard him say he died for

4237
03:16:45,439 --> 03:16:46,719
Right that's insane

4238
03:16:46,975 --> 03:16:50,303
I would never say that about any politician even that I love

4239
03:16:50,815 --> 03:16:52,607
But I thought was awesome I've never

4240
03:16:53,887 --> 03:16:54,655
I saw you squint

4241
03:16:56,959 --> 03:16:58,495
Maybe maybe

4242
03:16:58,751 --> 03:17:00,799
Robert Kennedy the only maybe

4243
03:17:01,055 --> 03:17:05,663
That are really good run

4244
03:17:05,919 --> 03:17:12,063
Maybe rsk maybe Solon the history of the world

4245
03:17:12,319 --> 03:17:13,343
Maybe so long

4246
03:17:13,599 --> 03:17:17,183
And that's just because of his treatment of a boy

4247
03:17:17,439 --> 03:17:18,719
Cincinnati

4248
03:17:19,231 --> 03:17:19,999
He had a good run

4249
03:17:20,255 --> 03:17:20,767
I don't know

4250
03:17:21,279 --> 03:17:23,839
He was the guy who asymptomatic

4251
03:17:24,095 --> 03:17:26,399
Hiiraan

4252
03:17:26,655 --> 03:17:27,423
Great chili

4253
03:17:28,703 --> 03:17:29,983
You remember those ads where is like

4254
03:17:33,055 --> 03:17:38,687
Story of the guy who

4255
03:17:39,199 --> 03:17:40,223
Was a military leader

4256
03:17:41,247 --> 03:17:42,015
Became a farmer

4257
03:17:42,527 --> 03:17:44,063
Then they were under attack in

4258
03:17:45,343 --> 03:17:46,367
What is a ohm

4259
03:17:48,415 --> 03:17:49,695
Could be rubbed Cincinnatus is

4260
03:17:49,951 --> 03:17:50,463
The Latin name

4261
03:17:50,719 --> 03:17:51,231
Another Greek

4262
03:17:52,767 --> 03:17:55,839
But the general gist of the story

4263
03:17:56,607 --> 03:17:57,631
Guy is

4264
03:17:57,887 --> 03:17:58,911
Former war hero

4265
03:17:59,935 --> 03:18:00,703
Get on a farm

4266
03:18:01,983 --> 03:18:02,751
The

4267
03:18:03,007 --> 03:18:04,031
City is under attack

4268
03:18:04,543 --> 03:18:05,055
They go to hell

4269
03:18:05,823 --> 03:18:07,103
They say we're giving you

4270
03:18:07,359 --> 03:18:07,871
All of the

4271
03:18:08,383 --> 03:18:10,175
You do whatever it

4272
03:18:10,943 --> 03:18:11,455
That you need to do

4273
03:18:12,479 --> 03:18:13,759
And then the moment he's a car

4274
03:18:14,271 --> 03:18:14,783
His goal

4275
03:18:15,039 --> 03:18:15,551
Helioptile

4276
03:18:15,807 --> 03:18:17,343
That's very similar

4277
03:18:17,599 --> 03:18:18,111
Right

4278
03:18:18,367 --> 03:18:23,231
Very very similar this is not a thing that

4279
03:18:23,487 --> 03:18:23,999
Pens in real life

4280
03:18:25,023 --> 03:18:26,047
What happens in real life

4281
03:18:26,303 --> 03:18:26,815
Is Caesar

4282
03:18:28,607 --> 03:18:29,375
Real life bud

4283
03:18:29,631 --> 03:18:31,423
Well technically Cincinnatus

4284
03:18:31,679 --> 03:18:32,703
According to

4285
03:18:32,959 --> 03:18:33,727
The history but

4286
03:18:33,983 --> 03:18:36,031
To me that's that has the Ring of myth

4287
03:18:36,287 --> 03:18:37,567
That is the ring of death

4288
03:18:38,591 --> 03:18:39,871
Bright

4289
03:18:42,431 --> 03:18:45,247
So Jordan I think if I want to put a button on this

4290
03:18:45,503 --> 03:18:46,271
What's your button

4291
03:18:47,295 --> 03:18:49,599
It is the punch button from die-hard Ark

4292
03:18:49,855 --> 03:18:51,903
We've we've made a lot of hay out of this

4293
03:18:52,415 --> 03:18:52,927
Funimation

4294
03:18:53,183 --> 03:18:53,695
Laugh

4295
03:18:54,719 --> 03:18:55,999
That the reality is

4296
03:18:56,767 --> 03:18:57,791
This is a desperation

4297
03:18:58,047 --> 03:18:58,559
Can cash grab

4298
03:19:00,095 --> 03:19:01,631
This whole thing is

4299
03:19:02,655 --> 03:19:03,423
There's no stops

4300
03:19:03,935 --> 03:19:05,471
Find it is just I need

4301
03:19:05,727 --> 03:19:07,007
Money please give me money

4302
03:19:07,519 --> 03:19:08,799
30 hours of program

4303
03:19:09,311 --> 03:19:10,079
Right

4304
03:19:10,335 --> 03:19:11,103
Outside

4305
03:19:11,871 --> 03:19:13,407
The Alex Jones Show

4306
03:19:13,663 --> 03:19:14,175
The programming

4307
03:19:14,431 --> 03:19:14,943
Unwatchable

4308
03:19:15,199 --> 03:19:16,223
Complete

4309
03:19:19,295 --> 03:19:21,087
I think if Alex Jones

4310
03:19:21,599 --> 03:19:22,111
Togo's

4311
03:19:22,879 --> 03:19:24,159
Not if he's bringing in Cerner

4312
03:19:25,695 --> 03:19:31,839
Burbage's close all right I haven't seen cernovich yet

4313
03:19:34,143 --> 03:19:38,495
He has more juice than a b

4314
03:19:40,799 --> 03:19:41,311
Call it.

4315
03:19:42,079 --> 03:19:42,847
I don't know how to list

4316
03:19:43,103 --> 03:19:44,383
Knowledge fight

4317
03:19:44,639 --> 03:19:46,431
Talking to work

4318
03:19:47,967 --> 03:19:48,991
Diplomate again

4319
03:19:50,783 --> 03:19:51,551
This s***

4320
03:19:52,575 --> 03:19:53,343
Alex

4321
03:19:55,647 --> 03:19:56,415
I wanted

4322
03:19:56,671 --> 03:19:57,183
I want to start anew

4323
03:19:57,695 --> 03:19:58,207
Yeah

4324
03:19:58,719 --> 03:19:59,231
I would like to

4325
03:19:59,487 --> 03:20:00,255
And each of our app

4326
03:20:00,511 --> 03:20:01,279
Episodes with the promo

4327
03:20:02,047 --> 03:20:03,071
Wrestling promo

4328
03:20:04,095 --> 03:20:04,607
Alex

4329
03:20:06,143 --> 03:20:07,167
Your Fannie and Freddie

4330
03:20:07,423 --> 03:20:08,447
Narrative is

4331
03:20:08,959 --> 03:20:09,471
Absurd

4332
03:20:09,983 --> 03:20:10,495
Stupid

4333
03:20:10,751 --> 03:20:12,031
You got no leg to stand on

4334
03:20:13,567 --> 03:20:14,335
Coming for you

4335
03:20:14,591 --> 03:20:15,359
Gold

4336
03:20:15,615 --> 03:20:19,455
That's what the wrestling came out

4337
03:20:19,711 --> 03:20:22,271
Pretty regularly you were like I do like this

4338
03:20:22,527 --> 03:20:23,039
Like

4339
03:20:23,295 --> 03:20:29,439
That's not a very bombastic wrestling promo tired

4340
03:20:29,695 --> 03:20:33,535
For three and a half hours prior to really come up with

4341
03:20:33,791 --> 03:20:37,631
A full strong girl baby

4342
03:20:38,399 --> 03:20:41,215
If you're going to pull this

4343
03:20:48,383 --> 03:20:49,919
Knowledge bike

4344
03:20:52,223 --> 03:20:54,783
There was more. Much better

4345
03:20:56,831 --> 03:20:57,343
Stupid

4346
03:20:59,647 --> 03:21:01,439
Criticism not you

4347
03:21:02,207 --> 03:21:02,975
Alex you're stupid

4348
03:21:03,487 --> 03:21:03,999
Alex you are

4349
03:21:04,255 --> 03:21:05,023
You're in trouble

4350
03:21:05,791 --> 03:21:07,583
No matter how much money you raised

4351
03:21:08,607 --> 03:21:09,375
You're getting sued

4352
03:21:09,887 --> 03:21:10,399
You're Gonna Lose

4353
03:21:10,911 --> 03:21:11,679
I think that's

4354
03:21:11,935 --> 03:21:13,215
I think that is the

4355
03:21:14,751 --> 03:21:19,871
Like the greatest thing about the have BuzzFeed article I have a billion followers

4356
03:21:20,127 --> 03:21:20,639
You can have

4357
03:21:20,895 --> 03:21:22,175
10 million followers

4358
03:21:22,431 --> 03:21:23,967
I think it'd all be giving you money

4359
03:21:24,479 --> 03:21:27,039
But you slandered someone who's a billionaire

4360
03:21:27,551 --> 03:21:29,599
And he going to let you settle

4361
03:21:31,135 --> 03:21:32,415
Just like we talked about earlier

4362
03:21:32,671 --> 03:21:34,207
The rich are always

4363
03:21:35,487 --> 03:21:41,631
Exactly

4364
03:21:41,887 --> 03:21:44,447
He's one of us even though he's a billion

4365
03:21:48,031 --> 03:21:50,591
I think it is I think that BuzzFeed article is right

4366
03:21:51,103 --> 03:21:51,615
In that

4367
03:21:51,871 --> 03:21:53,151
Alex is that tragic

4368
03:21:53,407 --> 03:21:54,175
Figure

4369
03:21:54,431 --> 03:21:56,479
It is not that someone else's

4370
03:21:56,991 --> 03:21:57,759
Taking Alex down

4371
03:21:58,015 --> 03:21:59,551
No it's Alex's

4372
03:21:59,807 --> 03:22:03,391
Taking himself down and he doesn't know how not to

4373
03:22:03,647 --> 03:22:05,183
That's what's fascinating if you get to the

4374
03:22:05,439 --> 03:22:07,231
The end of that article that talks about his

4375
03:22:07,743 --> 03:22:09,023
Divorce and cuss

4376
03:22:10,303 --> 03:22:11,071
Specifically

4377
03:22:11,327 --> 03:22:14,655
And basically it lays out that all he had to do was show up

4378
03:22:16,447 --> 03:22:19,263
Say a goddamn word himself as a good dad

4379
03:22:19,519 --> 03:22:20,799
And he would have won the case

4380
03:22:22,335 --> 03:22:22,847
The judge

4381
03:22:23,103 --> 03:22:23,871
Specifically said

4382
03:22:24,127 --> 03:22:26,175
His job has no bearing on that way

4383
03:22:26,431 --> 03:22:28,223
And she did not allow that stuff

4384
03:22:28,479 --> 03:22:30,783
All he had to do was not be a dick

4385
03:22:31,039 --> 03:22:31,551
He couldn't

4386
03:22:31,807 --> 03:22:34,367
Couldn't do it if you couldn't do it he lost that case for

4387
03:22:34,623 --> 03:22:35,903
Oregon sell he's going to

4388
03:22:36,159 --> 03:22:37,439
Keep on losing

4389
03:22:38,463 --> 03:22:39,999
He is a we're watching

4390
03:22:40,255 --> 03:22:42,303
We're watching an archetype of a man

4391
03:22:42,815 --> 03:22:43,583
Laid low

4392
03:22:44,863 --> 03:22:45,631
Fascinating

4393
03:22:45,887 --> 03:22:46,655
Because we know he does

4394
03:22:47,167 --> 03:22:48,447
It's fascinating

4395
03:22:48,703 --> 03:22:52,799
It's funny it's inevitable and it is the most infuriating thing

4396
03:22:53,311 --> 03:22:56,383
Because it didn't want

4397
03:22:56,895 --> 03:22:57,663
Can't we just get

4398
03:22:58,175 --> 03:22:59,455
Future where you've already lost

4399
03:22:59,967 --> 03:23:01,759
Well that's like why do we have to

4400
03:23:02,015 --> 03:23:02,527
Put ourselves

4401
03:23:02,783 --> 03:23:05,087
Through it like well

4402
03:23:05,599 --> 03:23:09,183
He's going to be impeached something terrible is going to happen

4403
03:23:10,719 --> 03:23:13,791
Why can't we just be there already why do we have to wait and watch it

4404
03:23:14,047 --> 03:23:17,119
Because we know what happens every

4405
03:23:17,375 --> 03:23:18,143
F****** time

4406
03:23:18,399 --> 03:23:19,167
I because I think

4407
03:23:19,423 --> 03:23:21,983
This goes back to how we failed in every other test

4408
03:23:22,239 --> 03:23:22,751
