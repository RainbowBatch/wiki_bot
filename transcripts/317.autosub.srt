00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,672
Oh my god do I love a girl I love grilling

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
I love it

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464
Love

Are you go down by the lakefront

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
Wander around

13
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:45,056
Lovett grills places

Can't Get Enough

15
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:52,224
I love it because I probably hot dogs

16
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,040
You're not a bracha no

17
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,064
No

18
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,880
I do not appreciate

00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,952
Map that a lot of people love

Text Shirley

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,096
Joy and one of them is

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,632
Feeling connected to the

23
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,680
The animal aspect of what I'm eating

24
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,240
Like I really don't like eating meat off a bone

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
Because it feels like you're biting

26
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:22,944
Through something involved in an animal

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
Is it that I just day I don't

28
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,088
I would probably be vegetarian or vegan if I had any

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:33,952
Restraint or control

30
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
One of the reasons I don't like

31
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,792
Do not like the recognition of the

32
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,072
Animal

33
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
What I'm taking

34
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
Chicken breast

35
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:47,264
You are entirely sure.

36
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,104
That doesn't have as much of a textural sensation is like

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,920
Eating a bone

38
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
Somebody to buy food issue

39
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Chooser text

40
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
Great hammer

41
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,840
Just a good hamburger

42
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
Complicity to

Beyond that I don't know tater salad

45
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,896
No I mean I like having Ron White customer

46
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:30,528
Those of you who don't know who that is and he is a comedian who goes by tater salad

49
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,912
We are going over the pass

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,568
I just want to say on our last episode

51
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,360
Silly little girl

52
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
Derogatory

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,224
Well coming from the mouth of the proud boy

54
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
It's

55
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
Because I was

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,720
Pretending to be a proud boy assumed everyone would hear as being this is what an evil person

57
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
Right right

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,096
But at the same time it still came out of my mouth

59
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,424
I understand everybody who heard it and felt like

60
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:24,288
I'm participating in this idea of silly little girl beating

61
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,592
An insult something

62
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,920
Wouldn't want to be

63
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
I do not

64
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Want to participate

65
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
And that at all

66
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,296
And if

67
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:48,352
I've got real scared

68
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,400
Free-speech advocates

69
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:55,520
Oh no

70
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
No I think it's terrible to use that

71
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,176
There's nothing blind spots

72
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,248
You can have if you go through life and I think that that's probably why

73
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,320
Accordingly

74
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,392
Well sure you are in a character Where You Are

75
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
Personifying

76
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
Somebody who is bad saying something bad buddy

77
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Understand that

78
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
Does that

79
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
Fall Apart

80
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,263
You adjust

81
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,871
Subconsciously believe you still wouldn't be throwing around the n-word

82
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,095
Subconsciously not recognizing how it might be heard to somebody else

83
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,447
Reminder to be more thoughtful

84
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,007
Directed

85
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
Set of just letting everything

86
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
You know fly out without ever even

87
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
For examining myself

88
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
Amen

89
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
The past

90
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:18,463
We are covered in February 19th and 20th 2013

91
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Working

92
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,559
Full of tumbleweeds

93
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,863
Floating down the street that's February 20th

94
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Episode

95
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,263
Is that so

96
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
July 1st

97
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
I'm outside very extreme

98
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:40,991
It was very scary and then on the 2nd and 3rd of July did not really develop anything

99
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
At all

100
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
It was

101
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,367
It was very much a holding pattern and it would have made for a very boring very pointless

102
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,439
Episode so from the present-day there's not really much

103
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
How's it go over

104
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
And then also

105
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
A lot of these wacky way

106
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Say folks are

107
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
Very

108
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,911
Right now I think they really don't know what's going on with Carrie cast

109
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
But she is not coming through with

110
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
With content

111
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
So

112
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
We're back in the pack

113
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Pretty in

114
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,943
I think I think it's today

115
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,015
So maybe underwhelming in import

116
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,623
Based on you know this is our last episode where it hits the roads are calling

117
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
I do think it's something

118
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
Very

119
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
Pens on this episode

120
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
And it starts right here

121
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
Mistress clip for February

122
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,047
Troublemaker

123
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,679
And is now or character who is

124
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
He is

125
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
This is this is great

126
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:12,127
About him

127
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:18,015
Does a little bit within the context of the timelines variant

128
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
Imma try not to get too much into the stuff at me

129
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Me and Marty talked about today

130
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,183
Does not like heavy overlap

131
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,975
To me this is Wendy

132
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,351
Just on the heels of Alex being on Piers Morgan show

133
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Justice

134
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
I don't know

135
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
The references included

136
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,519
Probably

137
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
Hooked

138
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
Turbulent time Pro

139
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,687
Now he's got a f****** guy in the WWE pretending to the fan of him

140
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Yeah

141
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
Issues

142
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Is that

143
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,183
Some people think wrestling

144
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
Is real

145
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,023
Inasmuch as they are fighting you know like

146
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,583
You do still have to put your body through a lot

147
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,655
It is real in that sense

148
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
Storytellers that is

149
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,799
Real in that sense but

150
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,871
Everything is predetermined storyline

151
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
Some people are incapable of

152
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Understanding

153
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
Storytelling

154
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
I believe him

155
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
Because

156
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Wow

157
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,767
That's one of the examples that he uses himself

158
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
Actually happened

159
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:02,463
I believe that was Alex if I recall that was you

160
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
Alex wrestling Israel's like me and my friends back when I was a kid thought it was real

161
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,847
Variable

162
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
I meant that was back when kayfabe

163
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
Was way more seriously

164
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,271
The business

165
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,599
If you are seen in public with someone you're feuding with

166
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
You better start fighting

167
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,743
Having a drink together you have to start fighting

168
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:44,191
I think it was Cody Rhodes told Dusty Rhodes

169
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
Injury around the house

170
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:52,383
Because it was part of his wrestling storyline like

171
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
From something

172
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,855
Sucks compared these wrestlers apparently

173
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,927
Haven't

174
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,487
Seriously

175
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,863
Taking it very seriously because if the illusion is gone

176
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:19,263
Especially back then that was what a lot of it was sold as Heroes and they were actually fighting each other

177
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,103
If you if you have them buddying up off hours it takes away

178
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,175
We really want to fight each other

179
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
XO the out whatever

180
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
Alex when he was younger was much

181
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
Closer to that era of wrestling

182
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Then

183
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
2013

184
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Next clip

185
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
We already heard Alex say that he thinks about half

186
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
The wrestling audience

187
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
Sphinx it's all real

188
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Himself

189
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
Here is where that takes

190
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
Real

191
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,911
Okay

192
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
What are we doing here

193
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,543
Okay what are we doing

194
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,359
Nacho Libre

195
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,959
He's heard

196
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
Minorities

197
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,127
Stop certain

198
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,967
I think their fanbase would not appreciate that as much as Alex

199
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,319
Maybe not

200
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:13,183
Experiment after 2013

201
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
So

202
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,791
It's interesting that earlier he said that half of the audience

203
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
It's can't tell if it's

204
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,143
It's real or fake the audience

205
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
Is it

206
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,495
These ratios are the same

207
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
Something interesting happening in Alex's

208
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
His discussion of whether or not people think

209
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
WWE pro wrestling is real

210
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
He accepts that a lot of people get there

211
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,319
Descriptive

212
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
He points out

213
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
The audience's novice

214
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,231
As if to imply that this cross-section of the audience's in Subway less capable

215
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,047
Understanding the wrestling is a storytelling art form

216
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
That alone

217
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
Is deeply Pickett

218
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Feather of a position to have

219
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
And this is only made worse

220
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,007
When Alex flips up a little bit and says this a little bit later

221
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
They're watching

222
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
Really

223
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
So

224
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Did the first clue

225
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
He's at the audience who's incapable of telling the wrestler

226
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,935
Mistake was half the Audience Network

227
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,007
And now just a little bit later you saying that half of the audiences

228
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
Illegal immigrants

229
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,103
This is how Alex sees this segment of the population

230
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,431
They're all illegal immigrants to him whether they are or not

231
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
Whether they're documented or not

232
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,111
He is using a Mexican Hispanic and illegal immigrant there synonymous

233
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
That's f***** up

234
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
There's some true, what else is doing

235
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:56,351
Explain that I need to explain a little bit of what's going on and like I said earlier to Rosa and I covered this in

236
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,399
In a past episode

237
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,031
A pretty 13 Alberto Del Rio was the WWE heavyweight champ

238
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,359
His character was a little bit of a flashy cocky Mexican guy

239
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,943
What is WWE's known for

240
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
Very poorly at

241
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Just tastes like

242
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,575
Is that they make some of their storylines mirror things that are happening in the real world

243
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,135
In this case the writers for better or worse

244
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,695
Decided that a good voil for their flashy cocky

245
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,815
Could be an anti-immigration right-wing dude who constantly throws up dog whistle

246
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,167
By constantly saying We the People after saying something vaguely racist and threatened

247
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,751
Which was with Jack Swagger's character for the most part was

248
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:41,407
The Raiders built this beauty around the idea that Jack Swagger and his manager Zeb Colter would cut promos about how there would America

249
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
The really is about

250
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,271
Del Rio didn't belong here it certainly didn't deserve to be champ

251
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,135
The plan obviously has her Swagger to be big s*******

252
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,975
All culminating in a pay-per-view where Del Rio defeats the racist villain

253
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
And that's more or less what

254
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
It's just basic wrestling

255
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Storyline

256
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
All Things Considered

257
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
With one very basic and massive

258
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Twist

259
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,239
Namely that the ethnic character was not the default bad guy

260
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,567
Yeah that's good yeah

261
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,967
Whether you're a fan of it or not it's pretty dumb to try and argue against the idea the pro-wrestling has xenophobia

262
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:21,599
So much of the business has been built on Noble white Gyros defeating scary sometimes

263
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
Sometimes not for Indio

264
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,231
Of course there was a very unfortunate case of the group

265
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
Kaientai

266
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,631
For a late 90s group of Japanese wrestlers

267
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,751
And so they might or may not have been in Yakuza and also try to cut off Val venis

268
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
Alright

269
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:45,919
I remember velvet I remember that. I remember that being in the 90s

270
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:52,319
Is end thinking

271
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:59,743
Episode of the show about how this is demonizing Japanese-American

272
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
I really don't think you did

273
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
There've been plenty of

274
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Very race

275
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,679
Gimmicks that are kind of embarrassing to look back at

276
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,751
Or the dancing African warrior

277
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
Bobby literal Muhammad

278
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,383
What does the cannibal Headhunter Kabbalah

279
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
The list goes on and on

280
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
The roots are so many

281
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,855
Easy bad guy tropes were created with guys like the Iron Sheik Nikolai volkoff

282
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
With a rock during the Gulf War

283
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
They often do this very poorly in with

284
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,351
Very little class but ultimately with the WWE is in the business of doing is creating emotional responses to their product

285
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
What are the best way to do that is

286
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,959
To create characters that fit pretty easy archetype

287
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,031
And have them get with each other about how their archetypes are in conflict

288
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
Each other

289
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,407
Right now for example and the WWE top bad guys is Daniel Bryan

290
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
New character is basically just a preacher

291
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
Vegan Environmental

292
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:58,367
Yeah

293
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
He's really good at his character

294
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:09,375
He won the WWE championship and remade the belt with hemp because he refused to wear a belt made of dead cows

295
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
He's a guy who's taking a lot

296
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,239
The stereotypes of liberals Chico Crusaders

297
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,055
And then he performs them as a bad guy with amazing skill

298
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:23,711
I do know what I haven't heard any vegans or environmentalist their liberal screaming about how this is meant to demonize their position

299
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
It's because they're not a bunch of big old dumb dumb

300
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
They get there certain

301
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
Things that are kind of annoying about their position

302
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,439
Anderson good fantasy those things exaggerated

303
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
To create a villainous character out of

304
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,815
This is how the Tea Party folks and Alex should have responded

305
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
The Jack Swagger

306
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
Or if they were adults

307
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,935
They should have realized and recognized that yeah

308
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:48,287
They do seem to be better at least a couple f*****-up racist among our ranks

309
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,639
And if something they could stand a little bit of exaggeration or parody any interest

310
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
Compelling wrestling

311
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
Story

312
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,991
Ultimately could have even been an opportunity

313
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,111
Versation about what is and it is what what is not acceptable within their communities

314
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
But I can't do any of that

315
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
For two reasons

316
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
Especially people like that

317
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
They took it

318
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,815
Deep down they knew that the things that

319
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
Jack Swagger and Zeb Coulter and their characters

320
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
The things that they were exaggerating

321
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,495
We're actually things that they themselves believe

322
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
And they took the presentation

323
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
Flagler is the bad guy

324
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
As a personal credit

325
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
They're goddamn Kahneman

326
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,991
Look for anything to raise their profile

327
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,135
The fact that Jack Swagger said that he liked Alex Jones is the best f****** thing to ever happen for Alex Jones

328
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
Oh yeah getting a mortgage

329
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
Sure was big for Alex

330
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Composure

331
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
But Alex knows that this has

332
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
Potential speech

333
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,631
The rub is that it could only be gigantic if Alex can capitalize on

334
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
And laughing it off as a storyline in wrestling

335
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
That's not how conman capitalized

336
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
Ultimately I think it's super in

337
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
Interesting as a glimpse

338
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
How desperate all these right way

339
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
When folks are free

340
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,711
Allison Glenn Beck both went completely nuts

341
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
When a wrestling character mention

342
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:06,111
Because they do the balloon their rent

343
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
It's also

344
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
These happen at the time it does

345
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,279
We're seeing that in February 2013 Alex isn't a very defensive

346
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Supposition

347
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
About media coverage

348
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,143
There's a weeks-long freaked out about Piers Morgan

349
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
Be coming to a close kind of

350
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
Ventura last episode

351
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,567
I'm freaking out about CNN indiatlantic accurately covering him

352
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
This opportunity to lash out

353
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,919
At the WWE could not have come at a better time

354
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,063
I'm going to guess

355
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
That he makes

356
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
The biggest deal

357
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,303
That he's actually just mad they think

358
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
He would send

359
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
A fan letter

360
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,423
No no no no

361
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,311
What are the things that's really interesting about this

362
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
And this is

363
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
Disgust

364
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
Did not care about Allie

365
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
WWE

366
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,503
This was far more about Glenn

367
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
Okay

368
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,343
Because going back was actually on Main

369
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,951
Where is Alex's

370
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:20,095
WWE

371
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Attention

372
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,911
WWE recognized

373
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,703
This is also a really good

374
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
Corny thing for us

375
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:33,151
We're getting you a wicked we could all make money off if this is good business for both of us

376
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,015
The people back in Alex Jones started to

377
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
Push back on them

378
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
They

379
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
Dorf

380
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Full on it

381
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,487
Because Glenn Beck started calling wrestling fan

382
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,655
About wrestling fans and how they're all f****** stupid even hearing Alex

383
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,191
Express

384
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,031
So in an unprecedented

385
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Event

386
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
I don't know if

387
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,711
I'm sure this may have happened at some other point but I can't think of another time

388
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,271
Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter

389
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
Cut a promo

390
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
Where they explained what wrestling is

391
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:18,464
Took one back and here is the beginning of that promo

392
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,816
And I am Jack Swagger

393
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,376
And we are real American

394
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,472
Play believer

395
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,264
Whether people want to hear.

396
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
We are here

397
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,176
Great country from eroding into bankruptcy naturally

398
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
And Morley

399
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,016
We believe in some very simple principles

400
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,320
We believe that if you live

401
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
In this country

402
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,392
You should speak Spanish

403
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,672
Chinese

404
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
Arabic

405
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
German

406
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
You should speak

407
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
English

408
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:01,216
Real Americans are struggling to find jobs because people from other countries are sneaking

409
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:06,336
Across our borders and are willing to work for next to no money

410
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,176
They're stealing jobs from real American

411
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:17,344
Country illegally

412
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,880
Then you should leave

413
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,672
If you don't want to leave

414
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
We will make you leave

415
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:30,400
World champion of WWE

416
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:35,264
Is a perfect example of the problems that plague our country

417
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:40,640
Which is going to be WrestleMania

418
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,248
When the world title and begin to set things right in this country

419
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,856
Army of support behind

420
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
We

421
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
The people

422
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
Hey Glenn Beck

423
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
What you decide

424
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
Flea collar promo

425
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:07,008
It's a scene we record to a listen to positive or negative reaction from our fans

426
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Say

427
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
We are entertainers

428
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
My name

429
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Is Jake Hager

430
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
And I'm laying down

431
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,736
We are performers for WWE

432
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,296
Zeb Colter is the character I play

433
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,856
Jack Swagger is the character Jake place

434
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
We are in the political business

435
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,208
All the immigration business

436
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,024
We are in the entertainment

437
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,888
Everything is designed to tell story

438
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,728
Right now the story

439
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,360
Jack Swagger are using the current relevant and topical story of immigration

440
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,712
To Target the WWE World Champion Alberto Del Rio

441
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,552
Also a character played by my friend Jose Rodriguez

442
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,624
In our story we are the antagonist

443
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,184
And Alberto is the ProTech

444
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,280
Just explaining story

445
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,352
It's amazing

446
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,656
In the middle

447
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,984
I know cuz they're interested in Glenn Beck

448
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
I'm not in Alex Jones

449
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
I wish II

450
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:20,992
Dream this sequence happened but Glenn Beck is a home alone and he's just start watching this and then the TV start talking

451
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:25,600
Directly to him

452
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,696
Oh my God it's like a horror movie where the TV

453
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
Reven

454
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,352
Even though like the the strictness is that I kayfabe rules

455
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Lazard

456
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
Duffy wrestlers we like

457
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,128
This is not my real name, character

458
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,456
These people were really insulting the audience

459
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
Rustlers in

460
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
Company itself

461
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,600
Probably took a bit of offense to that

462
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,392
At least on some level

463
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
EXO

464
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,232
This whole promo is largely like

465
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
You're calling already

466
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
Stupid

467
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,352
Let us explain why you are stupid

468
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,912
Sir Robert

469
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
Specifically at Glenn Beck

470
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,288
Glenn Beck a little bit of an invitation

471
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
At the end of the prom

472
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Afford

473
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,176
To continuing to tempura box

474
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,528
Controversial stories with characters of all backgrounds and beliefs

475
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,624
Many of your followers are WWE fans

476
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,208
And they understand the difference between reality

477
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
An inner tie

478
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,304
Are you out of touch with your on this Glen

479
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,352
Or are you just a

480
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
Stupid

481
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
Political

482
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
Commentator

483
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:49,312
We cordially invite you to

484
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336
This Monday

485
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
Or you can deliver

486
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
A 5-minute

487
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:56,736
Unedited rebuttal to our Global TV audience

488
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,784
Anna sold out crowd

489
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,832
12000

490
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
Stupid

491
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Wrestling fan

492
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:12,096
America's like Zeb Colter and Jack Swagger won't stand for

493
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,936
The country our forefathers built

494
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,008
Is part of this problem

495
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,056
And we're going to fix

496
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
We

497
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
People

498
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:31,040
Thanks buddy yeah

499
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,880
Pretty f****** Electric

500
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
Amazing about this is like

501
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
That's such an awesome response

502
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,312
Alex has got to be serious that

503
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,360
Didn't get the

504
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,344
I don't know if you would have

505
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:12,000
Food I will say I wouldn't have gotten to you did a bad job

506
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
Perfect setup

507
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:19,936
Not the other thing too is that like if you really listen to that promo except for Rolling the r in Dallas

508
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,496
That doesn't sound that different from what Alex says

509
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
At all

510
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,872
It's a it's a it's a parody

511
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,736
Only very slightly

512
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,576
Couldn't help but take it

513
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
Back and Alex

514
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
Both took it

515
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
And that pretty much ruined

516
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,304
Golden opportunity for all parties involved

517
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,912
Just keep that conflict machine Rollin Rollin Alex might have been willing to

518
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:57,312
Engage with it like that

519
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
To do work

520
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
Enough to do the job for him

521
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:07,040
Also probably never would have gotten involved with Alex and any real Alex would never allow himself to

522
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
Look fat

523
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:11,904
Yeah the job before somebody

524
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,488
If you're if you're going to get in if you are out

525
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
Situation

526
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
With

527
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,352
This storyline let's say

528
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,400
And the WWE brings you in

529
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,448
The way they probably bring you in

530
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
Is to like

531
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,776
Say whatever you want and then

532
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Get fake attacked

533
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:35,200
By Alberto Del Rio

534
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,368
Right or the only way if I can yell at people for

535
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,208
How do we prevent that there's no way

536
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
No you're not doing

537
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,424
The characterization

538
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
It's only that he's back

539
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,752
Because you saying things that are very similar

540
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,312
To their positions and what they believe

541
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:06,176
But I think his actual positions are exactly what

542
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Like

543
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,272
They're the problem is overlap

544
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,320
The Paradox is

545
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,368
More accurate

546
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,904
If you understand what I'm

547
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,488
Like

548
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
That kind of

549
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
Then Alex is public

550
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
They're exactly is racist

551
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,496
The parody

552
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,544
Whether or not you're right

553
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,848
I think of something to that

554
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:40,736
Sara is missing a mixing of Hispanics and illegal immigrant

555
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:45,088
Yeah I think so he's the bad guy

556
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,136
In the past

557
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,464
This would have been a white guy fighting Papa Shango and he would have won

558
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,536
The good guy

559
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,168
No

560
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
The big problem is

561
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,008
The owners of the WWE

562
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,312
Vince McMahon and Linda McMahon

563
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
To the GOP

564
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
That's what's going on here

565
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
Here's Alex

566
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,992
Complaining

567
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,064
Really

568
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368
Because

569
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,496
Establishment Republican life

570
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,568
But before we do Alex's got talk some more s*** about Linda

571
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,448
Power structures

572
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:12,640
So the argument here is that the GOP hate the Tea Party and so because the mcmahons are such as Fabolous

573
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
GOP Folk

574
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,736
They're falling it.

575
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,528
In order to demonize the Tea Party

576
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,576
By way of a

577
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
Character

578
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,672
Linda McMahon ran for Senate

579
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,952
Connecticut in 2010

580
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
2012

581
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:31,328
She's mostly remembered for losing both times and spending shitloads of money on each

582
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,192
She spent approximately 100 million dollars on those 2 campaign

583
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,008
According to USA Today 77 million

584
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
That was her own money

585
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:45,920
Even after she lost those races she stayed around in the world of Politics as a major donor for Republican

586
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,968
What you have to understand

587
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:52,064
The WWE has a whole hell of a lot to lose if they're subjected to regulate

588
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:57,696
The way they classify the wrestlers as independent contractors a lot of conversation

589
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,744
Recently

590
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,048
Employee with the protections

591
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
The complement designation

592
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,864
Their profits would be cut

593
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,192
Spending a hundred million dollars on policy

594
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:14,848
Is a pretty small loss is more left-leaning ideas about workers rights and more University

595
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:18,176
We applied the idea of these people who are like growing old

596
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:24,576
Injuries they sustained for gears in years of wrestling protections it would cost

597
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
Hundreds and

598
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,416
So fight back against

599
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
Make sense

600
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,488
Give millions of millions of dollars

601
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
People who will help

602
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,560
Protect the business

603
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,632
Logical advancements in the world

604
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
Worst

605
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
In the 26

606
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,104
Campaign donated seven billion dollars to Trump align super

607
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,944
She invents were big supporters of Trumps campaign

608
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,296
The WWE Hall of Fame

609
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
In 2013

610
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,648
And he was inducted into the Hall by Vince McMahon

611
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Self

612
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:06,304
From 1995 to the present day the only

613
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
Where Donald Trump

614
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
Stone Cold Steve

615
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,912
Also hate

616
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,216
Everything

617
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:17,824
How do you know if your how do you not give Stone Cold

618
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,872
Induction speech

619
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,944
Such a big part of the Attitude Era

620
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
The defining

621
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,064
Donald Trump

622
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Jesus

623
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:33,440
Christ also a little fun I already the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony

624
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,976
Only takes place on WrestleMania we

625
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,792
It's all part of the day's long celebration

626
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
Trump was inducted in 2013 which is the year when Alberto Del Rio Jack Swagger

627
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
Russell

628
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:52,128
B b savior that we're talking about right now

629
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
Real one

630
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,224
Also Trump was booed off stage when he gave his except

631
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:02,880
Your crowd was not super into a guy they were very familiar with who's been a piece of s*** locally for

632
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Couple decades

633
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
Yeah pretty much

634
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,512
Bad idea did inducted to the Hall of Fame in New York

635
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,608
So the mcmahons of Trump have had a really interesting

636
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,632
Trip over the years

637
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,192
They began working together in 1988

638
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
When Trump was

639
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
Instrumental in helping

640
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,056
WWF WrestleMania 4 to Italy

641
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Atlantic City

642
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,640
They hosted the event at the Atlantic City convention hall

643
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,200
Which was called Trump Plaza in advertisement

644
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,016
They would return to the venue for Wrestlemania 5

645
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,576
Making it the only place to host the event into

646
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
Consecutive years

647
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,208
In 2004 when WrestleMania was in New York Donald Trump was in attendance

648
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,256
Jesse Ventura interviewed him

649
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,584
And asked if he was at if that Torah where to get back into politics

650
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
Could you count on Trump support

651
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,936
Trump said 100%

652
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:53,312
Twitch Ventura gals to the crowd that it seems like we need a wrestler in the White House in 2008

653
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,872
It's very G to watch in hindsight

654
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,688
Also Jesse Ventura

655
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,504
Very heavily dying his beard at that point

656
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,600
Got very dark beer

657
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,440
Gone completely

658
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
He's pretty cool though

659
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,560
He is pretty cool 2007

660
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,912
Appreciation Night on Raw

661
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,704
Appreciated

662
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
Call them

663
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,032
Basically made it all about himself

664
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,568
In the middle of his skin

665
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,360
He's interrupted by Trump on the big

666
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,944
Screen who tells them that

667
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
Thought you dumped a bunch of money on the fans out of

668
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,672
I hate everything

669
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
I hate everything

670
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,024
Trump was even then obviously

671
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,816
To wrestle

672
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,096
Call this help

673
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,424
Spiders to represent them

674
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
Compete in a hair vs hair match

675
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,848
The loser would have to shave their head and if you're not a new 4-minute

676
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,896
Absolutely

677
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,504
Vince chose

678
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
Who he described as an interview with Imus

679
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
As quote

680
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,952
The strongest man I've ever seen

681
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,536
Bobby Lindsay

682
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Did he

683
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,888
Did he just Mandingo us did that just happen

684
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Special rest

685
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,032
So after last

686
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,360
Stone Cold and Trump celebrated at Stone Cold fashion

687
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,152
Which is to say that stone-cold chugs

688
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,688
A event gave Trump's daughter

689
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,736
It's completely bizarre

690
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,016
And very grim

691
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
In hindsight

692
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,344
This is all

693
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
Tragic

694
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,440
Now what you think about

695
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
The timer

696
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
This isn't January

697
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
2007

698
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
Collaboration between trumpet

699
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,608
That's the point when it was heating up

700
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,424
But behind closed doors behind the scenes

701
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,472
Collaborating a bit more as well

702
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,032
Donald Trump been running the Trump sound

703
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,872
Station which New York attorney general Barbara Underwood described as being engaged

704
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,688
Quotes shocking pattern of illegality

705
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,992
In their 2015 IRS filing

706
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
Foundation B

707
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
To self-dealing

708
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,112
Or transferring assets or income to disqualified individual

709
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,464
Used more than $250,000 of foundation money to settle this

710
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
Disputes arising

711
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,768
From his golf courses and hotels

712
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,888
Use $20,000 of foundation money to buy a portrait of himself that no one else wanted to buy

713
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
It doesn't

714
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,216
To much of a controversial statement

715
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,008
To say that there's a pattern

716
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
OB legal Behavior

717
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
Surrounding the Trump Foundation

718
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
You could have gotten rid of

719
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,480
Sure but I'm talking specifically about that

720
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064
Stop putting his own money

721
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,088
The Trump Foundation

722
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:45,856
In 2000

723
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,928
And his biggest donor in 2007

724
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Was Vince

725
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
McMahon

726
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,744
Who gave the Trump Foundation

727
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
4 million-dollar

728
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
The 2000s

729
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,400
The foundation's total stated fundraising that year was 4.1 million

730
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
Go on to give another

731
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
2009

732
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:08,384
If you count it all up you're looking at an amount over 12 million dollars that the mcmahons have given to Trump

733
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,664
Between 2007

734
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
2016

735
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:17,088
Was elected one of his first positions he felt was to make Linda McMahon his head of the small business

736
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,160
She served in that position until Reese

737
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,696
On April 15th

738
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
2019

739
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,608
It was announced that she was going to be moving on to become the chair of the pro Trump Super PAC America First Act

740
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
The exact same super packed

741
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,728
Sheriff David Clarke became board member of after he left the Sheriff's Office

742
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:38,592
Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is also a senior advisor

743
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
For America First action

744
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
Fun fact

745
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,480
America First action between 2016

746
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
Spent over 400

747
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,320
$60,000 of the money that I brought in

748
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,856
Trump own proper

749
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,208
They paid over $120,000 to two firms directly tied

750
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:55,744
David Clarke

751
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
Clear pattern

752
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
Decide for yourself

753
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Don't like

754
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
That

755
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
All of this

756
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,704
The Happening

757
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
First

758
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,336
I think the thing that I hate most about it

759
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,384
Probably

760
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,456
And how nobody doing

761
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,320
Pretty

762
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
Super Pacs

763
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,160
Are just places where people

764
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,952
Who get cast off

765
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,488
Baby no stuff

766
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,256
End up getting

767
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
Parachute

768
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,864
People who suggested that I don't know if you could prove it but it

769
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,008
Seems like all these weirdos are really slick Trump boosterism and become unaffected

770
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,312
An effective anymore seem to

771
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,848
All funnel into these America

772
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
First policies in America

773
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
The first action

774
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
A lot of stuff

775
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016
Very volume

776
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Campaign

777
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,088
Maybe they're more juice

778
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
Who knows

779
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,160
Could be

780
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:00,512
My point here is that the McMahon family has been deeply involved with Donald Trump

781
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,816
There's a real irony for Alex

782
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,608
To be calling about is gop's

783
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,936
In bed with a new world order here in 2013

784
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:11,264
A huge part in Alex's KERO getting elected

785
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
Is president

786
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,336
There's another funny piece here too

787
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,128
The mcmahons got paid

788
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,432
When Trump won the election he gave Linda

789
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,480
Job

790
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,040
Even though she was primarily a small business

791
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
Right

792
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:29,696
Even though she was primarily known as a pro wrestling promoter and a person who spent a hundred million dollars losing elections

793
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
Still gave her a job

794
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,768
She was an embarrassing aunt

795
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
Trump still put her in office

796
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,352
Something that he would never do

797
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
For Alex

798
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,680
The mcmahons are Trump collaborators

799
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
Alex is a useful

800
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,520
Yep there's a big distinction

801
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,056
It's really funny

802
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,336
To hear it back in the past

803
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664
Little does he know all the

804
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
. man

805
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:57,088
Because this all sounds like

806
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,112
A f****** joke

807
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
Very bizarre

808
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,120
Alex calls for a boycott of the WWE

809
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
Cool

810
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
Boycott

811
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Grimm

812
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,568
Which

813
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
The singer just contrary

814
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,544
Contrarian

815
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,872
Is really f****** dark

816
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,431
Stupid

817
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,991
I would love to try and convince

818
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,063
These folks to Liberty and my position

819
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,623
But it's not even worth it to try and convince them

820
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,695
They are brainwashed by the last door

821
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
Understand my position

822
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
Therefore

823
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
That's very that's very bad

824
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Also

825
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
I would love to get it

826
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,191
Supercut together of all the time

827
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,727
Call Joseph Watson

828
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,775
Have like

829
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,567
If someone wants to boycott like

830
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
F*** off

831
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:34,367
A meeting from WWE

832
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
It's so stupid

833
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,183
They're all still f******

834
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,023
It's only infuriating

835
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,047
When it comes to

836
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,887
Yeah when they pretend to have some sort of a high ground

837
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
If that's

838
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,935
Yeah it makes it

839
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,239
It's so annoying

840
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,543
Because it's so late bear how little

841
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Have they

842
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,847
There are no consequences

843
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
In there

844
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,895
Nas it don't matter

845
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,967
Topsail

846
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,527
About Jack Swagger

847
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,551
But it turns out

848
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
Across the pond

849
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:10,463
Over and also pissed off

850
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,839
Why is created a special report about the issue

851
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,703
Set

852
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,847
Received

853
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,407
From

854
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
Glenn Beck

855
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,223
And Alex Jones

856
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:45,791
Or Alex Jones

857
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,095
It's clearly a joke

858
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,167
Like what their operating off of

859
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
They're laughing

860
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,727
Comforters are laughing

861
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,007
They're making a joke

862
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,871
They're not even saying he literally got fan mail from any of those people

863
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,199
That humor

864
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
Over here

865
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,271
Paper UT position

866
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,695
Paul's report

867
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:20,095
That anybody who listens to that nobody's going to do while they would if you already frame it if you

868
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
Frame it is being real

869
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:25,727
Really I don't know

870
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,263
Casino like he's coming out like

871
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,591
These people

872
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,407
Said we're got you know and then you play that clip in your leg

873
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,503
The commentators

874
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
Are f******

875
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
Joking

876
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
Yeah

877
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,879
Nonsense

878
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:49,023
Whatever we make it back to this year in vape we may not who knows but it does next clip

879
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
Really aluminum

880
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
Okay and

881
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,959
If you pay close attention

882
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:57,983
Or dogs

883
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,311
You'll see that all he's doing is reading drug

884
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,687
Directions

885
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:17,439
Ocean trash is Ted Turner

886
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,375
Good point

887
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,007
Don't know where to live

888
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:37,663
Crazy is open about it like I'm just reading off

889
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,455
Headlines that I haven't read the stories

890
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,015
Drudgereport you're not doing

891
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,551
You're not doing analysis

892
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,879
You are cold reading headlines from Drudge

893
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:47,903
That's

894
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,183
Half of his career

895
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
Crazy

896
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
That's irresponsible

897
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,255
Amazing

898
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,815
Next clip

899
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
Wants to talk about the

900
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,119
Culture

901
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
Causing fire

902
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,447
Video camera

903
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,727
And wrestling

904
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,775
Meds now he's off the wrestler

905
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
It's it's

906
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
Triumvirate

907
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
Video games

908
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,175
Write psych meds course

909
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,567
My response to that is like

910
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:42,687
Shut up old man

911
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:49,087
I think it is somebody's mom be more of an old man but

912
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,903
Video game

913
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,303
The prevailing culture in the Youth of the devil love the devil

914
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,375
F*** out of here

915
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:09,567
They might be rainbow parties lipstick

916
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,383
That nobody ever did

917
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:16,223
So on this episode Alex

918
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,783
A lot of Long Grass

919
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
Thanks

920
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
They're probably going to kill

921
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:29,023
He keeps insisting that he's never going to hurt his family or himself before the bulk of the show I had no idea

922
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,095
He was doing that

923
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
Steam very bizarre

924
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,471
And then towards the end of the show he brings up this case

925
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,311
Leading into an inn

926
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,335
Introduction for his neck

927
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
Text guest

928
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,455
Investigative reporter not investigative reporter

929
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:57,695
Airline pilot

930
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,031
Security

931
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,207
Marshalls

932
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,303
So he's got a report

933
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
Philip Marshall

934
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:41,727
This is where Alex is getting his ideas that the government is going to come kill him then

935
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:48,127
Dodge no kill his family in order to make it look like he killed his family

936
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,407
For this Phillip Marsh

937
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,735
Philip Marshall was a pilot

938
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,759
Who had some connection

939
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
The CIA

940
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,319
He was involved with Barry seal

941
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:02,719
It's some capacity he was mixed up in Iran Contra

942
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,999
Decide

943
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023
Some soft rice

944
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,071
Sure but with more

945
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,119
Like credible connect

946
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,679
Chance to attend Larry Nichols

947
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:14,751
In addition to that he was a bit of an author 911

948
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,359
He published a book in 2008 called false-flag 911

949
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:25,759
And a book that I was just brought up the big publishing February 2012 before

950
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,343
On February 2nd

951
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
2013

952
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,927
Marshall and his two children aged seven

953
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,207
19 + 14

954
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,975
Profound

955
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:39,583
The children were shot as they slept on the couch

956
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,655
Situation is a

957
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,423
Intense track

958
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,007
Situation

959
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
Is 8

960
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,871
All the traces back to Alex

961
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,919
Sagacity is about to bring up Wayne bats

962
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:57,503
It's important to remember that Wayne Mattson often just make s*** up

963
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:01,599
He's the guy who said that Hillary Clinton's personal chef was murdered

964
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,159
Attached to a method call Larry Nichols

965
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:08,255
And that's far from the stupidest s*** that way madsen's

966
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,023
Reported

967
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:13,119
You might notice the Way Madison doesn't come on Alex's show anymore in 2019

968
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,911
And that's because these two dudes now

969
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
Heat roster

970
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,495
Matteson is a side of it Alex's working for Israel

971
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,775
Which is on brand for him

972
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:23,615
Since Matson pretty much thinks Israel's behind everything that happens that he doesn't like

973
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,687
Anders Breivik was secretly working for Mossad

974
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,967
That's something that he report it

975
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,247
He reported

976
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,271
Yeah

977
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,575
After Marshall and his children were found dead

978
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,623
Wayne Madsen went to the town that they lived in

979
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
An investigator

980
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
Hey what do you know

981
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,719
He found no evidence

982
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,999
The Philippa killed his children

983
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:44,607
There must be a secret assassination hit meant to punish him for the book you published

984
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,423
A year prior or something

985
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,983
I don't I don't think he was

986
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,823
I think he was

987
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,615
Sneaking around like

988
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:59,711
Course I didn't let him at the binoculars

989
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,527
A couple weeks after

990
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:08,927
Close enough like everything was probably processed by that found no evidence of

991
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,743
1025

992
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,023
Assholes

993
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,375
To find out if there was any

994
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,967
I suspect look too hard because

995
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,247
Twist mist

996
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:40,159
Beginning in at least at least 2008 Phillip Marshall and his wife Shawn Plummer began having severe problems

997
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
Their marriage

998
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,975
To be pretty much all his fault

999
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,047
In November 2008 plumber sister told the police

1000
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,631
Police that he told plumber that she quote will not see December

1001
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,447
Which is one of many over threats

1002
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Pre-made to her

1003
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:58,335
Former sister and reported on multiple occasions being afraid for her safety as well as that of Marshall

1004
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,103
Children

1005
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,943
She reported that Philip quote Philip keeps calling and driving by the residence

1006
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,247
Behavior that you might call stocking

1007
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:09,087
On December 5th 2008 Philip got into a physical altercation

1008
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
Super plumber sister

1009
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,647
Would you like to plumber getting an

1010
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,207
Protective order against which violate

1011
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:19,071
Throughout this time Philip was clearly involving their children if their domestic problem

1012
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,655
When the protective order was issued police reviewed phone message

1013
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,215
For his daughter

1014
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,263
Michaela this is Daddy

1015
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,287
We're going to have lunch

1016
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,567
We need to talk right now

1017
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,615
If not something is going to have

1018
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,175
There's no circumstances under which it

1019
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,711
It's acceptable threaten your children like

1020
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,247
That is deeply abuse

1021
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,319
Flower initiated divorce proceedings then

1022
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
Back in 2000

1023
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,159
Emotion and try to make things work

1024
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:44,927
In 2000

1025
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:49,535
In October 2012 she decided it wasn't going to work and filed for divorce

1026
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,583
All the details

1027
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,399
Listen to the crime match up perfectly with a double murder-suicide

1028
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:58,239
The bodies were not repositioned nothing of value was stolen from the sea

1029
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
Seen all the ballistic evidence

1030
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,055
Exactly as you'd expect

1031
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,895
There was no sign of a struggle and there's no disruption of the blood spatter evidence

1032
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,455
Which indicates that there could not have been

1033
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,223
Anyone else

1034
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,527
A close enough proximity to have done the shooting

1035
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,343
Since their bodies would have ended up causing gaps in the blood supply

1036
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
Phillips fingerprints

1037
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:18,207
We're on the ammunition box and Gun Magazine

1038
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,023
The bullets used used matched

1039
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,559
Specific type of ammo

1040
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:27,167
But he purchased days before at a Big 5 sporting good store as confirmed by receipt

1041
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,959
Security video from the store

1042
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,775
Police police searching the house found his safe

1043
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,543
Unlocked

1044
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,847
In the safe they found his box of ammunition

1045
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,383
Which accounted for all the bullets

1046
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
Everything

1047
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,455
I was sitting on top of the

1048
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,831
They also found five bags of medical marijuana with a note next to it that said quotes hi Sean

1049
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
Which is his wife's name

1050
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:51,743
Medical records reviewed after the murders revealed that Philip had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2000

1051
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:56,351
I do his episodes of depression and grounded from flying commercially

1052
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,631
In September 2000

1053
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,935
They also found it in the more

1054
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,471
Recent past Philip have been suffering from

1055
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
Chronic pain

1056
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,031
I've been visiting clinics

1057
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,567
Trying to get pain

1058
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,615
The bottom line is this

1059
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,407
There's a whole mountain of evidence

1060
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,711
Philip Marshall is the guy

1061
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,015
And that he was struggling with a lot of very difficult

1062
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,599
Their long-standing mental health battles as well as

1063
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
Abuse issues

1064
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,927
And beyond that and more importantly he had a

1065
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,719
You clearly had a history of domestic

1066
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:26,303
Which is the single factor that you will almost always

1067
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,607
History of the people who do things like Philip dick

1068
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:33,983
I feel a certain amount of empathy for what he must have been struggling with in his life

1069
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,007
But that just appears

1070
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:35,775
Really quick

1071
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,567
When you consider how he treated his wife

1072
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:43,711
Children in the 2008/2009 tray it probably plenty of other times that are less documented by police

1073
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,271
Wayne Mattson doesn't know s***

1074
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,599
And almost all of this conspiracy nonsense comes directly

1075
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,695
You go to websites that are reporting on the conspiracy and have

1076
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,719
Questions

1077
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,023
Quotes about it almost all of it directly

1078
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,071
Goes right back to Wayne Madsen

1079
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
In quotes

1080
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
Reporting

1081
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,471
Is not

1082
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,031
Bring up gun control

1083
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,591
Talk mainly about the

1084
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
NeverEnding

1085
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,503
That is another one of those things

1086
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,807
Most gun deaths are suicides

1087
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,855
This kind of Scituate like

1088
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,671
One reason that I

1089
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,695
Would love company

1090
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,719
Control is just because

1091
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,487
I don't

1092
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,791
Thinking I should be allowed to have a gun

1093
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:33,887
My personal level of

1094
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,191
I can't have a gun because

1095
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,007
That to me just the mere fact

1096
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
Owning it is

1097
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,055
Owning

1098
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,335
You know clicking off but

1099
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,151
One of the things that

1100
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,479
Is shown over

1101
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,527
Study after study when talking about psychology

1102
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
Profiles

1103
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,319
The people who commit

1104
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:56,159
Suicide is a little bit more time the moment

1105
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
Bright

1106
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,767
Hope you and I can talk

1107
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,071
Pizza that from experience

1108
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,631
That's a shity argument

1109
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,167
I forgot control

1110
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:11,263
It's not an argument for gun control it's something that I

1111
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,543
Think is involved with

1112
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:19,455
We should have got cuz it's bad for you to have a gun

1113
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,247
To have a gun

1114
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
Per se

1115
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,039
I don't mean that no one

1116
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,111
Figure make that argument

1117
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,791
It's a good

1118
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,327
Reason

1119
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
4

1120
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,887
They're to be more consideration

1121
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
So you're buying a gun

1122
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,215
More factors to go into

1123
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,007
Absolutely

1124
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,031
So

1125
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,567
The reality of the situation

1126
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,359
Without Marshall is very sad

1127
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,383
A very

1128
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,943
I need another way to put it

1129
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,967
Incredibly sad

1130
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,991
The horrible turn

1131
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,295
And the way Alex

1132
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831
Editorial

1133
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,623
And just make stuff up

1134
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,159
About how he imagines

1135
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,951
The whole thing

1136
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,719
Is just

1137
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,999
Next Level monster

1138
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:27,807
Drones

1139
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:52,639
If if that isn't true what he's doing is

1140
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,919
So f******

1141
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:54,687
Engrossed

1142
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,735
It's not true

1143
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:02,623
Based on the evidence available he's just making up a story line about a Cuban tragic

1144
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:12,351
Can you imagine what his ex-wife is going through like it's still only a couple weeks after here Alex is on air

1145
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,399
Talking about her children like

1146
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,703
It's f****** awful

1147
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,007
Because

1148
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
WeedMaps

1149
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,847
Is this next clip

1150
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,895
We get

1151
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,711
Starting to just report the Roni has information

1152
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,503
About the situation

1153
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:36,415
Unfortunately

1154
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,463
All right what are you basing

1155
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
Nothing

1156
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,047
Hear this next clip

1157
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,607
This is just Wayne Mattson make

1158
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,375
Shut up

1159
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:08,415
Marshalls wedding ring on a box

1160
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:23,007
Like what do you mean what do you mean where did it come from

1161
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
Oh good

1162
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:29,151
Videos and buying ammo

1163
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,687
Before

1164
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,735
Bulshit

1165
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,831
He presents himself as a f****** investigative journalist

1166
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,599
The facts

1167
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
Contradict

1168
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,647
Everything he's saying

1169
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:45,791
He doesn't know about the domestic history that police were investigating and and

1170
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,839
Had police reports about

1171
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
Glitter

1172
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
Contradict

1173
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:50,911
The amicable

1174
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,703
End of the marriage

1175
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:57,055
The fact that the police were aware of the security footage

1176
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:00,639
Big 5 Sporting Goods or if he does

1177
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,407
Please reply

1178
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,199
Just completely lying about this

1179
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:08,831
Fall back on is I talked to a neighbor who seems like a nice guy

1180
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,879
Which is what people say about people

1181
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,439
Every single f******

1182
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Hi

1183
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:17,279
It happens right

1184
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:20,351
UK me I wouldn't even say that if it was true

1185
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,423
If I if I if I had a very quiet

1186
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:27,519
Polite neighbor who I was interviewed by

1187
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Local

1188
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,639
I wouldn't say

1189
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,967
I will probably not say anything

1190
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,759
But I also think a lot of the time

1191
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:42,111
When people say like goes always a nice guy it's not defending them

1192
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,927
Expression of shock

1193
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,023
Seems like a nice guy

1194
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,815
It's just boring response now

1195
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,887
Clipper

1196
01:00:54,911 --> 01:01:01,055
Showmars

1197
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:07,455
Some years ago

1198
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:11,295
That's not true

1199
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,855
Mental health issues that he had

1200
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
You just

1201
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,903
Years prior

1202
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,231
That was grounded as a pilot because of that

1203
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,767
And they continued

1204
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,047
Play kits

1205
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,583
. this is not

1206
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,351
Okay

1207
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,399
This reporting is not okay

1208
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,727
Can you just straight-up lie like that I guess you can

1209
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
Really what is

1210
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,799
Do Weymouth

1211
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,271
He's huge in the circle

1212
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:48,159
I don't know if I don't think it's true but he presented self

1213
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:55,583
What Project Camelot guy no big big heroic backstory

1214
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,655
He pretends he's got a lot of scoops

1215
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,447
And then just

1216
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
Treated

1217
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,031
I don't I don't know how

1218
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,311
Actually make

1219
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,919
Yeah right

1220
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:16,319
Probably Google ads at the job that he purports

1221
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,135
Pretty bad

1222
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,671
Especially

1223
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,951
These are been on

1224
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:22,975
True thing

1225
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:27,071
These have been things

1226
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,631
Fact

1227
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
Now

1228
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,983
When he has to give a reason

1229
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:37,055
For why he thinks the Trilla Marshall couldn't have killed her

1230
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
Does children

1231
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,591
Adam cell

1232
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,871
This is what he's got

1233
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,375
People who

1234
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,775
Real bad

1235
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,055
Thinking

1236
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,335
That's like

1237
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,663
Wow he loves the Saints

1238
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,479
The Super Bowl was being held in New Orleans

1239
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,063
And so he couldn't have possibly committed suicide

1240
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,599
Prior to that

1241
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:56,671
Cuz he would put it off until after the Superbowl

1242
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:00,767
I don't think that this is a good understanding of how people in

1243
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,559
Crisis actor

1244
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,863
Like when you're in a mental health crisis

1245
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,655
Other things do not cut

1246
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,935
They're not as important

1247
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:12,287
Things that you used to find great enjoyment and you no longer relief

1248
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,311
Fuel vacmop

1249
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
4

1250
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,639
You know Hobbies Fall Away

1251
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,919
Pastime

1252
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,479
Groups that you're involved in you just drop out of

1253
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,527
Like it's something that is very

1254
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,295
Common

1255
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,319
People who are in

1256
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,111
Major depressive episode

1257
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:31,487
So the idea that like we would he would have loved the Superbowl

1258
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
That is

1259
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,303
Not good thinking

1260
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,375
This is bad investigative journalism

1261
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,775
This is only okay to bring up

1262
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,799
As like

1263
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,847
You know he love the Super Bowl

1264
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,127
It's a it's a shame

1265
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Primerica

1266
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:50,943
Just kids

1267
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,527
Yeah that's the only

1268
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:57,343
Go to it

1269
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
It's so

1270
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,207
Alibi

1271
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:02,975
Hi for a car

1272
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:09,631
Miss the Superbowl

1273
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,191
God dammit

1274
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,751
The government

1275
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,615
Super Bowl

1276
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:24,735
Three days later then

1277
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,015
For sure

1278
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:32,415
It's two days before the Super Bowl 2013 Super Bowl like

1279
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:37,023
Wasn't Orleans but it was the Ravens and 49ers like if he's a big stye

1280
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:40,607
Just because it's at the stadium

1281
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,911
We're not even engaging with that

1282
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:49,311
Do you know how is even worse than that

1283
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:53,407
I don't even want to allow it to

1284
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,711
So here is Alex

1285
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,575
What waves doing I think is

1286
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
Inhuman

1287
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,415
Like it's really disgraceful to the memory of the

1288
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:07,487
You people the children

1289
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,279
They're that they're lost

1290
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,559
The family

1291
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
What are you doing

1292
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,679
Under the guise of like I just want the truth

1293
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,983
Yeah he's doing is such a

1294
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
Massive

1295
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:20,799
To them

1296
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
It

1297
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,359
Can't be overstated how

1298
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,199
I don't know how you can sleep when you act like this

1299
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:27,967
It is

1300
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,247
This is

1301
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,783
One of the

1302
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,575
Examples

1303
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,599
That I will use

1304
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,879
From now on when I say that

1305
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,183
Because it goes for real

1306
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
WeedMaps

1307
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
He's getting haunted

1308
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:45,119
Maybe his own apartment

1309
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,655
Covington

1310
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:50,239
So what are you doing terrible but what Alex is doing is pretty bad

1311
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,335
Reporting on Wayne's stuff as it's fat

1312
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,607
I mean like

1313
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:19,167
It's the same thing

1314
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,727
Same impulse as

1315
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:28,127
The Jack Swagger's house it's only important because I'm worried that it makes my team look bad or

1316
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,407
Whatever

1317
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,687
This guy

1318
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,735
Because there is one trait

1319
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,759
It's similar

1320
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,807
We're both conspiracy theorists

1321
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:39,135
I must deny that he's capable

1322
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:39,903
Of doing

1323
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
Herend

1324
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,487
Just not okay

1325
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,767
It's not okay

1326
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:49,119
To deny the ability of someone to do terrible things

1327
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,911
Because you think it looks bad

1328
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
Right

1329
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
That is

1330
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,471
Pathetic

1331
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,495
It is

1332
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,479
It's a bad thing to do

1333
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
Defend anybody

1334
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,039
Cuz they're on team

1335
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:07,807
Regardless

1336
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,599
Just got there on your team regardless

1337
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,367
Directions

1338
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,903
It's good that it doesn't

1339
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
Work

1340
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,975
It's good that it's an ineffective strategy

1341
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,023
You know it's great

1342
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
Kavanaugh

1343
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
All of those

1344
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,631
Nevermind

1345
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
Perfectly

1346
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,191
It works it so well

1347
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
That sucks

1348
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,263
So

1349
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,567
This makes clip we're done with Wayne Madsen

1350
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,591
I just really

1351
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,663
Was a shocking display of

1352
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:34,943
Evil being

1353
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,991
Yeah I want to be done with Wayne Madsen

1354
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,015
Forever

1355
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,551
I was shocked

1356
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:44,671
Like Madison was coming up to the beginning of the show sometimes

1357
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,999
Boring

1358
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,351
You guys are terrible I started to look into

1359
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,655
The case and that I found these

1360
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,423
Articles

1361
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,959
Police reports in them

1362
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,263
Contradiction

1363
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:02,847
But from Wayne Mattson

1364
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,943
You're leaving a lot out of this story

1365
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,991
It's not the story you want to tell

1366
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,783
You want to tell the story that

1367
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
Depends

1368
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,575
You

1369
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,367
If you're not a factor

1370
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
This is about

1371
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,439
Okay here's what we

1372
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
I got to pitch

1373
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,279
We do a regular Ghost Hunt

1374
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,071
Okay buddy

1375
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,887
Instead of doing the like let's go

1376
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,935
Alcatraz

1377
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,215
Feeling out goes there

1378
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:33,055
We just go to places where s******* like Wayne Madsen

1379
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:35,103
And Alex Jones and all of those people

1380
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
Have

1381
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,663
F***** over people

1382
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:41,247
And explain

1383
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:44,575
I can't feel any ghosts around here right now

1384
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,903
Well the problem with that is that physically it's a lot of

1385
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,671
Some places

1386
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:53,791
Like Wayne is in Washington DC and Alex's in Austin as they're having this conversation

1387
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,327
Okay I mean

1388
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,351
Alright I'll picture

1389
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,143
But then we have to go to like California to

1390
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
The crime scene

1391
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:05,823
Fitzgerald Madsen crafted his interview

1392
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,847
Then Austin

1393
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,919
This is this again

1394
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:14,527
Overcoming

1395
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,855
They suck

1396
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,903
This exposes just kind of funny

1397
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
Tacos Alex

1398
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,207
Alex

1399
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,431
Casino

1400
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:52,159
Casino gulag

1401
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:55,487
So funny that you just described

1402
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,791
Well I'm probably just some piece of it

1403
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,887
Completely obsessed with Death Race

1404
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,447
2000

1405
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,799
It's just really funny to me that

1406
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
He's talking about it

1407
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
Casino game show gulag

1408
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,407
When in 2019

1409
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,687
He is

1410
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,479
Completely

1411
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,271
Like most public.

1412
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,087
Disgraceful bootlicker for a guy who ran casinos

1413
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,391
Came to prominence as a game show host

1414
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:26,207
And his running gulags

1415
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,071
Police state

1416
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:34,143
Casino game show gulags now let me

1417
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:40,031
Really Grease the wheels so this casino running game show host guy can

1418
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:44,127
Run gulags that I justify him running

1419
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,455
Enraged

1420
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:51,807
Angry at us being dragged Along by faith

1421
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:55,391
Do everything made perfect

1422
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,951
That's not okay that he accidentally got that right

1423
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
Bulshit

1424
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:00,767
Goes to show

1425
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,535
I'm angry

1426
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,375
For a large part of the end of the

1427
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,143
Episode

1428
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:06,911
Alex

1429
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,679
Is

1430
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,495
He's really mad at

1431
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,055
LA mayor

1432
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,335
Villa Ragusa

1433
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
Sure why not

1434
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,455
It turns out that someone

1435
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,247
Has been putting up stickers

1436
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,039
And posters of Alex's

1437
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,063
Illegally

1438
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,087
In Los

1439
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:30,975
Oh no bill for the removal of those

1440
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,143
Happy about it

1441
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,935
He goes on to

1442
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,703
To say like

1443
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:42,239
What if someone hits

1444
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,031
Spray painted like

1445
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:48,127
Some McDonald's thing somewhere

1446
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,663
Maybe

1447
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,711
Depends on if the property owner

1448
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,015
Complained I assume the reason that you're

1449
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,855
The reason that you're getting a bell for this is that it was on

1450
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,391
Maybe city property

1451
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,695
Four on subway

1452
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:05,023
Cuz I'm sure that the city wouldn't even remove it unless people complain

1453
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,815
Just let it be

1454
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,263
Irremovable difficult to remove

1455
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,031
Posters

1456
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:20,127
I bet

1457
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,663
Complained

1458
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,431
Take care of it

1459
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,455
Alex

1460
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
Complaints about it

1461
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:59,295
201 2000

1462
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:14,655
To enlist his audience to harass like

1463
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:19,519
Clerks in La about a f****** invoice for probably like

1464
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,567
$1,000

1465
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,223
It's the time to try and send

1466
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,087
Who cares

1467
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,135
What absorbs

1468
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:40,255
I'm fine with that

1469
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,791
Oh man

1470
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,071
No cuz you remember

1471
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,119
He has to say all the time

1472
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:49,215
Put them up in legal and lawful places

1473
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,519
I guess he gets bills

1474
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,591
Infowars sticker removal

1475
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:58,175
I like I like the imaginary rules

1476
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:00,735
System that these guys work on there like Alex is like

1477
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:08,415
In a sarcastic way but if it was the sheriff

1478
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,695
He'll be fine with it

1479
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:16,351
Notification down again

1480
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,399
Who said to Bill somewhere else he be like

1481
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:24,799
Exactly right Sheriff can do all of that like it was a sheriff coming down on some liberal person hit me like

1482
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:31,199
Good Noble law

1483
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:34,271
Imagines that feel ragosta is coming around again

1484
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:41,695
Yeah

1485
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,719
Ridiculous

1486
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,511
So Alex is nephew.

1487
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,815
With Antonio

1488
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:52,703
I look forward to that being continue to do this for a week

1489
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,007
Max Keiser comes on

1490
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,031
Is Alex gay

1491
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:02,175
Max Keiser

1492
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:05,247
Talk about how that you know how

1493
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,271
It's 2 billion Bond

1494
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,599
Bullets

1495
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,367
Commodity

1496
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:14,207
We're right there aren't very expensive

1497
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,487
Almost think

1498
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,559
He's advocating people buy them as an investment I'm not

1499
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
But

1500
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,143
I only pulled this clip out because

1501
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,447
Listen carefully

1502
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,263
Something very weird

1503
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:39,295
So the bullets are always the weak spot

1504
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:43,135
What

1505
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,927
He's

1506
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,463
Sing the bullets are cute

1507
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,743
Eminem

1508
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,191
He has to say that to himself

1509
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:00,287
I think I accidentally

1510
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,359
I feel that way

1511
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,383
Yeah

1512
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:07,455
Think so

1513
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,223
Sincerity

1514
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,247
He's expressing that is

1515
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,527
But he thinks bullets are cute

1516
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,831
Weird

1517
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,903
So it is next clip

1518
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,695
Yeah what Max

1519
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,463
Kaiser

1520
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,231
Procedure to do

1521
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:28,447
Then you'll see

1522
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,455
That we could happen any day

1523
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:45,855
A massive kind of

1524
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,719
They don't really have great now

1525
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:55,327
This is what's going to happen to Southern California the place for economic

1526
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,351
Analogo show

1527
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,375
Almost

1528
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,655
Without exception

1529
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,959
Everyone that comes on

1530
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,031
Has to either directly say or imply

1531
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:06,591
Did any day now gold is going to go through the roof

1532
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:09,407
Because Alex works for a gold company

1533
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,967
This is ridiculous

1534
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,551
Go to break

1535
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,831
They're listening to

1536
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,111
Commercials during the break

1537
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,391
Apparently

1538
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,671
Comes back from break

1539
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:22,719
Laughing

1540
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:26,303
Squatty Potty

1541
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,599
He's been wrong about it

1542
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,879
Pretty much everything

1543
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:56,767
He's also wrong that The Squatty Potty is hilarious

1544
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:03,167
Commercial

1545
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:10,079
I don't know how hilarious it is

1546
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:12,895
A little slight elevation in their legs is helpful

1547
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,967
Coronavirus

1548
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,015
But it turns out I'm probably wrong

1549
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:22,879
It's for window mount

1550
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,487
Really

1551
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:41,311
Free Squatty Potty jokes in 17 seconds

1552
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,335
Is impressive

1553
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,383
Funny no

1554
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,175
Hilarious

1555
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:46,943
It's not funny

1556
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:49,247
It's hilarious

1557
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:56,159
Getting into the pro wrestling narrative which I always

1558
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,183
Excited for

1559
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,743
Disgraceful

1560
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,535
Reporting about Philip Marshall

1561
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,607
Max Keiser have joking about

1562
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,679
The f****** right there

1563
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,703
Nuts

1564
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,543
The 20th is a show that I would

1565
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,824
Describe is mostly

1566
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,104
Full of

1567
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
Poop

1568
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,224
No

1569
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,040
No it wouldn't there are episode

1570
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,064
That I run into

1571
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,088
To from time to time

1572
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,368
They are just

1573
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,160
This is Alex

1574
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:29,952
Phoning it in

1575
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,976
Yeah but it's

1576
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,000
F****** impressive

1577
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,328
The skills that he has

1578
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,120
The ability to say nothing

1579
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,144
Passionately

1580
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,424
For long stretches

1581
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,448
Yeah that's

1582
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:46,080
Today there are episodes you'll just be like an hour you haven't said anything

1583
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:47,360
But you're yelling

1584
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,640
That that's

1585
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
Right

1586
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
Stock

1587
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,760
Little bit

1588
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:57,856
Industrialized

1589
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,624
You want to

1590
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,904
Brutal crash the dollar

1591
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,768
It is all that all that strong in a row like they're eugenicist

1592
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,072
Nothing

1593
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,608
Just did General thing

1594
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,424
The generalship thrown all over the place

1595
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:14,752
And that's what most of the 20th is it was a hard listen

1596
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,568
So nothing

1597
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:19,872
Okay

1598
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,896
You think

1599
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:21,920
That he

1600
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,992
He thinks about his show after he's done

1601
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:28,320
You don't think

1602
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:32,160
How could you do that unless when you went home you didn't even ask

1603
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
Yourself like

1604
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,720
Was today a good show

1605
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:39,328
Not a chance

1606
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,936
Whatever is a virus

1607
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,960
I can read

1608
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,264
About

1609
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,032
Fuel

1610
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:53,664
A great about it

1611
01:21:53,920 --> 01:22:00,064
Quite a bit I think it's the difference the difference between caring and not

1612
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088
I think he understands

1613
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,112
Woody's talkingshit

1614
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,136
Who cares

1615
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,160
As long as

1616
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,208
As long as you keep in the money coming in

1617
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:10,048
That's really what this is about

1618
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:12,352
So you don't have to worry about them killing him

1619
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:18,752
You don't have to worry about actually winning the battle at the globalist yeah cuz it's all bulshit

1620
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:20,800
So

1621
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:27,200
He's not like man I did a really bad job you're always like hurting people who can't hurt you

1622
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,760
Exactly

1623
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:32,832
He's never going to be in a place where they can get to

1624
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:38,720
Sure he lives in a townhouse

1625
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,768
So I think there's something

1626
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,048
But today I think you just

1627
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,328
Suit of loser

1628
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,120
Sense of caring

1629
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,144
When they're already

1630
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,448
Steaks are Imagine

1631
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,336
So on the 20th

1632
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,384
I wanted to play this but instead

1633
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,408
Describe it for you

1634
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,944
Because it's too long

1635
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,248
Yeah a caller calls in and he's like

1636
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,016
Hey

1637
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:05,600
We need to be upfront about this

1638
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,904
I'm saying that's not you

1639
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,696
So you don't have to get criticized for this

1640
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,792
It's the Jews

1641
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,568
Of course they did

1642
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:33,248
Alex's likes will thank you for letting me off the hook for this one

1643
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,552
Because Alex was pushing back a little bit

1644
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,576
But not much

1645
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,344
It was

1646
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,624
It was a very strange

1647
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,464
When you get a caller like that

1648
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,512
You know what they're saying

1649
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:50,912
You don't need to be like yes there are Jewish Mafia is an Italian mafia is a

1650
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,448
You don't need to do that

1651
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,752
Probably be like

1652
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,568
I got to go I got to go

1653
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,944
I thought it was really interesting because he does keep him on the line for like

1654
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:06,016
They have a long call

1655
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,064
All the time

1656
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,344
Not on the show

1657
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:16,000
It's weird like it's

1658
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,536
It's the resistance but it doesn't

1659
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
Aggressive

1660
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,584
Lovely

1661
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,144
Yeah oh yeah

1662
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,168
It's wishy-washy

1663
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,288
I felt it would be a disservice

1664
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,568
Do not like playing the hole

1665
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,104
Yeah it was

1666
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,896
But we do have a few clips

1667
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,432
I've other things

1668
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,736
I wanted them is Alex

1669
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,296
This is just a

1670
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,368
I think a precursor of the world of Cruelty

1671
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,160
He would go on to become the mouthpiece

1672
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,952
Because

1673
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:46,976
MC little shades

1674
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,000
Of

1675
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:48,768
Adelaide

1676
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,032
I just can't help it

1677
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,376
Got another

1678
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:32,032
We already know that does that fake laughing when he's really a

1679
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:37,920
Which makes the comment even weirder

1680
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:41,504
I just don't I don't I don't appreciate her enjoy

1681
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,272
People

1682
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:44,832
Expressing that Delight in others down

1683
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,904
Even if you disagree with the other

1684
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,696
Especially because

1685
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:50,976
Kind of discussing

1686
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,048
Yeah you know it's not just like

1687
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,328
You know you

1688
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,864
You don't get your way

1689
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,424
Or something like that it's

1690
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,472
It death

1691
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,544
That does seem to be

1692
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,176
Huge component of their non-zero-sum game or their zero-sum game

1693
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,200
Kind of Outlook

1694
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,528
If my

1695
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:16,832
Progressive causes our champion

1696
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:17,856
Put into place

1697
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,392
I'm going to laugh

1698
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,696
Because it makes my enemies fall

1699
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,536
Honestly

1700
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,584
It's just that I want to put in place

1701
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,912
Makes even my enemies lives better

1702
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:35,008
You're right you know I don't want universal healthcare for the winners

1703
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,544
No no

1704
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:39,104
For some reason there

1705
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,384
World doesn't exist

1706
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,920
Like that

1707
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,200
This is what you

1708
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,992
Christian like election night

1709
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:50,880
Alex and Rodger is laughing

1710
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,952
It's that it's that

1711
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,512
Glass carries over

1712
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,560
23 years after the

1713
01:26:59,072 --> 01:26:59,840
That night

1714
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,120
Yep

1715
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,168
And I mean if anybody needs

1716
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,216
It's clear

1717
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,776
What they were laughing at is people crying

1718
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,800
Exactly what's happened

1719
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:11,104
The children being in camps

1720
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,384
People dying

1721
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,736
The bills in Alabama and restriction

1722
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:17,760
On abortion

1723
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,808
Those are the things that

1724
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:23,136
People mocking people for

1725
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,416
Being afraid we're going

1726
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,440
Want to come

1727
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,208
So

1728
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,512
Put that into sharp Focus

1729
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,328
His cruelty is always been

1730
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,352
And

1731
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,912
Is very bizarre belief

1732
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,448
About spiritual

1733
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,984
I've also always been there

1734
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,288
Cousin this next Cliff he expresses

1735
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,592
A very strange

1736
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:43,872
Belief

1737
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,152
About why Society

1738
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,096
So

1739
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,888
Civilization rise

1740
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,704
In order to make it easier to

1741
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,728
To sacrifice human

1742
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,496
Being

1743
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:15,616
To Gaia the earth guy who's actually was

1744
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,152
To explain what

1745
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,272
So you need to kill a lot of people in order to make Gaia / Lucifer happy

1746
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,000
No.

1747
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,304
Is for Gaia gods

1748
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:41,216
Yeah I don't know he doesn't complicated cosmologists really great the break

1749
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:47,104
Happened right there Nora comes back from commercial and

1750
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:50,944
Jack Swagger

1751
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,480
Zeb Colter

1752
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,552
WWE characters

1753
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,856
To hate the Mexican champion

1754
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,160
Alberto Del Rio

1755
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:04,000
Love it

1756
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,304
Alex has only legitimate complaint

1757
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:13,728
But he doesn't

1758
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:16,032
A lot about the Raza

1759
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,592
This episode on February 20th

1760
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:24,480
Misunderstanding of what lorazepam

1761
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,760
That's

1762
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:28,832
If he believes it to be a specifically only

1763
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,136
Hispanic nationalist

1764
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:34,720
Group that seeks to destroy all non-hispanic

1765
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,512
Which is

1766
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,328
But in complaining of

1767
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,376
He says something

1768
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:42,656
That again

1769
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,960
Is very bizarre for the present

1770
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:48,544
Our kind of horses Spanish

1771
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,896
Your portion

1772
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:11,328
Alex

1773
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,632
2013 is warning

1774
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:17,472
About

1775
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,800
Which is kind of his entire show in 29

1776
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,896
I just don't like

1777
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,736
How complete the dismantling has to be

1778
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:29,760
Daddy

1779
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:30,784
It's vile

1780
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:37,184
Only because he doesn't believe this stuff

1781
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,280
Dismantling gets a facade Falling Away

1782
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,560
How thorough it is

1783
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:47,424
You know like getting a new episode

1784
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:51,520
It's like there's at least one thing where you can drive Direct

1785
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,288
Parallel

1786
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,312
2 today and

1787
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,080
He's doing the

1788
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,016
Nationalism

1789
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:02,784
The race-conscious

1790
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,552
Business

1791
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:05,856
And now at the same time in the

1792
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,904
Benno couple years later

1793
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:11,488
Going to be hanging out with a lot of people who are pretty

1794
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,768
Super into

1795
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:15,328
Race Consciousness and nationalism

1796
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,608
It's fine because they're

1797
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:18,400
Race-conscious

1798
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,168
Right

1799
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:21,728
Become super

1800
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,008
Clear the all of this doesn't

1801
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,800
Matter all this doesn't

1802
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,080
It doesn't mean any

1803
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:27,360
It only has two

1804
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:31,200
To do with feeling like white people will be targeted by XYZ

1805
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,224
Yep that's it

1806
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,760
That's the only thing

1807
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:34,784
Underlies

1808
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,064
Position

1809
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,136
Everything else is built on top of that

1810
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:42,464
And a primary the primary building block

1811
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,488
Is

1812
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,512
White

1813
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,304
Right

1814
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,328
Fear arises

1815
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:48,864
Almost certainly

1816
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,632
Because

1817
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,912
They assume

1818
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,704
That

1819
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,800
Well because that's what they wanted

1820
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:57,824
Basically

1821
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,664
That's because what they do want when they get power is

1822
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,968
Able to do all that stuff

1823
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,248
So they assumed

1824
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:07,040
If they were to gain power

1825
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,832
They would want to do the same

1826
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:12,672
Maybe to them that you could not

1827
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,024
Maybe not take away all rights like that might be

1828
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,560
Too much to put on Alex

1829
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,328
From everything I've

1830
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:21,376
But certainly make second

1831
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:24,704
You know what I mean like I don't know if

1832
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,984
Looking at Alex

1833
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:26,752
In 2013

1834
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,568
I would be at all comfortable

1835
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,872
Assuming

1836
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
Really

1837
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:33,920
If I would say that

1838
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,688
If you got

1839
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,480
Everything go his way

1840
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:39,552
He would completely make all non-white

1841
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,344
Not have Civil Right

1842
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,672
Protections

1843
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:48,512
But he would like he would pave the way for somebody who would

1844
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,048
Probably weather

1845
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,328
Justly or not probably

1846
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:55,680
More interested is upholding a system wherein

1847
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,984
People who were up like him

1848
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,800
Were considered secondary or

1849
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,080
Different or weird

1850
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:07,968
As opposed to him and all the traits that are like Kim which are normal and anybody like him

1851
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,504
Completely incapable

1852
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,528
Kind of

1853
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:13,856
Right she wants to uphold

1854
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:15,904
Which is functionally very similar

1855
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,952
Quite frankly

1856
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,720
Ed's

1857
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:21,280
If it isn't immediately

1858
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,888
That that very thought process

1859
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:30,752
That everything that everything that

1860
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,032
Yes sure

1861
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:37,920
You didn't want to outright Holocaust but all these little things start popping up

1862
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,456
And then all the sudden you have to

1863
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,480
Add this

1864
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,016
Directions

1865
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:46,624
You have to put down this thing over here and then finally somebody's like Welsh it

1866
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,416
Let's just get rid of them

1867
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,976
It's how it goes

1868
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,512
It's a road

1869
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:54,560
Yep

1870
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:03,008
So in the last clip we have here

1871
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,288
I just think

1872
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:07,872
Crazy clips

1873
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,640
And Alex

1874
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,944
We know that

1875
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,480
Relate everything

1876
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,504
From movies to

1877
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,272
To reality

1878
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,064
Really tell the difference

1879
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:16,832
Xtrema 2

1880
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,648
Movies

1881
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,208
You don't talk about as much but

1882
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,536
Without a doubt is one of the most foundational movies

1883
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,120
I have long believed that he believes himself to be Howard

1884
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:36,032
He believed him to be a self to be this guy who's mad as hell and

1885
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,336
It works against

1886
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,408
It did not surprise me

1887
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,456
February twenty

1888
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,224
Ashok

1889
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,016
Play the clip from Network

1890
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:47,808
And start stalking back

1891
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:51,904
To it as if he were Howard you this

1892
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,464
Is bizarre

1893
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:15,712
Call Gord

1894
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,064
That's crazy

1895
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:21,600
Razor

1896
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:26,208
You know what one of the things that makes it even more crazy to me is that it's not very performative

1897
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:30,560
No like he's just talkin back to it as if you would not like

1898
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:35,168
His normal screaming certified

1899
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:38,496
Do you think they're getting

1900
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,032
No you're not getting through to me

1901
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:42,080
Like he's responding as if it's

1902
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,640
Actually a conversation which is outside of his

1903
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,432
Performance style General

1904
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,968
Here's what it felt like to me

1905
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,248
Private

1906
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,784
It felt like that's something

1907
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,600
In private and we weren't

1908
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,368
Supposed to be

1909
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,744
Yeah I feel like I was

1910
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,864
Standing closet door like looking out

1911
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,656
Saying that to movie like that was

1912
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:13,312
Yeah

1913
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,336
Feel

1914
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:18,176
I would assume so

1915
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:20,736
Feels like you can do a better job than

1916
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,344
Hoosiers

1917
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:31,744
Yes

1918
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,328
What you have here is you know an interesting couple days

1919
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,352
A little bit

1920
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,656
I think that you're seeing

1921
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,448
Weird developed

1922
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,496
How

1923
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:43,520
Attention

1924
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,800
Starved Alex's

1925
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,336
In 2030

1926
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:47,872
Like willing

1927
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:48,896
Engaged

1928
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,176
In

1929
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,760
Not very optimized

1930
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,296
Publicity stunt

1931
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:56,832
Be going

1932
01:36:57,088 --> 01:37:00,160
Two Piers Bart like going on Piers Morgan show good

1933
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,208
Well done you did exactly what you need

1934
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,024
Showing up at the gun shop in Texas

1935
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,816
You did a good job after

1936
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,352
To the fact but how you

1937
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,888
Confronted peers

1938
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,424
Was very not Optima

1939
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,496
Go back on his show repeatedly

1940
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,288
Looking kind of sad and weak

1941
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,080
Does not work very well for you

1942
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:22,176
But you wanted to go back on his show because the first one was so good

1943
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:24,736
Should I understand why

1944
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:27,040
How to behave like that but that's not very good

1945
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:29,600
The way you trying to turn

1946
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,880
You know any

1947
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,184
Media coverage of him into a scandal

1948
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,208
Not good

1949
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,256
The WWE stuff

1950
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,048
He's not doing this right

1951
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,352
There is a way he could have gotten

1952
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,144
So much press out of this

1953
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:46,240
And all it involves is a little bit of humility and a little bit of a sense of humor

1954
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:49,312
If you had done that he could have played this so well

1955
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,104
Glenn Beck's not showing up

1956
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,896
He would show up for that

1957
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:53,920
But Alex

1958
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,712
Is desperate enough to show up

1959
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,504
Just play ball

1960
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
He could have done it

1961
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:02,624
But instead he's an optimized version of this Feud with the WWE

1962
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,648
He comes out looking

1963
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:04,672
F****** silly

1964
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:06,208
Because they want back

1965
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,512
Responding to them

1966
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,048
Talking about Glenn Beck

1967
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,840
And casually mentioning him

1968
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:12,864
In a joke

1969
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,632
Did the comment

1970
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,704
This is this is a sad

1971
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,264
Who really wants

1972
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,800
He got a taste of that attention

1973
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,080
Glenn Beck

1974
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:25,664
He wants to feel

1975
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,432
A w

1976
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,200
If you do that again

1977
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,736
He wants another hit

1978
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:32,064
Alex doesn't even know that

1979
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,088
The Squatty Potty

1980
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,392
He is

1981
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:40,512
I don't know it's interesting to me

1982
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:42,816
Me because this Ron is

1983
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:45,632
We're supposed to be you know figuring out his

1984
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,656
Rhetoric after

1985
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:47,936
Cooking

1986
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:50,240
Stretches of time

1987
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,544
Like it's not something that he's

1988
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,336
Primarily interested

1989
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,616
And we saw it

1990
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,384
Flare up

1991
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,664
When

1992
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,712
V-Star how

1993
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,992
Popular

1994
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,272
These conspiracy theories

1995
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,320
We saw his attention

1996
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:07,648
When he found that YouTube video that a 10 billion views

1997
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,696
Amy had the professor on

1998
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:10,464
To be interviewed

1999
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:11,488
About his

2000
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,512
Crazy.

2001
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:15,584
I think that these trends that we see

2002
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:16,864
With his

2003
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,632
Desperate

2004
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,400
Attention

2005
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:21,472
Got things with Piers Morgan with

2006
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:23,008
Criticism

2007
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,056
Really responding aggressive

2008
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:25,824
Play to them

2009
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,360
The WWE stock

2010
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,896
I think that trend

2011
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,664
Is going to

2012
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,688
Him

2013
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,224
Down his dark

2014
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,016
But that's just my sense

2015
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:34,784
That's what I have right now

2016
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,320
I think it's related

2017
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:38,112
But on a secondary

2018
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:40,928
Level development

2019
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,952
Sandy Hook narrative

2020
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,232
I think we're seeing

2021
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,536
The essential pieces of the stage

2022
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:46,560
If it needs to be

2023
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,096
Be set for him to go

2024
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:48,864
Down

2025
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:51,168
Really dumb bad path

2026
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:53,216
And we're already seeing dump bed

2027
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:56,032
Marshall story is

2028
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,080
Is unacceptable and on defense

2029
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,128
Like did the short jump

2030
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
From that

2031
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,688
Two saying directors at Sandy Hook

2032
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:05,248
To be less

2033
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,784
Dignified in order to

2034
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:07,808
To that point

2035
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,112
But I think he will be he will need

2036
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:10,880
Be motivated

2037
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,416
Dim sum

2038
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,072
So

2039
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:21,888
Yats

2040
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,168
It's pretty bizarre

2041
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,520
Long string of things

2042
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,800
It should have some

2043
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,848
But apparently

2044
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,896
I think misery is it

2045
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:33,920
Is a consequence

2046
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:38,272
So there's that it's cold comfort

2047
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,552
At least there's some

2048
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:43,392
Obedience training

2049
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:47,488
The consequence has to come very close to the event otherwise you don't learn.

2050
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,560
Yeah

2051
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,352
The consequence for all this

2052
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:54,912
Broken everything

2053
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:03,616
Yeah I think about that a lot like one of the things that I reflect on

2054
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,664
Like a lot of this

2055
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,944
Work comes down

2056
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,736
Listening to his shadow research

2057
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,760
Also reflect

2058
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:10,528
Pokemon

2059
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:12,320
What what is going on

2060
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:17,184
Thought that I can't ever get away from his how many times

2061
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,464
We had a chance

2062
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,256
A situation where at

2063
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:22,048
Yeah like how many times

2064
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,328
People had an opportunity

2065
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:27,680
D2 like whether it's the people who have sued him and then let him go with a

2066
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,960
Like giving an apology

2067
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,520
Or the people who do things

2068
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:33,568
That could have warned everyone

2069
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,896
People who had inside information and maybe they signed not.

2070
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:37,664
Disclosure green

2071
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,712
But they could have been brave

2072
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,528
Stood up been like no

2073
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,808
This is dangerous

2074
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,088
I know something

2075
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,648
Betty's is helpful

2076
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:48,672
There could be helpful to me

2077
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,232
The past

2078
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,512
Like we could have not gone down

2079
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:55,072
Alex could have been

2080
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,144
You know brought low earlier

2081
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:00,448
Didn't happen

2082
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:05,056
Yeah it is interesting

2083
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,080
The idea that

2084
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,360
Proximity

2085
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,128
Punishment

2086
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,408
The act the proximity

2087
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,456
Because it is

2088
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:14,016
No matter what happens

2089
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:16,320
Now it'll never be able to

2090
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:19,648
Alex won't experience that as the consequence of action

2091
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,464
Exactly

2092
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,000
Maybe that's

2093
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,536
Just a human thing and it's not his fault

2094
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,304
Process

2095
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,584
But it is unfortunate

2096
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,352
Because

2097
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:31,424
His inability to process it will probably be

2098
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:34,240
Text Meredith

2099
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:42,432
How's the speed is victimhood and its feelings of I've been wronged by everybody even more

2100

2119
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:48,480
Probably not cuz I would say Jack Swagger

2120
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:50,272
WWE

2121
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:52,320

Mixed martial arts

2124
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:05,376
No anything but also kind of a s******* he recently tweeted the where we go one we go all

2125
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:14,336
Jack Swagger might be a bit of a dumb dumb

2126
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,152
Is Alex Jones

2127
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:25,600
