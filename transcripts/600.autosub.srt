Interested in the live-action Cowboy Bebop

48
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616

For the new series I can go a long way and they just released the the open

60
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
Cowboy Bebop has maybe one of the most

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
Iconic open

It's amazing it's the same exact

70
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
What is the maze

Incredibles music

What's the business

108
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
Heroin

109
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:31,423
Look here's the deal

110
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Sentence with look

111
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,335
We've already discussed this a million times look implies look

112
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
,

113
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,759
Look at your video are both ways of me saying I did not make that much

114
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
I have the pan

115
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,903
Sure I got the single serving lasagna pan

116
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,255
I bought the ingredients of multiple times

117
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
It's tough to make a lasagna for one it's embarrassing a little bit by yourself

118
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,847
Might be more embarrassing than not making lasagna

119
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
I would feel accomplished

120
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
By doing it perhaps

121
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
But yeah

122
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
If it struck me as a little bit sad

123
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,063
I don't know if that's why I didn't do it could just be lazy

124
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
No that's entirely

125
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
But yeah

126
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
One of these days

127
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,719
Episode 600

128
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
By episode 700

129
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
God is my witness

130
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,679
Everyone knows do the 600's not really that special of a number we were looking forward to

00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:42,079
666

132
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,407

00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
Episode 666

135
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Taking place

136
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Perhaps

137
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
I hope so

138
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
We start Today Show

139
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
And this is big

140
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
This is real.

141
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
I mean right out of the gate

142
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
You know it

143
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
This is not f****** around

144
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
Today

145
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
This is like

146
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
The world is standing still

147
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,103
Mark your calendars as the day the world Stood Still

148
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
Broke yesterday afternoon

149
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,575
Took care of a lot of technical

150
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,159
Business and things around here and infrastructure keep this operation afloat

151
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:33,279
So I did not know about it until we couldn't sleep all night

152
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,863
Approximately 5 hours of research on this

153
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,935
Tell you unequivocally

154
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
This story is

155
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,311
10 times bigger than anything else you ever reported

156
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
10 times bigger

157
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Quantifiably

158
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,431
Ten times bigger than anything else Alex has ever reported

159
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
You know

160
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
I think my favorite part of this show

161
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,599
My position

162
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
I love remembering that this is in the past

163
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,231
Yes

164
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,839
The Day the Earth Stood Salem like

165
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,119
So this was last

166
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,447
Next week cuz I do not remember The Day the Earth Stood Still at all

167
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,263
Yeah I was a little bit confused

168
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
I was jogging my memory as

169
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Wednesday

170
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Covid-19

171
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
I won't spit still very much

172
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,391
Still Irene I didn't go out much

173
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
This is not

174
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,743
10 times bigger than any news that Alex has ever broken in his life

175
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Okay

176
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
Bigger than

177
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,631
Other Monumental pieces of History

178
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,215
Dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

179
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
I remember those Cold War

180
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Remember that one

181
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
This is better than World War

182
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
Oh that was easy to remember

183
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,991
The first one

184
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,807
In modern world history

185
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
And you can argue they succeed

186
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
It is the biggest thing

187
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
In history

188
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
Nice save

189
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Nice

190
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
Oh man what if it go back to

191
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,799
Jesus that he didn't add that in the end I was so impressed by that

192
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
Immediately when I was listening to

193
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
What about Jesus

194
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Look

195
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,271
If there's anyone who would be impressed by that safe

196
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
Jesus

197
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
Oh yeah let me do the same

198
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,695
You're probably curious with this news is

199
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,815
Well Alex doesn't wait too long

200
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Can I get to the bombshells

201
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
I saw this yesterday

202
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
I was going to bed early I was

203
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,239
I'd only got 5 hours

204
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
Go to bed at 1 in the morning

205
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,847
6 in the morning

206
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
Rilke he went to DC to go beyond

207
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
Tim kulas podcast

208
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
What a great guy

209
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,087
I was energized Electric

210
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
Police documents

211
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Release documents

212
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Approach them

213
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
3 years ago

214
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,735
You want to release a chimera

215
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,295
Coronavirus described is covid-19

216
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
Freon

217
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
Vagina

218
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,071
Honestly

219
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
If that were true

220
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,471
That would make the Earth standstill right like there's no way other than to say that that

221
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Is definitely a bio-weapon

222
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,799
That's true I mean

223
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Sure

224
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:05,247
I don't think it's true that the world would stand still

225
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,903
Astro I think that would make a real standstill more than this probably here's the situation

226
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Reporting

227
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,719
DARPA didn't release any document

228
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:19,583
An alleged document was released by an internet-based investigative group called brass

229
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:24,191
Which stands for decentralized autonomous search team investigating covid-19

230
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
Rename document his only been

231
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
Confirmed by an anonymous former Trump

232
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
Official

233
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
Still

234
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
Kind of

235
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Like a little bit of cash

236
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
Confusion surrounding it

237
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:40,063
Jurassic is claimed that they got the documents from an anonymous source so it's really difficult for me to assess

238
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:45,695
All Robins but even assuming we can just assume that it's real

239
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,791
And what it is is it the grant proposal that said to have been made by Peter.

240
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
Through the ecohealth alliance

241
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
A project called

242
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Project diffuse

243
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,519
This isn't interesting stuff and it falls into pretty much similar territory as the last documents that we discussed

244
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
But it's not a smoker

245
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Gone in the way that Alex is reporting it

246
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:09,247
If you wanted to get a little bit out there with it you could use this to argue that the lab leak hypothesis is slightly more

247
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
More likely than it would appear to be before

248
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,855
Sure but what Alex is doing this misreporting

249
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,743
Also this is electrogram proposal that was rejected

250
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,095
So unless there's some kind of evidence that it was accepted by someone other than DARPA

251
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
I don't know what this illustrates

252
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
Doesn't show anything

253
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,591
So that means that Alex is in a type of movie you know the one where the person goes and they've got this

254
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:39,967
Proposal never do that

255
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
And then some random rich guy just walks up and he's like

256
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
You've got just the ideas we've been looking

257
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
Bright

258
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,463
I even looked at the article write-up on

259
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,863
Infowars and it is like they just quoted somebody as being like

260
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,263
Well let's see prove that I don't I don't know if you could just speculate these things

261
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
I think with wild about

262
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Is somehow

263
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
These these types of things

264
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,687
Keep coming out and they're being used

265
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,735
Is to smear the people who is

266
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
It seems like

267
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
If you look at these things

268
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,879
Saw the world as it was like 3 years ago and we're like

269
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:25,791
You know China's regions were there a lot of baths cause a lot of viruses maybe we should keep an eye on that like

270
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:32,959
It could not be more like these people were like hey we've correctly identified a problem and then we saw what happens when we

271
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
We don't listen to them

272
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
Absolute

273
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Repo we should be list

274
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,359
There are various

275
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
Parts of the world

276
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
China is such a

277
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
Huge country

278
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
That it also

279
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
It has

280
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,599
Has a lot of those places where there are

281
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,439
Russia's the same tooth they were there animal population

282
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
That aren't used to enter

283
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,767
Interacting with humans

284
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,583
As time the climate is changing

285
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Patterns

286
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
Is of interaction

287
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Archangel

288
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
And monitoring

289
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
What we should be worried about from those novel interactions is definitely something that is good the people are

290
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Research

291
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
I'm not exactly sure

292
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
You know what to what

293
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
To draw from this but I don't

294
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
I think this is

295
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
Nearly

296
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
As evil as I wasn't suggesting a lot of details

297
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
She's coming up with arches

298
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
Why

299
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,535
I'm confused as to why they called it covid-19 in there for

300
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,375
Proposed in 2018 for them to do

301
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Sketchy

302
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
To even darker like

303
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
And I like their evil right

304
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
But they thought this way

305
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Was too evil

306
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,479
They brought grants to DARPA saying we want to create nanotech

307
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
That delivers viruses

308
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,111
Go through human skin

309
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
So we can spray it on people

310
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
11

311
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,559
Barbara said this will endanger the humans of Earth

312
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
We will not do this

313
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Do you

314
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
This will endanger the humans over

315
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,967
According to Alex like DARPA has been on this like they did harp their create 5G to everybody

316
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,551
How do you put a no

317
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Decent

318
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
I have a little dick

319
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
Yeah

320
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
I don't

321
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,071
I know how Alex keeps his villain straight and I'm like

322
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,471
They're out of line the villain

323
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
Everybody

324
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
He's everybody's not sure of what they're

325
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Jobs are

326
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,223
The thing that got that gets me is like if you sent all of his villains down and just like

327
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,527
Clearly delineated response

328
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
Disabilities

329
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,087
SA

330
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
The devil

331
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
You could

332
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Rush it right

333
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,975
You got a lot of All-Stars working for it I would

334
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,047
Guess that since DARPA has been on these plans

335
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
Do you know

336
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,375
Call the population and what have you heard all this

337
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
I have to be working with a double right

338
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,495
So why is this to you over that way

339
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:24,479
Sono dangers the humans of Earth

340
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,343
Concerned with could have not showed up so this seems weird that they would say

341
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,927
I know this seems like a huge situation weather like

342
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Maybe we could do the

343
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
That looks so fun

344
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,047
So Alex is a nano virus

345
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Right

346
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
Nanotech in a virus

347
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
Is there something

348
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Do you know who else is

349
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Talking about that

350
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,823
General Flynn actually he hasn't actually said that publicly but like Alex's heard secondhand from

351
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
Publicly

352
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,343
And I agree with his horses

353
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,159
He said a month ago this is a synthetic

354
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Coronavirus

355
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,791
I want him out there he told him

356
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
Because

357
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,887
Synthetic Nano virus

358
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
Hollywood

359
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
Okay

360
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
Wait how to splint

361
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
I don't know

362
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
Was he at

363
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,431
Maybe this is change

364
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,319
Not what it was before

365
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
No

366
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Is a completely different

367
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Story

368
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:41,023
So I just like the idea of Alex being like you know who else is saying this plant well not publicly but somebody I know

369
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
Sure

370
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
Somebody I know right

371
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
Said that he told

372
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Medical doctor

373
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Very excited

374
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,823
It's rare that some of our media worlds

375
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Intersect

376
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
But

377
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
Before this episode

378
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,503
On the majority Report with Sam Cedar

379
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
They have done a segment

380
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
About Sam Harris

381
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,367
Paris had a podcast

382
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
That's where he was asked

383
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
Whether or not he would talk to

384
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,535
Bret Weinstein about covid and Ivermectin and all this and he said

385
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
No

386
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,375
And he gave an explanation for it part of the explanation was

387
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,447
I also wouldn't I wouldn't do an interview with him

388
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,543
In the same way I wouldn't do an interview with a 9-11 truther like Alex Jones

389
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:30,431
So Alex Jones's name is in the title of that video

390
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:36,063
Responding

391
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
Iran

392
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
YouTube

393
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,279
Eclipse lighter

394
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,119
The fake news about resigning at the a scientist

395
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,447
You heard the news about them voting against the booster shot

396
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
It's just not true it's fake

397
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,335
And we're not going to debate those fake scientist The Joe Rogan interview

398
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,991
Of course they did resign that you had scientists

399
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,671
Okay

400
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
They sit there

401
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,815
How many people are being force-fed the feeds

402
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
Sam Harris

403
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,703
Precious Bret Weinstein with Alex Jones

404
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
Comparison

405
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
The majority report

406
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
And they just go

407
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,711
It's not true nobody resigned it's all lies of Alex Jones

408
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,903
It's weird that you say your fake news and then use your name and all Alex Jones says they was on

409
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
So it's the

410
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
That's not at all

411
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
What happened

412
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:54,399
The waters on that was sad to see the intellectual dark web

413
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
Breaking up like this

414
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
They were there was there was such a

415
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,799
Good friends when they were also there these dangerous ideas that

416
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,639
They were on the edge

417
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,175
Way too dangerous

418
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,015
So yeah like I said

419
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Explaining

420
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
Podcast

421
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,647
That's a cheater and Emma vigeland are

422
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Discussing

423
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
Oh how he's not going

424
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,488
To talk to

425
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
Bret Weinstein now that he has a book out

426
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,144
He's going to go in this book to her he's not going to interview him about this

427
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,448
Of the irresponsibility of engaging with

428
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
Some of these ideas

429
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,288
So I would explain further wet to Alex's

430
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,128
Representing about this a clip but I'm just going to play a little clip from

431
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
From that will be able to see very

432
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
Clearly

433
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,040
The reason why they're stuck in a cemetery here is that it is just impossible

434
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
To debunk

435
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,136
Most things in real time

436
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
And

437
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
Even if

438
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,256
The point being made is in fact spurious

439
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,584
It won't seem spurious to 99% of

440
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
An audience

441
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
Sprite soda

442
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Person on me

443
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,216
Conspiracy theory side of things

444
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
Convey

445
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,824
What about the 14 CDC officials who resigned

446
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Last week

447
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
And wouldn't give reasons

448
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
When asked

449
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
What do you make of that

450
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Right now

451
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
There's probably nothing to be made of that

452
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
Right I didn't even hear about it

453
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
I just made that up

454
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
But

455
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
When delivered in the contacts

456
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
Activate quote debate

457
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
About these things

458
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
It was someone who

459
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,816
Whose whole angle is

460
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
There's conspiracy

461
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
Everywhere

462
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,936
It can seem like although you didn't know about that well

463
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,984
That's cool a problem you should look into that

464
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,312
What about the paper that just came out of Micronesia

465
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
It showed

466
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
Ivermectin

467
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
With 100% of fact

468
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
I didn't see that paper

469
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Out of Micronesia

470
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,552
Oh you didn't walk a to Z's really do your homework

471
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:53,440
So these are examples that he's using out of whole cloth of things that people might throw at you

472
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,768
Because we are part of the collective Saint Marys

473
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Who's talking about

474
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
It's so much easier

475
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
To just make a mess

476
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Clean it up

477
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
And you have a disadvantage

478
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
If you're somebody who's

479
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
Trying to clean up a mess

480
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,544
As opposed to Dee person who's throwing things around

481
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
He's not saying

482
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,688
But nobody resigned

483
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,992
Anything like that was a story that did happen

484
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,784
Right but he's making up

485
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,720
And you can't fact check that on the on the Fly absolutely reason why

486
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,256
Kind of counterproductive

487
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
22in Gables

488
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:35,936
I'm not a huge Sam Harris fan but I do think

489
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
Add nauseam

490
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,176
Yeah yeah it's why I would never really

491
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
Want to talk to any of these

492
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
But look

493
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
I know that

494
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
When we were going back in

495
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
Gametime

496
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
Maybe in 2009

497
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
Was imploring his audience

498
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
Can't stop trap

499
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
Absolutely

500
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,888
Run out into traffic scream into the car next

501
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
Do you

502
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,472
I believe you also then went on a rant about

503
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
What kind of cars he likes

504
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
Exitos like some

505
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,800
American Muscle

506
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
Creams similar territory now

507
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:23,040
Alright I'm asking Emory Westerner watching this live on September 22nd on this Wednesday run

508
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856

Biggest story of the 21st Century

514
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:50,944
I've never put five exclamation points up for a live show feedback I don't think

515
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,992
So two months ago Alex use Forex

Has he used 5

520
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:09,120
Maybe not I don't know I will admit that I stopped my research

521
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,936
You can't fact check everything

522
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:19,616
Oh god I've never used five! That's how much I mean this

523
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,432
I'm going to tell you this right now

524
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
2X

525
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
Exclamation points

526
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,272
Is the maximum you can use

527
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
Anything beyond that and you're just making

528
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
King of fools a

529
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:36,000
What there was a Greek quote I can only use two exclamation points in the entire

530
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,048
I already over their career

531
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,864
Probably fine advice terrible

532
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,448
We know that Alex Loves movies

533
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Fix their real

534
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
They are

535
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,592
It's about Terrebonne

536
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,944
James Bond women

537
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
Depopulate

538
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,528
China

539
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,856
United States just like every other James Bond movies dates

540
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,160
Which is based on real things that happen during the Cold War

541
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,464
Former OSS agent

542
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Plumbing

543
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,840
And what is what is

544
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,888
They're always right

545
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
Dabke Austin depopulate

546
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,776
What's really going on

547
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
They tell you what's that

548
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,640
This is this is just what they do they tell you in the Bond movies

549
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
I mean

550
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,456
How do you argue with somebody who

551
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
Who's like nada

552
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
What's what your what

553
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
What you're missing

554
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,064
Okay

555
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Is that

556
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
The Bond movies are what you

557
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
You should be research

558
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,208
Moonraker

559
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,048
The Man with the Golden Gun on Her Majesty's Secret Service you should

Sea From Russia with Love

561

I know that I'm not a

564
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,848
Aban scholarship

565
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,384
I don't know I don't know what your relationship

566
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
GIF is with Bond franchise

567
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,272
But how many books and do you think it was before Spectre was introduced

568
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,576
I want to say like

569
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:11,488
14 was 9 ball

570
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,792
It's a long jump to get there

571
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,352
Also we talked a little bit about Ian Fleming

572
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,400
Before the password I want to rehash

573
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
She too much but

574
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:24,032
Ian Fleming is revealing everything that's real through the three Bond movies

575
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,360
Does that mean chitty-chitty-bang-bang is real 100%

576
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,152
Okay absolutely

577
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Reverse address

578
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
That's alarming

579
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
So

580
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
We also have some other news.

581
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
It's not based on

582
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,136
Movies not based on

583
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,696
The world of creative fiction

584
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,768
Alex seems to be maybe

585
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
Making a slight pivot towards

586
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
Supporting China

587
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
Okay

588
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,496
But down for this because it is outrageous new rallying cry

589
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
Find

590
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:03,456
I'm not defending gg.com put their children

591
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,528
We're running the American agenda to destroy the family

592
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,600
The u.s. is run by poison leader quotes

593
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,440
We're against your new world order so they've broken with them

594
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,744
And we're breaking with them

595
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
Motorcycles

596
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,240
Because you know he was supposed to defeat

597
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
Buble

598
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
That was weird

599
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
So I guess China who is

600
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Is the greatest

601
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,408
Partner of the New World Order and the devil

602
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,248
He's now breaking with the New World Order and Alex's

603
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:41,856
List of congratulatory things are we're having children we're arresting of a sex

604
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672
Why was that Angie's List

605
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,000
I mean well I think if you wants to be very obvious reason

606
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,072
I'm not saying I want to arrest Havasu

607
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,376
Sexual what I'm saying is I want

608
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
The government

609
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,448
To walk into everyone's homes

610
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
Double-checked

611
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,032
To make sure they're not homosexual and if

612
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
SO2 arrest

613
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,336
Those who are

614
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:06,176
I got to say he's been making slips like that a lot more regularly

615
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,224
Is Nazi a straight-up bananas

616
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,576
I mean they just all lost their minds they just have no f******

617
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,392
Complete untethered nonsense

618
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
From any direction

619
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
China

620
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,864
Today I lost the New World Order

621
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,008
The devil built the Great Wall

622
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,544
Just nothing just doesn't matter

623
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,640
Mulatto coverage is the Gabby Petit

624
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:43,040
Keto stories yes yeah I have personally not engaged too much with this because I do

625
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,112
Don't know what it is a missing person and a possible

626
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Murder

627
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,720
I don't know I don't really know entirely enough

628
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Is

629
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,536
I don't know

630
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
Nothing

631
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,144
It's sad someone.

632
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
And it feels like

633
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
True Crime fans

634
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,264
Can't get enough of a white woman not being around any

635
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:07,872
It's strange and assumed name pop-up of it but it's not it's not

636
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Flipping out

637
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
Do too much

638
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
You would expect

639
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,224
That based on Alex's

640
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,528
Entire career and everything about him

641
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,320
DB super into the story

642
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,648
Because of the way he's covered all sorts of

643
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
Total weight

644
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
Victims of

645
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
Nothing

646
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
Slugs

647
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,536
He goes the other direction entirely

648
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:31,424
Cheeto

649
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
Young white woman

650
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,752
The missing husband the mystery

651
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:39,360
They're spending about half the news time on fox singing in MSNBC

652
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:43,200
Not with the imploding border and tens of thousands more Haitian showing up

653
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,040
By not knowing what planet he's on

654
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,904
The clap

655
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Avakin

656
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,768
Fauci told the Pentagon and Arbor they were developing

657
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,096
Enteroviruses or synthetic

658
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,912
To purposely released covid-19

659
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
In the wild

660
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,312
Sure

661
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,640
Operation lockstep of the UN

662
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,992
No no no no

663
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,528
Fortune occupation

664
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,600
Globalist agenda here

665
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
Whole human world

666
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
Fascism

667
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,768
Using communism in race war for control that's not important

668
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,888
Don't you care about Gabby potato

669
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,704
What about the tens of thousands of children

670
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,616
See this is a story that is

671
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
About a young white woman

672
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,688
Girl missing

673
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,736
The media is covering it incest

674
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,296
That's why Alex can do this game

675
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,856
Now if this was a story that

676
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
Wasn't getting any track

677
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:59,488
Action he would say that the media is covering it up because she's white and you can't

678
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,280
You can't human eyes white

679
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Victims of things

680
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Systems against

681
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
White people

682
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:09,984
You can have your cake and eat it too you can take whatever angle you want on the story that makes you appositional

683
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
And somehow above the

684
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,544
Afraid but it's just

685
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
No

686
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
And it's

687
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,408
It's whining it's whining at look

688
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
Who Among Us has not stopped

689
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
And looked up at

690
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
The sky and thought

691
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,552
I wish someone loved me the way America

692
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,344
Culture loves it when a white woman goes away

693
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Who am I

694
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
I get it

695
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,280
But if you go on your Sony like why are people paying attention to my stories my stories

696
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,584
R5!

697
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,864
It's like okay you're a

698
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
Looks now confirmed

699
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
Sprayed with Nano viruses

700
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:46,336
If you want to stop if you want to see Jessica

701
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,408
They're going to continue

702
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
Kitchen

703
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,992
Jobs

704
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Kenosha

705
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
Protein in your body

706
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
Sure

707
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
There

708
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,584
Having us produce when they injected

709
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,400
How to say if this is all confirmed

710
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,960
It's an amazing amount of restraint

711
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
But Alex is showing

712
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:19,104
Believes a word of this

713
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
Bring It On

714
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:28,320
Breeze

715
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,904
I mean are we adding this into Chemtrails are we going with like

That like

718
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,376
God dammit

719
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:46,496
You have a room by poke at night with needles

720
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,800
But we all do we hire the Roomba

721
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Speak

722
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,360
I just think

723
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:57,504
The only thing you could possibly be advocating for if you believe this

724
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
Stop

725
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,064
He believed this narrative is

726
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
We need

727
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,648
Jurassic Revolution total total war

728
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,464
Yes the people who are behind this

729
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,048
The violence must be used against them they're Super Bowl

730
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:16,192
I mean it doesn't get more movie villain Justified Violence then

731
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
They're spraying

732
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,008
Play God you

733
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,592
Even like

734
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,640
Even though the

735
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:32,320
Cillian Murphy Academy water supply

736
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,880
Scare people

737
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,696
This is worse

738
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,256
Yes

739
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:47,936
I'm not calling for violence I don't want violence but you're going to get a John Brown moment with these levels to did all this and I don't want

740
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,544
Name out of your mouth

741
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:57,152
Football you get the horns those that live by the sword die by the sword

742
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
About

743
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
Myprotein

744
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,464
Plexiglass cage in Times Square

745
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:15,328
The federal government will administer a couple million of his own

746
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,912
Super virus is over a thousand times stronger than created for us

747
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,240
And then he can he can die miserable Delta suffocating

748
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
How about that

749
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
Imagine passing that law

750
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,688
Imagine how shity that would be

751
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
Debate session

752
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,528
We're going to hold 72 hours to debate

753
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,344
Yes yes we're going to take

754
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,416
How about we don't kill everybody is that cool

755
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:45,024
Nonono how about we now legalize

756
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
A very limited

757
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
Scale

758
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,888
Public School

759
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
Torture effects

760
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Execution

761
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Of a duck

762
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,496
Yeah yeah yeah

763
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
I think that debate would be

764
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
Brought

765
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,152
I can't imagine Ron Paul being on board with that

766
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
States map meme I'm going to have

767
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,576
To go with he would love that s***

768
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
Beyond the state level this could be a federal law

769
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
Torturing people to death

770
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,560
Obviously

771
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,840
F****** comic book

772
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:24,192
Anyway Alex

773
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
Advance recalled North

774
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
He actually believes

775
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:34,688
That his yelling on the radio is responsible for this grant proposal

776
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
Being released

777
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,576
I'm about to go to everybody I said

778
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,136
If you don't release this

779
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
And you're part of it

780
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,232
You really believe in a breakaway group

781
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Curiosity population plan

782
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,608
I said I want to see the documents

783
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,704
If you got on them on plan

784
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,360
Authorized to do it if he's a pentagon wasn't behind this

785
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,920
Cuz that's where all the news with moving

786
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
Yeah man

787
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:12,064
He just gets on air start to talkingshit and then people leak

788
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,464
Document know and I hears what it hears what he doesn't know that what's that is that I was one step ahead of a

789
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
The Pentagon in advance

790
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
And I told them

791
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,584
That if they don't really speak

792
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,352
Documents

793
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,936
To make Alex look like a s*** head and I will release

794
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
Real documents

795
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,032
That reveal that they haven't revealed

796
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,080
The real documents yet

797
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,408
It all makes sense

798
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
Everybody's

799
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
Goodnight. Covid

800
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:46,368
No weapon

801
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,416
This is conspiracy at this point is

802
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
Is just

803
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,720
You just got it

804
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,512
Got a Buckle in

805
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:59,680
Pretend it all makes a Miss whenever it was just George Bush 9/11 Inside Job

806
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
That was simple

807
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
Damn you did it

808
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,264
Yeah we got it man

809
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
Sure

810
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,872
Now it's got to be the devil

811
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,968
Sure they have a cure

812
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,272
And only some people are going to

813
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,344
This cure Perry few very few

814
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,208
I would call this kind of like it's not an incitement to violence definitely

815
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
But at

816
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Enabling of it

817
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,608
They're only giving a very small group of people

818
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
Believe me

819
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,056
Because backseat phone

820
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
Might have colored again all this

821
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,560
You continue on.

822
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
I'm going to call my mom

823
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,704
Well if you have the total proof

824
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
A rest

825
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
Doesn't happen

826
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,312
Because it's not going to because you don't have the

827
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
The total proof

828
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,920
Then I guess the only answer is you have a responsibility to stop these people right

829
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,224
Motor that's not responsible message

830
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
To be putting out

831
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Do

832
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
Whatever audio

833
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Okay

834
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
Here's my pet

835
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
Here's my pitch

836
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Dog we need to get

837
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,232
One of these Alex Jones hose okay

838
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,024
How much does Tucker Carlson

839
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,608
Can we buy him for like a million

840
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,424
I feel like he's cheaper than you might expect

841
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,240
I feel like he's like 100k and he'll say whatever you want

842
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Like I feel like

843
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
But

844
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,104
I think I think you would respond more to

845
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Same

846
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:48,736
Assertive trying to get a little bit of attention by proxy

847
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,552
Alright

848
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,088
But what we do is

849
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,368
We have him

850
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,416
Go on one of his shows and say

851
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,208
You know hold up a fake b*******.

852
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,072
And save now the vaccine is the cure that the elites already

853
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
You had

854
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
Right

855
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,936
And then the mainstream media is going to look into it they're like no it's

856
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
The same exact thing

857
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,264
But because the mainstream media debunk

858
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,056
The fake bulshit

859
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
That's going to make the

860
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
Conservative Luna

861
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,920
It's even more the actual cure

862
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,480
So we'll finally have everybody vaccinated

863
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
Yeah

864
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
I looked in a story I like what your

865
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,112
What you're bringing to me but in the real world

866
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
It still is like

867
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:32,256
Really being manipulative about people's informed consent

868
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,560
I don't disagree

869
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,608
I'm glad

870
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:40,448
Definitely based on what you're saying I'm glad that it's not our responsibility to

871
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,728
Problem because I think that

872
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
That idea

873
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:48,896
Probably backfire at some point solutions to things everybody always wants to be like oh let's do the smart thing

874
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,456
Let's do the weird clever thing that always

875
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
Okay

876
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,808
Alex's decided

877
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,344
But everyone's

878
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
Shark world world

879
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
Naturalistic globalist

880
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,488
Swim but keep going

881
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,792
I mean once we were given life we were in

882
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,072
That is true

883
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,656
There are about 1,000 people who will survive

884
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
They have a robot

885
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
Mycroft

886
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,136
One shot to stop them

887
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,952
They're probably going to release the bio-weapon anyways

888
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304
I'm not going to sit here

889
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Worried

890
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
We're dead already

891
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,984
I'm dead already but we stopped this

892
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,568
Start easy Star Trek Wrath of Khan analogy

893
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,663
Because he's dead already

894
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,199
I'm dead already

895
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,783
Your dad your you and your family are dead

896
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,367
You and your family are dead you're dead unless you stop

897
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,975
Letting them kill everybody

898
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,047
I care about my children lot more myself about

899
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
That's more than them

900
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,447
I'm all in baby

901
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
100%

902
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
That's what I'm supposed to be

903
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,079
This is not done out of glass

904
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,759
Is it adult to go into that reactor

905
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
And maybe we live

906
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,599
Call icing on the cake

907
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
But it doesn't matter

908
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,487
We got to get in there and turn this around or everybody's gone

909
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,871
Leave you alone

910
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,015
Sure maybe 1,000 people are getting a ticket out of this

911
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,551
Weatherall building big bunker

912
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:12,511
Already moved in private island with 50 ft walls I don't even trust their security

913
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,839
I can assure you it's raining here

914
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,423
Security compound

915
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,751
That's why they're going into robot guns and everything

916
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,799
That's why they're going into robot John's

917
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,127
Why does every time he tells me about the

918
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,151
The future it feels like a

919
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
Pitch meeting

920
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Okay

921
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,503
And then and then what's your resolution

922
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:38,111
Erick Khan

923
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,903
It does seem like he's

924
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,719
Again it's just a heating moving

925
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:49,119
Trying to run on the surface of the water and then what

926
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
Like a peach thing

927
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,215
I totally totally you're hungover your

928
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,007
Pitching and you don't have

929
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,407
Yeah probably like not totally unfair

930
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,943
Hearing a reading of that is

931
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,247
Encouragement towards suicide bomber

932
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,575
No I mean it doesn't get much more

933
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:14,975
That's weird there's icing it's the icing on the cake you have to take them out

934
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:21,887
Every every every time they go back in like the Legos fighting for so they were the most fearsome but it was

935
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,423
Because they had the same thought of

936
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,215
They're already dead so they just

937
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,263
Through their f****** yeah yeah

938
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,335
And I was thinking that and then I made it even the more

939
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
Explicit

940
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,247
Rockhurst

941
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,111
Robots

942
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:49,279
Remote control robots Ki gun ports

943
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,351
Tear gas systems everything else but that's not

944
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,167
Stop people on a suicide mission

945
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,471
Sparkles

946
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,543
It's on

947
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,591
You know the world folks this is it

948
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,127
Unless we stop them

949
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
End of the world

950
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
How much we stopping

951
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,503
It's the end of the world

952
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
Encouraging

953
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:16,415
Robot guard sure that's fine but what about people on a suicide mission

954
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
This is this is so f***** up

955
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:27,935
Yeah and it's such a good I wonder I wonder I really do wonder if Joe Rogan would like to help enlist this suicide

956
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,983
Dive bomber army that Alex's

957
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,263
You trying to inspire

958
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:37,663
I mean he's got the numbers for it do you get the numbers high enough sooner or later I'm going to find a

959
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:41,247
Sidebar in their rights

960
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,319
Brogan thinks his cool Ivan Joe Rogan

961
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
Explicitly sign off

962
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,135
On suicide bombing

963
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,695
Wow as well as arresting

964
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
Slough meaning

965
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,487
Certainly

966
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,511
Tacitly supported

967
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,279
The person who is

968
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:57,375
Absolutely

969
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,935
The problem is he doesn't know you know

970
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,543
I mean the thing about his

971
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,591
Description that way such that

972
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,359
Perfect

973
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,639
Distillation of what

974
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,919
Elite Panic is

975
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
That like

976
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
Cuz

977
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,527
If you go through every major disaster

978
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
Everybody

979
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
Bands together

980
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,927
They're like to work together to get through this situation

981
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,999
It's only the elites do the rich

982
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,791
People is only that were always like

983
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:30,399
Well obviously it's going to be cannibalism in 10 days so I need to grab all of my s*** and get away from these

984
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,167
Monsters

985
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,959
Surrounding me

986
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:36,799
Plays out over and over and over again and it's not

987
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,359
It's not a mentality that actually people really

988
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:44,223
Succumb to a very small percentage of people

989
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:50,623
Yeah yeah but he's almost universally like listen the only way we're going to get through this is if we work together

990
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,463
Ditto

991
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
Can't

992
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,255
Like

993
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:01,119
Regular people for the most part can't see someone hurting and not want

994
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,703
Especially in an emergency

995
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
Or a disaster

996
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
I don't know

997
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:11,871
I don't have nearly as dark view of humanity is Alex seems to

998
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,151
And yet he seems to

999
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,711
Pretend that you love Humanity to a mug

1000
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,015
Anyways the end of the world

1001
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,087
Give me the world folks this is it

1002
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
Unless we stop

1003
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,647
Animal world

1004
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,279
The design control collapse of planet Earth

1005
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,191
Why

1006
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
Why

1007
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,335
That's dumb

1008
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,271
There's a meteor heading for earth that will destroy it and other news these prices go down

1009
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
What

1010
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:58,207
The demise of all of us has Eminence please do not hug your children

1011
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,279
There are some ads for tied to come and go

1012
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:05,631
The switch has been flipped to destroy life on Earth

1013
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,191
The humans of Earth are screwed

1014
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,751
Current news coming up other news

1015
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,383
Is York

1016
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,199
Thinking about you it's

1017
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
It's weird

1018
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,271
It's weird to do that

1019
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,391
It makes me think you don't need it

1020
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:33,791
I think if there's more news after the end of He-Man

1021
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
You might not believe in the end of you

1022
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:41,215
It's going down

1023
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,495
The buffet

1024
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,263
Is

1025
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,287
Good

1026
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:47,103
So I'll explain this is really this is

1027
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,895
This really fascinated me because it's

1028
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,199
It's just such a good clear-cut example

1029
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,735
Alex setting up a clip

1030
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,783
It not saying what he says it says

1031
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,343
And then him barreling forward as if it's

1032
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,927
Let's go in here fauci talking about his primary target

1033
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,719
Is the young people

1034
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,839
Viruses that cause blood clots for life

1035
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:15,775
Infecting a baby or a teenager or a five-year-old

1036
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,103
We'll just killing whole person I want to keep from getting your pension fund

1037
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,407
Sure is the children

1038
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:25,759
Here is the mass murder and criminal that launched HIV covered up the cures for it

1039
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,783
Treatment

1040
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,719
Here is the sickle what it mean

1041
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,559
Grim Reaper garden gnome

1042
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,631
Himself sing primary target your children here it is

1043
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:47,519
Can you keep hearing from officials and administration yourself another said that you're confident

1044
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Stanford

1045
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,919
Can you say with some level of confidence that you think there will be

1046
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
Available

1047
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,479
Halloween

1048
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,839
Is that what it is

1049
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,911
I think that the really good chance it will be before Halloween

1050
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,495
You're pretty confident

1051
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:25,919
Pretty confident I I believe it's a reasonably good chance that it will do

1052
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,223
Primary target for children

1053
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,783
What

1054
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
Did you get that

1055
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
I didn't

1056
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,903
Is there someone asking him if these shots

1057
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,719
Sir potentially going to be ready by Halloween

1058
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,511
And I'm saying

1059
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
Probably put

1060
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,351
It depends on what you mean by relatively certain

1061
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,191
Primary target is the children

1062
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,239
Like that what you got

1063
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,543
I told Alex got from that yet

1064
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,103
He made it up

1065
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,127
Oh that would make

1066
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,063
It was more fun for him to report then Patxi's headshots may be ready by Paula.

1067
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:09,439
Also if traffic is listening to this that is how I want to be brought up on stage from now on

1068
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,279
Who created the releaser of HIV

1069
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,839
Who's Joseph Mengele of our times

1070
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:21,215
I bet that devil that ladies and gentlemen

1071
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,239
Jordan Holmes

1072
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,823
I love you can also see him at colleges

1073
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,919
He's a regular

1074
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,943
So you know

1075
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,551
Be the moment where Alex is like this is the end of the world and will get back with other news

1076
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
That's

1077
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,343
Silly

1078
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,647
This is all so silly and pretty much the same way

1079
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,487
And we all stand up now if we supposed to store going to back off

1080
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,583
Order to release the new bio-weapon but at least we won't know what hit him

1081
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
So

1082
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,471
If we stand up now they'll back down or they'll kill everyone

1083
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
One of the

1084
00:51:54,495 --> 00:52:00,383
And then we'll really sad and then we'll really get

1085
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
90% global.

1086
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,991
Depopulation but after that I'm coming for you

1087
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:06,783
Absolutely

1088
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
Bizarre

1089
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,623
So

1090
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
And

1091
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,975
He is a guy who started my free.

1092
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,767
After I think is the name of it we can

1093
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,791
Telemedicine

1094
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,071
Who's basically

1095
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,351
Believe away 2

1096
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,143
To give people Ivermectin

1097
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:22,911
Prescription

1098
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,679
Sure sure

1099
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,495
Okay and he's on and he believed

1100
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,311
If the property is literally responsible for every covid death

1101
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,871
That sounds right

1102
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:36,223
Population

1103
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,575
Truskin penetrating nanoparticles

1104
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
Close quote I mean this is

1105
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,391
Everything we

1106
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,695
Confirm

1107
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,743
The Pentagon Declassified with

1108
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,559
He was approached by fauci a dancing for Bill Gates

1109
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:04,895
I call him doctor death

1110
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:11,039
We paid for it to be created and as you just

1111
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,343
Have released the information today

1112
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
They

1113
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,391
Released it on purpose

1114
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:20,255
Yeah I don't I don't know I don't know how much I dig this doc

1115
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
Even if it

1116
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Use me for it

That's also

1119
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:28,959
Not very clever

1120
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,751
Weird clever solution

1121
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,799
He also has something

1122
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,615
But maybe there's a little more clever move his little more up your alley

1123
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,919
He refuses to call it a vaccine

1124
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,223
He calls it a lethal injection

1125
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,039
I'm done so incessantly

1126
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:47,391
About what you've seen in the last 20 months since this all started or 21 months

1127
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Where you thinking

1128
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,999
You witnessed

1129
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,791
I would say this

1130
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,583
We've seen lots of

1131
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,143
Death and misery and bad side effects

1132
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,423
From the lethal injection

1133
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:06,847
The big picture problem is there in population gold

1134
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
Nice

1135
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:12,223
They're entitled

1136
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:18,623
On the planet right now so that means

1137
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:21,183
Directions that means

1138
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:25,023
So this is kind of why I think this information is coming out now they're almost

1139
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,815
Almost complete

1140
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,887
They're getting ready

1141
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:33,215
He believes that it's a lethal injection that everybody

1142
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,495
The next clip I'm just

1143
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:41,151
I got to spoil you think that everyone who's got the vaccines going to be dead in a few years

1144
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
Depopulation

1145
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,479
Sumdog

1146
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,271
Look here's my question

1147
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,039
Haha

1148
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,575
Is it a Pawn on

1149
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:51,135
The gates of the cemetery I think so

1150
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,671
Cuz I think Bill Cemetery

1151
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
Yeah but

1152
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,231
Big Bill Gates of Hell is probably

1153
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
That would be waived

1154
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279
I think it might be

1155
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,351
It's a little clearer could cemeteries that you know you don't really think of

1156
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,631
Gates

1157
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
Let me tell you some

1158
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,703
If we're going to start punching up one of

1159
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,727
This guy's pigs

1160
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,007
It's going to be a long night

1161
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,847
I gave up on the voucher one I don't even I don't even think that's worth saving

1162
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,175
Or does he say death.

1163
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,199
I don't know

1164
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,223
I think it's false

1165
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,759
Death.

1166
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,527
Get to Folsom

1167
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,575
Faucet is right there

1168
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:23,391
So you turn on the faucet outcomes death

1169
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Yeah

1170
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,207
No man that's better but it

1171
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,999
It still sucks

1172
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,279
But it is right there

1173
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,351
It is

1174
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,751
Problem is is 5 billion.

1175
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,799
Dolese injections tomorrow

1176
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,847
Luke

1177
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:50,783
Montagne he's a Nobel Prize winner he believes that everybody who's had the lethal injection will be dead in two to three years

1178
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,951
I agree with that position from

1179
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:01,791
The many thousands of Articles I've read on the subject in the past year-and-a-half

1180
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:07,679
I agree that these are Lethal Injections if your design the lethal injection

1181
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:11,519
Hours days weeks months or years that be too obvious

1182
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
Very well said

1183
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:25,087
You're not a doctor if you just feel like they can design a thing to kill you whenever they wanted

1184
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,367
Concerned

1185
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:31,487
Months from now they got a vaccine for that scene for it

1186
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,255
Three months

1187
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:38,655
They haven't figured that one out yet one year absolutely concerned about somebody who's a doctor

1188
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,239
Sort of like this this relation

1189
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,519
The complexity of humor

1190
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:51,199
I just put it in there

1191
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:55,807
I would encourage this guy to look into some of the stories of

1192
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,831
Execution

1193
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,391
By lethal injection

1194
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:07,071
Hundred percent of the time by the book by the book kill people at exactly

1195
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:07,839
The time you want the

1196
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,375
Yeah

1197
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,447
He's calling this lethal injection

1198
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:15,519
He kind of f**** up your so-called vaccines

1199
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,247
Are the Lidl in Philly to injection

1200
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,927
The things people need to be aware of

1201
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,975
Especially

1202
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:37,279
Everybody should treat people who've been

1203
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,095
You've had the lethal injection as if they have Act

1204
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,167
Especially head cases of

1205
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,703
Pregnant women

1206
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:48,799
Pregnant woman that was around somebody who Justin recently vaccinated lost her baby

1207
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,103
Don't think I might be a coincidence

1208
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:53,919
I'm a doctor

1209
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:57,503
And if there's one thing that medical school has taught me

1210
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:03,903
There are no coincidences that he's passing off as somehow proving

1211
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,951
Vaccinated are dangerous

1212
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,535
Proved it

1213
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
Someone

1214
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,607
Got a vaccine nearby

1215
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:17,727
And then sprayed in all directions

1216
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:22,335
Like an anime shooting lasers all over the place and then that woman's baby

1217
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,175
Well can't argue with that

1218
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,199
That sounds right

1219
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,991
I think he's saying.

1220
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
Yeah I think so too

1221
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,599
When is the only reason that I think that is cuz

1222
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,391
He gets into talking about how he believes

1223
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,183
Like all of the science

1224
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,975
What's going on with covid inside

1225
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,767
That's false escience

1226
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,047
School

1227
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
This guy

1228
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:49,215
Is not TV ready

1229
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:59,455
There's one study that give them results that'll make them mine that's the study they published but they bury the nine studies dead

1230
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:03,807
That won't make them money

1231
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,367
Promoting false doctors

1232
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,951
Yeah we got

1233
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,231
They have in the hospitals

1234
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,143
Where they're often the patient

1235
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,423
Jesus

1236
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,287
That absolutely If he if he's actually a doctor that should

1237
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,127
You should go to any medical board anywhere play that and be like

1238
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:34,015
Obviously this guy can't be a doctor right and they be like total discipline a reaction

1239
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,807
Yeah

1240
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:42,207
Alex tries to do the like while you work at the hospital so you know Hospital

1241
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:47,071
All that I am working out been essentially told me I should get it

1242
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,679
But he's just doing live streams

1243
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,703
Prescribing the Micromax

1244
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,751
Great is his

1245
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,775
Is clinical approaches

1246
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,543
This point wow

1247
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,103
Yeah also I would say that if the

1248
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,687
Hallmark of the faulty science is taking the one Cherry Picked

1249
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,991
Study that you like and ignoring all the others

1250
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,271
Looking with Alex.

1251
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,575
Snow

1252
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:13,183
Holyshit frequently will just keep using

1253
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,463
Even after it's been

1254
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,559
Retracted sure but that's the only retracted because they don't want you to know

1255
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:19,583
That's true

1256
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,351
That's true

1257
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,375
Faulty

1258
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
Sunnyway

1259
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,447
What is terrible

1260
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
I like your

1261
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,263
I'd like to apologize in advance

1262
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,311
Do the nurses and doctors of America

1263
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,079
Who may be listening

1264
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,103
For what

1265
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,383
This guy's about to say

1266
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:41,855
They have all your videos

1267
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:48,511
Think about it is so many healthcare workers doctors that are

1268
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:53,375
Speak up because they might lose her job but we're just following orders well that's what the Nazi Soldier said

1269
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,143
Holyshit

1270
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,679
And that's just disrespect

1271
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,215
Wow

1272
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:57,983
Wow

1273
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,519
I guess you

1274
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
I mean

1275
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:01,823
Man

1276
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,199
You if he breaks his leg

1277
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,991
Just got to you got to suck it up

1278
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:13,343
If you break your legs you have one leg from now on

1279
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,671
No one's helping you out there to make a splint

1280
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,719
You better go into the woods

1281
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,023
Bark down

1282
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:26,143
Foxbody actually I just read this new study produced by dr. Bret

1283
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,191
That's shows

1284
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,727
That you know they're putting a

1285
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,519
Cast on a broken leg

1286
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,311
Work sometimes

1287
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,591
Will work more

1288
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,615
Is ivory

1289
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,663
And

1290
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,199
I mean I don't know what

1291
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:39,967
To say but

1292
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
This is

1293
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
Is becoming a pattern

1294
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,111
Crossmember mactan with me

1295
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:50,463
Very safe

1296
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,767
Denali

1297
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:55,839
And you so I'm going to go ahead and take them right now

1298
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,887
Yeah but he takes his Ivermectin on air

1299
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,655
Which

1300
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:02,239
Just now at least the second time this has happened on out today probably more

1301
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,311
Have you consider like I bet I bet Daddy's made Harrison

1302
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,103
Takes a it doesn't

1303
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,895
Where's a good say no

1304
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:11,455
Swear to God we live in such a dumb

1305
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,223
Timeline

1306
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,807
That three or four years from now we're going to find out that

1307
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:20,415
You take too much Ivermectin in a short. Of time you're going to die

1308
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:25,023
I meant all of these people are going to be like I am going to kill you three or four years

1309
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,303
And then they're dead

1310
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,351
And I don't even get to say I told you so

1311
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:33,727
I don't I don't know about any predictions like that cuz it is highly possible that there will be limited effect

1312
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,775
But anybody actually sees but

1313
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:39,871
You don't know that he's just stupid we live in a dump time

1314
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,431
I'm not saying it's going to happen

1315
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,967
Predicting it I'm just saying that

1316
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:48,575
Everything that's happened up to this point believe that dumbness is everywhere

1317
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:52,415
I am a nice somebody who's in this line of work I agree

1318
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,487
Jordan I would say that some of this sucks

1319
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:58,303
This is a stupid episode where Alex has 5X

1320
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,119
! bombshell stories that are black

1321
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,911
CB2

1322
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:08,543
Inside people toward suicide bombings

1323
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,359
A bit out there

1324
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,431
Now it's time for some good clean fun

1325
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,479
That's what this wave will provide

1326
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:22,623
You are gracious enough to stay in Austin and we really appreciate you and I do you

1327
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,903
Baker Hotel see you tonight

1328
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,351
Favorite places in Florida

1329
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,751
I have not been there

1330
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,079
Network where's that at

1331
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,599
Feel like you are

1332
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,671
Love it

1333
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,743
Do you realize

1334
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:03,327
Earlier on in the show you said

1335
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,631
That everyone was dead already dead

1336
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,447
That guy just said that in three years

1337
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,471
Five Below

1338
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,775
5 billion people will be dead

1339
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:15,359
Haha and you are going to tell me that it's fine.

1340
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:18,687
Love that are in Florida

1341
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:23,295
DeLeon was a true search for

1342
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:27,135
Of course this is a tourist attraction in Florida

1343
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,463
Remember Luella day McConnell

1344
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:36,351
Did not believe that it's actual sound of you get the f*** out of here

1345
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:41,215
Stop it don't sound like you thought it would be

1346
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,775
To open to the early 1900s

1347
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:47,871
She made up a bunch of stories about it in order to attract customers that I guess Alex has fallen

1348
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:52,479
2 Louella was a doctor in Chicago before heading out having succumbed to what

1349
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,015
Described as Gold Rush fever

1350
01:04:54,783 --> 01:05:00,159
You going to strike it rich but you failed to do so and then ended up settling in St Augustine Florida where she quote

1351
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:05,023
Became convinced that a well outside your front door for Malia spring was the Fountain of Youth

1352
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,863
He started promoting the well when charging people in nickel to drink out of it

1353
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:12,703
Hazard profile grew she started making all kinds of outrageous claims like

1354
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,471
She was a descend

1355
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:17,823
Napoleon had his pocket watch to our hand that when Jesus returned it would be at

1356
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,103
Fountain of Youth

1357
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,663
Is this dude related

1358
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,991
Alex

1359
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:29,855
She died in 1927 when she drove into a ditch

1360
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:34,719
Continue to operate by pretending that it wasn't just a well that someone made a bunch of bulshit stories up about

1361
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,511
Alex is really smart

1362
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:40,095
It really he's really good at sussing out details of pigs

1363
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,119
You know it does

1364
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:41,887
Seem like there's

1365
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,703
Like there's a suite that there's that moment

1366
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:49,055
Where your b******* just goes into Legend and then it becomes true somehow

1367
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,639
Didn't like what this story like

1368
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,711
She just stuck it out for just long enough

1369
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,527
That people were just like yeah it's probably

1370
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:03,135
Play true now that she died and someone else like took over

1371
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,695
Kind of like now you don't have to answer any question

1372
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:11,071
It is like she did all our did was trying to find

1373
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,887
It's just amazing I cannot believe the

1374
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:16,447
Little things that you find of Alex's like

1375
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,239
The things that

1376
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,799
The Lord that is real to him is

1377
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,079
It's fascinating.

1378
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,895
Any couldn't pronounce

1379
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,455
And forgot pump

1380
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:33,599
This is like somebody thinking that the world's largest Walnut

1381
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:39,999
Is actually the world's largest ball not the world's largest ceramic

1382
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,023
The largest nut

1383
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,047
Also

1384
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,839
That giant ball of yarn

1385
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,887
100% yarn

1386
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,655
It's just

1387
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:50,751
Trying to get you to pull over

1388
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,775
It is the world

1389
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:57,151
Look if you drive by the world's largest Walnut without stopping its via Gates you've missed

1390
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:57,919
The worlds large

1391
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,783
I did stop at the world's largest Walnut

1392
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,063
Second

1393
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,087
If you didn't want to miss it

1394
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:11,743
It's only it's only one if you know what it is a game is that could be a really fun thing to do

1395
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,023
Do you want a long-term

1396
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
But

1397
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,863
Alex believe in

1398
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,143
That's not good

1399
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:29,407
It is nice that he clarified that far

1400
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,479
Silence starts the next segment with a ad

1401
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,271
You go straight from this ad

1402
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,807
Into talking with the good doctor

1403
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,343
About how

1404
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,903
Satan B BMX

1405
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,207
Satan's in the mix

1406
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,743
It is back in stock

1407
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,767
They also have

1408
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,071
Vitamin B12

1409
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,607
Infowarsstore.com

1410
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,911
30% off those sales

1411
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
And

1412
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,959
On Monday

1413
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:07,295
It is a human what you're saying he looks like

1414
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,087
Under a microscope

1415
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,415
And I know this is all very occultic a bunch of them

1416
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,791
60 60 60

1417
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,559
Oh boy

1418
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,375
I didn't I didn't expect that this was the direction we were going

1419
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,655
Well I guess I should have

1420
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:26,239
Yeah well your your weight looks good

1421
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,263
Your blood pressure is looking

1422
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,287
Great

1423
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:31,871
Unfortunately I did look at your DNA

1424
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,687
Oh no

1425
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:39,551
Let me show you this is your 20 30 know the one that's the one that says 666 on it

1426
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,831
It's not the market

1427
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:45,695
The doctors

1428
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:52,607
So I'm not saying

1429
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:56,703
Renee Lethal Injections a firmly Mark your DNA forever

1430
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,519
That your god-given DNA is altered

1431
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,615
And they're saying you haven't happened to leave your house or buy or sell it is the mark of the beast

1432
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,735
And where are the churches on this

1433
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:14,367
Well that's the scary thing about it most of the churches are all like Covino do your pardon

1434
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,671
I'm going to need a second opinion and hold on

1435
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,631
I can't believe how normalized it is for us

1436
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:29,215
To be listening to someone who present themselves are the doctor talking

1437
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,495
Sing about the devil

1438
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:35,103
No I mean I don't trust totally unacceptable

1439
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,991
I I do love how in

1440
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,295
Consistent all of these people are though

1441
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
Unlike

1442
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,367
I mean I know it's Satan

1443
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,903
He's playing because that's what I would

1444
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,695
You know like

1445
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:55,327
If I were coming up with what was thinking of it never occurs to them

1446
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,351
That maybe

1447
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,143
Baby

1448
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,727
Satan's operating on a higher level.

1449
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,799
Yeah I think that all these people are bad devils

1450
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:08,383
They're really shity at it and they assumed

1451
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,687
Subway

1452
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,247
Involves another thing that's one of my favorite Hallmark

1453
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,527
Of these weirdos

1454
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,575
And that is the every single thing

1455
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,343
Goes wrong

1456
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,391
Possibly isn't Elizabeth political attack

1457
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
Of course

1458
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:26,047
For the past six months we've been working with a developer pay to many thousands of dollars at 2

1459
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:28,863
To develop our own server zandona happen

1460
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:35,263
He was supposed to deliver that on August 1st and he backed it up to September 15th and then lo and behold a few days

1461
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,079
And

1462
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:44,479
Just took our money and said he's not going to left us we learned

1463
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,807
All your money

1464
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,343
That's why we

1465
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,367
Christian Developers

1466
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,135
Yeah

1467
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:56,767
You hired a bad developer for your website and Secret

1468
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,351
Does Scott that's what the left

1469
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,375
Can't it

1470
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:05,727
It's just it's just a child who never grew up

1471
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,519
Figure who never figured out the boogeyman was

1472
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,847
How could you be having that conversation and not laugh at Alex

1473
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,127
Like it's it's

1474
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:12,895
Silly

1475
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:16,479
It's just like the left to not develop your servers

1476
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,551
I hate the lyrics

1477
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,111
Squarespace

1478
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,927
This doctor he's putting

1479
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,719
Some of his energies into

1480
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,999
Productive

1481
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:35,935
I can't even take this

1482
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:43,615
I thought of a hypothetical cure that we need to develop which is basically tell me about it

1483
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,407
MRNA to alter your

1484
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:51,039
Not how I want to hear that

1485
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,111
Before they got to lethal injection we could theoretically

1486
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,415
Come up with an mRNA

1487
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,207
Product

1488
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:00,767
Restore your god-given Jeanette Cota

1489
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,583
The previous injection does that make sense

1490
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:07,423
Exactly use the very same technology to try to reverse

1491
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,703
Okay

1492
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:12,287
Oh my God it's almost like some sort of plot

1493
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,079
That someone would develop on f******

1494
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:14,847
Star Trek

1495
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:18,687
For some people this might require a time machine

1496
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:23,295
Because you need a tissue sample from before

1497
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:28,415
Don't worry about it no holes in this plan Satan needs my advice no holes

1498
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:32,511
That's what I would do here's what I would do develop a hypothetical vaccine

1499
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,559
And what this vaccine would do

1500
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,351
Is exactly what I would want it to

1501
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,935
And I will give you a nebulous way it might

1502
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,215
Yes

1503
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:44,031
Sound like magic

1504
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,359
I think that this is a silly conversation

1505
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:54,015
Like in the real world because he believes that the actual mRNA is bad

1506
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,295
Like he thinks

1507
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,087
They actually using that

1508
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,111
Technology

1509
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,391
Run somehow

1510
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,207
Toxic or dangerous to people

1511
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:05,791
Using it in the way that this guy is describing it should be

1512
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,071
Something he is completely again

1513
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,655
Because they are just using momentum to keep going and keep

1514
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
Pitching their ideas

1515
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:17,055
Yep sounds like a great idea.

1516
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:21,151
Alex has the doctor holdover in

1517
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:21,919
Into the 4th hour

1518
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,687
But

1519
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:25,247
You know that first little bit of the fourth hour

1520
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,039
Doesn't go out on the radio

1521
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,831
Gas stations that play their own little thing

1522
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,415
Keys has what they're going to do during that

1523
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:37,023
That was extremely powerful info substation don't care the first 5s for a comeback

1524
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,119
Eye doctor

1525
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,143
You know

1526
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:46,239
Medical doctor says Nicki Minaj's cousin

1527
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,031
Nicki Minaj

1528
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,639
Tomorrow

1529
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:57,759
Workshopping ideas for a clickbait titles for whatever

1530
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,551
So during the five minutes I'm going

1531
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,367
Go to try and get this doctor to say that Nicki Minaj's cousin

1532
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:08,767
Balls are huge he was more than willing to say that he was game

1533
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:12,095
They can inject you so your balls grow a little bit

1534
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:18,239
So they grow a lot of bit

1535
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:21,311
Is anything that I'm afraid of

1536
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,639
I would like a second opinion

1537
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,663
So Alex

1538
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,199
4/4 hour

1539
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,015
Interview he did

1540
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
With Tim pool

1541
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,551
Until I turned it off

1542
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,879
I think there are some people who wanted us

1543
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,647
Discover Alex

1544
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,439
Cuz he was just on Tim pool show

1545
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,207
And I

1546
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,999
Don't really want

1547
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:40,767
2

1548
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:45,375
I worry the temple is the kind of person

1549
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:49,727
Bike judging his internet Behavior

1550
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:54,079
Yeah and it seems like the attention economy is really what he's running

1551
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,895
I don't even want to be a part of it

1552
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:59,455
We're probably not going to

1553
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:05,855
To cover that maybe

1554
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:09,183
One last clip and I just wanted very funny

1555
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:09,951
Cuz before Alex

1556
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,719
Goes to his

1557
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,999
Simple interview today

1558
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,815
He wants to complain a little bit more about the majority rule work

1559
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:18,143
Well I noticed a video I was sent this morning

1560
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,959
Sam Harris

1561
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,263
Weinstein

1562
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,055
Alex Jones comparison

1563
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:28,127
The whole thing from

1564
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,151
Majority report

1565
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,015
MPR

1566
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:35,807
Cobra snake

1567
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,343
Voice to put you to sleep in

1568
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:40,159
Talk about science and how we don't debate

1569
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:40,927
8 people

1570
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:45,023
They're playing

1571
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:50,399
I think that if you want a Lobby that criticism it's a that's kind of fine he does

1572
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:53,471
Speak with a really measured tone and

1573
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:56,287
Kind of a soft voice but like Sara Lee monotone but not

1574
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:58,079
Anybody who's ever watches

1575
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:04,479
The majority report would never think that about Sam Cedar

1576
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,271
Yeah it's

1577
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,295
Now it. That's

1578
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,599
Ridiculous

1579
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
Listen I watch

1580
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,903
I watch the whole movie

1581
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,439
420 IG

1582
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,999
I know Saint Peter is not a quiet

1583
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,679
Especially when he get to going on like

1584
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:26,239
Medicare Lookout

1585
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:31,359
I think this is this is kind of fun

1586
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,663
But ultimately

1587
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,687
I just

1588
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,735
See this episode was being indicative of likes

1589
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,503
Some real Danger

1590
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,551
I feel better

1591
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,831
Danger when I hear it

1592
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,111
Yeah I don't like

1593
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:42,879
I don't like

1594
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:43,903
People

1595
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,975
Getting the idea that suicide bombing

1596
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:47,999
Spine

1597
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,047
Or it's within the conversation

1598
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,327
Well I mean yeah

1599
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,631
That we have this

1600
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,191
You know misreported DARPA contract

1601
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,215
It was rejected

1602
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,775
That is now being used as

1603
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,055
Complete evidence

1604
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:01,823
That there's

1605
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,895
Raying nanovirus is on people

1606
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,687
It's just

1607
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:07,967
It's just a mess

1608
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,783
I just don't know what to do I mean

1609
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,319
Well for one

1610
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,879
Every year

1611
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,671
If you are a medical doctor

1612
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:17,951
You should get

1613
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,743
A very simple questionnaire

1614
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,791
And if one of the answers is

1615
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:28,447
They can make a vaccine that kills yet any time of your life whatever they want you to their like hahaha

1616
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:31,263
You're not a doctor anymore if one of the questions is would you

1617
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:34,079
Consider going on Alex's show

1618
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,967
I also think

1619
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,991
That maybe

1620
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:46,367
Maybe it did a legal for a doctor to take a medication on air is an advertisement

1621
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:51,743
I think it is I think it would be if they are have a financial interest

1622
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:57,119
In the medication that could but I would say that it probably isn't illegal if they don't

1623
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:00,191
I would imagine that the irresponsible

1624
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,983
6 board would be like no we don't

1625
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,263
Think that's weird

1626
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,799
Smile upon it at the very least

1627
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:14,271
MRNA tissue sample cure for the vaccine

1628
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:16,063
Just take people

1629
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,135
Set the f****** Fountain of Youth no can't do it

1630
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,183
Can't do it

1631
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,719
Dan it's not actually

1632
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:23,999
It doesn't keep

1633
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:26,047
Keep you a lot Idaho. Stelly on found

1634
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,863
Don't tell Alex.

1635
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,423
Well anyway Jordan

1636
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,191
We have

1637
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,727
Dum604

1638
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,007
Hard to believe

1639
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:41,407
It's hard to believe yours to 601

1640
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,223
But until then Jordan we website

1641
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:50,879
Net worth of laundry or fighting that go to bed Jordan

1642
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:53,183
No I'm Leo MDX

1643
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,487
What the sex robots

1644
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,791
Holding

1645
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:02,911
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
