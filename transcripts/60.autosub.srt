00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:09,728
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:16,128
I'm Jordan we're couple dudes like to sit around drink novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,432
Which is one

4
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:25,600
Thank you

5
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,536
Your first words are

6
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,424
This might be very very fun or you might be curious

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,216
Wow you could introduce our beverage

8
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,520
Search for the day cuz this is your choice

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,592
Vanilla cream

10
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
How's that taste

11
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
You're based what is pretty good

12
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,064
Vanilla

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,856
Cake frosting but liquid

14
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,672
Okay now I think I know what the next

15
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,232
The next you know a lot about our

16
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,256
Alex

17
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,400
You don't know anything about witches

18
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,680
Is very exciting for me

19
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,496
Like like Jordan alluded to I told him

20
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,312
Before the show drinking a vanilla

21
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920
It's weird

22
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,528
Before the show I told Jordan that today we're going to do something a little bit different

23
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
Here's why

24
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,648
Pretty violent

25
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,208
In the current want to talk about that

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
It's kind of boring

27
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,792
And I also don't want to

28
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,144
Feed into a really even dissect to the CNN

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,912
Oops

30
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,264
The project obviously

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
Manipulative the edited

32
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
He's James O'Keefe Eli

33
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
Monster High

34
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,736
Discredited repeatedly in the past

35
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
Been sued

36
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
Repeatedly

37
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
Somebody that somehow people are still

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,024
The narratives that other people wish were true

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
Right but I mean

40
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
Come on

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,912
That brothers are Mercer fund

42
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Astro

43
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,496
Money gifts to make

44
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Let's make sure billionaires

45
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
Control our world

46
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:26,432
Recent video was about to Hooker

47
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
Okay here's here's the video

48
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
I've already I've already taken you off track

49
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,464
Freezer one is legitimately James O'Keefe outside

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
Zucker's house

51
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Microphone

52
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,144
And he's like

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Basically

54
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,216
Hooker

55
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
In a car

56
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
I meant O'Keefe's like what a coward

57
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,808
They reveal that they've been staking out in front of his house

58
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,856
To get his morning routine down

59
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,952
Are you stalking him basically

60
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
This is something that we should adopt

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
Don't f******

62
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
Don't f****** go to your congressman

63
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,192
Get 1000 10,000 people and just sit around outside there

64
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,288
Studio is

65
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,920
I mean it would be that hard we could employ the exact same tactics and running

66
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,248
That's true

67
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
Give us money I'll do it

68
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
Alright

69
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,768
The other thing is we're currently in the middle of an Alex Jones

70
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
Distraction

71
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
Which is

72
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Whenever

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,216
I don't know exactly what the there's no through-line exactly why he does

74
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
The things he does

75
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
Money

76
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,712
But every now and again something will pop up and it'll be

77
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
Look up

78
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
It's me it's the right sheet

79
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
To the charging bull

80
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
What group is about to smack Alex Jones

81
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208
But he's been lying about a bunch of stuff

82
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,768
And he gets the red tape out and distract

83
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
Cibola

84
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
This week

85
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
At the end of last week

86
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
He had Robert David's

87
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
Honor the go

88
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Who we've discussed in the past

89
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
When he came on

90
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,871
And was saying the Trump needs his own propaganda TV network

91
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,431
He was the guy who came on it was like

92
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
I need you to talk to for me

93
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,063
I have a list of suggestions he needs to read that

94
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,415
We talked about it

95
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,255
Beyond the one with the

96
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,583
No no it was Dennis Montgomery

97
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
Time for a little bit

98
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
Because he was

99
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
Basically saying that they need massive election

100
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Reform

101
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
In order to like

102
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
Liberals

103
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
In a democracy is a really bad idea

104
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,271
He came on the show the end of last week on Thursday

105
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
You dropped this nugget

106
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,791
Tell me just point out that pedophilia does not stop with sodomizing children

107
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:26,143
It goes straight into terrorizing them to Adrenalize their blood

108
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
And then murdering them

109
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
It also includes murdering them so that they can have their bone marrow harvested as well

110
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Body parts

111
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,431
Pedophilia is must be original

112
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,295
Yes yes it's an anti-aging singing

113
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,695
And way out but we actually believe that there is a call

114
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Only on Mars

115
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,047
Populated by children who were kidnapped

116
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
Space on a 20-year Rye

117
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,007
I saw the once they get tomorrow if they have no alternative but to be slaves

118
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,015
No idea

119
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
I mean

120
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
We see a bunch of

121
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,775
Original guys on the air and could you do I think you should be the truth

122
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,847
Channel in America he can't be he doesn't know how

123
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,943
But

124
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
They say ridiculous s***

125
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
Then everyone is like

126
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
Look at how ridiculous

127
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,767
Play me a clip of me saying that well

128
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,119
We played the clip you had a guy who you have focal said you respect

129
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
What is opinion

130
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
About

131
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
Hey man your response

132
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,591
There's machine wreckage on Mars

133
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,663
You're reinforcing it without actually saying you believe in it

134
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
Attract

135
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,015
It's all a trap for the media it's all a trap

136
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
For people who don't like Alex Jones

137
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
Non him for bars

138
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Yeah I've seen

139
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,487
This this one in particular on the on the Twitter

140
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
Yeah I saw that

141
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
And said no

142
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,911
The course that was that

143
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:40,543
Come on bro scientist walk up to a podium

144
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
Rubbers for hedges

145
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Come on

146
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
Why do I have

147
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,015
And the only real function that we get out of this

148
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,087
I think it's always funny when official organization

149
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,159
Below their status

150
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
Just shut up

151
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
I always think conceptually that's pretty funny right but it's

152
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,887
Putting out articles about it

153
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,727
By people not being really accurate and just making fun of him for it

154
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,823
The end result is the people are exposed Alex Jones

155
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,711
They if they watch that full clip they get to hear him talk about how terrible pedophilia is

156
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
I'm at Mike's at office

157
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,343
Files

158
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,159
There is a decent chance that people will end up

159
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
Listening to

160
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,815
He was just allowing free speech on his show

161
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
Come from falling for this

162
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
This bull trick

163
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Okay

164
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
It is always like what

165
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
Twitter the Twitter

166
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,687
Which is amazing how Alex

167
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
Can just keep

168
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,039
F****** showing up in the world every time

169
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,855
It seems like he's somewhere in the on the internet

170
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Like

171
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Are we helping

172
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,559
Are we

173
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,167
No just making it more likely for it cuz

174
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
The movie click on it

175
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Do anything fun

176
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:26,015
Everybody thinks like I do appreciate our listeners who engage with stuff

177
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
Appropriately

178
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Famous Mart

179
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,879
A lot of people and text

180
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
Some stuff about how like

181
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,463
Juicy this new Alex Jones meme

182
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,303
And I think there's a mentality people think that you can just block him out of it

183
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,143
Not realizing that no you can't that's not going to work

184
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
There's going to

185
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
Need to be a much

186
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
More

187
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
Deliberative

188
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Focus

189
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Truth Bass

190
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
Exposure of what he believes in

191
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
And who he actually is

192
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,503
Hiding behind those silly things

193
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
Is a bigot

194
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
In the same way

195
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Reading

196
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
Trump's tweets

197
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
Bright all of them

198
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
Get f****** hit by a meteor

199
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
I don't f******

200
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,631
Supposed to

201
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
Please go f******

202
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,287
Making

203
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,383
Trying to make it so we can vote

204
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,039
He is destroying the healthcare

205
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Re-election

206
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
With 97

207
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,511
Crazy.

208
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,815
So we have that to look forward to

209
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,215
So here's the deal I don't want to talk too much

210
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
About

211
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
Nonsense

212
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
It's not worth

213
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
Discussing most

214
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
So the stuff that Alex

215
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
What is on at the end of last week

216
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,223
Beginning of the week he was on vacation

217
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
I don't

218
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
I don't know what's going on

219
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
He's living a wildlife La Vida Loca

220
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
Play

221
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Life on Mars

222
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Dakota on that

223
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
They did not

224
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,791
From that album

225
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
Exact

226
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Also

227
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,191
Is episode comes out will be getting surgery

228
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
I want a treatment

229
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
So

230
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,871
I've decided to do a complete audible on this episode

231
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
And explore

232
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,807
Where this idea of bases on Mars come from

233
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:42,207
Play f****** at are you kidding me yes the rest of this episode will have very little to do with Alex Jones

234
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
But it will have to do with where

235
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
And deleted from the iTunes

236
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:54,495
I promise you that this will actually be maybe more entertaining

237
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
There are a lot of people who believe

238
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
In

239
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
Space spaces

240
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,271
And what have you community community is very diverse

241
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,623
You can find tons of people who cites far more diverse than Alex Jones

242
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Totally

243
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:17,279
I'm sure there's more than 3% African-American

244
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
But maybe not I haven't seen study

245
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
But

246
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
There are a lot of people believe

247
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
You know

248
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
Lot of rampant speculation

249
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,007
There's a lot of people who have been fooled

250
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,799
Buy fake documents about stuff

251
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
And that's all fun we could do deep dive into that or we could even do a deep dive into stuff like move

252
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
That is an organization

253
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Keep track of

254
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
Self-reported UFO experiences

255
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Multi

256
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
The National UFO

257
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
Network something I don't

258
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Stanford

259
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,959
Milana the movie that very traumatized Mike Pence

260
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
I don't know

261
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,127
Anybody other than my wife

262
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
Weather

263
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Woman

264
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Other than my wife

265
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
Mother

266
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
What

267
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
What

268
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,391
Like a radio show his childhood has

269
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
Open Dumbo

270
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
F***** up

271
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,023
Yeah for the mutual UFO Network

272
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
It's a non-profit

273
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,655
Investigative body with Emmylou just they have a lot of

274
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
They have Maps

275
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
We're UFOs have been sighted

276
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
And stuff like that

277
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,151
Is apocryphal so much of it is basically just

278
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Hey I saw this

279
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
And there's no real evidence

280
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,319
You know it's as good as a people

281
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,415
And putting them online

282
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
So I tried to find some more concrete

283
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
Version

284
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Space Bass

285
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Stop

286
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
And one of the organ and we're going

287
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Straight Talk

288
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
Space command for our first

289
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,615
Right now we don't really have space command doesn't really come into play because that's a pedestrian

290
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Title

291
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
The people in the know with never calls

292
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Okay

293
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
Organization

294
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
Camelot

295
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Hey what you doing

296
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
What's today

297
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
Apparently

298
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,959
She had a very large inheritance

299
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
And she started

300
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
An organization

301
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
She's has Skype interview

302
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
People

303
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
About their weird

304
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Experience

305
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,527
She's had a ton of interviews with people who

306
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Claim

307
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,367
But they were personally involved with a lot of really f***** up

308
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,951
One of the people that we have

309
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
In the past

310
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:00,351
Guy by the name of Andrew basiago he's done some interviews with Project Camelot

311
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:06,751
He is the guy who claims that you as a child was in a time travel program he went back to like the Getty

312
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Leesburg address

313
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
He's been years

314
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Future like

315
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
2014

316
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:18,015
He's been far in the future

317
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
When he was a kid

318
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,391
Barack Obama was in the program with him

319
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:29,791
Hemet believe that

320
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
He also ran for

321
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
For president in 2016

322
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
Is Rodney

323
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,175
Also is Eric Hall is a big proponent of what's-his-name go

324
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,575
No longer does anybody say Bernie would have won

325
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,535
Also I would know you would lose that race

326
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
It seems like

327
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
He knows that he's going to win

328
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
2020 race

329
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
And he just had to go

330
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
Get his profile out

331
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
Clearly

332
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
You have no idea

333
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
He also believes

334
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Stargate

335
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,431
He's big into that also has made reference

336
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
Affected use half dolphin

337
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
And has

338
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:31,231
Stargate

339
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
Kingdom leading class

340
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,983
Anthony just agreed

341
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Standing ever

342
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,615
Conspiracy theory thrown out of

343
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
Getting in hospital interviews

344
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:56,319
Scott Aukerman

345
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,367
August blind

346
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Guessing

347
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,743
But a lot of it is the same methodology

348
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:10,143
Dolphin

349
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
I'm a chimera

350
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
You fear me Alex Jones

351
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,943
The Camelot

352
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
We were texting the other day about how

353
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
Mysterious it is

354
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,575
Never brings up like Louise Mensch

355
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
She would be an obvious Target for him if

356
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,999
He was he's mad at anybody who's against Trump

357
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,607
She has created this whole cottage industry online

358
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Of being

359
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
Superga

360
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,959
And having super secret information

361
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,007
Seems like our Jones

362
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
Making up in

363
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:52,383
Information

364
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
About her as we should be

365
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,063
Very beginning and I have this very short conversation

366
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:06,463
Could give her that I'm sitting there screaming

367
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
I told you so

368
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
I wasn't saying I believe

369
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,863
I was saying that she was in a different

370
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
Class of

371
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,495
Commentator

372
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,567
Right and his time is going on the proof of the pudding is

373
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,199
Eating and I don't think I stand by my comment

374
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
Broad

375
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,415
People who are perfect

376
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Is one thing

377
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
Finally get he could

378
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
Tee off on the line

379
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,143
Everything has proven wrong

380
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,703
He could easily do that but he doesn't

381
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
Does a little mysterious.

382
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
I'm not sure it means anything

383
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Control.

384
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,847
I have no idea

385
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,895
He also doesn't ever talk about these

386
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,455
Please Andrew basiago

387
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,039
Via this whole world of stuff

388
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
And there's also a reason

389
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,647
It's because they expose how stupid his ideas

390
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
Will know

391
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
Not directly

392
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Pfizer word

393
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,559
Okay thanks

394
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
Are horseshoes

395
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,191
Like a Warrior

396
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,287
Make lunacy of Alex Jones

397
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
Fish people walking around

398
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:33,759
Is there a fish people walking around that have one of them

399
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,087
If you did you interview him and you guys.

400
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:43,743
Let the real world version of the fake ship that is

401
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,583
Garbage is almost if

402
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
Alex Jones

403
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,655
12 dimensional dreams

404
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
Susan lies all

405
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,239
Came true like people are alarmed

406
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
What Alec

407
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Alex Jones is talk

408
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
Yeah it more or less

409
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
Carrie Callahan

410
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Does this

411
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
Project Camelot

412
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,527
She puts out really long YouTube

413
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
Interviews with people

414
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,903
Sort of Hallmarks of her interview Style

415
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
Is she believes Buckeye

416
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,743
Can ever

417
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
She's like like

418
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,839
You know George Noory on Coast to Coast AM

419
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,911
Is never make people feel we

420
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,007
Whenever people call it was outlandish stories he's kind of

421
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
You never is like

422
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
Shut up you're stupid

423
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Carrie is like

424
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,663
Even farther

425
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,943
Like

426
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,551
Play Crazy Horse

427
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
Christina

428
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,623
That seems more intellectually honest

429
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Tomato

430
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
A Fox news interview where they pretend

431
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
The pushback

432
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
Phuc yea

433
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,559
Believe it

434
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,375
Any reason

435
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,911
Suspect that she doesn't believe

436
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
The things you say

437
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
I I kind of agree with you

438
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
She's a professional bowler

439
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,359
Yeah like what she's paid to do is just believe everything

440
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
Yeah

441
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
Although the thing is

442
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:14,879
Her videos often have as many views as Alex Jones videos online

443
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
No

444
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,024
She could be making multiplayer

445
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
Everybody had a real serious cut

446
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,096
YouTube address

447
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,656
Okay because they're switching over to that YouTube

448
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,680
TV format

449
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,520
They're shifting into like a lot of Fringe stuff and political stuff

450
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,080
He's getting caught in terms of their ad Revenue

451
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
But it's not

452
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
You can claim the train

453
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:42,272
To censor libertarian

454
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,136
Those two channels that also had massive cut

455
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
In terms of what they are making

456
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
So

457
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Who cares

458
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Carrie Callahan

459
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
Project Camelot

460
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
I have done

461
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
Severian

462
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
Nursing interview is over

463
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
Over the years and one of them we're going to be

464
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,496
I'd like to read a little bit

465
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
Perspective

466
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,800
From an interview she did with

467
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Nicki Minaj

468
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,128
Which is a bikini magazine

469
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
This is this will give you a good scent

470
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,672
Is a good precursor for the interview we're going to be

471
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
Hit I'll start with v

472
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Thought so what do you think

473
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,328
Aliens have such an interest in Earth

474
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
So why do you think it is

475
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,912
What's a good or special about us

476
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Her answer

477
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:37,824
There are many things on earth they find quite desirable and I have a good number of whistleblowers who have given me information

478
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
To that effect

479
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,152
My whistleblowers are predominately ex-military

480
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
Some of whom are still working for

481
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
The secret

482
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:49,088
Also record the aliens are very interested in our gold for exam

483
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,136
Fargo

484
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,976
Yes I'm told the gold on earth is relatively easy to access

485
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,768
Compared to getting it off an asteroid

486
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,584
Which obviously would have issues when it comes to mining for gold

487
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
Rebuttal

488
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,728
You also mentioned aliens wanting to do business

489
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Yes

490
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
Earth is also a very pleasurable place

491
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
To do business

492
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:15,456
There's also reason to use Earth as a jumping-off point to explore the rest of the solar system and the Galaxy

493
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,552
Also apparently human females are considered to be very useful for breeding

494
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,624
A genetic experimentation the extraterrestrials

495
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
Is also come here for food

496
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,232
Turn reptilian races consider us a food stores

497
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
Are those

498
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,864
Simply wants us with us

499
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,424
We're very good at building things we also

500
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
Send troops

501
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,728
Conflict around the universe

502
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
Now this is important

503
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,104
Human soldiers are being sent to Interstellar conflict

504
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Her answer

505
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,968
Soldiers were alleged to be going to Iraq or Afghanistan

506
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
Places like Mars

507
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,600
To fight battles alongside other alien race

508
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,184
Those men and women will have their minds wiped when they come back

509
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,256
This is why we're having so many suicides with exposure

510
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,328
In some cases their minds have been wiped so many times

511
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,608
They become

512
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
As a result

513
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,936
When they returned they don't know where they've been

514
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
They think they've been to the Middle East

515
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
But they've actually been out

516
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
What is a good primer

517
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
Love this

518
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,664
I have never been in love

519
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
Quite like this

520
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
So what are your thoughts

521
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
Man

522
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,856
Ex-military

523
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
We're off to a great start

524
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
First sentence

525
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
Gold is easy enough to find on Earth

526
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Which is

527
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
I mean

528
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
It seems not true

529
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,216
I don't know is there a lot of gold

530
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,056
I don't know

531
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
So

532
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Gold

533
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
Really only manual

534
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Turd

535
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
The center of

536
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,272
Rockstars so when they explode that's why I heard

537
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Metals on Earth

538
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
Because

539
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
Fusion in

540
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
Stars exploding

541
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
So

542
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,048
It would seem that planets

543
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
Would probably be

544
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Where to get gold from

545
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,496
I don't know I think there are trace minerals

546
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,896
Okay I'm going to say that once

547
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,456
Do you understand why they want our gold

548
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
Why do you feel like that's important

549
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,440
Sixer iPhones

550
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Need the conductor

551
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
We're all good though

552
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,584
Interstellar travel

553
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,192
They still haven't figured out

554
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,032
Okay

555
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,080
Pleasurable

556
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:58,016
Disagree with entirely if you could leave

557
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:04,416
Yes that's true option of leaving the planet be nice to be

558
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,464
Places

559
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,608
Vacation

560
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
All right well now you've convinced

561
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,008
Secret government is still out

562
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Okay

563
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
Jury is still in a

564
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
Not disproved

565
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
Probably better for genetic

566
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,552
Experiments

567
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,184
I would say that

568
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
I don't

569
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,024
Alien races

570
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,304
I'm not sure how much

571
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
Genetic experimentation

572
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,376
Would be relevant

573
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
Seeing as we're completely

574
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Different species

575
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,752
Then why

576
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
Eksperimente

577
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
Also there's

578
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,736
So we're just going to go by curiosity

579
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Philip

580
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,696
Eating people the reptilians

581
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
Maybe maybe not

582
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,328
I don't know

583
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
What about Komodo dragon

584
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,384
Coronavirus in Hawaii

585
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
Slight fear of

586
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
The Komodo

587
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,272
Lizards

588
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Around

589
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,600
Lizards

590
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,904
Little bit scary

591
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,976
What dinosaurs

592
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:48,864
Poisonous snakes eating humans

593
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,168
Eating our flesh it's also like

594
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
Harvesting emotion

595
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
And stuff like that

596
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,544
I did not know that

597
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,336
In these communities there is a lot of feeling

598
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872
The world is so negative

599
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Because

600
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,712
You have to create negative energy that these

601
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
The demonic

602
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Being scanned

603
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
Beast off

604
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
I have not heard that

605
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,256
Which one

606
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
Soldiers are committing

607
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,584
Suicide

608
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
Is because

609
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,144
They've traveled the universe

610
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,448
And have their mind

611
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
But

612
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
You find that both offense

613
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:35,200
Insofar as completely trivializes

614
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
Destructive

615
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,088
Post-traumatic

616
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
Basically trying to say

617
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,720
There is no war in the Middle East

618
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,304
And all those 100,000 million

619
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,328
The people who have died

620
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Ezra as a

621
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,888
Results of fake news fake news

622
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
People die

623
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Call

624
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,336
ETF

625
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
It's so stupid

626
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
Defensive

627
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Terrible

628
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
That's it

629
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
I want to live in that

630
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,696
That's the world I want to live in this world sucks

631
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,488
Give me the world where

632
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,304
Universe traveling soldiers

633
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,400
But that's why people gravitate towards

634
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
Because it is

635
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
Much more pleasant world

636
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:34,336
Fantastical and Wild

637
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
Okay so today

638
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
We're going to be going over

639
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,528
T45 with a note

640
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
446 with a

641
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
Jury still out on the

642
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,136
Yeah so

643
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,488
We're going to be looking at an interview that she did

644
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,792
With a gentleman by the name of Randy Cramer

645
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,936
To give you a little bit of a syllabus of what we're about to hear

646
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,032
According to himself

647
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:10,688
Maybe I'll just let it play out I don't want you to I want you to be surprised by the things he says

648
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
Super soldier or Dolph Lundgren

649
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,064
I don't even know where to draw the line

650
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,928
His story

651
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
Like I said

652
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
This is not

653
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,584
Sara leave the beginning

654
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
Of the idea that there are

655
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
Colonies on Mars

656
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,728
And stuff like that

657
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,176
F*** yeah they come up

658
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
Course they do

659
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,992
VI

660
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,832
This isn't the beginning of the ideas

661
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
Mars

662
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,184
Look into it in the

663
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,976
The stuff that's being spewed online

664
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,840
Very little in terms of people who have come out

665
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
Thought they were involved in those things

666
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
And therefore I think

667
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
Worthwhile

668
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
To take a peek at

669
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,800
So I will

670
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,592
This thing start with Carrie

671
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,872
Callahan

672
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
Project

673
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
Given the introduction

674
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
Give him some credit

675
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:21,088
Captain Randy Cramer is a US Marine is super soldier who served

676
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,136
For 17 years on Mars

677
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
Canning the Mars colony

678
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,536
And was assigned to the Mars

679
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
Defense Force

680
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:35,680
Covert military branch United States Marine Corp

681
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,848
Designed to handle all matters

682
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,992
I'm really glad that that's your reaction when doing a Regular Show f*** that

683
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,576
No it is all about Carrie Callahan

684
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
No thank you

685
00:31:53,856 --> 00:32:00,000
That's hard and before the show that this could indicate a new direction that we can take the shower

686
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,656
You guys enjoy this episode please do let us know cuz we

687
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
More than willing

688
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:12,032
Episodes about these whistleblowers

689
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
Absolutely

690
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,360
You can take away from that is

691
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,200
He has been ready Cramer

692
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,272
Has been on Mars for 17 years

693
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:28,160
He is a super soldier

694
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
U.s. Marine

695
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
I'm going to

696
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
To speculate that he's

697
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
Did you look it up

698
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,680
I can't find any evidence that he is

699
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:44,800
When we what's his story is flashed explain why I'm not convinced he's actually a Marine

700
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:55,552
I will be honest but

701
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,392
His timeline and stuff like that to be very

702
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:03,488
But at the same time I don't want to take anything away from his service

703
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,280
And I appreciate it even if he is

704
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
A little bit naughty

705
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
Even if it was on Mars

706
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:13,472
Also 3D I think I would appreciate that because

707
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,824
Long drive tomorrow 17

708
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Which means

709
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,872
You know that was

710
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
2000

711
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,944
We probably could have gotten to Mars

712
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
What

713
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
Oh no.

714
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
You left Earth

715
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,344
In like 1983

716
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
Let's take a look

717
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
In 1980

718
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
83 how long do you

719
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
I think it would have taken

720
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:42,400
Infinite Thai

721
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
So he's

722
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Rufflet

723
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
Super soldier because he

724
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
75 years old

725
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,592
I promise you all of you

726
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:56,224
Relativity is involved he has to be I promise you

727
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,296
I promise you all of these concerns will be addressed

728
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,832
Just poorly

729
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,416
Like I said I'm not

730
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,696
Play sure what the super soldier

731
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:09,536
Your stuff is at this point

732
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Four serum

733
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,072
Well let's see

734
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:18,752
Without divulging too much richer did Elizabeth are in the 1960s pretty much became the priority technology

735
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,616
Developing a technology

736
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
Ability

737
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
From the ground up

738
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
Field trip report

739
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:36,928
Nothing but, based mind control technology

740
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,976
Really damaging to the subject

741
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,304
Incognito

742
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,144
So if you want to guarantee that you have a subject that can get a job done

743
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,496
For you you know us a hint at the end of a very very large

744
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,568
It will happen but you're not going to get it

745
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:58,432
You're self-destructive become completely mentioned in stable or something

746
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
Checks out

747
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,904
United States Marine Corps special section being the organization that it was again and being beholden to the

748
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:16,352
I'm getting really was doing plenty of passionate about the technology and was assessing that much of the

749
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,912
Trauma-based mind control is not working

750
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,728
MK Ultra

751
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:30,688
We think that your methodology

752
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
Jackson

753
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
We think you ought to consider why

754
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:40,928
This is a better way of doing things than what you're doing because we think the week all going with the brain training versus the

755
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,488
Against the grain

756
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,048
Create a better

757
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,376
Last longer

758
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,520
They won't go crazy if it works right and they'll actually want to do their job because you won't be

759
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,176
Absolutely

760
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
Upgrading Supercell

761
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,136
Did a great job of giving us One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

762
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:15,744
Sometimes A Great Notion also why the Unabomber

763
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Never

764
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,632
Take me to bomber out of there

765
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:28,288
Unabomber out of there

766
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,824
Jaded Drake

767
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
Yeah

768
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,688
John Holmes

769
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,992
Add event

770
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
MK Ultra

771
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
And it did exist

772
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Like in the 50s

773
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,440
Robux that was one part of it right there were also

774
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,000
Weird psychological tests that we're done on people

775
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
In terms of

776
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
Abusing them

777
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
I'm seeing what would happen

778
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,656
Brett

779
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,312
Just line up in Italy

780
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
It's a horrible thing

781
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,480
And it has come out there is evidence

782
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
Continue past

783
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,856
Date as it were

784
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
Which is

785
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
Not what this

786
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,696
Secret government wants you to think

787
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
Exactly

788
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,744
Secret government

789
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Damn you

790
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,936
This all started with Eisenhower apparently as Randy Cramer

791
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,728
He explains that

792
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,032
Basically

793
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
They were working

794
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,616
With space programs

795
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,384
And what have you

796
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
And that's what

797
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,296
Track you was actually talking about

798
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
This whole program

799
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,136
And I off of planetary stuff

800
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
Also Eisen

801
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
How was

802
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
The first Super

803
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
Slogan

804
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Be like

805
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,608
Right ba

806
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
Going on and on

807
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,616
Don't really even explaining what they did

808
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,320
Here we go here

809
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,672
Specific

810
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,744
And by late 1969

811
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,632
My DNA was being concocted in the petri dish somewhere and then when I was born

812
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:36,032
Animal of 1970

813
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,336
Super silver fighting machine

814
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,664
Implanted

815
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,968
Came out nine months later and raised

816
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:51,648
I could figure that everything being happening

817
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,304
Religious background so any of the sort of the more weird metaphysical things that were

818
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
Write off

819
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
Being a

820
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,216
Demonic attack on the household or

821
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:10,592
You know something that was much more spiritually answer both of their religious system

822
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
So we can take from that

823
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,688
Parents are crazy

824
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,504
Which which would lead to

825
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,808
A higher incidence of the kid being a little

826
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
So

827
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
He was

828
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
In a test tube in a lab

829
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,768
Implanted back into his mother's womb

830
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
Born and raised

831
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
Is as normally as possible

832
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
Which is why we need

833
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,424
Stop playing

834
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
I'm sure they would have

835
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,056
So he goes on

836
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,128
Being something maybe more material

837
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,296
Strange bruises

838
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,608
They're getting older and they don't remember a lot of

839
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
Conversation

840
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,728
Strange things are going on today

841
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,056
I kind of live in their own universes while I'm somewhere ISO

842
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:23,040
They actually took it very well very well

843
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:29,696
Would you rather

844
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:36,096
5150

845
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,728
I shouldn't

846
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,008
The smoke follows pregnant

847
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
I shouldn't have used God while

848
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,200
Things to like mysterious bruises and stuff like that

849
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,760
I know you speculated sleepwalking

850
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
It's entirely possible

851
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,856
There's also possibilities

852
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,160
Usually when there are bruises

853
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,464
And stuff mysteriously on children

854
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,560
Stigmata

855
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
From his childhood

856
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,376
That wasn't

857
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
Parents receive

858
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
Absolutely

859
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
Do that pause

860
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:18,080
I'm not saying that is the case but it is entirely possible and when you bring up stuff like that

861
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,200
Ghosts

862
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
And super soldier

863
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,064
I don't know how is genetic engineering

864
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,856
To be a super soldier would cause me

865
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
Mysterious bruises

866
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,928
Outsiders

867
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,976
Experimental program

868
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,280
Sparring when he's five

869
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,328
His body is rebuilding itself around these

870
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
Genetic

871
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
The veins

872
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
The the arteries

873
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
Tazewell pop

874
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
Growing inside

875
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
That's where Bruce

876
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:51,872
Nothing interesting.

877
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:59,039
Why the f*** not

878
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,599
Blow your mind

879
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,159
Also this is not where I'm going to plant my flag

880
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
Before

881
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,047
They have this MKUltra this abuse

882
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,839
Super soldier

883
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
But the problem

884
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,911
Will you come too

885
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,703
Is the DC super soldiers

886
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,239
Ucreate had no morality

887
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,079
Did they die real young

888
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
Sort of

889
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
Robot

890
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,199
They weren't a robot

891
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,991
Super soldier that you would need

892
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,039
Brandi goes on today

893
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
Explain how he is

894
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,623
A version of amore

895
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
Amor mortal

896
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Super-soul

897
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:44,095
It's basically I was trained from my adolescence left my teenage years the age of 17

898
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,423
As a super soldier in Project

899
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,799
What's the different kind of program

900
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,639
Actually thinking feeling

901
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:00,735
Moral super soldiers that would make moral and ethical decisions

902
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,807
That would be for the good of the people

903
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,671
Historical notion

904
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,743
Plastic

905
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:18,143
Greco-Roman heroic model and said Luckett really want to create people like you know this

906
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,471
Hercules

907
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,007
Ajax

908
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
They're not just murder me

909
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,383
These are moral ethical Heroes

910
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:32,735
Who did what they did because they believe in a better purpose

911
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,807
Bigger stronger faster smarter

912
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,623
Monster they were bigger stronger faster

913
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,415
Smarter stronger better

914
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,023
Because they believed in self-sacrifice they believed in

915
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:50,911
Chicken back and being fat with a bunch of bunch of wires but you know they were out

916
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,727
Fighting the Dragon

917
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
People

918
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,311
No real dragons

919
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
Ben

920
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,615
This man

921
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:08,831
I don't care.

922
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,183
Would this dude be probably better than Charles

923
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,023
So

924
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,559
Re-examine

925
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,607
History

926
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,143
Let's first of all

927
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:25,471
A Titan he wasn't human

928
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,823
How do I listen

929
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
Because he was bad

930
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:45,183
But be that as it may use a use a warrior

931
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:51,583
He is wrathful primary characterization

932
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,375
The only reason

933
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,167
There's a story in The Iliad

934
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,703
Is because Achilles

935
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,983
Gets pissed off

936
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,031
General

937
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,055
Comes over in his like

938
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,847
Hey I'm going to take your warbound

939
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,871
Which was women

940
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:08,735
Yeah his woman got stolen his plunder got stolen he like f*** it I'm not fighting then

941
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,295
That's the whole beginning tension

942
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Oh

943
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,367
Hero

944
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:18,207
It's not like he was fighting for some Noble purpose in the simile

945
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,047
In the Trojan War

946
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:28,191
Cheerleading the Second Amendment property in the sensitive person was his property yes absolutely

947
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:33,311
His examples are immoral

948
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
Super soldier with

949
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,127
Hercules weather

950
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
Hero

951
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,687
As a

952
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
Play

953
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,831
The guy but he was also a demigod

954
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,511
The Gorgon

955
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,279
The 12

956
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:57,375
The cleanup

957
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,495
Superhero I will admit

958
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,519
Clean up that shed

959
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,335
You're good so I think we're pretty well established

960
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
At this point

961
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
Imagine a

962
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:16,319
Much deeper into the essence of

963
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,367
The program that makes

964
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,415
Other than to say in that last

965
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
Was training

966
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
I was sparring with trees

967
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,335
Think you got that thing on your

968
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Your face huh

969
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
What's cross-eyed

970
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
The surgery

971
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:52,927
Maybe it's a homing Beacon that I'm going to be cutting out of myself

972
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
Suddenly in

973
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
Mysteriously

974
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,023
They refer you out after

975
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
Initial diagnosis

976
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
He did

977
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
Oh no

978
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
Secret government so

979
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:05,983
Future

980
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,031
I'm glad we have

981
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,591
Explain what happened

982
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,639
The program

983
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,943
So as they took 300

984
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,527
The program and then when I guess

985
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,343
Graduated about age 17

986
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,159
Moonshadow essentially

987
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,999
Only one of many super soldier programs

988
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:32,351
Not just in America but around the world that contribute to the larger program

989
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:37,727
Then parcel soldiers out of the programs to something called project manager

990
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,543
Mannequin is a larger Global program

991
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:46,943
Which takes all the super soldier program from everybody else and then assigns them either back

992
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,247
Reprogrammed on the ground

993
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,879
Waiting on word to the outer program the DVD

994
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:59,231
The Briefing is off-world Adams off-planet is definitely PDF

995
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:04,863
So you either trying to get parcel back into a special unit or you get sent off

996
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,447
Idiot block

997
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:14,847
DDS in park without exposure to radiant Guardian into the other store stations in any of the other planet

998
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,687
Radiant guardian come on

999
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
The program

1000
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,551
3DS

1001
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,343
Fundrise

1002
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
Foundation

1003
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,391
Brett

1004
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
First offense

1005
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,815
I'm not privy to every planet

1006
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,631
Play Parcels at them to all of those

1007
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,655
And

1008
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,191
Come tomorrow

1009
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:46,591
Mars the Mars colony Corporation is what runs smartphones makes Contracting MDF

1010
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,431
Which is the only private military Contracting agency

1011
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:53,247
The water is not

1012
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:01,439
Paperwork thing is no longer you know in charge of everybody at the nccr the India

1013
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:07,839
Bureaucracy

1014
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,887
We live in this

1015
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,471
Go to

1016
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,263
That makes me

1017
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
Like

1018
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,103
Bureaucracy

1019
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:24,735
Call the time

1020
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:31,135
Makes me think maybe he's had a shity job

1021
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,183
Paperwork

1022
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,975
Before but

1023
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:41,119
B I like that all the people in the moon Defense Force are from the Earth Defense Force

1024
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:44,191
Coronado members of the Earth Defense Force members

1025
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
This is just normal

1026
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,055
So you might be asking

1027
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
Yourself

1028
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,871
And how are you you comes in at 7

1029
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
What happened

1030
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,479
What was the actual moment

1031
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,503
Whatever

1032
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,807
300f

1033
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,343
Defeating the

1034
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:13,375
From Earth at age 17

1035
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,167
Remember the 17th

1036
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:21,567
1987re actually in the morning of the would have been November 18th 1987 at 2:30 a.m.

1037
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:27,967
A localized Wormhole a two guys

1038
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,367
But we didn't just go do training session it was

1039
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:38,207
Talk to an underground base to a like

1040
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:43,327
Hanger with an aurora trb-3 big black triangular vehicles at the

1041
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,143
Actually manufactured by Boeing

1042
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,447
And that other

1043
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,495
Schoolmaster the Air Force wherever else

1044
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,567
You're still kind of a standard

1045
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:59,967
Terrestrial shuttle vehicles are not the most advanced thing at all but you know if they do the job

1046
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,527
Advanced technology

1047
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:08,159
You know people if they catch one or get one

1048
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,463
Tjk

1049
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,143
I want to take a moment to say his story is changed

1050
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,703
Substantially over interview

1051
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,591
He's a lot of his stuff did not appear in early interviews about size.

1052
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,615
Absolutely

1053
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,455
But you know he's remembering more and more

1054
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,295
He does like a

1055
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,623
Recovers blocks of his memory and stuff like that

1056
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,439
Explains why a lot of the stories

1057
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
Some changes

1058
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,255
But it also explains why

1059
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,023
Has gotten to

1060
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,559
To the point where a lot of this

1061
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,583
This is blase

1062
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,351
A lot of

1063
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,167
Who's like you know

1064
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,983
Forest there's a lot of paperwork

1065
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,519
Carryover

1066
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:04,479
Localized

1067
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:08,063
Were you given warning or was it just like a hole

1068
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,391
Space is opened up into dude walked out more like

1069
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,183
Alright

1070
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:18,559
Get in. Get in here so you go stupid

1071
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
And my butt

1072
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:26,239
They come through this wormhole

1073
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,895
Localized wormhole

1074
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,943
Older Country

1075
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,295
Absolutely you don't want to be second opening up he's crazy lungworm

1076
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,831
Anyway that's

1077
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
Again

1078
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,159
Riverside Lodge

1079
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,975
You're right there

1080
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,839
You want to go with the safest route and you've already got the

1081
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,655
Pizza Inn

1082
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,567
You might ask

1083
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:04,127
I mean is there anything.

1084
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,151
Maybe

1085
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:08,479
Where we going with reprocessing process

1086
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:14,111
In front of a junior officer

1087
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,671
We're going away for a 20-year tour

1088
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:23,071
You don't know where you're going to go yet I can't tell you that we don't know it's the package classified but yet Edition.

1089
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:26,399
Going to happen then we'll bring you back

1090
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:31,263
Erase your memory for security reasons

1091
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,103
Anyway

1092
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,383
Not the lie but no

1093
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:44,319
Medical exam

1094
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,343
And there's a waiting.

1095
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,671
I love that there's another another medical exam I think

1096
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,559
Contract

1097
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,495
You're not going to

1098
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,287
Remember that

1099
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:08,895
F****** stay

1100
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,687
Secret government always lied about

1101
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,503
Make you sign a contract

1102
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,295
You'd like they would even acknowledge

1103
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,879
You are genetically engineered in a lab.

1104
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
Super soldier

1105
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,743
It's not like you're going to do you need that paperwork on file

1106
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,327
Also if you're going to

1107
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,375
To be a super Soldier on Mars

1108
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:32,703
Like you haven't

1109
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,287
How are you

1110
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:45,247
Localized

1111
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,599
A wormhole

1112
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,391
Everything is localized

1113
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,695
Geo behind wormholes

1114
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,743
R1

1115
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,375
Across the Universe

1116
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
Words coming out of

1117
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,287
Listeners are like

1118
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,335
Wow I thought perspective Jordan that was

1119
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:16,735
That's what you're doing with the Wormhole you're taking one

1120
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,087
Because there's no real

1121
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,367
Between the two of them

1122
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,183
Play the same thing so how do you even think of

1123
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,207
Localized

1124
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,487
Is Wormhole is any

1125
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:28,767
Interstellar

1126
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,583
And that's the magic of

1127
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,631
Allows immediate

1128
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
Theoretically

1129
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:38,751
Now you might be surprised to learn

1130
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,287
But at the same time

1131
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:43,103
Randy tells us this next clip

1132
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,871
Takes 15 minutes

1133
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,407
To get from the Moon to Mars

1134
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:50,527
No I don't even want to be a part of this

1135
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,855
I think I cut out the

1136
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,415
The part where you talked about this but

1137
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,975
If we're talking about an einstein-rosen

1138
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,255
Sure

1139
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,535
There is

1140
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
0 time

1141
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,703
He goes to a Moon Bay

1142
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,007
I'm guessing that's where they did

1143
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
This process

1144
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,335
And then from there they enter

1145
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,127
8 story tall

1146
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
Spaceship

1147
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,735
Don't know why they're there waiting

1148
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,319
Evolve

1149
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:28,415
Therefore we could be living

1150
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:31,231
8 stories tall is a Mastiff

1151
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
To get off the ground

1152
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:38,143
He gets on this ship and they go

1153
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,983
Not even from the Moon that would be difficult

1154
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,263
Who cares

1155
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
Anyway

1156
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,639
There's a lot more than I've ever cared about it

1157
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,175
Save your energy

1158
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,015
So they go in this 8-story tall ship

1159
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,039
From the Moon

1160
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,111
Go past the due a buzz by

1161
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,903
Buzz flyby of Earth

1162
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,951
From the ceiling

1163
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,743
You can see the Earth

1164
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,791
And you can see electrical storms

1165
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,583
Cousin Randy is filled with his scent

1166
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,119
The Earth is alive

1167
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,167
It fits nice last

1168
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
View of Earth

1169
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,959
Before they shoot off

1170
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,727
For Mars

1171
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,263
And I hear is

1172
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,287
I'm talking about

1173
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,615
The trip

1174
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,919
Tomorrow I'm assuming that eventually we'll get in

1175
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
He still has

1176
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
Maybe

1177
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
Literally Maybe

1178
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,487
Cal or something

1179
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,303
Forget to check

1180
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,119
Good memory erase box there's a clause in his contract

1181
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,727
Secret government

1182
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,775
So we had to let him go

1183
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,799
Answer that question

1184
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,079
But I have to do it later

1185
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
Assuming you're not going to answer

1186
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,967
I just want to know if there's a

1187
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,735
Possible

1188
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,807
I mean

1189
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,831
There's a fence

1190
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,695
I can't tell you that there is an answer that's good

1191
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,767
Look we're in Alex

1192
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,583
We're engaged

1193
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,655
Yeah absolutely

1194
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Mr. Tire

1195
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:20,031
Also I'd like them

1196
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:26,687
This is about the trip to Mars and the beginning of his time there also DuckTales nicely into some

1197
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
About time

1198
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,527
Find me travel distance

1199
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,319
Much time was passing during this time

1200
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:36,159
I mean it say was the matter of minutes

1201
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:41,535
Seems like I mean maybe it was a 15-20 minute you know

1202
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:46,399
Ride from the moon to the back to the sort of looking at Earth and then

1203
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:52,799
Once we left everything was maybe a 15-20 minute right tomorrow because then we went via Wormhole so then the vehicle

1204
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:59,199
However the wormholes are manifested went through one and then we came out of Mars and then eat those unwelcome tomorrow's you grab Daryl

1205
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
Location

1206
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,783
Drive time to the ground and landed a Terri Freeman

1207
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,319
Okay

1208
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,647
And then this was your base for

1209
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,023
3 years

1210
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,583
So some kind of

1211
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,703
Solar Warden

1212
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,751
I'm not sure what you doing

1213
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,799
He was radiant Guardian when I was

1214
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:31,199
The part of that program but it's changed you know number of times and it's all it's been that something similar to that

1215
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:41,695
About you whenever was the remainder of my 20-year tour you know however that worked out exactly what 17 years three months

1216
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,487
14 days in

1217
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:47,327
You know I guess so

1218
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:02,175
In order to get more time out of it they're not going to waste time on YouTube

1219
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:16,511
The actual service time unlike okay crackhead find getting extra

1220
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,071
When you move from one place

1221
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:25,983
If they want there to be if they want to see if they want to save time

1222
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:32,127
You know they can do something out of time so that instead of it taking days weeks or month to take

1223
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,175
You know 5 minutes or 15 minutes

1224
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:40,575
Play with time like that I'm not a really good at Temple mechanics

1225
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:47,231
The time guys really understand their businesses and certainly know how to move things around about

1226
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:55,679
So you understand what he's saying they're basically is that there's time travel involved so they can

1227
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,959
Screw you out of the

1228
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:03,359
You the time that you've been you sign up for 20 years so maybe you do some of it takes like 3

1229
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,151
MMA

1230
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,479
Yeah

1231
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,783
It's a living

1232
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
Cursive

1233
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,671
Well if they want

1234
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,279
Why would they look like they are they are they joyriding are they

1235
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,815
They f****** with you what's happening

1236
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,607
I don't know

1237
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,679
Stopwatch

1238
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,263
If they want to stop loss

1239
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,615
Right that's true it's a very bizarre understanding of time

1240
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,895
And I don't

1241
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:43,551
We hung up on 15 minutes of time

1242
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,855
Like if you want

1243
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,439
Travel

1244
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:52,255
Here's my second theory here's my theory on that

1245
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
Alright

1246
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,863
Because of all the time traveler

1247
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
That he's done

1248
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,655
The only

1249
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,447
Real amount of time that he can

1250
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,471
Can measure in his brain

1251
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,031
Like that's all you've got

1252
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,055
Possible

1253
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,079
You're talking to him

1254
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:08,383
And you're like it's a 11

1255
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,151
Now

1256
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,455
Do you want to watch the Cubs

1257
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,223
Game that's it

1258
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,527
How long

1259
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,295
Do you think it's

1260
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,111
Going to be

1261
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,903
Maybe

1262
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,719
Siri

1263
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,743
Time travel

1264
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,023
True

1265
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,815
Absolutely I've seen lost

1266
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,399
Time travel I guess Desmond's mine just

1267
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,495
You're wrong

1268
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,055
Celine Dion's AR all day but

1269
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:42,175
Does next

1270
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,967
But Randy ends up on Mars

1271
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,831
This next clip we get to little bit of talk about what

1272
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,623
Is like when he shows up

1273
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:54,207
But innocent you were based in on Mars

1274
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:00,607
Explain to people that you know we're going to be relatively

1275
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,655
On Mars

1276
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:09,311
Except that point from the Earth Defense Force which route

1277
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:16,479
Military private military company that is contracted to the Mars colony Corporation of the MCC to defend the Marc Cohn

1278
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:25,439
One of many station to create a buffer zone around the territory with the colonies are located

1279
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,023
Any of the local

1280
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:34,399
Hostile animal life & Style of life

1281
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,703
You know out of that territory

1282
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:43,103
And I can only sort of answer for you know what was taking place in our area which Dino for sometime I certify

1283
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:51,295
Northern Arctic

1284
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:57,183
So you know

1285
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,743
Everywhere else but

1286
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:04,863
Crossovers and validation

1287
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,423
Eventually they will be a lot more people talking about

1288
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:13,823
They're not ready to come forward right now but you know

1289
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,127
You were talking to people on a regular basis to

1290
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,135
To go to their meeting

1291
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:34,303
People end up in a work

1292
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:41,471
Planning for a lunch happen

1293
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:45,055
I want a wrong number group text

1294
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,079
Hey

1295
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:52,479
What was your experience like

1296
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,551
Local

1297
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,599
Hostile

1298
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:00,415
And possibly also possibly

1299
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,183
Sentient

1300
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,207
Oh no

1301
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:05,791
There is no possible about it there were aliens

1302
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,071
Oh yeah well

1303
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,095
Indigenous Marsh

1304
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,399
As I believe they prefer to be

1305
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,679
Yeah yeah

1306
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:14,495
That's the correct terminology

1307
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,847
He was there you was on Mars

1308
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:20,895
Colonies

1309
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:25,503
We find some overlap with Robert David

1310
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,551
Steal from The Alex Jones Show

1311
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,087
Talking about there being

1312
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:29,855
And colonies on

1313
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:30,879
On Mars

1314
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,671
He was

1315
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,951
Super soldier Randy was

1316
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,231
Fight off

1317
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,255
Dogs

1318
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,071
Right

1319
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,375
So now he has a really interesting

1320
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
Prob

1321
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,727
Don't look at me like that

1322
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,591
So what is

1323
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,871
The one problem

1324
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:56,223
He goes on to say that their bases were like Underground

1325
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,247
And within a mount

1326
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,527
Cuz of course they

1327
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,551
I mean

1328
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,831
Cuz otherwise

1329
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,415
There are a lot of people

1330
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,183
Why they would need to

1331
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,231
There a lot of people with a lot of telescopes

1332
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,279
We have a Rover on Mars now

1333
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,351
Figure out

1334
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,911
Breitbart

1335
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,215
The spot where we

1336
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,239
Faces

1337
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,799
Yeah that's true

1338
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,335
See the entire planet

1339
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,687
If you have underground base

1340
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,735
Where are things

1341
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,759
Coming at you from

1342
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,575
How are you having a war in underground bases

1343
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,135
That's the thing that they do

1344
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,903
Discovered

1345
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,439
So they go there to set up the

1346
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,983
Is everybody doing coke pretty well-established

1347
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,311
It started before the 8-hour shift.

1348
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,103
Pictures of

1349
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,431
We got the nuclear bomb and then immediately went to Mars

1350
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247
Distraction

1351
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:06,367
That's when they did it everybody was is the Fallout of Nagasaki

1352
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
We only really mean

1353
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,927
One yeah

1354
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,951
Butthole

1355
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,791
McCoy

1356
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,839
Everybody's too busy with the tragedy

1357
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,959
Digging underground to develop our Martian colonies

1358
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:21,983
But

1359
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,287
To their surprise

1360
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
There's

1361
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,175
Right they are fighting

1362
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,735
Against

1363
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,295
I'm going to go with gold

1364
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,575
Orson Scott Card

1365
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,367
Wood-style

1366
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,159
Morlocks

1367
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,279
They already have bases

1368
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
Is down there

1369
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,327
If you're just occupying

1370
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,607
Morlocks

1371
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,447
I need Super Soldier

1372
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,263
If there was nothing going on on Mars

1373
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:58,847
You just have a bunch of people there

1374
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,639
Marrow of

1375
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,199
Children adrenochrome blog

1376
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:08,063
And you'd like but you'd still like

1377
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,623
Weird underground battles going on because

1378
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,927
EBay people who were able to withstand

1379
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,719
These Wormhole jumps

1380
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,767
Some stuff like that

1381
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,535
Spaghetti

1382
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,559
As a

1383
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,119
Forgotify

1384
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,143
True scientist

1385
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,031
We know that Mars

1386
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,335
There's no aux

1387
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,383
Oxygen are there

1388
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,919
Could not really exist there

1389
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,455
Randy wants you to know

1390
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,991
You're a dumb dumb

1391
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,807
He wants to tell you the truth about Mars

1392
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
Climate

1393
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:02,335
Right now

1394
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,895
About it

1395
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:08,223
It's not exactly the way not to tell the snack

1396
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,063
Thousands that doesn't have a breathable oxygen

1397
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,623
I love how

1398
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,159
It's not

1399
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,463
Exactly

1400
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,535
Missy sarcasm

1401
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,863
You guys are dumb

1402
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,679
Do you believe

1403
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:30,495
It's not quite like that but your clothes

1404
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,519
Right

1405
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,543
Right

1406
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,311
So good

1407
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,847
It's a it's a real turn-on

1408
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,615
So good

1409
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:41,247
Super breathable in mountainair for us it's really not recommended

1410
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,623
Outside the equatorial regions to try and like survive without an environment suit

1411
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:50,463
Regions can be a bit warmer in a bit more mild and temporary

1412
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:56,607
So it's not the worst thing in the world apparently to just be sort of exposed in any Street clothing Thursday

1413
01:09:56,863 --> 01:10:03,007
Can you get any of the directions for the farther north and south and you're going to get way more extreme temperatures and Wednesday so Coruscant

1414
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,543
You're going to need some protection

1415
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,479
You're fighting

1416
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:16,575
Never went outside without an environment without a powered environment

1417
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,135
Everything else

1418
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
Package

1419
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:26,047
Did you have structures that you

1420
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,375
Or was it all Underground

1421
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:36,543
We were inside of a mountain free much everything is I understand is underground I mean there may be some facilities which

1422
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:42,943
Operate on the surface of everything that you want to stay functioning it's got to be Underground

1423
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,527
Inform

1424
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:49,343
It's fair

1425
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:52,415
I just looked it up it has to be

1426
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,695
I'll tell you why

1427
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,231
Near the poles

1428
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,279
Temperatures can get down all the way

1429
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,303
82

1430
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,327
- 100

1431
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
It's pretty cold

1432
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,911
Even on the equator on

1433
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,447
During a summer day

1434
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:09,055
Which I don't remember the length of Mars

1435
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,615
Around Earth

1436
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,663
Who cares but Summers awhile

1437
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,711
It can get all the way up to 7

1438
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:20,831
Degrees Fahrenheit you could be out there it's a bit mountainair

1439
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,855
You can still breathe

1440
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,159
Don't run

1441
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:27,743
Equator of Mars

1442
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,023
Sad at night

1443
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:29,791
Even

1444
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,327
Get down to mine

1445
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,351
9073

1446
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:37,983
100 wild fluctuations

1447
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,823
That checks out I'm on his side now let's be clear

1448
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,127
Things are colder Underground

1449
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:48,223
You can control the environment a little bit better and put in like

1450
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,503
Heaters and stuff like that

1451
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:53,855
But if its -195 degrees north

1452
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,647
He's at the North most

1453
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:59,487
Point of their operations

1454
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,791
Negative

1455
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,583
195°

1456
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,119
If you go underground that's going to be

1457
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,447
That is going to be way colder

1458
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:14,335
Do you like 30 feet underground you are is not going to make a difference

1459
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,127
He said he's in a mountain

1460
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:23,295
Underground could be inside of mountaineer cylinder

1461
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,319
Sitter mountains ground

1462
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,343
What are the volcano

1463
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:31,487
See now you don't even have to worry about From the Vault

1464
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,767
All volcanoes

1465
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,535
Not all men

1466
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
Volcano

1467
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,055
When people are on earth

1468
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,407
Call gentleman

1469
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,735
Amen

1470
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
You might be asked

1471
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,087
Asking yourself which is something I keep fighting myself

1472
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:00,671
At this point you might be quizzically thinking

1473
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
Hey

1474
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,743
It's all the stuff

1475
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,279
Is going on and there are all these

1476
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,559
Space spaces

1477
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,375
On the moon

1478
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,983
Probably going on at work

1479
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,775
You can get anywhere around the world

1480
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:19,871
Are we getting any indication of like radio signal

1481
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,943
Communication must be going off between

1482
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,295
Now he's got it covered

1483
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,607
Technology

1484
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,591
Say something

1485
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,967
Yeah

1486
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,623
Alright

1487
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:05,951
RadioShack

1488
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,719
Cigna Cigna

1489
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,559
Be strong enough to

1490
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,583
Reach Earth

1491
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,351
From Mars

1492
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,631
And it would have to be

1493
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,655
Selective enough

1494
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,423
So you could have this

1495
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,447
Signals you do want

1496
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,519
Coming in coming in communication

1497
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,287
Between the

1498
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,311
Basis

1499
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:26,943
Absolutely I don't know what is the technology people use

1500
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,735
Sorry go ahead

1501
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,759
Now that's a good point

1502
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:36,415
I don't know

1503
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,975
To know whether or not you could hide once

1504
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,999
Successfully from

1505
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,023
We weren't

1506
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,095
Specially-created in test tubes and implanted into our parent

1507
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:48,447
That's true you don't know all these

1508
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
Soldiers

1509
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:50,495
Right

1510
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,031
That means they also must

1511
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,055
WhatsApp created

1512
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,735
They're the ones who were lying to us

1513
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,015
Climate change

1514
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:06,367
You don't think this is a 3-hour interview

1515
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,415
And I don't have all that much

1516
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:14,815
Kept it mostly to the Mars stuff yet he believes in climate change so

1517
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,887
If we're getting we're getting off-planet

1518
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
The Eisenhower

1519
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:25,055
Totally clear

1520
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,079
Really give

1521
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,919
Any real reason that any of this stuff exists

1522
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,455
Would be idea that it is

1523
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:35,807
Is a potential colony to move to or anything like that really

1524
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
Cuz why not

1525
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,671
Sure

1526
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,999
Explore-the-world

1527
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:51,423
What has to go to Mars

1528
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,775
I think the more likely thing is

1529
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,567
This guy had a little bit of a psycho

1530
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,359
Psychotic break

1531
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,639
Crystal superfunctional

1532
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407
It could just be

1533
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,711
Creative

1534
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,479
A lot of fun

1535
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
If I could

1536
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:11,135
Sustained a 3-hour interview of made-up b******* with

1537
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,927
Credulous

1538
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:15,999
Woman in the world could

1539
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:18,047
Listen to harass

1540
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:18,815
Question

1541
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,119
Completely

1542
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,167
Oh yeah

1543
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:28,799
Called it to the radio

1544
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,615
Celestial defense

1545
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,895
Yeah yeah

1546
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,687
Weld

1547
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,783
Is it goes by it's different

1548
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:47,487
I have here discusses

1549
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:50,047
To go up there

1550
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,095
Get to the bottom of that

1551
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:59,007
Mars

1552
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,663
Basically encountering

1553
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,455
From what I understand

1554
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,927
Program who have interviews

1555
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,231
Which day are called frogs

1556
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:35,103
You know other Hive insects as you know sort of the do there

1557
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:41,759
Building machines is genetically engineering another bug read another you know insects

1558
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,807
Job and so

1559
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Call Zack

1560
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,799
Just like here in

1561
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,079
United States

1562
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,735
Giraffe fighting

1563
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:23,743
I think it's important to point out because I I keep telling people presume what that conflict was it

1564
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:28,863
Or what we were fighting over and climb I'm feeling more and more that I need to be real

1565
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,191
About why we were fighting and what we were fighting for

1566
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:38,591
It was not for supremacy of the planet it was not for a total Global work the planet

1567
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:44,991
Attacking got involved

1568
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:51,391
But you know we were having when I would call

1569
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:55,743
Conflict really with the native reptoids in the native insectoids messerly

1570
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,447
It was way more polite and civilized

1571
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:07,263
Stop What was a

1572
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:11,103
Organic system of territorial

1573
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:17,503
Boundary keeping that was not meant overrun somebody else's 5 or territory dispensary can maintain

1574
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,551
Everyone

1575
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:23,391
No one could grow over strong

1576
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:29,791
So that everyone could maintain a Peaceable territory without anyone actually trying to become our whole planet

1577
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:38,495
Words

1578
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:43,871
Back-and-forth that was meant to maintain and stabilize the territory

1579
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:53,343
It might

1580
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,135
Look we were fighting

1581
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,695
Soupremacy

1582
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,743
F****** reptile

1583
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,839
Ostensibly another

1584
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,631
Local population

1585
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
Skirmishes

1586
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,935
Big fan

1587
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,263
But I want them

1588
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,799
Because if

1589
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:15,616
They just genetically engineered another

1590
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,528
Insectoids in

1591
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,208
I don't understand

1592
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,536
Feed the draconian

1593
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,328
Bring an insectoid back

1594
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:41,472
Here you have a create all kinds of Technology solve a lot of problems should be taken care of

1595
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,544
Folding ancient Europe

1596
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,176
Just want to f*** everything up

1597
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,528
Very much so

1598
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,808
Is a very

1599
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:59,648
Included in the entire mythology of the lizard

1600
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:05,024
Draconian

1601
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,864
David Icke

1602
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,888
A little bit here

1603
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,680
Lithia the lizard-folk

1604
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,776
War with Iran

1605
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,824
But there was

1606
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:18,848
It's not there was

1607
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:24,992
You didn't

1608
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,624
Fight forever no not even on Mars

1609
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,976
Between Russia and the United States

1610
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,256
Sooner or later going to get paid

1611
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,816
Just like that

1612
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,096
Just like that

1613
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,376
Conflict is right

1614
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,424
I think they're going to be

1615
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,448
I think what

1616
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,728
Sort of

1617
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,008
Expressing is

1618
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,032
Is a little bit of an eye

1619
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,848
Madea and maybe a fanciful idea about

1620
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:53,408
Like Wars between Native American tribes

1621
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,688
Before the white man came

1622
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,272
Is a little bit of that to everybody saying

1623
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:01,344
I don't know

1624
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,648
I don't know enough

1625
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,440
I don't know enough about

1626
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,720
Native American history

1627
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:10,048
But I do think that if you also don't know a lot

1628
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,352
You might speculate that

1629
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,632
That was how Native

1630
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,656
Warfare when

1631
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,984
And then the draconians would be

1632
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,520
The Europeans

1633
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,288
I'm coming over in

1634
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,312
Going for

1635
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,360
So maybe this is all an allegory

1636
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:25,920
Just about arse

1637
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,456
If that's

1638
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,736
McKay's

1639
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:33,088
But also I don't know

1640
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,392
I don't know if that's accurate

1641
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,696
No but I mean even the lesson

1642
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,464
I'm not sure if

1643
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,232
Accurate

1644
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,280
Again I don't know enough about

1645
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,816
Old time

1646
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,120
American history

1647
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:46,912
No they were people

1648
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,192
It feels right to me

1649
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,216
That lesson

1650
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,752
But I don't I don't know what to

1651
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,520
Beetroot

1652
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,080
Because of all of the stuff that we

1653
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:56,640
Kind of idolize about the neighbor

1654
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,944
Living

1655
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:03,040
The nature and all the buffalo

1656
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:03,808
Did nothing

1657
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:07,136
People they still f****** each other letters right there tribes

1658
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,416
We're driven

1659
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,208
Inspire others

1660
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,792
Simulated there was slavery there is all that other stuff

1661
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,096
Fiat currency

1662
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,632
Seeing what have you all to make the argument

1663
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,216
Just use bartering

1664
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,496
Really if you look at it

1665
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,800
That's not Tommy

1666
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,336
Sophisticated

1667
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:30,176
It's a little bit

1668
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,968
Is not because we were so

1669
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,736
Technologically

1670
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,016
Superior cuz we were

1671
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,344
Is native a

1672
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,368
Most native

1673
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:39,904
Where at

1674
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:46,304
The disease before we ever even got here

1675
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,960
But

1676
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,520
Like archaeologist

1677
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,544
Found that they've had

1678
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
One of these

1679
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,592
Largest

1680
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,360
Cities

1681
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,384
In the world

1682
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,016
This has been fun but let's get back to crazy

1683
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,552
So you

1684
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,320
Heaven

1685
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,088
Giggling

1686
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,112
And what happened

1687
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:13,184
A f****** Delight from you've been giggling everytime

1688
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:18,048
He worried about the Mars colony Corporation

1689
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,840
It is a corporation

1690
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:23,168
I mean come on

1691
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:32,640
Condos on Mars

1692
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:39,808
It's a business Endeavor that is being protected by a black water as

1693
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,600
Super soldiers on Mars

1694
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:44,928
If you want to really look at the Longview that's what's going on

1695
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:50,048
Randy talks a little bit about the actual colonies themselves

1696
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,888
And you're not really allowed to visit the colony I've never been to them

1697
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:57,728
I've never seen them I don't even know what they exactly look like I sent you

1698
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:02,336
Albemarle County Corporation colony

1699
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:06,432
Apparently they have five colonies Corporation

1700
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,224
A Consortium of

1701
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,552
Ghetto Earth base banking money people

Technological Corporation

1703
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:15,648
Government

1704
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:17,440
We're all participating

1705
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:23,840
In order to be part of the operation and to be part of the colonies

1706
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,376
Jackson

1707
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:31,008
Yuno future civilization project

1708
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:37,664
In order to preserve Humanity its efforts extra so

1709
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:47,648
Correct I have never seen the colonies never even been close enough to them to tell you whether they're don't under

1710
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,928
Around or what they look like

1711
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,000
You don't want your

1712
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:52,768
Colonist

1713
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:53,792
Being in

1714
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:54,816
Influence

1715
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,840
Warlike

1716
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,632
People

1717
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,400
Movie Pollyanna

1718
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:07,616
Like people who are born

1719
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:12,224
Winterfell necessarily to know about the others who are up north where the white walkers

1720
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,296
The wall

1721
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:19,904
We have no idea of other

1722
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:20,928
Filipino thing

1723
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:27,328
Resume Game of Thrones coming back soon

1724
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,912
Still will not pick up on those goddamn books

1725
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:31,680
Even if my life

1726
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,704
Dependable

1727
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,240
List

1728
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,288
13 + 5 or good

1729
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,056
2 + 4

1730
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,360
Interesting trends

1731
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:40,640
Just take

1732
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:44,480
Every other book off

1733
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:53,184
I got no time for it I got to refill stuff

1734
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,464
Anyway this

1735
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,744
Next

1736
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:02,144
Part of this clip cuz I've never been to the colonies I don't know what they look like they might be

1737
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,168
I have no idea

1738
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
Carrie Callahan

1739
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,472
Comes back

1740
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,288
With a real nice rebuttal

1741
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,056
She does

1742
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
Okay I respect

1743
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,872
The f*** out of this answer

1744
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,640
Still crazy

1745
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,176
But it's great

1746
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,528
Possible if you're fighting

1747
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:21,088
I mean was there

1748
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:30,816
Battle at the end that actually you know

1749
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,376
Reassigned to

1750
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,144
To the Moon

1751
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,936
But prior to that

1752
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,104
Your brain

1753
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,640
With all due respect

1754
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,432
That's been erased

1755
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:53,088
Call memories that I extracted but I find that

1756
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:59,488
Unlikely at this point since I feel that I've done a pretty solid extraction of pretty much everything like all the chunks

1757
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:04,608
It would be something that would be a missing chunk that I am

1758
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,936
Unlikely that I haven't found that

1759
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:09,216
Rap

1760
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,288
Now that makes me feel

1761
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,056
Terry's right

1762
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
All the more

1763
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:16,896
If you

1764
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:24,576
But his denial of that like

1765
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,368
He was if he was making this

1766
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:27,648
Here been like

1767
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,928
No you're right

1768
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:35,584
He would have attended her baby maybe that's possible even in his denial

1769
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,936
Absolutely not

1770
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:41,472
I've done all the searching

1771
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:45,312
It's possible in my memory has been cleared I know everything

1772
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,360
Absolutely not

1773
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:53,760
That would be more respectable because that is an outright denial this still allows him to later be like oh s*** I do

1774
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:56,064
Remember to call

1775
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,600
If you're dealing with somebody who's in

1776
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,624
Early stages

1777
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
Ulta

1778
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,720
See them

1779
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:05,792
Them questions

1780
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,864
Most likely

1781
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:09,632
Play be like

1782
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,168
I mean

1783
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,472
I don't like cooked

1784
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:14,752
It could be but I don't

1785
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,544
So it's very unlikely

1786
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,592
They feel like they're in

1787
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,128
Control

1788
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:26,528
Praise they don't they're not aware of their own passport of the early onset Alzheimer's

1789
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,296
Could you get

1790
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,576
You had your memory wiped

1791
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,624
Different we don't actually know how many times

1792
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,160
You know that

1793
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:32,928
He's constantly

1794
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,696
Trying to get as much

1795
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,744
So you got to lose

1796
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,584
Restore

1797
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,608
Drive you're going to still get

1798
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,376
Artifacts

1799
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,400
If you are if you got it

1800
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:46,496
You got to ask yourself to how is he going about recovering this

1801
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:47,776
Obviously it's

1802
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,056
Just talking to other crazy

1803
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:52,128
I think

1804
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,688
He's giving me the idea of them

1805
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,456
Machine that

1806
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,480
You are like

1807
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:57,504
Hypnosis or some

1808
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:01,088
I think maybe hypnosis maybe regressions

1809
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:03,136
Stuff

1810
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,160
Crystal therapy

1811
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:07,744
Get to some of his science a little bit later

1812
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:11,840
There's too much

1813
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,120
Too much sodium

1814
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,472
Randy was a hero

1815
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,240
On Mars

1816
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:23,360
Acer valiantly for 17 years and then was in this

1817
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:29,760
Becoming a pilot on the moon for the last three years of battle

1818
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:35,648
Tiberius infiltrate like a Draconian base

1819
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,696
Or something like that

1820
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,464
Something

1821
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,792
That these guys

1822
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,072
Are always the hero

1823
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:48,704
There's no there's no okay I was on I was on Mars

1824
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,800
I ran away from everything I lied

1825
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:56,384
Pissed my pants

1826
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,664
Four different times because

1827
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,480
My friends they were going to get rid of

1828
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,760
Like what

1829
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,808
I'm genetically engineered

1830
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:04,832
To be a super soldier

1831
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,136
Who's the greatest

1832
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,928
I'm too expensive for them to get rid

1833
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:12,768
Some other weird

1834
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,816
Dad and battle

1835
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,632
Everything is so crazy

1836
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:18,656
Everything is

1837
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,424
Absolutely

1838
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:22,496
Is

1839
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,288
About

1840
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,872
His 20-year Tour of Duty

1841
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:33,504
Actually let's skip that set

1842
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,296
Year did you

1843
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,576
Return to Earth

1844
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:45,536
Technically I finished my tour in 2007 but then was returned to 15 minutes after I left on the

1845
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,352
Remember the morning of November 18th 1987

1846
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:51,424
2445 or 3 in the morning

1847
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,544
You were here at least in this 3D reality

1848
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:57,824
7

1849
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:07,552
Did the mission for 20 years and then they told us to Aid reversing thing which I don't think was really anything more than putting

1850
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:11,136
Efficient

1851
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:15,744
Think I'm still 17 with repressed memories

1852
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,080
A bunch of times to so

1853
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:37,504
Maybe hear my original body wasn't my original for a long long time cuz all the parts have been replaced please one point

1854
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,272
Another

1855
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,856
Question

1856
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:42,880
You've got this guy

1857
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,672
You replace one

1858
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:47,232
He's still the same.

1859
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,000
But if you reply

1860
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,024
Place all of his body

1861
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:55,424
I don't I didn't keep this clefable

1862
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,984
Connection in your brain

1863
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,032
The electrical impulses in your brain connection

1864
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,056
Your soul

1865
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:08,224
As long as there's a connection

1866
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,016
Between your brain and your soul

1867
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:14,880
They can just recover and take your brain and put it in the Clone body

1868
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:18,208
Between your brain and your soul

1869
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:21,024
You're like a car that's totaled

1870
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:23,328
Okay so in this last

1871
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,096
Battle videos

1872
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:27,168
He was lucky enough to

1873
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:30,240
Lost a lot of good men

1874
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,520
Buttercup supercharged

1875
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,248
I'm just saying that this has the

1876
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:43,808
It was all a dream

1877
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:48,160
No s*** if you're bringing it back to 50

1878
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,184
2 minutes

1879
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:54,816
15 minutes 15 minutes back

1880
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,096
After you've already left

1881
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,656
But you're still in your

1882
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,728
20 year old 20 years later

1883
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,520
So what they do is

1884
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,800
Kill your old self

1885
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,336
And then put

1886
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:11,200
Well I guess if you left

1887
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,016
2 in the morning

1888
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:23,744
Weeks in the morning there is nobody

1889
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,656
The old body

1890
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:37,056
Right that's what it is exactly the same no one will notice exactly

1891
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,384
Configuration

1892
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,456
This clone would have had to been raised up to the point

1893
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,736
17 years

1894
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,808
If you would have had to time it is

1895
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,576
Exactly

1896
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:55,232
Ortega's cuz time travels Rio you could just go ahead of time travel the body to the right the right

1897
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:58,816
Cara

1898
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,864
Transfer the Consciousness put it back

1899
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,216
Making you young

1900
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,008
Right and he's like

1901
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,032
These f******

1902
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,056
Probably

1903
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:09,824
Just put

1904
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:10,592
Me into a younger

1905
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,896
Clone your dresses

1906
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,272
We make me younger at all this technology certainly exists

1907
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:24,672
Technology

1908
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,208
City Sign was he get a job

1909
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,912
You're not even old enough to drink

1910
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:37,984
And they've erased your memories

1911
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,032
You've got a little bit of regret

1912
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,616
He going all of us

1913
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,176
Whoa

1914
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:52,064
This could be like the Israeli Army

1915
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,600
IVF is part of

1916
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,368
PDF

1917
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,952
How's your GF

1918
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,976
Both Moon

1919
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,000
And Mars

1920
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,792
Little Mix

1921
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:03,584
Totally makes sense

1922
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,168
Is sort of a coda to

1923
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,704
The entire experience

1924
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,520
Carrie asked him how things going on Mars now

1925
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:19,712
You wouldn't if you listen to it too.

1926
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:22,784
Know what's going on there and he wasn't interested

1927
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,088
Little bit

1928
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:30,720
Do you know for example that the reptilians have been completely

1929
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:33,536
Neither one of them are still ongoing

1930
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,840
Do you know that kind of information do you have

1931
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,632
Ongoing Intel

1932
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,192
Or are you completely detached

1933
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,216
This time

1934
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:49,920
Well I can certainly tell you that the last time that I was on the moon within 2007 I remember the closing Sarah

1935
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:52,736
Ceremonies that they had for the returning officers

1936
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:59,136
Good2Go so

1937
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:04,512
But they've changed about Luna Operations Command

1938
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,120
The last time I was there

1939
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,144
Now I do

1940
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:16,544
Regular intelligence report weekly intelligence free from the Brigadier we have conversations on a regular basis

1941
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:18,336
So I feel like

1942
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,872
When I know I have to

1943
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:26,272
My people are telling me the truth on and there's certain things sure I can use my own abilities and I can remote

1944
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:34,720
I have to double-check but I still take them

1945
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:40,864
He's psychic abilities

1946
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:52,640
But there is a brigadier. We're going to learn a little bit more about him in the future

1947
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:54,432
But so what

1948
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,968
You get the weekly update

1949
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:58,272
Like briefing

1950
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:00,832
Which seems like it would be outside

1951
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:03,648
The purview of this organization

1952
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,696
And probably doesn't want him to be

1953
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:08,512
Remember

1954
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,280
You must have

1955
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,096
The brigadier's the man on

1956
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:15,680
The thing as

1957
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:16,448
He tells it

1958
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,472
He

1959
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:19,008
Clearance

1960
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,312
Requested that you make

1961
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,336
This information public

1962
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,920
The Army the secret programs that he was in

1963
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:28,736
The reason that it's fine for him to be talked about

1964
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:29,504
Speaker program

1965
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:32,064
Is that they requested that he starts

1966
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,648
To disseminate the information cuz he want they want to get the public ready

1967
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:39,744
Okay so he is like the tip of the spear internal

1968
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,024
He's coming over

1969
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,304
He's coming out to the crazy

1970
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,072
He's right now

1971
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:44,608
Yeah and then they'll be

1972
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,632
Steady

1973
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,912
Trickle

1974
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:47,680
More of these

1975
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,960
He's coming out until we get them

1976
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:49,984
The mainstream

1977
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,568
Finally when they're in the Stream

1978
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:56,896
Declassify all of

1979
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,944
And we'll all have

1980
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:02,272
Prepared

1981
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,808
Technology

1982
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:12,512
No I was oh I bet you would call him

1983
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:18,400
Anybody who's been on Project Camelot

1984
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,936
Would probably still have a

1985
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:22,496
So

1986
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:23,520
Hear it

1987
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,312
2000

1988
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,104
Now

1989
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,152
Hebrew

1990
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,176
Set the 2

1991
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,200
2007

1992
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,224
He lived through

1993
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,504
The same 2000

1994
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:35,808
I don't know

1995
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,880
I'm tired

1996
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:47,328
I feel like a it's very difficult and exhausting to try and wrap your head around like

1997
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:51,936
Of course I mean

1998
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:54,240
His play has been preparing for this

1999
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,264
Tire life I've read

2000
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,032
Watched

2001
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:59,104
Earth makes it a

2002
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,920
Future than the 27th

2003
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,968
He experienced original

2004
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:07,808
Influence

2005
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:11,904
So that that makes

2006
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:14,464
He was on

2007
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:15,744
The Moon

2008
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,304
Was there

2009
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:19,840
The other him

2010
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,120
The other clown

2011
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:21,888
Now

2012
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,680
Simultaneous

2013
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:30,848
Is

2014
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,896
And this is what I can't find evidence

2015
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,480
He ever in the military in real life

2016
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,552
Or is all his service

2017
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:42,624
This other time streamware clone came back

2018
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,160
15 minutes

2019
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,208
How could you

2020
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:46,976
You put him in the

2021
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:48,768
Right

2022
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,560
He was he was raised

2023
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,120
And he is a

2024
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,656
U.s. Marine

2025
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,192
Send

2026
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,800
The people who trained

2027
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:05,408
Give me back when he was like 13 before you went in the portal

2028
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,432
I guess

2029
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:12,064
I don't know

2030
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:12,832
Look him up

2031
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,112
Unless they

2032
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:14,880
Didn't look

2033
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:17,952
Typically go out of their way

2034
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,536
Atlanta versus real world

2035
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,328
Yes in real world

2036
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:25,888
He wouldn't be able to get into the military because

2037
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:27,936
Uggs for kids

2038
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:34,080
Contract set the army with the Army would be able to see

2039
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:39,456
He's a clone of this traveling super soldiers

2040
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,992
Is it only in the brain

2041
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,016
Or we

2042
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:44,064
What's going on there

2043
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,600
Fully genetic

2044
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,624
I mean otherwise how would he get

2045
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,928
That's true

2046
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:49,696
You have some kind

2047
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:53,792
People believe that everybody

2048
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:55,584
Remote viewing

2049
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,864
Okay

2050
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,704
Alright that's not necessarily super powers as much as it is like

2051
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:05,312
Spotify

2052
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:07,616
You genetically

2053
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,640
Engineer the original

2054
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,200
But you build the Clones

2055
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:12,480
From the original

2056
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,784
From the pre genetic

2057
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:20,160
Brightright moving his

2058
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:21,440
Is embryo

2059
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,048
U-Save part of it

2060
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,864
You genetically engineer the other one that

2061
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,888
What you need the super-soul

2062
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,680
You use this

2063
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:34,496
So then when the super soldier comes back

2064
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,520
Kill the Supra

2065
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:39,360
Put his brain into the regular

2066
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:42,944
Who's really dicey though cuz then you've got to make a sort of habit of

2067
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:43,968
Killing super soldier

2068
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,296
Receive

2069
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,088
No but I mean it would be difficult

2070
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,392
There super soldier

2071
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:56,256
Bourne Identity

2072
01:42:57,536 --> 01:43:03,680
Stupid let's not expect this to go to H

2073
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:05,472
You had no idea

2074
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:15,968
Okay one more listen to before we

2075
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:22,880
You know I'm also a military officer when I can grab it with my hands and it's very very real to me

2076
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:27,744
With my hand and I can't stab it then it has

2077
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,024
Celebrities me so

2078
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,304
I presume

2079
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,752
Terriers want to help the process

2080
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:46,432
And I provided a lot of information to me that has been honest and truthful and helpful and the other folks as well

2081
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,224
So he has a chain of command

2082
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,040
What's going on on Mars now

2083
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:53,856
This is

2084
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:54,880
This is very

2085
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:56,160
I don't like that at all

2086
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:56,928
Fly

2087
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,208
Because he's already established

2088
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,048
Multiple times about the job

2089
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,704
Why would you

2090
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,472
You assumed they were telling

2091
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,264
I don't know

2092
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:13,568
Duchess

2093
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,592
You should have a

2094
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:15,360
Much healthier

2095
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:18,688
Considering

2096
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:22,016
To use psionics and you can remote view things

2097
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,600
Think about the Brigadier

2098
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:28,928
Yes and here is where he explained

2099
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:29,952
Situation

2100
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:30,976
Hey before you

2101
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:34,816
Into a crazy for

2102
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:39,168
Best Buy Theory

2103
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:47,104
Let's see if you agree with me or him

2104
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:54,528
He goes by the name of Brigadier General Julian smile I can tell you that

2105
01:44:55,040 --> 01:45:01,184
Names on your driver's license when he goes home at night and there's a name on his you know drivers

2106
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,512
I think when he goes to work every day and they're not necessarily the same thing

2107
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:16,800
But that doesn't mean that that's you know the name on you know his

2108
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:19,104
What's a pseudonym

2109
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,128
MCs

2110
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:21,408
Us

2111
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:23,968
United States Marine Corps super soldier

2112
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:25,248
Probably

2113
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:30,624
Because that's part of

2114
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:31,648
Super soldier program

2115
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:33,696
We're right but if that's in Fantasyland

2116
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,512
In the real world timeline

2117
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:39,840
If we

2118
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:40,864
He just

2119
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,168
Slept through the night of November 18th

2120
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:44,960
And woke up

2121
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:48,032
You know did some drugs

2122
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,312
Maybe add some

2123
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,336
False memories

2124
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:54,944
If you go to therapy if you don't

2125
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:59,552
Theoretically credible person if you are not careful about it

2126
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,832
It's very easy to employ

2127
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:01,600
False memories

2128
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,720
Exactly

2129
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,744
People

2130
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,280
Jail for

2131
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,560
Life for crimes

2132
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:11,584
Did not even have

2133
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:12,864
Yep

2134
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:17,728
My theory would be that that is what

2135
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,032
He has full memories

2136
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:22,848
He's turned them into a very robust narrative

2137
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:23,872
That is fun

2138
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:28,480
Fantasyland timeline where he was a super soldier

2139
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,504
Did not exist

2140
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,808
He is found on the internet

2141
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:33,088
Who agree with him

2142
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:35,392
Brett and have their own narrative

2143
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:38,208
Decided to work together and combine

2144
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:41,792
And reinforce each other one of them is a brigadier general

2145
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:43,072
Who has a fake name

2146
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:44,864
Brigadier General Julian

2147
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,424
Great faith

2148
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,264
The good fake

2149
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,824
Briefings in this at all these

2150
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:54,848
Data

2151
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,128
Dumps to him

2152
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:58,176
That are just some other guy

2153
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,968
Reinforcing his narrative

2154
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:02,528
Informing him of bars

2155
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:03,552
Wonderful

2156
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:04,576
No the other day

2157
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:06,880
That's not it's sort of where my brain

2158
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:09,440
I don't know if you're different

2159
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:10,464
But that's where I'm at

2160
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,488
I like

2161
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,560
I will say this

2162
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:16,864
I would

2163
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:19,936
ReDiscover

2164
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,472
Exactly

2165
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,496
When he got

2166
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:25,056
Yeah

2167
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,080
That's what I would like

2168
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:30,432
I don't know if I'm aware of that I don't know I'm not going to

2169
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:32,736
Do too much more digging on him

2170
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:36,832
I will I will tell you this

2171
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:37,600
Good

2172
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:42,208
But I can't find evidence that he was actually

2173
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:42,976
In the military

2174
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:45,280
But

2175
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,560
I did find

2176
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,328
A GoFundMe

2177
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,608

On February 3rd

2179
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,424
13th of this year

2180
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,264
A GoFundMe

2181
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,312
Looking for $70,000

2182
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,872
Okay bye

2183
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:01,920
That's a new car

2184
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,944
Then you might be asking

2185
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:03,712
What the f*** is

2186
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:04,480
Is he trying to do

2187
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:06,528
I'll tell you what he's trying to do

2188
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:08,064
He's trying to create holographic

2189
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,600
Regenerating Medical

2190
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,696
Wait why do you need the

Overcomplicate

2193
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:25,984
In Randy's heroic efforts to help research and develop Earth's first holographic regenerating

2194
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,520
His funds are running low

2195
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:30,592
To continue his awesome Endeavor he needs your help

2196
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:33,664
This $70,000 gold will help bridge the gap

2197
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:34,944
What's

2198
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,224
Kramer has these fun

2199
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:36,992
His mission

2200
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:39,552
Sanctioned by the Brigadier General

2201
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:43,904
Is to bring together large investors to employ full-time medical engineers

2202
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,440
Computer software engineers

2203
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:47,232
Security Services and other personnel

2204
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,768
And a team of

2205
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,560
To develop his first prototype

01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,496
Memes that

2210
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:03,872
We as the Earth's population can finally have access to a technology which

01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,152
Regrow limbs

2212

These funds are needed right now

2216
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:24,096
Play head only

01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:26,656
Field commander Randy Cramer

01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:31,008
The sooner we can reach this goal the sooner we can all get access to these amazing

2219
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:34,336
Elysium style holographic regenerating Med beds

2220
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:37,152
According to Randy Cramer

2221
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:39,968
Holographic technology

2222
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,528
Cheaper

2223
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,552

I love this

2232
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:58,656
Infomercial why is this

2233
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:01,728
The the

2234
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:03,008

2235
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:07,872
Give me a

Restart

2237
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,432
Regrowing limbs

2238
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:13,760
It would absolutely every single thing

2239
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:16,064
Even the things that are modern science can't

2240
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,856
Not only can you fix everything

2241
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:23,488
We're very excited about that

2242
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:26,816
It's not even

2243
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:33,216
80 contribution that was the largest capitalized

2244
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:37,568
Life-forms

2245
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:39,104
Now and in the future

01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:22,112
Hologram

2263
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,392
Why do you knead challah

2264
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:26,720
Also

2265
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,376
Edit on that cop

2266
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,144
Maybe a little

2267
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,472
This is this was started in February

2268
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:39,008
You going to create

2269
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:40,544
Things that will regrow limbs

2270
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,848
Cure cancer cure everything in the world

2271
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:43,616
Is the most important

2272
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:46,432
How much money

2273
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:49,248
482nd down

2274
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,904
Your family a little bit more there bro

2275
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,512
That is good

2276
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:02,816
Soda Springs

2277
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:04,608
End of our exploration

2278
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,888
Randy Cramer

2279
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,448
Interesting because this holographic

2280
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:10,240
Regenerative

2281
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:13,312
Is very much the sort of stuff that Alex Jones talks about

2282
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:15,104
He talks about the life expect

2283
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,128
Technology

2284
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:22,784
That the globalist they don't want us to have

2285
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,856
I am

2286
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:28,160
So is kind of

2287
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:29,952
Because I was never specific

2288
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,232
Think about the kind of life

2289
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,256
Centra Technologies

2290
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:39,168
Person is promoting on the internet

2291
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:43,776
Yeah

2292
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:44,544
We're about it

2293
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:45,568
Can you get mods

2294
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:46,336
Right

2295
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:48,896
So that's one similarity and then

2296
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:51,712
Alex is allowing a guy like Steel

2297
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:52,480
Mr. Steele

2298
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:54,272
Come on is Joanne.

2299
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:56,064
I'm specifically talk about bars Bass

2300
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:59,392
Well you just explained another

2301
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:01,952
Figure in the world of weirdos on the internet

2302
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:03,232
Who

2303
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,280
You know issuing knowledge

2304
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,888
But

2305
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:13,216
There's been a lot of torture

2306
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:18,080
This almost feels like

2307
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:19,872
Jordan

2308
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:26,272
Which makes me suspect this next episode that we do

2309
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:27,808
It's going to be

2310
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:32,416
Horrific

2311
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:35,232
It's more like you made it through David

2312
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:37,792
Here's that

2313
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:40,864
I mean that was

2314
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,656
My primary motivation.

2315
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:43,424
Turn out that way

2316
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,984
I'm glad you enjoyed that listeners

2317
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,008

2318
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:49,312

2319
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:50,592

2323

2331
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,104
Secret space program

2332
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,432
It is

2333
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:27,456
It's kind of tragic

2334
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:29,760
Original gin

2335
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:32,832
Let me get through this

2336
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:37,184
John Rappaport was on the show on Thursday

2337
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,768
He was just saying the exact same things you said in the episode that we cover

2338
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,072
He's just

2339
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:46,656
He spent like 40 minutes talking about how the DSM 4

2340
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:47,936
Doesn't have any blood

2341
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:50,496
So he's

2342
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:57,664
Just a hologram

2343
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:58,944
The real

2344
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:00,992
It's f****** dead

2345
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:07,136
What's the new sign up

2346
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:09,440
Holding

2347
