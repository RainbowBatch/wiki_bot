The disaster anyways

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744
Shadow looking motherfuker

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,024
So I shared it off

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,400
Indeed I also know a lot about Alex Jones

10
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,288
Is today April 16th in the Life of Alex

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,432
But before we do that we got to give a shout out to a couple of our new donors what's going on out there

12
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:57,088

With a nice little British

24
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,968
The number of people who donated since Alex Jones turned on Trump and we appreciate it so much

25
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,368
It's like their donations of the troops but man I appreciate it

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,928
Shockingly close to like

00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232

00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Cigarette

34
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432

36
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088

37
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,672
Ahmed episode we experienced

38
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
It on his shoe

39
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:44,608
I have not as big a man is Alex Jones

40
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,800
I believe so the other choice quotes were fucktrump and fuckeverybody

41
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
That's a good one

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
She was in

43
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,760
He was in a real bad State on Friday night let's check in how he's doing on Monday

44
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
I still

45
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
Alright okay

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
You're so f******

47
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
This is so frustrating

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,520
Office dirty

49
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,568
Yeah

50
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,664
Somebody was Isis up their dirty a******

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,296
Man this we were talking before the show when I told you there was a reason why I've been down in the dumps

52
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,368
Right I didn't want explain it to you until we got on air

53
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:45,536
This is so lame we had this possibility laying in front of us look like

54
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
A complete narrative shift

55
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,728
After this year-and-a-half of watching him just be a boot-licking

56
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,800
Jerk could finally see I don't think

57
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Outlook

58
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:02,432
I don't know I've heard some people on in our Facebook group who are speculating of like

59
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,296
A return to the Alex of the path to tell you there is no Redemption

60
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,440
Holding Out for something different

61
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
Mewtwo

62
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
At the end of the day

63
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,607
It's just not his nationalist

64
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,143
Yeah

65
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,519
I wanted something different I wanted a new flavor to it

66
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
Experience instead of this

67
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,895
This job has been feeding me for all this time

68
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
Idiots

69
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Inopportune

70
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
It's so disappointing

71
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
Weird for me to say

72
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,159
Nationalist

73
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
Garbage

74
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
F******

75
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
Trump loving

76
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
Kyla of

77
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:01,055
Disappointed as much fun as we had with the

78
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,383
You like him freaking out drunk and Leon are

79
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
I still I still thought it was

80
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
Petrolatum stupid

81
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
At the same time you like

82
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Hi

83
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,879
Right this moment

84
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
You would have been awesome

85
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,999
You know what though I don't know I can't figure out exactly what this

86
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Situation is

87
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
Is Rodger Stones not on this episode

88
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
I don't know if you like

89
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
Got a call from Member something

90
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,215
Money is money backers were like

91
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
I think it's not I think

92
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
I think that he's still holding out some like

93
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
You saw what I could do there

94
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
Little bit of Jack

95
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,575
And I'm going to be

96
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,695
A lot of the coverage of it was like how stupid is Trump he's lost

97
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,535
Alex Jones

98
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
Took a little bit of a hit I think

99
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,119
Isaac

100
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,983
Know who Alex

101
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
There was a possum

102
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
I don't know you're right

103
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,943
Realized

104
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,807
No one else likes me anymore except for trumpf and what am I going to do

105
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
He's the best I've got

106
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
Rand Paul is not elect

107
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:25,279
Even if you went back to him cruise is a disaster you can't go back to him

108
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,095
Play nobody else on the global scene that Alex

109
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Shift and B Bhai

110
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,703
All he could do is go solo again like he had four

111
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,287
For a long time exactly

112
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,871
Money's exactly

113
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
But I do think

114
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
He is back

115
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,295
More or less being like

116
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
You going to ride

117
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
I do think

118
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
Vet

119
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Heave

120
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
He's cut himself out a little bit

121
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
Bye-bye going back

122
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,423
He's also a think everyone who doesn't actually listen to Alex Jones

123
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
Is missing out on the larger narrative

124
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,823
And that is I think Alex Jones is about to lose his goddamn mind

125
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871
Turn this into an actual cult

126
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
Yeah like

127
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
He's gone

128
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,527
So close to Towing the line of Infowars being a cult

129
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
Listen to this first clip

130
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,623
I think it's the introduction of like

131
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
Things are things are not good

132
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,511
Most children out there

133
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
Society is collapsing

134
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
And it's going to get a lot worse

135
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,543
We need rehab from cell phones when he rehabs

136
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,127
Resorts

137
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,455
Do TV news papers

138
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
Call Ray Gun

139
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
Presby and swimming pools

140
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,207
Girls

141
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,887
Indiana

142
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,215
Jonathan post we are dying

143
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,871
Well I mean is he living with one of that guys like legitimately

144
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
How quick with that turn dark

145
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
Call

146
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
Alex Jones

147
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:26,111
Running a series to watch TV

148
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,695
The outside world

149
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
He's essentially talking about dr. Kellogg

150
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
Yeah

151
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
We're going to go swim

152
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,167
You get two enemas a day

153
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,495
You might as well

154
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
I think

155
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:50,175
This isn't the only time he brings up these sorts of weird fantasies episode

156
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,271
Listen to crying and talking about how we all belong

157
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:59,903
Ready

158
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
Because he's saying I don't even think

159
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
No matter what you do

160
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
You can make it

161
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
In this world

162
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
I think we got to go to the woods

163
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
Or whatever

164
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,519
They got the wrong guy

165
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:23,455
That's why Alex is the

166
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Proud

167
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
Wrote that no there's no way

168
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
The Unabomber that was eloquently written

169
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
Illiterate

170
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,743
You know we've got this like we've got to go to the woods

171
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
Guide of narrative Beginning Witch

172
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
Is not great

173
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
We got to go

174
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
I feel that way sometimes I just don't want to be alone in the woods

175
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
Could you also get a good

176
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
Could you get a good massage

177
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,271
Add Alex Jones Resort probably let me tell you

178
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Massaging my life

179
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,391
And I'll say I'm not Forum overrated

180
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
Throughout my back

181
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
And the time I was a member of

182
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
Jim Adams

183
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
Is there a massage

184
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,423
It was a comedy of errors

185
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:21,311
I was comforted like a 32-year old dude I've never gotten a massage before Zod

186
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,895
Like two years ago

187
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:30,527
Should I get naked

188
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,671
A little bit further how do I tip

189
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
Anyway

190
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Speaking of weird things

191
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
These dudes I got to go back to

192
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
My bread and butter

193
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,679
I got to go back to what made made and that is

194
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
Classified

195
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
Call the closure

196
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,287
Believe they're called the penny

197
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,943
Case you are a

198
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Okay

199
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
Alright

200
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,815
There is literally literally

201
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Describe

202
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
He just read

203
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,655
Dune this is one of my like

204
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,519
Least favorite things about Alex Jones is be like

205
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
I'm out now I

206
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
I can't look into this

207
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
But I can tell you that everything that

208
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:06,527
Camaros near like growing organs inside pigs and stuff like that

209
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Does not involve

210
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
Brainless animal tanks

211
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
That part that part

212
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
Slightly unreal is

213
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
Let me ask you a

214
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
18

215
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
Really just kind of

216
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Insulting

217
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,447
Like women wasn't raised cow like a

218
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
Euphemism literally workout

219
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,895
Putting a brainless can you put them in there

220
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
That's it

221
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:42,623
Classify

222
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
Would like a a little agony

223
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
Scary Mary

224
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,559
Right behind growing organs in animals

225
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,631
Eunos flight human genes and them

226
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
For the purposes of growing

227
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Organs that can be transplanted

228
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
Another

229
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
But it's not bad

230
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
It's about that

231
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
If nobody

232
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
I will say is that he's going on

233
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
Trouble trouble

234
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,087
If true I would like to see that classified information Alex cuz

235
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
I'm going to be honest

236
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
I would like to see

237
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,999
So Alex clearly also intro clip

238
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Is waffling on Trump

239
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,839
But UE speaks a little more on it

240
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Where are you

241
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
Support President Trump

242
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,687
Trump literally said IMA global

243
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
What also happened

244
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Today

245
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
In regards to Trump

246
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
And quote on quote

247
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Hating

248
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
The globalist

249
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Is it

250
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Situation

251
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,303
It is that he

252
00:13:54,815 --> 00:14:00,959
Alien

253
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:07,359
We don't mess with Russia for any reason ever

254
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,711
About that and willing to believe it Nikki Haley

255
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
Something prematurely

256
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,575
I'm willing to believe that possibility but in the same time

257
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Why wouldn't you do that

258
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,183
Good question I don't know

259
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
It's weird anyway Alex

260
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Trumpet Santa

261
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
I am saying I'm a club

262
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,775
Finally done some basic things that are good for the economy in the country

263
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,895
Like a b**** but he starts going sideways in their agenda

264
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
It's the global Awakening

265
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:49,087
Elisabeth I am loyal to

266
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
EBay

267
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Pressured

268
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,191
There's the old

269
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
That's not good

270
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
If your guy is at

271
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
That's stupid

272
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
Goddamnit Alex

273
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
You got it

274
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
Yeah

275
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
Haha

276
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
It makes perfect sense

277
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
That's exactly why

278
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Busy thinking about these brainless

279
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,927
Cows

280
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,999
Brian Williams Stockton

281
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,839
And now you can get that that

282
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,167
You know you can go for a second ride

283
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
As it were

284
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,519
Government is

285
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,079
Always been pitching the account

286
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Get some of that

287
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
Get the Rocks off with bombs and

288
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,991
Right

289
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:54,111
He's really tough Ontario at the same time

290
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
F*** off

291
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,463
What are you talkin about

292
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,535
He says my Lord my allegiances in my loyalty lies with

293
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,607
With the populist nationalist movements around the world

294
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Putin

295
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,519
She's

296
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,591
Fantastic ever bring up

297
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
Is populist and nationalist

298
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,223
Well he's right

299
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,575
Nationalist

300
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
Never bring those up

301
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,903
No I mean except for the white ones in Southside

302
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,463
Staffordshire the sweet Flanders

303
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,767
Even know where South America

304
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,911
Does he know what populism is code for you know what nationalism is code for

305
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
He knows what nationalism

306
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
I don't think

307
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
You should ever use the word populist

308
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,079
It's so infuriating

309
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:52,735
Maybe cuz it's know that triggers you use to describe everything it seems like

310
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
People are angry about

311
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:02,463
So I don't disagree with you but it was Brian Williams pissed off at Bryant

312
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
The f******

313
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,559
Visit my allegiances

314
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
His nationalist movement

315
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
Proto-fascist

316
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,215
So it's

317
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
If that's what you're into worldwide

318
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Boy

319
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
I tell you what

320
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
Proto

321
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,175
Welcome or aspiring cuz most of the Lost

322
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
Worcester election

323
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,063
You can be a fascist there's a civilian and it's fine

324
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
Listen Marine

325
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,903
You can be anything you want to be when you grow up

326
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
That's not what her dad would say

327
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
Susan a wonderful French private

328
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
That's cool where they were

329
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,495
Absolutely appalled

330
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
At her behavior

331
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Right right

332
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
Something about it is falling again

333
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
Today

334
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,015
What we talkin about started earlier in the show talking about Alex

335
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
Wanting us to be like

336
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
More troubling than Alaska

337
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,839
Save yourself

338
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,399
A month

339
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,823
Nope

340
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:28,223
No 450

341
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,039
Super wrong

342
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,695
Modern world

343
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,959
Actually I am a Cancer

344
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
That is already got it

345
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,359
Blue

346
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
Elliptical

347
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:11,231
To get off Electronics we got to go to Alex Jones Resorts around the world it's

348
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
Isabel to make

349
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:18,911
Make it through life with these liberals all around you if you homeschool your kids there's no

350
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:24,543
Alex Jones

351
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,823
Which is

352
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:32,223
An accurate reading of the pilgrims history

353
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,415
Absolutely a religious supremacist

354
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
Make him go to somewhere else

355
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
But then you get the Israelites in Egypt

356
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,375
Are you enslaved bro bro bro

357
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,287
The metaphor might be liking the tiny bit

358
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
What were the

359
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Anybody

360
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
Anybody who's done Annex

361
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
That's that is

362
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
Bestest

363
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
What record

364
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
What's your favorite exit

365
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:14,463
I don't know it was kind of boring

366
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
They just wondered

367
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
For 40 years

368
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,071
I like that though it's not about the destination

369
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Truck Journey

370
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,215
He's probably pretty close

371
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,567
To like pitching himself as a modern-day Socrates I think we might be close to

372
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
To that can we make

373
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
Well to be fair

374
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,735
Yeah no no

375
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,551
It was more like they were like

376
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:45,951
Please leave please leave if you don't leave we have to make you drink poison we don't want you to

377
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:52,351
We're always glad he's coming be like we got a boat for you but you can view

378
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,727
You got you got found

379
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,775
He got found guilty and then

380
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:04,639
Choose your own punishment

381
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,943
Right eye is like I think you guys should

382
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:12,063
Feed me for the rest of my life but we're killing you

383
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Jack

384
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,672
Yeah that's one of the things that I've always liked B fascinated by about soccer

385
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
This is like people

386
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
Thinking he was kind of too

387
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
Just a questioner that was like

388
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,936
I just like to provoke

389
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,520
The Socratic method is being like you asked

390
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Bring people

391
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:36,384
To their own understanding it's more like the guys like

392
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
Yeah just

393
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
That tone hadn't

394
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,832
To develop sarcastic

395
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,648
So we covered it

396
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
It's nauseating.

397
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,000
Detail the Friday episode we turned on Trump

398
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,536
Here's his take on it on Monday

399
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
But

400
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:11,200
He's talking about the like Twitter clips that we heard of him like screaming and put like that key doesn't apologize for the

401
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,808
Trump has Isis up his dirty a******

402
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Isis

403
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,880
I were screaming obscenity

404
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:23,488
To the point where Owen Shroyer had to remind him we're out of delay

405
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
Control myself a lot

406
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,264
It feels good to let yourself have an outburst occasionally

407
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,104
13

408
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Because

409
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
If they can start to turn Trump

410
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,392
1 degree that can turn him 100 days of grace

411
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,672
That's also not great

412
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
To say about your guy

413
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:59,072
Compromises

414
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
You just said

415
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,656
If you turn Trump 1°

416
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,240
He is weak and pathetic and we'll go all the way

417
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
Easily

418
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,360
There's no there's no like Trump is going to meet you halfway there's either

419
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,664
You get a little bit of a

420
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,968
Armor and then you get all

421
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
No

422
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,320
There is no possible what are you saying

423
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
A great degree is

424
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
My boys

425
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,304
He can be a dictator

426
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
But your boy can't govern

427
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:38,240
Also he can be very weak

428
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,056
Screaming about sucking on a ding dong

429
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,104
Apologize

430
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,224
Stone with a beard

431
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
I mean Rodger Stone

432
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Yeah

433
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
So

434
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,672
The International Community is largely of the Mind

435
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
That

436
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,768
The gassing took place in Syria was

437
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,328
Done by Assad or Subs forces

438
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,376
Absolutely

439
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,680
I think our position I like our position

440
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,728
In the best in terms of

441
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,544
Heather might have an oversight on it there might not have been who knows

442
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,360
Who's answers are impossible to know really

443
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:19,712
Kinds of stuff I I feel like a lot of people discount the fact

444
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
That

445
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,760
Everybody

446
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064
A kind of s***** at their jobs

447
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
One day of the week

448
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,440
Expression the fog of War

449
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
Like Frankie

450
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:35,328
It's entirely possible that the people in the helicopter who were dropping those bombs

451
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
Are the plane or whatever we're just like

452
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,728
We labeled

453
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,776
I think that's

454
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Too easy an hour

455
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,664
Are they in the planet

456
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,480
There's also put on the other

457
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,320
The first rule of Syrian Boy Scouts

458
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
Be prepared

459
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
Chemical weapons

460
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:03,488
There's also story this coming out today I believe

461
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Amsterdam

462
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,072
About Russia blocking

463
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Investigators

464
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
From looking at the

465
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
Besides

466
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Confusing

467
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,360
Is it because they also helped cover up the the sites themselves look that way

468
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,640
Alex

469
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,456
In the middle of the show accidentally reason anti-russia

470
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Headline about

471
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
God.

472
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,296
Situation

473
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Does a rug with clothes

474
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
Okay

475
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
The road was blocked

476
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,904
If this two-lane road is blocked guess we're done

477
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,208
Different story

478
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
Really easy to

479
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
You know sauce out

480
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
Roblox

481
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
Very different

482
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
From

483
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,472
It's like on the it's like when I'm are on the red line

484
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,544
And they're like there's going to be delays because there was a chemical

485
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Open the tacit

486
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
Chicago and State

487
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,408
I know it's

488
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,064
It's a real Chicago commute

489
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,088
12 minutes

490
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
Yeah

491
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
I'm sorry I mentioned

492
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,464
Up top that

493
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,768
Profound I don't know what he's doing he might be hiding out

494
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,328
Haha it's entirely possible

495
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,608
So Alex has got to get

496
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
The motherfuker

497
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
Fill out the show

498
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
Gerald Celente on

499
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
It's kind of boring

500
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,800
It's another it's a continuation of

501
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
The Joel skousen

502
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
An appearance from Friday

503
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
Tell me I'm a good boy

504
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
Gerald Celente

505
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,624
No no point bad it's not your fault I needed that.

506
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,440
Yay

507
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
And look

508
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,000
I like that you're supporting him

509
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
You know what you go back

510
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,912
250 on it

511
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
He just wants to talk about trans

512
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
And money markets

513
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,080
Some stuff like that

514
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,920
Vicky

515
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,480
Watch that video and then the next day was like

516
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,136
A man has to go into work on Monday

517
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:46,304
Video on Saturday

518
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
Also is being like

519
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,008
Backbone

520
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
So

521
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
So weak

522
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
So weak

523
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:06,272
Low energy

524
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Still said

525
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:13,184
He has on here on Mondays show is a gentleman

526
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,488
And Paul Craig Roberts worked

527
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
In Reagan

528
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
Treasury

529
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,608
Undersecretary in the treasury

530
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,472
And we'll get into some other troubling pieces of his history but

531
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,872
Here is a clip so once again

532
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,664
On the info

533
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,248
Exactly

534
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,112
Clearly Young

535
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
Underoath

536
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,512
From the military security complex because of his original

537
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,840
Normalize relations with Russia

538
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,312
And all the other

539
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,104
False accusations

540
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,992
Trump into a militarist position

541
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,088
That's something

542
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
Really good

543
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
Thought

544
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
In the way that he's dumb

545
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,792
But it is it is

546
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,328
Trusting. Whenever you

547
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,912
Taken how many you hard right Russia Hawks

548
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
There are in there just like

549
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:35,616
The Cold War Radar National Security advisor

550
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,664
Find the Cold War

551
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:44,064
Turn right so let's just keep on doing that

552
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,136
This is another piece of the equation that we haven't really discussed

553
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
Nearly as much

554
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:52,256
And that is the Fulton is also a kind of anti-russia hawkguy

555
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,584
So is introduction into the fold

556
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
Probably has

557
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
Creeped out Alex a little bit now

558
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:02,240
It was worried before cuz he had an apparatchik

559
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:07,360
It right like that before but now I think he's got to be worried about that and a couple of things

560
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,640
By Bolton being like

561
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,456
F*** this guy he's been in for a week and now we're boss

562
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
Now

563
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,272
The other take on that is

564
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
Is Bolton is

565
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,600
Actually the janitor from the Looney

566
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,648
Kansas possible

567
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:24,256
I think that's one of his early goals

568
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
Still a little darker

569
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:28,608
So the other thing we need to take him to account I

570
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Is important is

571
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,912
Paul Craig Roberts

572
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
His written for

573
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
And Russia Insider

574
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
At least 24

575
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
I also

576
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,152
Batman sets 2016 he's written

577
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,688
For Alexander Dugan

578
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Think-tanks website

579
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
Container

580
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,552
So

581
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,976
I think he's got. I can use a regular gig got a full staff and they all mysteriously pop up on Alex Jones Show

582
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:59,328
Seriously

583
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,120
So here's some of the articles that he's written

584
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,656
For Sputnik

585
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:06,496
Will Putin realize that Russia holds all the cards

586
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,312
Washington is destroying the world

587
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,640
American government cannot be trusted to tell the truth

588
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,200
Washington is defaming Vladimir Putin

589
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,504
Putin calls out Washington

590
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,368
Is the Atlanta strategy to attack Russia

591
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,416
Justin that headline

592
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
We have

593
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
The Atlanta

594
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:31,584
Versus urania you have the Eurasian ISM narrative coming in

595
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,632
Or even just in that headline

596
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
These buying into that divide

597
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:41,824
Just on just based on the headlines I would give him a 500 batting average

598
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,360
Stuff that makes

599
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,640
Sawyer

600
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920
Hey

601
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,480
American government to tell the

602
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:54,880
Write the truth it's different when you're saying that on a podcast for like apropos of nothing

603
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
Making a

604
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,208
Statement and when you're doing it on

605
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,024
When you're writing an article for a site

606
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,328
I do it right now this

607
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
Podcast will be over

608
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,704
Cuz I will be opposed to that

609
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,264
I'd be very opposed if you did that on

610
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,944
And MSNBC npri

611
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
Bri wood

612
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,528
Well one not be allowed on a I'm too loud

613
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
We get some rating

614
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Cloud

615
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
Baby like

616
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,232
The difference between

617
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
Places that are legit state-run

618
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,888
Media and places that aren't

619
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,752
Yeah I was going to say

620
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,128
Like in America

621
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:54,272
Media is beyond listener funding has Grant and endowment

622
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,856
It's from the government stuff like that you know there is like a voice of America in

623
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
Change it like that

624
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:03,488
Clearly isn't using NPR

625
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:09,888
It seems it seems like there is a pretty solid Fox News control over the entire

626
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,192
When the president

627
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
Boxing

628
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
Friends and is like

629
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,824
Those are some good policy ideas we're not in a good place

630
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,872
So here's some more headlines

631
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
Braces written for Russian

632
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:27,296
America America have no unifying moral culture it will lose a war with Russia

633
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,600
Will Russia wake up

634
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,648
The West seeks its destruction

635
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
Okay so

636
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,512
Alright seems like he kind of has a Russian

637
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
Apocalyptic

638
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,120
He's really Apocalypto

639
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Ciclavia

640
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
I can't imagine why

641
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
Also

642
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:49,824
Also interest you believe in the pre-trib Rapture I think Now's the Time to let it

643
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,664
Trivia is a

644
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:59,552
I think that 288 play timeshare one of Alex's Resort

645
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
Yeah

646
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,624
The great Investments

647
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,928
Deed I've heard that on timeshare commercial

648
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,744
I'm taking away from this

649
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Is that

650
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
You've got call Craig Roberts

651
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
Coming in

652
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,864
Tell a Galaxy Note

653
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,984
More relaxed Russia is a good guy there's a good actors here which believes anyway

654
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,544
I only talk about

655
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
More less

656
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,152
That's the driving you look into his past

657
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
She's written for

658
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Russian Publications

659
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,248
Incredibly anti-American things

660
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,784
For a very long time

661
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
Is weird

662
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
I mean it's not it's

663
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
It's

664
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
Definitely

665
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
Not a trend we have not seen

666
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
But it is it is

667
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,424
It is one of those things where somehow it is

668
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
Far more

669
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Effective

670
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,752
To have a guest on

671
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Echoes the s*** that you've already

672
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Neco it back to

673
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:59,200
It's kind of it's kind of almost a pressure

674
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
Oh no

675
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:09,952
Call PCR we need we need we need some of that good old Russia didn't do it

676
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,024
Yeah you can do that or you can call Shaggy

677
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,632
Hayward

678
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,496
Thought I saw you with a cylinder

679
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,336
Biogas in Europe

680
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:32,224
In my country people guess you all right

681
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
Jack off speaker.

682
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,832
Are free

683
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,624
Nashville Springfield

684
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,952
Our friend Tyler Snodgrass

685
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:48,352
Like I used to write jokes for him back when he before he moved to Chicago

686
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,656
That's not your private information

687
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,216
Talk about it

688
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,800
But the show with the blue room in Springfield I believe

689
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,616
The place and jack off

690
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,408
Came out to the show because

691
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
And it was

692
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
Embarrassing

693
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,832
I just watching people want to come talk to you

694
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,136
Nothing against the legend of the game

695
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,696
He's a legend

696
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,720
I don't want to f***

697
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
Can go

698
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,560
Like getting the crowd to talk to Yakov Smirnoff

699
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,960
Just your being a fanboy for yakoff well

700
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:30,336
Are you okay boyfriend I respect him I don't think I don't like his comedy respect

701
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:34,176
I would like to see

702
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
In a picture

703
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,624
With his arm around your shoulder giving you the thumbs up if we could go back and do it all over again I would like that

704
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,952
To exist but I'm going to try my Principe

705
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,704
Where is he from I don't think it's

706
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Yeah

707
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:07,712
I never thought to look into it

708
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,272
I never cared

709
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,856
Former Soviet Union but he wasn't actually from

710
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
Mainland Russia

711
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,440
The timeline matches up with entirely possible

712
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,256
The show you also brings in

713
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
The man

714
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
The mail

715
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
Doctor Steve

716
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,424
You just like

717
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
He just wants Alex

718
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,776
The shut up kind of I think right I like it

719
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,336
Why do you have to have your Outburst but like

720
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,432
I think at this point he was kind of sick about

721
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,248
Kind of I think he wants him back

722
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
Trump

723
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,856
Because that's the easiest status quo for him to defend

724
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
Is a good footing

725
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,696
Realized

726
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,512
Without Alex Jones credibility goes away too

727
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
Cuz he's not on anyone else

728
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,400
How old is

729
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,448
I'll put them in at 6

730
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
Be something

731
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,568
Yeah so this is healthy 60s really Steve's last

732
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,640
Like if at any point

733
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,992
Time if

734
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,552
Neuropathy

735
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Media Forum

736
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,392
Know if he's if he's not involved with me

737
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,416
With Infowars

738
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,696
He can't roll with the

739
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
Steve is enrolling

740
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
With it

741
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
You could

742
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,864
Oh yeah I think you could

743
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,424
Yeah I think he could but he would be the one

744
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,240
He said that he's leading divorce

745
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,056
You had a man like he be able to manipulate our

746
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,384
Alex's next wrinkle will be

747
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
Probably see

748
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,432
Steve pieczenik

749
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:49,088
Okay I'm not disagreeing with you I'm just saying what if you like him so easily

750
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
I mean

751
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,976
The two of them kind of fight a little bit

752
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:55,744
Just heard of Beltline

753
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
Get up there neither of

754
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,352
No one's in a good place post Friday

755
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:07,008
Right you're alright

756
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,128
Just left everything because it's it's

757
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
Something to be associated with

758
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,944
Alex isn't a good place to go

759
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Because he realizes

760
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,016
Can't get that off the internet

761
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,064
Nope and

762
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:27,488
Really need to go back into the Trump campaign

763
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,280
Talk about that

764
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,840
Interview

765
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
Incredibly

766
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:33,888
Is it

767
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,936
Has opened up a new

768
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
Finishing school

769
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,008
No that would be that would be

770
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:43,360
Every single resorts

771
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:50,272
Yep yep

772
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
Call their mothers

773
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,696
That is not

774
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,024
So what

775
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,888
Is appearing with

776
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
A painting behind him

777
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,776
The painting has

778
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
I watched him

779
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
A while back

780
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
I don't know

781
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
I don't know

782
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
I was I was worrying

783
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
I've seen

784
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,392
People talking about the suffix

785
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
Afterwards

786
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,584
Now that's not cool

787
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
We'd been assholes but

788
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
Yeah

789
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:47,872
So Steve appears on behind him that is

790
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
Heavily breast it

791
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
There's titties

792
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,736
Okay

793
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,296
A slightly pornographic image

794
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,600
Of a guy coming down

795
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:01,440
Some sort of figure grabbing a woman with her breasts

796
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,488
Stout anyting credibly weird

797
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,768
And they don't bring it up

798
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
For the first segment

799
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
If Steve is on

800
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,376
I'm guessing Steve had to pose for a long time

801
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,424
Fortunate

802
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,728
Absolutely did this on purpose

803
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,776
Did this on purpose

804
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,568
He's broadcasting in front of a f******

805
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,640
Square behind him with huge titties on it

806
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,688
Purpose for sure

807
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
OK Google Play

808
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
Alright

809
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,320
Was he also broadcasting from an 80s car wash

810
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:34,720
No set up to save the Rex know this is his office know Alex finally brings it up and I think it's

811
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Invalidating

812
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Number 11

813
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,424
And then they're just always

814
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Corruption

815
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:55,967
Friday's

816
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,575
I couldn't

817
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,327
This one out of the sky right now

818
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,199
Okay

819
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:33,087
Earth goddess Christ figure

820
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,463
The struggle

821
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,679
Even though

822
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
God

823
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,239
Alex the art critic

824
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,311
I want to go to a museum with Alex

825
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:59,711
I want to go to a museum with Alex Alex you are invited to the MoMA

826
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,015
Chicago

827
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,807
Oh that be great

828
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
Nothing but art

829
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,159
So we can invite him to our there

830
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,439
Home Depot

831
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:15,839
Steve correct them what the artist actually about

832
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
That this

833
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,007
I'll presentation from Alex cuz you can even hear him say that satanic deviantART

834
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,591
And then he explains what he sees there he says the end of it

835
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,639
It's the fruit of Satan

836
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
You know cuz women

837
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
He doesn't

838
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
Care

839
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,527
Steve pieczenik has weird art

840
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,855
But that's what he screams about all the time with John podesta

841
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:44,767
That is weird right that means some sort of sick in the head

842
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,791
Art all around

843
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
What is the

844
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
Weird

845
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
I know it when I see it

846
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,703
Exactly

847
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
Like this

848
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,519
Isky

849
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,567
I think Steve pieczenik

850
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,615
Broadcast it in front of that painting

851
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,711
Yeah or not to f*** with his head

852
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
But you like

853
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
That ruin

854
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,063
His argument about John podesta

855
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,647
That whole thing goes away does not care about

856
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,463
I think you subtly trying to undercut

857
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,767
A bunch of us and maybe this is fancy

858
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:21,375
Debugging on my part to Alex VR

859
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,935
But his behavior likes

860
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,983
Very clearly intentionally broadcast

861
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
In front of that picture

862
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
Cuz he broadcast

863
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
In front of a bunch of different

864
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,871
Something in front of

865
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,919
A flowchart of hip-hop artists

866
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:38,271
You know like you broadcast in front of things not like

867
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,807
It does tend to have a little bit of

868
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:45,183
But it's not like a riddle but he has a broadcast from here with this behind me

869
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
Me today

870
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,743
Enticing

871
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,023
Here's my theory and again

872
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
Nothing's back this up

873
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,839
I think the neck

874
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,143
Six months but we're going to see out of Steve pieczenik

875
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,935
He's one by one

876
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:02,335
Providing evidence everything Alex Jones has stood for his been b******* you have to pay attention

877
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,663
Everything

878
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:11,039
Exactly next episode he's going to be eating Greek yogurt

879
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,951
That's what I think is happening

880
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:21,023
It's probably not I'm just bored

881
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:25,631
The satellite of Love basically watching the ship but I like to believe

882
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
Believe

883
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,311
This woman has

884
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,335
Is large breasts

885
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:40,223
But no arms

886
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:40,991
For having breath

887
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:45,087
What if Steve

888
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,111
Like

889
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,183
Laura Jean demond

890
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
Behind him

891
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,815
Another world coming out

892
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,143
Or what if he has that skull covered in semen

893
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,799
Turned it into a chalice it was just

894
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,127
Flavor Flav and get the whole time

895
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,711
It's just behind him and he never mentioned it

896
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,599
Pretty amazing weird

897
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,159
Charlie Sheen

898
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,231
No I was talking about the light reflecting off

899
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,559
Evocative

900
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,375
So if it deals with

901
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,679
A little bit of difference

902
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,959
Like a

903
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,519
We're in this

904
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,079
No man's land of I love hate I love hate Trump

905
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,639
Well there's a Schrodinger's Trump

906
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
What's going on

907
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,479
In this clip Alex's sort of expressing

908
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
The Trump is good

909
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,319
Trump is good

910
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:52,927
Mermaid Inn

911
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,231
Game it's not a smoke-and-mirrors

912
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,447
Pino's

913
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,407
He said stabilizer

914
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
Happens all the time

915
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,975
It sounds like someone bragging about their dad telling a notch

916
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
True story

917
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,167
No

918
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,983
Incredible

919
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,567
It is a sabotage

920
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,591
Here's the thing

921
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,639
The Bottom's fallen out

922
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,991
I don't know exactly what's going on

923
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,807
You could have stopped their great

924
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,111
Debbie great sentence to end with a.

925
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,135
But now

926
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,439
Is the time for Larry Nichols

927
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:03,839
The Comeback he's not on the show but this narrative is weak

928
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
If you need

929
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:10,751
To get away from it all of this means to do what all of the right-wing media does

930
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,543
If

931
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
If

932
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Things don't look good

933
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
Hey

934
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:22,527
What else did we not said about Hillary

935
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:27,391
They were like so it appears that Hannity was mentioned in the

936
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:34,303
What else is going on in the news

937
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,583
Better

938
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:40,703
Mr. blackmailing Congress himself

939
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,751
Boy

940
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,567
He has not been on since we did that episode

941
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,431
Really I didn't even realize that until the other day

942
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
Is fan

943
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:58,111
He has not been on Alex Jones Show to the best of my knowledge and I listen everyday mail Congress

944
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,439
Coincidence of some sort

945
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,975
Right cuz he's thinking

946
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,535
I will be God damned if that isn't hilarious

947
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,607
Feel like there might be a connection between that like

948
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
Ojeda

949
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,935
You did commit a felony on air

950
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
And no one

951
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:19,615
Listening

952
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,663
Was it our episode or was it his

953
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
What do you mean

954
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,735
Larry Nichols.

955
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:29,599
What are episode out like right after he had blackmail Congress

956
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:38,303
Play rhinoceros

957
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
That's fantastic

958
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,799
That would go on my resume

959
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,271
Look at the contact info for all of these

960
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:04,671
Oh yeah I do know what you're saying I didn't realize that you were asked

961
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,487
Larry Nichols

962
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,279
We brought up

963
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,071
Video

964
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,375
Those were about a week apart

965
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,167
Okay I apologize I did not

966
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
Understand what you mean

967
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
Yeah we do need to call

968
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,311
These fools destroy

969
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,151
More power than we've ever imagined

970
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
Yeah yeah

971
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:30,271
Pressure

972
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,367
He was at the height

973
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:37,439
Again not necessarily torpedoing

974
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,815
Get out of here with you comes back on

975
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
If

976
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,119
We're going to call

977
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,655
Right

978
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,959
Next time he's on it's got to be about how like

979
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:52,287
Map

980
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,919
Now I know that Linda bloodworth-thomason

981
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,455
Is a witch she is a witch

982
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
Alright

983
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,391
You know Trump is good

984
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,671
Glow blister bad

985
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,207
Assad wants to go to London

986
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
I mean

987
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,815
I think there's a really easy way for this to play out

988
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,095
So I could say

989
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
Anything like that

990
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,935
Could just go to London

991
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,311
He could know he

992
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,335
F****** c***

993
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:31,967
Appointment

994
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:32,991
Just like

995
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,783
Oh your password

996
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,879
No nobody's this s*** is true

997
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,719
There's a way to negotiate all of the stuff that like

998
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:47,327
Workout for him if he's just like

999
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,351
Look high

1000
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:52,191
Been fighting bad guys this whole time

1001
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:56,287
I don't want to be a dictator I'm in a bad situation I want to get out of it

1002
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:59,615
Which is xylem and some other country

1003
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,151
He could just leave

1004
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:07,551
Look this is gotten out of control I don't want to be a part of it anymore

1005
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,695
Stupid idea of the you like the Russians

1006
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,975
Facade and our government

1007
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:18,303
Military behind our governments back made this deal

1008
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,911
Putin has no reason not to say that happened

1009
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:29,311
She's already saying the United States is they don't follow through with her

1010
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:33,407
You know their word and stuff like that you're already halfway there

1011
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:36,735
Just come out and validate Alex's argument

1012
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
Why not

1013
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,319
I mean I wouldn't believe them but if you do

1014
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:46,719
If just came out was like dude we negotiated the secret deal behind the government's backwood

1015
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,255
With the American Military

1016
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,559
To get rid of a sod and now they're back

1017
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,119
Checking out that would be the best news

1018
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,679
And if it's true you know he has evidence

1019
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:01,055
Oh yeah officer he doesn't enter into a tripartite agreement

1020
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:07,455
Behind the president of a country's back without some sort of corroborating evidence

1021
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,063
Is the heroes in our military

1022
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,855
Trump is just following

1023
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,951
Everything everything

1024
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,511
Ever said to

1025
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
Anyone

1026
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:25,887
Except of course the oligarchs with prefer

1027
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,191
Recordings not exist

1028
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,751
Yeah we learn about

1029
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
One of the reasons

1030
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,543
The globalist

1031
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,567
Are really bad

1032
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,639
Depopulation

1033
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,415
You find a very small percentage.

1034
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,975
One quick way to research

1035
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,791
Just one small thing

1036
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,959
Things like that which Witcher

1037
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,799
Zombie

1038
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,871
Washington

1039
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,967
I don't need oxygen they don't need anything

1040
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,759
A blowtorch

1041
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
Spell

1042
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,623
What is black light

1043
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,559
Flash

1044
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,543
The globalist

1045
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,103
Watching football and basketball

1046
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,639
Yep

1047
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,407
Is that

1048
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,943
Boy I'll tell you what

1049
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,711
That's fun

1050
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
They're zombie

1051
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:45,759
Buddy

1052
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:50,879
Referencing the one woman's genetic

1053
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,927
Material that was

1054
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:59,327
Henrietta Lacks

1055
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,911
Mutation that made ourselves

1056
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,679
Immortal

1057
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,471
Nearby that does not

1058
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,775
There's some sort of immortality that could

1059
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,799
Be granted by them

1060
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,103
When you talk about cellular immortality

1061
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,127
What that means

1062
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,431
Is that it will constantly split

1063
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:19,295
Are always split more as opposed to a lot of cells they have this thing called

1064
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
Senescence

1065
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,599
Which is a termination

1066
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,135
Point of they're splitting

1067
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:26,463
Keep spreading to a point that's when they they

1068
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,487
They can no longer

1069
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,023
Go through meiosis

1070
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,839
I believe it's also an Evanescence

1071
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,607
Beyblade

1072
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,399
That's cuz it's not a sexual

1073
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:39,007
Whatever but

1074
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,591
Alex is talking about a kind of real thing but at the same time

1075
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,639
Really stupid about it

1076
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,735
So they can't be killed

1077
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:54,367
Except for with a blowtorch probably just from the living dead at Walking Dead

1078
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,671
I don't think that's true

1079
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:59,487
There's so many other things

1080
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,047
Blowtorch

1081
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,119
Well I don't I don't know I think that's just his fans

1082
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:11,007
I'm through the thing is that these cells are like because they don't

1083
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,847
Play Don't Stop dividing

1084
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
Consistently

1085
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,175
B / they're perfect

1086
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:24,575
For research

1087
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,599
Polio vaccine

1088
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,415
You know there's things like that

1089
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:33,023
That they took them and hit them without ever acknowledging that they were take

1090
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,839
Taking from her or giving her any kind of

1091
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,631
Over estate

1092
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:40,447
Or anything like that

1093
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,727
That is a bigot

1094
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,007
No it is

1095
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,799
It is but also

1096
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,127
I don't really

1097
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,919
I don't really understand

1098
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
The rights issues enough

1099
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,503
They took them after she was dead

1100
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,039
It was like discarded

1101
00:56:56,063 --> 00:57:00,415
And so there is an argument that has been made by these researchers May believe it's held up in court

1102
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
But you don't have

1103
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,767
Necessarily possession rights after your death

1104
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,559
Discarded material

1105
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:11,935
It came from a tumor that would have been removed from her that sort of thing so it's

1106
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,471
It's really

1107
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,775
Murky territory that I don't know how to unpack

1108
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,335
I don't like it but I also get it

1109
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,895
Oh I understand from that

1110
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,919
Is a

1111
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,687
Weird

1112
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:26,783
All the elements that are like

1113
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:31,903
For Alex is stupid b******* about like they just want to create

1114
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,695
Cures for themselves not for us

1115
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,743
Do you have polio a******

1116
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
He actually

1117
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:41,887
Does the show The Iron law

1118
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,959
He's been in a wheelchair for 6 years

1119
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,983
People don't know that

1120
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,591
People saw fpr stand up to.

1121
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,871
That's a fair point

1122
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,639
At the fair

1123
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,711
Bear they got your point

1124
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,503
That's why I said it three times

1125
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,807
Like witches

1126
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
Which

1127
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
Which

1128
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,135
The reality of these like

1129
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:05,183
Immortal cells in the Lazarus album

1130
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,207
Stuff like that really interests

1131
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,791
I think there are a couple of strains of them that they've been able to find

1132
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:16,191
But there's literally nothing like whatever it is along those lines just another

1133
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,263
Brainless cow tanks

1134
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,287
Kind of like

1135
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:25,151
He relies on the Taiwan train with couch now he's he relies on the fact that is audien

1136
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:29,247
Not conversant in science at all and doesn't understand

1137
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,807
We certainly stand I mean maybe weird

1138
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,367
Conversant but not

1139
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:38,719
We're the type of people who are conversant in science

1140
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,303
Insofar as we know just enough to get ourselves to say something

1141
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,071
Think stupid

1142
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,095
All right you know

1143
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:47,167
If you gave me a week I could explain this fully but I don't care

1144
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:53,567
We could research it there would be no reason for us to

1145
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,151
Alex Jones

1146
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,943
This is mine and scream about to Isis

1147
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,223
Trump's dirty ass hoe

1148
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:06,623
We covered that but we failed to cover one thing I believe in

1149
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,695
Yes

1150
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,279
From Coast to Coast AM

1151
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,815
A complete weirdo

1152
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,607
Crazy dude

1153
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:19,423
But also made one of those two interesting radio shows

1154
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:24,287
I know you don't know much about coasttocoastam but is a big part of

1155
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,055
Of my

1156
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,871
Love of am talk radio growing up

1157
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,895
Actors on FM

1158
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,919
I'm in Columbia

1159
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:33,247
I love the format of Talk Radio in one of the

1160
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,039
Because of coasttocoastam

1161
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,087
Now granted

1162
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:37,855
Joe Frank

1163
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
Cuz I mean

1164
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,439
You don't know who Joe Frank is now

1165
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,999
He did a weirdo monologues

1166
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,863
I want

1167
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,935
Coasttocoastam

1168
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,703
Brilliant

1169
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,335
Brilliant

1170
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:02,175
Art Bell or George Noory would talk about something

1171
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,455
Really crazy

1172
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:07,295
And stupid laufenn aliens ghost that sort of Shay

1173
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,063
Sometimes

1174
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,087
Conspiracy stuff

1175
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,391
And then they just take calls

1176
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,183
And the callers would be

1177
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,743
But they'd just be like

1178
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,047
Yep you bet

1179
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,071
You bet

1180
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:23,423
Without the anti-semite

1181
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,727
Yeah not over it

1182
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,775
Anyway I'm not sure I'm not sure cuz

1183
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,567
I mean I don't I hate George Noory Paula

1184
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,127
He's good friends with Alex Jones

1185
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,503
Aan is much as

1186
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,551
The passing over like a radio Legend

1187
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,391
When we did that episode about

1188
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:50,303
Project Camelot episode about Courtney Brown remote

1189
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,631
He allowed Courtney Brown to come on

1190
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,911
And precipitate

1191
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
The events

1192
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,727
That would lead to the

1193
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,799
The Heaven's Gate 911

1194
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,895
I'm still like he had

1195
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,479
F****** problem

1196
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,759
The great broadcaster

1197
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,527
Arrest

1198
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,807
Peace are found

1199
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:15,135
Brown precipitated the Heaven's Gate

1200
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
We did a whole

1201
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,743
Really don't understand that

1202
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:26,143
I still Courtney Brown remote viewing an object was trailing the Hale-Bopp Comet and that's where that entire narrative

1203
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:31,263
I forgot that was whenever what's-his-face

1204
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,567
And then he got all

1205
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
Weird about it

1206
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,687
Marshall Applewhite

1207
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
It wasn't his wife

1208
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,247
That was his cool partner

1209
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:47,647
Whatever

1210
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,695
Derailing that

1211
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,791
So Art Bell rest in peace also Harry Anderson died today we miss him

1212
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,119
Glad we still got bull

1213
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,959
Yeah I was really sorry that Harry and the Henderson

1214
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
Was that it

1215
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,799
I'm not making a joke here I did love haryana

1216
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,079
I love Nightcore

1217
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:10,175
Is a great show today

1218
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,247
He wasn't that old though right

1219
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,527
60 something

1220
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,903
The article I read said no foul play was suspected probably are.

1221
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:26,303
Man-Bat what was it was it Newsradio

1222
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,887
No it's not news radio Newsradio

1223
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,791
This is not the media

1224
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,583
You know who tweeted about this

1225
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,143
Alex's ex-wife Kelly

1226
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:09,055
Kelly tweeted that Alex got his start or one of his early pushes was from Art Bell

1227
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:13,663
Alex is literally responding to her tweet by pretending the cheese the media

1228
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:17,247
No one in the media report that I'm not doing any articles about that

1229
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,039
I've literally only see

1230
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,319
Tweet about that

1231
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:24,671
So Alex whatever he wants to lash out at things the Kelly saying publicly about him

1232
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,207
Says

1233
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,767
Look at the media saying I was on Art Bell

1234
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:33,119
Weird I believe he actually probably wasn't on our Val cuz the timeline doesn't quite match up

1235
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,423
Use on Coast to Coast all the

1236
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,215
A bunch with George Noory

1237
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,519
Call Kelly the media in open court

1238
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:45,919
Nobody called it immediate the other day when you like the media is reporting that I was gagged

1239
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,991
Kelly again and I mean we see it

1240
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,271
Throughout the rest of the clip

1241
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,207
But you know what I like art.

1242
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:02,303
Art Bell mysterious narrator of the American Knights

1243
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:31,487
The show bigger for us

1244
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,559
You're just talking about like your

1245
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,583
8 years

1246
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,375
Your Feud with your wife

1247
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:40,191
Ex-wife is making me very uncomfortable

1248
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,471
That I know what he

1249
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
He's talking about

1250
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,287
I can see through this this is not the media

1251
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,591
These are specifically things that she has tweeted

1252
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,639
He's pretending it's the media

1253
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,407
Barry

1254
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,199
Very f*****-up would you doing on air

1255
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,479
Like

1256
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:58,879
He's too much of a coward to just say my wife my ex-wife is saying stuff and it's not true here's the truth

1257
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:04,255
Because it does seem like it is the true that are Bell wouldn't have him on his show because he knows like

1258
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,839
For whatever reason every time somebody doesn't like him

1259
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,607
He's probably like

1260
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,935
Whatever reason they think I'm a

1261
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,751
Piece of s*** I can't imagine why he would let him have it

1262
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,543
No that's my position on that

1263
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:21,663
In this episode we've seen Alex have kind of a weird back and forth with Trump

1264
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,431
Vanilla kefir

1265
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,455
I'm still supporting him

1266
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,271
He's probably corrupted or whatever

1267
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,879
Famous mixed with Alex says something

1268
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,439
M8 slightly familiar to us

1269
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,975
Yes but at the same time it's like

1270
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
If you think he's

1271
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,511
Corrupted you sure

1272
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,535
Want him to do this

1273
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,095
If Trump doesn't move

1274
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,375
With the military

1275
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,191
Number one

1276
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,431
Because we are overrun by Farhan level of power I appreciate it

1277
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,807
You sound like you are

1278
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,831
If he does

1279
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,111
Do this

1280
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,207
Calling for him to do this

1281
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,743
But if he doesn't

1282
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,839
It's like no big deal if he doesn't accept

1283
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,143
I'm not calling

1284
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,959
Walk

1285
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,775
It's a very very top weird line

1286
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,151
Trump orders

1287
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,503
And then

1288
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,807
Alex loses his f****** mom

1289
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,087
Haha

1290
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,111
Then he's like

1291
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,159
Well I mean obviously he doesn't

1292
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,719
Agree with what the military wants

1293
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,999
To do

1294
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:44,863
He wants he wants Trump to use the military to take out Obama

1295
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
Clinton

1296
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:48,447
Like you wants he wants him to use them

1297
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,007
The military to take out his perceived enemies

1298
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,079
Support

1299
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:54,847
A trump

1300
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,871
Just didn't

1301
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,919
Utilize the military in the correct

1302
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:04,319
Directions didn't use it for an internal coup and power grab

1303
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,879
Piss off my good friends in Russia

1304
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,671
And that's what pisses him off

1305
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,695
Alright

1306
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,511
That's not good

1307
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
Do you know

1308
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
Generally

1309
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,887
When is an elected

1310
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,679
Decide that it's

1311
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
It's a good idea

1312
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,263
To use the military to remove his

1313
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
Usually

1314
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,943
Only taking

1315
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:37,343
Literally every example of this occurring in the entirety of human history as my

1316
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,111
Reference point

1317
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,647
But it doesn't go well

1318
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,927
Forever

1319
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:44,255
I would say that I can think of 0 examples of like

1320
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,791
Hey everything

1321
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,959
Well Julius Caesar did and everything worked out fine

1322
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:56,799
Little Caesar

1323
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,335
Is RC

1324
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:04,991
Chavez did everything worked out fine Brazilian government a long time everything worked out fine

1325
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:09,087
African countries

1326
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:19,839
Let's just talk about where the word dynasty

1327
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,887
Witches

1328
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,911
When women

1329
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,679
Glasses

1330
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,239
The more important thing is

1331
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,519
All of that is

1332
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:29,823
Really

1333
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,895
The idea that Trump is going to have military tribunals

1334
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,223
They're sealed indictments on all of these people already

1335
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,015
All this stuff it's all

1336
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:44,415
I really saw this play out with all those other weirdos on on Twitter about like at the beginning of the Mueller in

1337
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,023
We saw all those that bogus as accounts coming out and saying like

1338
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,583
There is 170 sealed

1339
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,631
It's the same game being played

1340
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,655
Just buy the other side

1341
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,959
Write the other side expensive

1342
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:01,567
Believe it or not really on the side of cat

1343
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,103
Russian Ordnance

1344
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,431
It's trickster is

1345
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:11,295
Interesting performance side of

1346
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,575
It possibly

1347
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,367
Really interesting performance art

1348
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,135
But

1349
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,671
It's doing a lot of damage

1350
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:23,071
Sew-in from time-to-time wants the military to get involved

1351
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:23,839
Get some tribunals

1352
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:28,447
Who's going cuz he's heard people talk about that online is wrong course he keeps saying that's what's going to happen

1353
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:36,639
Really works for us

1354
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,199
I was thinking of Desmond

1355
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,247
You too but that was a that was a commission

1356
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,015
Yeah

1357
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,551
For the Truth and Reconciliation

1358
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
Impression

1359
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:50,719
I don't know by the Tribunal

1360
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,743
Is more effective

1361
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,023
Of or or

1362
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,559
Comes to better outcome

1363
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,583
You're totally wrong

1364
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,351
Yeah

1365
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,143
The show Survivor

1366
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:03,007
Is there a tribunal I thought that's what they called it whenever they go to Tribal Council

1367
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,103
No no no that's

1368
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,895
Tripartite

1369
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:12,991
Negotiate

1370
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:15,551
Somehow

1371
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:20,927
That is a massive blind spot in my ability

1372
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,767
Fire history

1373
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:28,095
I think I've always just heard the prefix Tri was like

1374
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,119
Well I can

1375
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:33,727
There's a b after it

1376
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:37,567
So one more clip left

1377
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,847
Alex

1378
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:42,943
Expresses that Trump is probably still good but he's been

1379
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:43,967
Which doesn't work

1380
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,015
From a logical standpoint

1381
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,039
And then

1382
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
So stuffy

1383
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:56,255
I'll be honest

1384
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,143
Are substantially.

1385
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
And

1386
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,551
Because they're not

1387
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,343
They want to destroy a nationalist

1388
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,647
I want to send a message

1389
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,071
They want to send a message

1390
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:37,727
President down and just like Hillary and all them said

1391
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,007
Once I get him out

1392
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,199
I mean

1393
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,247
I'm not afraid

1394
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,855
Response and I'm not saying that jacked up

1395
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:00,767
So

1396
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:03,839
It seems like

1397
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,887
There's clothes

1398
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,911
Open Rebellion

1399
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,983
Boom

1400
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:11,775
Now

1401
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,079
2 years into this

1402
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:15,871
How can you

1403
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,919
Possibly believe

1404
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,479
Has any beliefs

1405
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,039
Whatsoever other than

1406
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,319
Trophies Drake

1407
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,087
I like

1408
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,879
Right

1409
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:33,535
Hey that guy said the same thing that I'm thinking which is that Trump is great

1410
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,559
I love

1411
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:37,119
What kind of f****** mental

1412
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:41,471
Does it takes to imagine that that f****** guy has a bully

1413
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,519
Why

1414
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,055
Why would you believe that

1415
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,847
How could you believe that

1416
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,383
Higher because

1417
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,431
Rodger is

1418
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,223
Rogers

1419
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,271
Rogers very smooth

1420
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:59,647
He's got understand

1421
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,695
I've been thinking about it

1422
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,767
Think about it look at this look at this whole thing

1423
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,583
Like you guys at the beginning of his presidency

1424
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,119
CPP now already

1425
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:09,887
Do you like

1426
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:16,799
Alex is like rich friends happy in my rich friend I want to make I want them to think I'm cool

1427
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:20,127
Alex is like

1428
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:22,943
I'm a globalist

1429
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,711
Animation

1430
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:32,671
Keeps pretending that he's taking a pedophile network but there's no evidence of it in the stuff that we've gone over in

1431
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,951
In the past is clearly

1432
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,719
These sort of

1433
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,255
Annual operation

1434
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,071
Existed for years

1435
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,095
Around

1436
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:43,423
The month slavery and human trafficking awareness

1437
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,703
Like it is

1438
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,727
It's not it's

1439
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,007
Is opportunistic

1440
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:47,775
Weird

1441
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:53,407
Contemplate

1442
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,039
Solve human traffic

1443
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,087
Working this month and then let it go for

1444
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,879
It's weird weird

1445
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,647
Weird

1446
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,415
Weird thing

1447
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,999
Does dismantled

1448
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,535
Just buy

1449
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,559
Time

1450
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,119
Yeah it like you go on long enough

1451
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,655
You Trump himself will invalid

1452
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:18,751
And now we have the only thing he believes in

1453
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,287
And now we have a situation

1454
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,311
Cohen's

1455
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,103
His lawyers

1456
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,151
The office has been rated

1457
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,967
Alex even himself is like

1458
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,271
F*** they probably got a lot

1459
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,951
He paid off seven or eight women

1460
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:42,303
Casinos without being mobbed

1461
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:47,423
Probably done a s*** ton of money you're missing the point

1462
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:53,055
So when we did that September started in September of 2015 or August

1463
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,847
2015 we did the investigation

1464
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,871
We found it to be

1465
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,663
Beginning of Alex Jones is narrative

1466
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,967
With Trump the beginning of his ride with him

1467
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,527
This guy owns casinos

1468
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,551
He's mobbed-up

1469
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
He is a

1470
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:07,391
Frontman for a Consortium on the East Coast

1471
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:10,463
If you get your name is Genovese you go to prison if it's

1472
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,487
It's Trump you don't

1473
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:14,303
Those sorts of things like all of that

1474
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,375
He's never not believe that

1475
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,679
This whole time

1476
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,239
He knew that

1477
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:25,055
He pretended that wasn't

1478
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:25,823
True

1479
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:29,407
It because it went counter to all of his other narratives

1480
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,943
But the entire time

1481
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,479
He's known

1482
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,247
That was

1483
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
True

1484
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,551
And the fact that Cohen

1485
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:38,111
Got his is office rated

1486
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,391
And there's obviously

1487
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,159
Reproof

1488
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,463
It's going to come out of a lot of his stuff and Alex

1489
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,999
Does piss scared about that

1490
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,791
He knows like

1491
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,327
Now I cannot

1492
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:50,143
Pretend that I didn't know that

1493
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,959
I have to be like it's no big deal

1494
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,031
Is a very big deal

1495
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:58,591
Well I mean sure

1496
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:02,431
Paid 1.6 million December

1497
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,199
But who cares

1498
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,223
Who cares

1499
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:07,039
George

1500
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,087
Who cares that's what I mean that much money

1501
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,927
There's a moment as it goes on Sundays

1502
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:17,023
Clint because of these

1503
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,815
It related

1504
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,351
Because that was relevant

1505
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,375
But now

1506
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,191
Since he can't get it out

1507
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:28,799
He can't get it out like he can't explain why this is somehow like

1508
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,663
I just don't

1509
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,431
Understand

1510
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
The game

1511
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:39,039
Like he had the opportunity

1512
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:39,807
Because he

1513
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:42,367
He clearly knows that some s*** is going to come out

1514
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:47,743
And the writing is on the f****** wall coming out

1515
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,767
It's already

1516
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,303
Get it but the point is

1517
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,351
If he came out

1518
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,119
Now

1519
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,911
Then he's out in

1520
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,191
Front and Heat

1521
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,495
They claim even more credibility

1522
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:01,311
Because the other Fox News Fox are going to get f*****

1523
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,639
Like they've been carrying water so hard for

1524
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,223
Like they're all going to f******

1525
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,807
Bb-but you know nothing's going to happen there going to be

1526
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,975
Gear

1527
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,255
Here

1528
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,071
Here's what you don't

1529
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,351
Aren't taking into account

1530
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,631
Whether it's the

1531
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:29,215
Forgetting about it or or negligence or whatever

1532
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,751
Russia's not done with

1533
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,591
And whatever whatever situation exists

1534
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,127
Between those ants

1535
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,407
Because I have no f****** idea

1536
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,967
I think there were a lot of people probably making

1537
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,527
Think about the bigger deal out of the

1538
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,807
The Russia Trump

1539
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:48,671
Connection that may or may not exist

1540
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,695
We bring this up on the

1541
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,511
We are very

1542
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,535
Convince

1543
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,327
We're very clear

1544
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,119
Alex Jones weather

1545
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:57,887
It's because of

1546
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,679
You know some sort of compromising

1547
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,727
Material whether it's money

1548
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
Wreck

1549
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,287
With one of those things

1550
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:07,871
Flattery

1551
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:11,711
He has some sort of allegiance to Russia that pre

1552
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:16,319
It's more important to him than other things

1553
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,439
We which we clearly discovered on our

1554
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,463
2015 South

1555
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,743
Discovery

1556
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,279
From even further back

1557
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,047
But

1558
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:27,583
What

1559
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,423
The reason that he can waffle

1560
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,191
In all of this

1561
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,239
Is the same reason the Trump

1562
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,007
Conseil

1563
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,287
I'm not going to answer

1564
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,055
The sanctions on

1565
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:37,823
Right

1566
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,103
It's that that

1567
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
Is what's important

1568
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:40,639
Alex

1569
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,175
And whether it's

1570
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,199
Because he is dead

1571
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,759
And intellectual purest that he actually believed

1572
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,063
That there a nationalist country in

1573
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,903
That there is a hope of globalism or whatever

1574
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,695
Or if you knows that b*******

1575
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,463
And he knows that he

1576
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,023
I'm selling a line

1577
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,815
That's what's going on

1578
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,631
That's why you can go back on it be like

1579
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,167
Drop baby

1580
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:07,007
State but we got over got to set this out

1581
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,055
They're still

1582
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:12,127
There's still blood to be taken from this Stone as it were

1583
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
You know

1584
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,943
Are all the parties involved

1585
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,223
I don't know

1586
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,015
I don't know

1587
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,063
Some sort of writer

1588
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,343
Walter's garbage

1589
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,879
Look all of

1590
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,647
The ship

1591
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,415
It's come out

1592
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,951
There's got to be some sort of

1593
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,743
Awareness that

1594
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,791
This is going to crash

1595
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:34,655
I suppose the only the only thing that I would say if

1596
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,679
If your

1597
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,447
Russia

1598
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:38,751
And you have this investment going on

1599
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:42,079
Regardless of whether or not

1600
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,127
Freeshop regardless of whether or not

1601
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,663
Trump is aware of any

1602
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,687
Collusion

1603
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:47,967
Collusion

1604
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:55,391
RoboCop carita propaganda collusion or collusion

1605
01:19:55,647 --> 01:20:01,279
Wasn't it's not it like I'm not necessarily saying that they all got to a room together

1606
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,071
Right

1607
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,095
Perhaps

1608
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,375
Coinciding interest

1609
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,143
Happening

1610
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,935
Simultaneously

1611
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,727
It's like

1612
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,775
The only result of

1613
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,055
Is that

1614
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,336
Trump goes down

1615
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,896
And the only reason

1616
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:19,200
That Russia would still be involved

1617
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:22,272
Is because they think Trump is going to take America down

1618
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:26,624
Sure the only thing that makes sense to me right now

1619
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,416
Boy that's Campbell is look

1620
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,720
Can good

1621
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:31,744
Yeah

1622
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:37,888
Why we should go to the woods but before we do check out our website

1623
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:42,496
Autopart.com

1624
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,288
What are handles knowledge underscore fight

1625
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,336
What if you went to Facebook

1626
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:49,408
You can find us there and also a

1627
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,944
Go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

1628
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,784
Absolutely

1629
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,576
Camp

1630
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,624
This is tough for me it was tough

1631
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,392
2

1632
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,464
Summon the energy to do this but I'm glad we did

1633
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:06,048
I'm glad we made it through

1634
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:07,840
Depression is

1635
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,376
Mo Bamba

1636
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,656
Yeah

1637
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,728
I recognize and I hope

1638
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,008
It'll be fine

1639
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,288
Need a good night sleep

1640
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,312
Imma go get a slice

1641
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,336
Pizza after the shower

1642
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,128
Maybe play a little Zelda in

1643
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:22,944
Try to get my head right that's a good idea

1644
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,968
All those things

1645
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:25,504
Great ideas

1646
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,832
I feel like I've named the last two people

1647
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:29,600
Or so

1648
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,624
I think it's your turn

1649
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,392
2

1650
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:36,000
Yeah I'm going to show the word Tribunal

1651
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:42,912
Text Eddie that is existed in the blind spot for

1652
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:49,568
Better

1653
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,128
The word tribunal has escaped my knowledge

1654
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:58,528
That's infuriating but I recognize that like weeks because

1655
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:01,088
I have to honor your wishes but I do this

1656
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,880
Under protest

1657
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:10,816
Alexandra Thurston color
