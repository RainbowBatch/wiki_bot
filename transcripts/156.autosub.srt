F*** you.

7
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:36,608
Straight up

8
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,680
I put my creative soul

9
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,776
No I don't know the real you did was hours of hours of

10
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:49,152
I know that we both took it hard

11
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:54,528

Trials tribulations

18
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,528
I'm pretty sure every Christian is like

19
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,320
Word trip.

20
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,160
Love it so you could say that we both know a lot about

21
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
A Raptor

22
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
There we go

23
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
I feel like we got a

24
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:59,296

00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Have you noticed

47
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
I don't

48
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,712

00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,600
See the only problem with that reveal to me before the show that today

50
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,256

51
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
Possible

52
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,400
Wait for us to work our schedule. Monday live stream

53
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
Would be Project Camelot land

54
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,032
Because there's a lot going on over there

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,944
Must be covered

56
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,112
That's look for you so you knew coming in that we were going to be

57
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
Very

58
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
Kerry Cassidy has gone to prison and it is now time to

59
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Floresville

60
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,863

62
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,263
Overspace by my ribs

63
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
Of all of those words

64
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
In the same sentence is a delight

65
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,895
Earth Defense Force

66
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
What could you

67
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,991
Possibly get in the eighth installment

68
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
You are so dumb there are so many New Ringgold this is

69
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:50,047
I told you just before we started that I almost f***** around and just play at the entire episode

70
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,655
All over again without nope

71
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,519
Record

72
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:05,151
Tobey Maguire is the Raptors of Project Camelot

73
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:11,551
It was really weird so here's a little out of context drop that I'm going to start off with and just it's something it's important to remember

74
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,367
And he does have access

75
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Okay

76
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:21,535
You remember that

77
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:27,935
Basically synopsis of First 48 hours

78
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,055
She starts off the episode

79
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
Hi I'm carry

80
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:42,015
Gilyard

81
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
Space Program

82
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,463
How to delay because I went to Egypt with the group and so this is coming in

83
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,791
Interview

84
00:05:54,303 --> 00:06:00,447
I took very good care

85
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
Introduction

86
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
So now

87
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
This

88
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
How do you get episode starts off

89
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
Blue my mind

90
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
I think

91
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
She might be talking about us

92
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,319
You have gotten a little bit

93
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,279
It doesn't seem to matter if it's not it's not anything less than

94
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,143
32 assholes are making fun of me now.

95
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:34,751
Basically when I first got there I we talked about the impact

96
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
On him

97
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,591
Some information that he was given

98
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
It had to do with

99
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
People had

100
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,551
Talk critically about him and myself

101
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
And also

102
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,231
Didn't do their research and and so on and he was given some information

103
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Cruise on the internet

104
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:04,447
This is commonplace for us that are part of the internet world but for Mark

105
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
Culture so to speak

106
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,247
He doesn't know

107
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,783
People can hide their identity

108
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
And therefore

109
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
Very badly

110
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
And that's really what

111
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
Going on here so

112
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,775
That's true for World deals are negotiable in this world

113
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:46,175
Who the f*** else is making fun of them

114
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:56,671
I don't see anything posted around on the Internet it's like hey you got to get a lot of thing

115
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
This is crazy

116
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
Banana

117
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,327
I think it's just us consistently talking about how he's a murderer

118
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
Restrictive poor also

119
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
Anti-semitic lady

120
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
Baby when she watches

121
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
Which by the way

122
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
Thank you for joining us

123
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
Frozen

124
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
Speak up in the chat room

125
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
Maybe when she watches it she just sees like a Twitter egg over our faces all the time she's got like a

126
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,831
Browser

127
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
Possible interesting Theory

128
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
Mark's been in prison

129
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,423
For thirty years behind a murder

130
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
It turns out he's had some protection

131
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,919
Well even prison nationalist clearly runs with a dealer.

132
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
Command is

133
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:01,695
I think he was a silly move to another prison

134
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:08,095
Will another part of the prison apparently about how like

135
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,655
Kiesza hanging out with these old dudes

136
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,567
Old man in Portland

137
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
He's right

138
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,967
Early 60s like

139
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
How to use 29 when he got arrested

140
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
I believe so I'm not

141
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
Yes

142
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
Protection

143
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,463
Imprison the best around

144
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
Social Security or not allowing them

145
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
Get parole

146
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
Part of the problem

147
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
Prison system

148
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
It's very problems

149
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Really barbaric

150
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
He believes he was put into this

151
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
These quarters

152
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
Silence him

153
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
And he only feels

154
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Said he's alive

155
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
Because of the Hidden help

156
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
From his friends

157
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
The Raptors

158
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,319
Make sense okay

159
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:05,183
Okay they could

160
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:12,863
Guardian angel in him didn't help from a Raptor

161
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
Respectable

162
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
If people send him money

163
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,847
However chocolate from the commissary then that's how he pays them for their help

164
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,647
Accurate

165
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:42,047
You walk into the great room to meet your aunt

166
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,703
You better not be holding

167
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
We've wrestled with

168
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:55,359
The high level of bulshit that's blowing out of Mark Richards mouth about why he's not

169
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
Like gotten out of prison

170
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Because

171
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
Theoretically he's got

172
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:05,855
Super high connected friends

173
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:12,255
Fireworks level display of b*******

174
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
The Raptors can create portals

175
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
Keep in mind that he hasn't

176
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
And a family

177
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
Including his wife Joann

178
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,031
That he loves and this is why he

179
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
Tolerates the situation in

180
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
Instead of leaving

181
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Ingram portal

182
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Sure

183
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Actually could be

184
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Facilitator

185
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
Nope

186
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
And so he used

187
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Very dedicated

188
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
To his wife and family

189
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Cool

190
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
Yeah

191
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Boy

192
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,279
Anybody who has access to photos and does not overuse them Noble

193
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
Noble character

194
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,631
Very restrained

195
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,703
I could get out of prison with my rat report

196
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,543
Couldn't you get out of prison and then just get back into prison

197
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,103
Viaport how about like

198
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:04,991
Demonstrate like you don't have to get out of prison with a Puerto Ricans go to the other room piano

199
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
Really clear some stuff up

200
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:13,695
He's not making all this up cuz he's a board murderer

201
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
It never fails to Delight me

202
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
The reason that all of this is happening is because there is a board murderer in prison

203
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,847
Tricked

204
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,431
He might also be cute or not

205
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,759
He's not but listen to this

206
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
As far as

207
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
Arrest and

208
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,415
Tribunals offshore he agrees this is happening and not being

209
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Reported in the main

210
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,815
Military

211
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Appearing also

212
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,399
This week

213
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
Interview he was taught

214
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
Talking about

215
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Pilot to Edisto

216
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
Appeared in

217
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
An S8

218
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
In Antarctica

219
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,247
Easy US ship to Priscilla

220
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
Due to the journalists who would

221
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Reports

222
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:19,231
Journalist.

223
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
Who are attacked

224
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
And probably saw something

225
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
They were not supposed

226
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
See

227
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
And their minds were wiped

228
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
For the news

229
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Porter Scott

230
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,567
Access to

231
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,383
All the time

232
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
Is awesome

233
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Like

234
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,879
What was the F-18 event

235
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
The flight was it out of

236
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Look

237
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:57,375
One of the best parts about these episodes is I have no responsibilities to look into this

238
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,447
Definition of describing

239
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
No one's going to report about it cuz of course you can

240
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
Here's why it's really exciting

241
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
But she brought up Antarctica

242
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
Because I

243
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,439
Know a little bit about this

244
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
Specific

245
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
Or just Antarctica in general

246
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,839
Looks Leighton exquisite

247
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
Or not

248
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,191
Play the next clip and then I will explain what I mean by this

249
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,543
Man Mark also has to have the internet

250
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
YouTube

251
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Season watch

252
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:43,455
Hollow Earth and videos

253
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
This time and

254
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
He said regarding an R

255
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
And multiple

256
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Problems

257
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
She said the Nazis in New Berlin

258
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
Are still there

259
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
Refers to them as fast

260
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Easter

261
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
Distinction

262
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
And

263
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
The ruins of Atlantis are being revealed

264
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
And study by the US and Russia

265
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
This is the last

266
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
Human alien civilization

267
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
For humans an alien

268
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
We're living together

269
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
Openly

270
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
Hey guess what spoiler alert

271
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
If you're working together on a

272
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Study Atlanta

273
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
She got a look

274
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
Trust the alien

275
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,751
But verify the secret alien knowledge that is leftover in Antarctica

276
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,895
But it never end never goes out of style

277
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,015
Underground in Antarctica

278
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,063
Wait what does Halo Wars ship

279
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,647
This is straight-up Halo Wars

280
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Yes

281
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
Underground distinction

282
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:04,095
Cortaca March whatever

283
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,263
Regularly visit Antarctica

284
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,967
The hollow Earth theory the people put out there

285
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
Yes there's always knots

286
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,135
Applied to geography

287
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
So there's a hole at the bottom of the Earth

288
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:35,583
You can go inside it

289
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,447
Also have

290
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,895
Ambassadors over governments they have their own embassies on Floors

291
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,295
Within the already go to the 13th floor most places

292
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,087
F****** New Berlin Embassy

293
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
Is

294
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
Just literally

295
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,023
Just as reasonable as a superstition about the number 30

296
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,887
So that's the oldest closure I do have a bed about

297
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,935
John Quincy Adams believing that the Earth

298
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,263
The Admiral bird out their dick

299
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
That does come up

300
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,639
Carrie talking about how

301
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
Has diplomatic ties with

302
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
America

303
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
There is lots of contact

304
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,575
Between the Nazis in New Berlin and

305
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Our government

306
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,159
There are several hundred thousand who are Mass

307
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Simply rich

308
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
Pictures of minerals

309
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
Denture like

310
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:46,751
I'll be honest that would mind their

311
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,919
Real baby there are rare earth minerals

312
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
Where the f*** else do you think Alex gets his iodine clearly aligned with the fascist in Uber

313
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:08,255
Alex Jones believes in Hallowell

314
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
I like Hollow Earth stuff actually like

315
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,887
In terms of clearly

316
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:18,239
Wrong beliefs

317
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
Like this video

318
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
Truck like an hour

319
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,919
And not be mad

320
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
Hollow Earth

321
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,015
Hollow Earth frustrates me because I want

322
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
A

323
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
Mathematical certainty on

324
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Halo Halo

325
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,719
Like how many miles

326
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
For some reason I can't get over like

327
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
How thick

328
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:48,191
Do you believe the crust is this is there and he wanted to pick you up you want

329
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,519
How much it's the Sun

330
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,847
For the hollow Earth

331
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,943
Inside the Earth

332
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Forgot

333
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
I've had some issues

334
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
With the holiday stuff

335
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:13,023
I understand it there's like external gravity so it's like gravity pushing at work

336
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,863
We're walking on the crust of the earth and then like

337
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
The Outer Sunset

338
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
Exactly

339
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,263
We're not sinking into the Earth

340
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,311
Because the inner earth gravity is pushing

341
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:30,943
Bro

342
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,855
Find and it explains why you can't fly over the poles

343
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Hold on there

344
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:44,511
My favorite part of the hollow Earth

345
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
It's not just

346
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
That the Earth is Hollow

347
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
There's a hole

348
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
Made

349
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
For us

350
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,567
What are you talkin about

351
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,615
Right it's always the whole

352
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Why

353
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,199
Because that's how it is b****

354
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,551
Open doesn't make any sense

355
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:15,487
You make a golf ball with a hole in the top of the bottom it's a bad structural design

356
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,303
You should know that everything is awesome

357
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,447
Is Halo everything is all up

358
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
Chocolate

359
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:33,151
I can come back to Chocolate forever

360
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,807
Here is Mark Steyn

361
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,231
Who is also a Stargate

362
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,863
Are the most energized for Texas on the planet

363
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Checks out

364
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,191
Regarding inner earth Mark thanks a lot of

365
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
People are at

366
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Actually seen into

367
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
Earlier versions

368
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,567
Right

369
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Stargate

370
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,455
Why is that a feature is that a bug

371
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Reason

372
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
Is there a point

373
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
I will say

374
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
Gain or lose from

375
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:19,232
I will say that there are a number of times I believe one of them is right after that where she says

376
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,536
I should have asked for clarification

377
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,120
3 * 3

378
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
Yeah yeah you should have

379
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,496
So we always think of the best

380
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
Comebacks after

381
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,360
You know she was talking to him and then

382
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,384
And a day later today

383
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,992
Start a flight to Egypt

384
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,088
So I don't remember

385
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Right

386
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
Cuz they're powerful vortex

387
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,560
Find checks out

388
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,352
The polls

389
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
Lubbock does that make sense

390
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,424
Satisfied

391
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,776
Hollow Earth

392
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Where do they come

393
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
Poop

394
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
Target

395
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,320
Also why is it

396
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,136
But you can see into an earlier version of Earth

397
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
Through a Stargate

398
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
It's a date

399
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
Traveled

400
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
Between the Stars

401
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
Here's the thing

402
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,960
Alright in order to do that like there's a parallel Earth that you're seeing right

403
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:39,360
Parallel Earth where you also have to travel in time while you

404
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
Alright

405
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,920
It's complicated

406
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
I think

407
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
It marks his watch

408
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
The TV show

409
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,136
Actually

410
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
Parallel

411
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
I referred him to a

412
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
New series that.

413
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Called

414
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
Ants called counterpart

415
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,984
Which is really

416
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,080
Love Deluxe Princeton

417
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
Stargate

418
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
You also have

419
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Time travel

420
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,480
See

421
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
When creating a

422
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Parallel

423
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,112
Strangely enough

424
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
The creation of

425
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
The parallel

426
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
In a time travel required

427
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
Actually

428
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
Just like

429
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,584
The storyline of stars

430
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,936
Right

431
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
So that's quite fascinating

432
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
Sounds like perhaps

433
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
Producers over at counter

434
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
Said information

435
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
In from the secret government

436
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:49,760
And I will just

437
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,832
Throw this out here as a possibility maybe

438
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:58,720
Describe to him the entire plot of the sticker show counterpart

439
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
That sounds right

440
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,352
She secretly has stores

441
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,704
I feel like stars doesn't come on

442
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,800
It probably cost more to not have stars

443
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,920
Also I completely

444
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
These days

445
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,160
Put my grandpa hat on

446
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:34,816
So I forgot to bring this up there's a new wrinkle to carries Mark Richards reports

447
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,632
Has she started putting a little like

448
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,800
Hirons kind of like a little single pop up like talking about New Berlin

449
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,992
There's two that I think are amazing Want You misspelled China

450
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,272
G+ chenia

451
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
Come on

452
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,672
Take a little time

453
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,720
What you talking about Antarctica

454
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
You spelled

455
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
Dash

456
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Arctica

457
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:10,656
I should ask him about this

458
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,824
It probably could have saved after the entry

459
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
?

460
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Just like

461
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
Antarctica

462
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Wait

463
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Ants

464
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,416
Right

465
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,488
Leads me to believe she didn't study Latin

466
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
90 point

467
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
You did study ass

468
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
It's true

469
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
Answer

470
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
They are

471
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,264
It being a

472
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,408
Oh yeah well we can

473
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
Stuff to say

474
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,760
Barbie

475
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,320
He's a big fan of Tom Skilling

476
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
He's not a fan

477
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,928
Of our present

478
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
President

479
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
Because

480
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,144
That's a positive development well it's because you can

481
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Castration

482
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Soompi

483
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
People in the Trump Administration

484
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
Administration are resigning

485
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
Because they can't handle it

486
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
What's coming

487
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
AR-10

488
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,200
Basically eluding

489
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
Disclosure

490
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
Ethereality

491
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Entails

492
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
Here on planet Earth

493
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
Okay

494
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
If you took like a

495
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:41,536
You just took that inference at the end off the rest of the day

496
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,584
Trump officials are quitting

497
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,400
Because the repair light of what's coming

498
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,192
Bevricks why not aliens

499
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
But

500
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
Sure I heard

501
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Ronnie jacks

502
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,920
When he was read the laundry list

503
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
But he was accused

504
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
And he specifically said

505
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,808
I didn't drive a car drunk

506
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
I did not deal with the rest

507
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
Clearly

508
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,696
That means the rest of them are all about it

509
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,864
Right on, how do you get

510
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
How do you purge

511
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,008
At Trump's rally that you had the other day

512
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,592
Directly and overtly blackmailing a senator

513
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,200
I don't remember any

514
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,504
Nearby

515
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,904
Yes I believe so

516
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,888
You said that

517
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:55,264
God we live in such an insane world the only imagine if Obama was just like

518
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
Mitch McConnell

519
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
You don't

520
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
The fuk up I'm going to take it down

521
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,944
What are you what are we talkin about that that's not the only story

522
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,968
Are you telling me

523
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,296
Add a goddamn dumbass

524
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
Front Page News

525
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,160
What Trump being like

526
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,440
Hey I am going to

527
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:17,792
You ruin your career if you don't do what I tell you to do also

528
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,376
The one that we elected is now openly

529
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:26,496
Unless

530
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,824
Anymore

531
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
Could have been like

532
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,152
All a trick

533
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,456
Goes to Michigan

534
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,016
And pretends he's drunk throwing a rally probably

535
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:44,672
Because he also said Trump said that if he's better

536
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,952
Careful with your second

537
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
I don't

538
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:53,376
I'm paraphrasing a little but

539
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Regular citizen should kill it

540
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,472
Male stuff made me think like

541
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,544
One of his advisers is Larry Nichols

542
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
Nothing Nichols

543
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
I'll take all the

544
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Republican

545
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Amanda

546
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
Democrat

547
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
The Wharf

548
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Does wonho

549
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,464
One hope

550
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
Portals

551
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:23,328
Portals are going to come back up

552
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,632
We have for Humanity to survive

553
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
Yes

554
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
No I think he's right

555
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:37,152
We believed our only chance for survival

556
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
For us

557
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
2

558
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
With the Raptors and

559
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,296
They're princesses step forward

560
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,880
Along with

561
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,928
The fact that they themselves

562
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,976
They also consider

563
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
Prefer to be their Homeworld

564
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,560
And are therefore in the game

565
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
Regardless

566
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,752
There are various

567
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,520
Spider being

568
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
How to get those spiders

569
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,896
There's a different AI

570
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,456
Expanding and there are

571
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
4

572
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
Interested in art

573
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,112
Dave tab Robert Salisbury

574
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Said they are

575
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,440
Twisted in Jupiter and Saturn

576
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,280
Crazy

577
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,216
Hey we like our current home

578
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:39,104
But we are interested in diversifying and if there's something you know we do have some Equity built up

579
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:46,272
Better that we could get for a reasonable price

580
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,672
Go to figure this s*** out if your house hunting you're not going to look at one place don't be stupid. Stupid

581
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,000
That's why there for the Raptor princess

582
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:02,656
Cool

583
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,448

00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,568
Again on the side of the mountain

585
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,664
No that's the nordics were on the side of the dracos

586
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
No

587
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:21,088
I remember those

588
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,144
Does Nordic also include like the Pleiadians from lightbringer's

589
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,728
I apologize

590
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:42,336
The further that the Raptors are actually evil

591
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
Adelaide weather

592
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,920
However now that I know that the nordics are not all

593
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,992
Part of the New Berlin Ian movement

594
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,832
Also just address question in the chat room yes Jupiter is also Halo

595
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,232
Fiery definition

596
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072

597
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:17,152

598
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,944
Easter Bunny

599
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:25,344
For the low rent to a dollar store

600
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,440
Chocolate keeps coming up

601
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
So Jordan

602
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,840
We learned that there's a i threat there's for AI group

603
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,872
You're going to learn

604
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
Billions of dollars

605
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:03,232
You know evil and what have you that we learned about

606
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,816
Put your f****** bike down

607
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
I just want to

608
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
Explain to me

609
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,704
Exactly how we could have four different

610
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,496
Let me tell you this

611
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,336
Can't do it I don't know what the group part means either I have no idea

612
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
No idea

613
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:24,992
The knowledge. Explain AI group

614
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,600
Absolutely

615
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
That's how

616
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,024
Got to trade with the new berliners there is a new character

617
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
Coming in

618
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,376
Never discussed this before

619
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,008
I didn't know what to think what I heard her say these words

620
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,568
If the AI want to take us out

621
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
They first have to

622
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,616
To deal with the gaseous

623
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,176
And Saturn

624
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,784

632
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
And the way they defend us

633
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,424
Buy rechanneling

For incoming ship

638
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,896
Makes sense

639
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,968
Really want that I really want that last fit

640
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,992

649
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
Would eventually have to come

650
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,296
No because they wanted chompa chompa on Earth

651
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:08,160
They want to eat the Earth

I don't

Threshold of what a crisis is

664
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
Are they just

Are they just sleeping

00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
What are we doing here

667
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,232
They're friendly.

668
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,048
They guard the gates

Put capital letters on something it sounds gross absolutely especially when you gesticulated repeatedly

671
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,688
Kind of makes it more real to you

672
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,784
Little bit literal Gates

673
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344

675
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,744

676
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,840
These gaseous creatures

681
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
Because they're being stopped

682
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,128
However

683
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,920
Many are not based in

Everybody around you

689

Good ones we might be

691
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
That might be what Carrie think

692
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
That could be Munoz

693
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,608
Could we know

694
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
I couldn't prove it

695
00:36:54,656 --> 00:37:00,800
You know that's it

696
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,408

697
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,224

Right button until it gets to that item on the list the gaseous beans I think there's like a live-and-let-live

706
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,584
Still life

707
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864

708
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
They're not willing to go so far

709
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
Unless

710
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984

00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:30,400
You know how old Wars in our history have been really did aliens

718
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680

Yeah they've been

724
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,624
Pools at the weird alien machination

725
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,976
In this clip Carrie talks about some boats

726
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,512
The guy had two battles

727
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,560
And

728
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,840
Let me tell you this

729
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:05,472
One of the reasons that you sure that it was aliens and it was a cover-up that they said there were sharks

730
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
Courses

731
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,312
Quote there aren't that many sharks

732
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,456
I brought up several

733
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,480
Famous

734
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
Battles

735
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
He talked about those

736
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,856
The sinking of Indianapolis

737
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,392
In 1945

738
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
There were men in the water they were

739
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,720
Attacked by sharks

740
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
It was actually

741
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
Cover

742
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,072
Are there not that many sharks he said

743
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
Alien race

744
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:39,008
Didn't say which one markers or shortening for Aryan race they were dealing with

745
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
The Liberty

746
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,432
Liberty which was an attack by Israel our ship

747
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:49,248
The Liberty was Archie control center

748
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:54,112
At the time we were a vacillating between helping Egypt and helping Israel

749
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
A Anunnaki on the ship

750
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Attacked

751
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,744
Hold up

752
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
Came from

753
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
Egypt

754
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,840
And he said that the

755
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
He has a bad attitude

756
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
Towards the Anunnaki

757
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
Because he is

758
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,544
In the past and he doesn't like the way they View

759
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
Human

760
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,848
She doesn't trust them

761
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
And this tends to

762
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,200
Perception of what we're dealing with

763
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,760
So she's already

764
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Buyer

765
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,672

775
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,648
This next clip was like

776
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
Oh God does he even know what

777
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
She's smoking staying

778
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:07,328
What is all over space

779
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:13,728
Yeah where does he just get into

780
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:17,056
Martha probably neo-Nazi

781
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,688
Huge Palace in

782
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
Sure

783
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
Immediately was like

784
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:31,392
Going over all of the things that she is asking

785
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,928
And having answered

786
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,000
Why did she just come up with some

787
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
Random ass

788
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Battles 2

789
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,352
Closest to the 8th visit

790
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:45,472
Jesus running out of material please just write and out she's just got to wait Borges

791
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,032
Boom what else do I want to know

792
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:52,895
Elizabeth we got to learn a little more about the Anunnaki and it also accidentally turned

793
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,175
Deeply racist

794
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,735
Anunnaki

795
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,527
Draco

796
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
And this

797
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Makes their motive

798
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
Specious

799
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,927
However most Anunnaki are humanoid

800
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
And fairly

801
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,719
Play tall

802
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,511
The ones here on Earth

803
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,791
Can pass as human

804
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,887
Coloration in their skin

805
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Call boy

806
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Oh boy

807
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,007
I'm going to still go with Conan O'Brien

808
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:25,407
Anunnaki coloration of their skin

809
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:30,527
What do you mean bark-bark

810
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:34,879
Is the absinthe

811
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:41,279
You know damn well he's not what he said

812
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,143
So f***** up

813
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,239
They also have to be tall

814
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:54,335
Which as we all do tall people in Colorado

815
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
No

816
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
I think

817
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,271
LeBron James

818
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,807
Do you do you know how

819
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:10,207
Kerry talked to him for like 3 hours and then these reports are her to reading stuff for like 40 minutes

820
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
I'm just going to guess

821
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:24,031
Did some of the stuff she doesn't report back to Project Camelot is him saying some

822
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,639
Make some weird theories about Dodge

823
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,455
Right cuz that

824
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
For him

825
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,015
Kind of everybody knows that

826
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,367
That goes along with some of the worst stuff you can find

827
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,671
10

828
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:45,279
Worldview

829
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,239
Standby

830
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
Anyway

831
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,823
That's that's really f***** up

832
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,127
But it turns out that there's a hockey

833
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:00,895
Right

834
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
The bus

835
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
German government

836
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,527
There are many Anunnaki and reptoids in the trunk

837
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,623
Administration

838
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Or another

839
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,487
Most of Congress

840
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,327
Some in the state department know about

841
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
The alien presence

842
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,399
And many more in the Pentagon

843
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,423
Are in the know

844
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,983
I asked him about John Kerry

845
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,823
Why

846
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
He said he is

847
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
Probably

848
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
Alien human

849
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,711
Pull up

850
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,783
Just making a note here that humans are hybrids

851
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,575
In this case

852
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
We would have

853
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
John Kerry Wood

854
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
Turn

855
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
Arista

856
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,351
So he's a John Kerry

857
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:58,239
I don't know I don't know why you're shocked and Confused

858
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,919
I told you there's a lot going on

859
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:10,271
How do you have any conversation in 2018

860
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,575
That eventually leads to John Kerry

861
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,135
What is he even doing right now

862
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Hanging out

863
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,767
I don't know

864
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:25,375
I don't know if he's not interested anymore

865
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,727
Is that a news of the cabinet what do you want why were you even talking about

866
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
Alright so

867
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,823
So you're talking about Cary right now

868
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,871
What is that your next Quest

869
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,199
About a man who is utterly irrelevant 228

870
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,247
What is your next question

871
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,295
Say things I read

872
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
Well

873
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,023
Humans are already hybrids and then he goes

874
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:59,423
Hahaha you got me there mark well played

875
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,263
Wild played Mark so

876
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,311
About chocolate on the brain

877
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,127
Chocolate comes back up

878
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:14,783
Do the Raptors love chocolate so much

879
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,087
It's delicious

880
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,111
This

881
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,903
We talked about

882
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,183
Chocolate

883
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
Mark talked about the focus

884
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,279
Of other races on our chocolate

885
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,095
He said there's nothing like it on other planets

886
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,887
If you study chocolate

887
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
The cocoa plant

888
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,447
We still don't know how

889
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,215
Pollinate

890
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,567
What do you mean you don't know how it go.

891
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,103
We don't know how

892
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,383
I do

893
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,271
It's a little flies

894
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,135
Chocolate

895
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,415
They're pretty aware of how it works

896
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:57,023
Does she bring up the European vs American chocolate

897
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
There's a lot of raptors in Belgium

898
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
You should know that

899
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,655
And maybe

900
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
Semi

901
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
Invisible Knight

902
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,543
It's not it's not an ant or a v

903
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,335
Multiply

904
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
Take the cocoa plant

905
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,895
To another planet

906
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
To get it to grow

907
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,271
You know what

908
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:24,671
You got but I imagine that's true of all plants I'm right there with you

909
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,023
Aliens are not

910
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:29,791
A mineral

911
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,327
Or water he says

912
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
Plenty of gold

913
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
Asteroid

914
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
Fairy wings come here for

915
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,215
Things we make

916
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,519
Luxury items antiques

917
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
Things that beauty

918
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,359
My note

919
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,639
Obviously our

920
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,687
Sir

921
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,503
Antique

922
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,135
There's two things I know

923
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,207
How do you know the color that have you don't know tanaki

924
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,767
Color that's good

925
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,815
Antiques Roadshow

926
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:08,447
Favorite show is the Raptors

927
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:22,015
Armoire

928
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
Bulldog

929
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,767
Are you telling me this point is from 1910

930
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,303
Jack Briggs

931
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,839
The trip

932
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
That my friend

933
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,655
Stromae

934
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,775
Also

935
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:50,175
If you're looking at that list of things that you talking about gold fits like with they like things of beauty

936
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
Antiques

937
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,087
Oh man oh man

938
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,463
Alright

939
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,511
What happens when they go to Red

940
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,887
Probably didn't even know

941
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,447
They probably

942
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,239
Answer used to time traveling

943
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,031
Insulate a can just assume

944
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:18,847
You are used to

945
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:26,271
Doesn't the very concept of an antique become ridiculous that that's a problem

946
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,831
Season of itself

947
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:35,231
Nonexistent any further because it is always existing in the same present moment that's a problem for me

948
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,767
Logic

949
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
But you need

950
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,351
Before we judge too harshly

951
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:44,959
We're going to get a little bit of a backstory going for the rafters

952
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,639
The Raptors know more than we do not because they're smarter

953
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
Because they are a space

954
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,943
Bearing race

955
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,991
Cool seventh-rounder of

956
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,271
65 million years

957
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
And

958
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,831
A real quick

959
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,623
Where is that number from

960
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,183
Jurassic Park

961
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:10,815
Jurassic Park movie 65 million years in the making

962
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:19,263
Who is this

963
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,287
Have the Raptors

964
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
Is there actually

965
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,359
Match the Raptors

966
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
From 65 million years ago

967
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:31,295
So they were already

968
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:35,647
Herded cattle others up

969
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:41,791
To be soldiers isobe

970
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,607
65 million years ago

971
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,423
Earth and went on a journey in Tobermory

972
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
And they

973
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,239
Went into some sort of

974
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,775
Bandit animation

975
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,567
It's not clear

976
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Returned

977
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,895
To the galaxies

978
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,967
Few million years ago establish

979
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,247
The home in the grit

980
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,015
Draco

981
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,551
Galaxy at that time

982
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,367
Technology

983
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
Power there

984
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Chips

985
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,999
I can just slip into an event

986
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Verizon

987
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,559
10-day return

988
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
Okay

989
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
So there was that

990
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
Time Gap

991
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:21,471
The planet they settled on in the Draco Galaxy

992
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,007
Belong to the Draco

993
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:26,847
And when they took it over became enemies of the Draco

994
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,127
And they are at War

995
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,431
Right

996
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,479
Like that

997
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,599
McConaughey and what vehicle

998
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,535
So you good actor

999
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,303
Impact

1000
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
Now

1001
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,935
Dragon movie it's about Dragonheart

1002
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,751
Dragon

1003
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,407
That actually does fill in some of the plow

1004
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:06,015
It doesn't. Suspended animation

1005
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,063
The plot holes

1006
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,879
Funk do they get off of your 65 million years ago

1007
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:16,767
It's not that they're smarter than us it's that they are a space-faring race

1008
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,303
Exactly

1009
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,583
Nelda

1010
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,119
This is so what this is

1011
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
Okay let's

1012
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
Just think of it this

1013
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,007
I'm getting a second Source telling me it's raining fire something

1014
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,287
Confirmed

1015
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,919
So dumb

1016
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:37,759
No. Don't f****** that right don't do this

1017
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,039
Are not smarter than

1018
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,087
Ralph

1019
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,135
Fire a spacefaring race

1020
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,951
Propose a kind of

1021
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
Polynesian Scituate

1022
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,279
Where in

1023
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,583
They can travel across great

1024
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,679
Distance is relatively simple structures

1025
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:02,335
Polynesian

1026
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:09,759
They could travel from aperture stupid to make good boats

1027
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,063
Who is relative

1028
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,367
Same time

1029
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,647
Sturdy enough for them to

1030
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:18,975
Did you just watch Moana

1031
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,535
I did not I watched it a few months

1032
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Fair

1033
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:28,703
Also I've actually it's more I played civilization 5 whenever

1034
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,983
Polynesia

1035
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,543
Bonus where they can always travel

1036
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:37,151
Ocean tiles even though they are even though you haven't developed the

1037
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,575
The thing is whatever analogy you're trying to make is

1038
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,855
Bumpus Bumpus

1039
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:51,743
Getting off the planet is different than making a boat

1040
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,399
Sounds like a compelling argument

1041
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,191
Dinosaur

1042
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:11,199
Do you think they ran into it

1043
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,247
Dinosaurs don't breathe

1044
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,783
Turn up

1045
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,903
The Raptors are good

1046
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,487
According to Mark drakos are generally bad

1047
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
Right even though

1048
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,559
From his own admission

1049
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,839
Raptors

1050
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,399
Colonized planets

1051
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:35,519
Disregarding the fact that there were native peoples living there sure

1052
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,103
Isaac Isaac

1053
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,639
It suggests that he has

1054
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,663
Is actually Eve

1055
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,295
Mark Ritchie

1056
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,343
Is gas-lighting us about

1057
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,487
So the Raptors fully believe there are some good Draco

1058
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,327
But the Raptors and humans are diametrically opposed

1059
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655
Which involves

1060
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Take over

1061
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:09,311
I got bad news for you about humans

1062
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,103
Erase

1063
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:17,503
That is such a raptor concept of like

1064
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:22,623
Is it the same thing as your grandma said oh well yeah but they're one of the good

1065
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,951
Fresh

1066
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
Okay so the dracos

1067
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:37,215
They want to conquer things I've humans and Raptors aren't into that but

1068
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,263
To differ

1069
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:45,407
Every bit of human history would cost

1070
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:49,759
Floors between the Raptors and the

1071
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,039
Spider-Man

1072
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,879
Every now and then so you know how

1073
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,927
And the new prisoner

1074
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:03,327
So you know how we just learned that their gaseous beans and play the last time we learned Aunt being served play

1075
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,119
I knew about the spiders

1076
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:12,799
In this next clip we learn about a whole new group of aliens but before we do we learn something

1077
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,079
Dammit

1078
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,895
About the first lady of the United States

1079
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:23,295
I don't want

1080
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,831
Give away too much

1081
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:31,999
And he says he is

1082
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,279
Controlled by aliens

1083
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,351
He went from being a mediocre millionaire in

1084
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,119
4 years

1085
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,399
Tubing mega-rich

1086
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
His wife

1087
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,215
Is a biological

1088
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:41,983
Call creation

1089
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:46,079
That operates as his direct link to an alien race

1090
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,639
She is his communication device

1091
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,455
Alien race

1092
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,087
Leilani's discussion

1093
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,647
Talk about the bit about the cat beans

1094
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,951
And so on

1095
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:06,559
HopCat beer

1096
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,655
Jobs

1097
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
Cute cats

1098
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,959
Could you be cats

1099
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,727
Trump

1100
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:20,127
Has a wife as a communication device

1101
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,175
Don't know which one

1102
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:25,503
Now let me tell you something right now

1103
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:30,367
Is there a better explanation for why she will not always hold his hand

1104
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,159
What is that

1105
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,695
But a man calling

1106
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,743
And then hanging up on

1107
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
Perhaps

1108
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,071
0

1109
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:44,447
It's definitely not there in a Loveless marriage based on money and

1110
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
Has nothing to do with

1111
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,543
And I know that it doesn't nobody to do with it

1112
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,919
That's still not ruled that out Ivan Mark Richards

1113
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,735
Unreliable narrator in this situation

1114
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,039
He's providing cover for the cap

1115
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,599
I have it on good authority from my friend Carrie

1116
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
Uno's

1117
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,391
Numark

1118
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
It's not there.

1119
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,255
Where to learn about that here in a little bit

1120
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
But first

1121
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:16,447
Terry asked him about the wildfires in California

1122
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
Well

1123
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:23,359
Because the truth about it is pretty wild

1124
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:28,735
Fires in northern and southern California the fires in Northern California War

1125
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,271
Basically a group of

1126
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,063
Juvenile alien races

1127
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:32,831
Who decided to

1128
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,599
Hardy

1129
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,671
Psychology here and devouring human

1130
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,327
This brings in the wrinkle

1131
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:47,679
North-south Civil War

1132
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:54,335
Now she goes on to say I don't know what happened with the self. No idea about the south fires but the North

1133
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,407
Alien print

1134
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,551
Explanation of the other is just

1135
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,575
Atavistic

1136
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,111
Mark was tired

1137
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:12,511
Who knows why this other what's happened

1138
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,535
It makes me eat

1139
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,863
Clear that he's either telling the f****** truth

1140
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,399
Organization

1141
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,191
Super accomplished manipulator

1142
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:23,263
Because if he was just sort of an amateur con man

1143
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:29,151
Yeah

1144
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,943
Allow yourself to

1145
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,551
Appear vulnerable in order for the ability about you

1146
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,599
I'll tell you what

1147
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
I love it

1148
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,159
Fireburn alien prank

1149
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,743
Anycubic

1150
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,471
We don't know that their people

1151
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,495
There can't be

1152
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,359
Pull up on your judgement

1153
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:05,759
Terry was just in Egypt and you know there's a lot of people there

1154
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:09,087
I'm so it could be to be on her brain

1155
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:22,655
Where is it is viceland Vice President of the president

1156
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,239
Longfellow first lady being controlled by cat beings

1157
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,007
The cat being

1158
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
Okay

1159
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,591
But

1160
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,871
Are pretty important

1161
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,663
Mark does tell her about the Spanx

1162
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,039
Their cat people

1163
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:42,367
They were statues

1164
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,463
I think that is correct

1165
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,023
I don't remember.

1166
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,839
There's another influence

1167
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,655
Maybe maybe Marksman watching movies

1168
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,959
This is this is crazy

1169
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,519
The remaining Sphinx

1170
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,823
A human head

1171
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
From

1172
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,431
Cathead and

1173
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
Contact

1174
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,295
On this is a

1175
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
Black

1176
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
Panther cat

1177
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,135
Being called Contessa

1178
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,951
Okay okay

1179
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,327
Mark

1180
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:28,191
I also asked her if she was on 10 yet

1181
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
A lot

1182
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,639
To take in

1183
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,479
With a black panther

1184
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
Cat beard

1185
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,575
Course

1186
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Course

1187
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,391
I love it

1188
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
Take it off

1189
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:55,071
Can't Get Enough

1190
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,863
Now calendar

1191
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,935
Alright

1192
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
+ 1.2

1193
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:10,687
It is certain point it really feels like Mark Richards might be f****** with her

1194
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:21,183
Or maybe this is just his way of trying to

1195
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:26,303
Rationalize a rumble that he had with a black prison

1196
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,375
And the Black Panther

1197
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,423
I don't know I'm driving

1198
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,519
I'm over exegesis thing this unnecessary

1199
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,799
Why does cat people

1200
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:38,847
Also

1201
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:43,711
Michael B Jordan was great in that Egyptian fight

1202
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:45,759
So

1203
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,831
You know recently

1204
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,367
Recently sir

1205
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,671
The International Community

1206
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,695
Decided

1207
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,719
You know they

1208
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:58,047
Good reason to believe that

1209
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,327
Attacked a spy

1210
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,655
In London I believe wasn't right

1211
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,679
But

1212
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:04,959
Get this

1213
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
She wasn't Putin

1214
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,823
Regarding the style Spirit attack

1215
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,127
You said

1216
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:17,503
Reptoids and Draco when a week in the u.s. Russian Britain

1217
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,551
I'm so the aliens continue to pay

1218
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,879
He says Putin is not miss

1219
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:23,647
Messi

1220
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,695
Pills lots of people that with

1221
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,719
Precision

1222
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,535
The collateral damage indicates

1223
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,071
The Salsbury topless

1224
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,351
Carried out by British

1225
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,887
For the alien

1226
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,703
Wide swath

1227
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,495
Either the British

1228
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,823
Orthopedia number of alien races

1229
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,847
Brought up

1230
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:49,759
She is the black dragon Queen

1231
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:57,183
Could be under the sway of the black drag queen

1232
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:57,951
Maaco in disguise

1233
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:04,607
I don't know I don't think a lot of literal dragon

1234
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:11,263
Portsmouth Portsmouth

1235
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,335
Absolutely

1236
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:22,527
Your own player f*** out of here Draco

1237
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,319
Go on Planet Hunters

1238
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,927
That would also being except

1239
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
So

1240
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
I believe it's

1241
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,047
Skip this next clip cuz the really all that great

1242
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,327
It's just mark

1243
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,399
He's trying to stop North Korea and China from killing

1244
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,167
Millions of

1245
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,191
Himself

1246
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:40,959
Yes

1247
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:44,287
These leaking information is leaking information to carry

1248
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:50,687
In order to stop a war that will kill millions of people

1249
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,223
The people and you have

1250
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:56,831
Both the information necessary to stop it and accessed

1251
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,599
Right

1252
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:02,975
You could probably do a little bit more than kind of leak it or just hang out with

1253
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,767
Could help

1254
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,583
Doesn't even have access to a pen

1255
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:15,263
So now we learn more about this Contessa character the Black Panther game

1256
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,799
She's got the

1257
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,079
Some interesting quirks

1258
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,895
We talked about the cat beans and

1259
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
Tessa Leoni

1260
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
Panther

1261
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,223
Being that

1262
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,271
I had mentioned earlier

1263
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:29,599
He said he's written about her in his writing

1264
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
Available

1265
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,183
Defense headquarters site

1266
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,679
Here's the problem there's nothing

1267
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:49,055
Thomas.loc.gov which is a reference to

1268
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,199
I went to the website

1269
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,735
It's crazy

1270
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
Like

1271
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,319
His wife is made a straight-up

1272
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:06,719
501 c 3 nonprofit organization

1273
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:12,351
I have the original copy of the golden bough

1274
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,727
Well I mean like the book

1275
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,263
Not

1276
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,055
Nothing mythical object

1277
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,359
B of A

1278
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,967
What's the other thing

1279
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:32,319
That they've got together organization

1280
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,087
At all

1281
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:40,511
You know I am as much as we can make

1282
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:45,631
I'll be goddamned try and follow through on their ship

1283
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:51,519
So we wouldn't make a 501 c 3

1284
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:58,175
I don't know what that means if you go to the website the earth eventually you'll find that the executive director is Joanne Richards his wife

1285
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,991
Course not there's a board of directors with blue my mind

1286
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:05,343
Wait what

1287
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,439
You've been on Project Camelot

1288
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,975
Do an interview about how much

1289
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,255
Mark Richards

1290
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:17,375
I was about to be like what we're doing that episode but I listen to like

1291
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:22,495
Maybe 15 minutes of it and he is a boring ass dude I look further down the list

1292
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,567
And one of the people on the board of directors is Lou Wagner

1293
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,615
I was like what the guy from chips

1294
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:34,527
Character X

1295
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:39,135
I got to send them an email

1296
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:45,535
I don't know very well

1297
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
Years old

1298
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,583
Very well

1299
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:01,663
Did you swing the guy from chips

1300
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,455
He's a good guy

1301
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,479
He's a good guy

1302
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:07,551
There's there's absolutely no doubt about that

1303
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,879
I'm trying to find the the exact

1304
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:14,207
Page that I was on earlier

1305
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,559

01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,055
Look for like 40 bucks

1312
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:34,943
You can learn about what happened at Hamilton Air Force Base in the summer of 1950 240 bucks

Pipe it

01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:10,271
It's the Earth Defense headquarters

1325
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:14,111
Part and parcel of that is Dragon Hill Research Center

1326
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,415

A castle like setting

1332
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,735
The moment you need to make that

The research center is proud to own the parliament rolls of medieval England covering 1272

1341
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,567
250

1342
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:08,383
And several volumes of the golden bough

1343
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,687
Crazy

1344
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,223
Crazy

1345
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,247
Crazy

1346
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,271
I want to go there

1347
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
Kind of thing

1348
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,367
The saddest thing

1349
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,159
Probably have

1350
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
Have a better sign

1351
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,303
I want to go there

1352
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,351
Absolute

1353
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:32,191
I don't know if my transcripts

1354
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:39,615
This this club isn't done I still have to talk about the Black Panther lady

1355
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,295
It's maintained by his wife Joanne rich

1356
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,087
And I highly recommend.

1357
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,647
That's a great place

1358
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,207
She says

1359
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,999
Cat things are not

1360
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:56,767
It's time

1361
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,535
Open late

1362
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,559
Human

1363
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,375
Cat races

1364
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,143
Open contacts

1365
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
And that

1366
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,959
Detached from Human

1367
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,239
Fairs

1368
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,287
Marc's only contact

1369
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
Being

1370
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,455
She loves luxury items and has lots of

1371
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,223
Kittens

1372
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,015
Fast

1373
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
Okay

1374
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,087
Cool we have two legs

1375
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,439
She likes luxury items and has lots of kittens

1376
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,743
This Bixby

1377
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,767
Really sad

1378
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
Ficklin

1379
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:35,423
But this one

1380
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,495
It is this is lazy

1381
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,567
I demand better

1382
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,919
Different races

1383
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:52,319
Alien races

1384
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,855
Ocelot

1385
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,879
Salata Lake

1386
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,975
Negative

1387
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:04,607
Rue21

1388
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,727
I don't know how you can't just like

1389
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,775
Be like Mark

1390
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,079
Come on

1391
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,639
This is ridiculous

1392
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,943
Even Carry has to be liked

1393
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,503
Give me a little bit more to work with him

1394
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,039
Give me more than

1395
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:23,807
Forecast

1396
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,831
Species just

1397
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,111
Not giving a f***

1398
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
Just like cat

1399
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,719
Sprite

1400
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,255
Please who are essentially cats

1401
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,535
You know

1402
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,167
Look you go run the universe

1403
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:39,935
Catholic

1404
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:43,007
Cats have been around for at least 65 million

1405
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,359
Well

1406
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,639
If you wanted him to give

1407
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
His next Club

1408
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:54,015
Turns out we learn a little bit more about the Dutchman

1409
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,391
And a very famous person

1410
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,183
Had a bit of a disagreement

1411
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,767
Thomas Jefferson

1412
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,791
Carl Sagan

1413
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,351
Stab the Dutchman

1414
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,887
Had an argument over the

1415
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,911
Voyager discs

1416
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,679
Went out into

1417
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
Say

1418
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,239
Basically Marquette

1419
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,519
Considered

1420
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,055
It gambling with

1421
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:17,823
Charlotte

1422
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,895
Okay

1423
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,687
Savers

1424
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,479
Neighbors

1425
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,015
Are already

1426
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:31,135
And this matter

1427
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:36,511
The Voyager didn't go far enough to deal with aliens

1428
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,559
Coming from different galaxies

1429
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,607
Impossible

1430
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,631
There's no waiting for

1431
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:46,751
Aliens were involved in World War II

1432
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,567
Look up travel

1433
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,895
Does it not the Raptors in the past 5 million years ago

1434
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,175
Sagan was there

1435
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,199
Mega Man

1436
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,223
I love it

1437
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,503
We're going

1438
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:01,855
Confirm or deny the story about the Dutchman

1439
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,415
Lizard Man species

1440
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,487
For sahagun

1441
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:13,887
Whichever it is

1442
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:21,055
Amphibious humanoid sahagun

1443
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
Now

1444
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:24,895
Shortening

1445
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,919
Right

1446
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,759
F****** Reptoid he's a f****** Reptoid

1447
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:33,343
Do it the whole time

1448
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:36,671
He wanted to eat that.

1449
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
So

1450
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,911
This whole this whole exercise pushes the realm of credulity

1451
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,191
Way too far

1452
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
It goes bad

1453
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:53,823
Going along with all of it is wild

1454
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,127
We do reach one point

1455
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,663
Geared towards the end

1456
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,015
How do you wind up on a conversation

1457
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,575
How do you wind up going from

1458
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,111
Aliens

1459
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,671
Right that's the biggest takeaway

1460
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:17,375
You don't mind

1461
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:24,031
He's probably like your grandpa and your grandpa

1462
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:35,807
Stereotypical Grandpa's just like I tell you about the time I World War I punched a Nazi

1463
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,855
He's talking about like doesn't I don't like soup

1464
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:43,231
I'm sure Mark Richards is the same kind of dude just like

1465
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:49,631
I love to hang out with people who like luxury items

1466
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,423
Have different colored skin

1467
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:58,591
Not because of that but you know you can't trust them cuz they work with Draco

1468
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:03,199
Korean to conquering things that humans are against that and have her all the time

1469
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,735
But that's just because

1470
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,783
Lizard snap

1471
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,367
You did not specifically say that the Anunnaki

1472
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,391
Worries

1473
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,439
Intrinsically

1474
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,999
He does everything but he is staying

1475
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,791
You can't trust them

1476
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,583
Because they do

1477
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:25,727
With those other people them in the past

1478
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,495
Therapist

1479
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:34,175
I don't know I just I just agree Terry reaches the point where she's even like a little step

1480
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:43,903
He is a f****** captain in the literal secret space program that saved the world

1481
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:50,303
Right right

1482
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:53,887
Absolutely

1483
01:16:54,143 --> 01:17:00,031
But apparently we learn a little something about

1484
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:02,847
Naming

1485
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,151
Every insect that was in

1486
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,175
Cancel that.

1487
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:12,063
Interior slightly different information

1488
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:15,135
Regarding mantids in Raptors

1489
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,671
He said they are now a limo

1490
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,463
Lions with humans

1491
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,255
I and

1492
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,535
That's very in

1493
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
Interesting and we need to

1494
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,095
To talk more about that

1495
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,423
Especially with her

1496
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,447
Regards the Mantis

1497
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,239
Why though

1498
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055
Here's why

1499
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:34,847
Are some recent

1500
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:35,871
Information

1501
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,407
From a remote

1502
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,431
Viewing by threat

1503
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,711
Stewart

1504
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,735
And I'm going to be

1505
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,551
In an interview

1506
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,135
So some guy remote

1507
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:52,767
Viewed something and learned about mantis beings in a ways he's learned contradict

1508
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,679
Here's what I just found out about myself

1509
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:02,495
It somehow it makes me way more depressed

1510
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,799
When she has to deal with

1511
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,103
Two sources disagree with each other

1512
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,919
I guess baby video like

1513
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:15,039
Now you're entering a whole being conned by one condom

1514
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
That happen

1515
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:21,951
If you're being conned by to con men at cross-purposes like a Michael Caine movie

1516
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:26,047
She's calling everybody to cuz she's like

1517
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:32,447
Well she was you know not posting up all these videos

1518
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,751
Social media

1519
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:39,871
Accounts and everything was going crazy saying like I'm being censored because we're talkin about this real

1520
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:48,319
Saying that every tragedy in the world is fake and a laundry list of false proof

1521
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:51,647
Of all of this s***

1522
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,439
Because rightfully someone complain

1523
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,767
It's so she wasn't allowed to stream anymore

1524
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:00,351
Stop and she was saying that her livelihood was being taken away from her

1525
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,631
And I'm here to tell you

1526
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,959
There's a 40 minute long video there's like five commercials in it

1527
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:05,983
Like throughout

1528
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,287
Haverly monetize

1529
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,823

01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,256
He's more creative than Alex

1714
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:11,584
So he can't keep coming up with new f*****-up things

1715
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,400
Forget these little other things like

1716
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,936
Why is the chocolates

1717
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:19,008
Special

1718
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:25,664
Missouri keeps up the old stuff brings the old stuff back to mine wow introducing new stuff

1719
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,688
In a way that's

1720
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:27,456
Compelling

1721
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:31,808
Do you know what I find fascinating about it and I think this might be my favor

1722
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:35,904
Is unlike your your other

1723
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:40,256
Where do you keep escalating things and it feels bloated

1724
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:45,888
You don't like like Spider-Man 3 villains and none of them

1725
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:51,264
Azalea you lose the real heart of the character

1726
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,312
Kegels

1727
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,336
Opposite direction

1728
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,640
Instead of paying it back

1729
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:59,712
Kind of focusing on the heart of the

1730
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,760
He goes so

1731
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,808
Far into the let's make it

1732
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:05,088
The most bloated

1733
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:09,440
Let's go from random messing to random at 6 we're just we're just jumping

1734
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:12,256
From subject to subject

1735
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,280
This is

1736
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:17,376
F****** it.

1737
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:23,776
Fury Road of alien conspiracy

1738
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:27,360
Every Fast and Furious movie

1739
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,640
Furious movie

1740
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:29,920
With Ant-Man

1741
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:33,504
They weren't in there

1742
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:39,904
That's true proof of raptor wasn't in there.

1743
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:44,768
Done

We lamented

1747
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:12,160
Impossible to

1748
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,184
Recreate

1749
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,232
Improv

1750
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,632
The Improv that you see if places

1751
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
They're doing the same

1752
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,704
