1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,136
Knowledge fight.com

4
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:08,096
Sit around with novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

5
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
Damn

6
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,520
He's the reason for the Xmas season what then pray tell is your favorite Christmas tree

7
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,616
Their Christmas tree I like peppermint bark

8
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,712
I think we talked about this before I've been roundly attacked for this

9
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,248
I don't take care too

10
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,576
I do I do I don't want to hear the b*******

11
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,856
I like peppermint bark

12
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,464
Everyone go fly a kite interesting leader

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,280
He candy canes with peppermint bark

14
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
Partially based don't like

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,656
The licking on the account

16
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
Candy is generally available

17
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
I think it's

18
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
The combination

19
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
Into the chocolate

20
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
It's like texture and also the flavor like

21
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Like it's much better

22
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,432
Good with the richness of dark chocolate

23
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,992
A peppermint comes together in a very nice

24
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
It's dark chocolate peppermint flavor combo

25
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,792
Just because I assumed that peppermint makes everything white generally have like the dark

26
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,352
And white peppermint is the KKK of

27
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
The Christmas tree

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,728
I don't like all these attacking my beloved peppermint bark

29
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,592
I'm not attacking my mom always used to make also like egg white cookies that little meringue

30
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,896
Oh yeah I've never had one of those

31
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,200
I like those quite a bit too but I don't really know how to do

32
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Describe them

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
Is an audio media

34
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,600
But to those would be nice I don't know what those are

35
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,904
Traditionally Christmas but I associate

36
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
Yeah of course any kind of homemade

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Cookie is

38
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Christmas

39
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
Who's on Christmas bread

40
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:48,192
In all its variety

41
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
Abscess bike astronaut about peppermint bark

42
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,568
A little bit better about it apparently

43
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,968
I know a lot about Alex Jones

44
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,528

70
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
This week.

71
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
Enjoy

72
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
Give me a shout over there

73
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,135
Defensive

74
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:49,279
Okay myself I need to stop trying to make

75
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
Jokes at the beginning of those episodes

76
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:57,471
The last two times we've been on there I've tried to open with a joke and it has fallen

77
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,079
And I look like a f****** a******

78
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,663
It takes you a little bit to get revved up into the floor thing I think you

79
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,063
We came all this immediately following that Taraval the Mike Adams episode I made a

80
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,159
The joke about us being the first repeat cast

81
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
Supposed to be a joke

82
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
Pterodactyl There is five minutes of stunned silence

83
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,239
Chicago is a big city can have anybody as a gas but you chose us I look like a goddamn narcissist

84
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
I was trying to lead into saying like

85
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:37,151
You go to head Rahm Emanuel somebody with particularly weird

86
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
Yeah could have been anybody about ketchup on hotdogs

87
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
No joke no joke

88
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:55,583
Anyway despite that I really appreciate it thank you to Robert and apology

89
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,191
Cut that.

90
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,799
Hey that's my main issue

91
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
So Jordan like I said we're doing just

92
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Number 13

93
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,967
Today and I realized it's been a little while

94
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,551
Drop here is a nice out of

95
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:23,231
Merry merry Christmas

96
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
Love it

97
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
That's like a

98
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,471
Card you get in the mail right there that's that makes me feel great it's one of the cards you open

99
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,823
Put it up and it starts playing that song for that's audio peppermint bark for me

100
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,663
Man I think that's a curse to get a Merry Christmas from Infowars

101
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Certainly

102
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
So the last

103
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,623
We checked in on the present-day stuff we had a situation where Alex was really going hard on this their microchipping homeless

104
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,927
Yep and I'm going to

105
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,511
A chip out of somebody on here

106
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,911
F****** body with sorting out the Hippa forms otherwise we got this setup

107
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Everyone's going to love it

108
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,775
That's that's dropped

109
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,127
Shroyer interrupted the

110
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,991
Impeachment inquiry made a big deal out of it and that got the fact

111
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
Did Alex and now

112
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
He does not care

113
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:23,647
About that people experiencing homelessness in Austin

114
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,231
So Thursday waiting for him to say he can't afford a scalp

115
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:33,631
We would we'd love to but we just don't I can't use a razor blade literally just can't afford

116
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,007
So he Thursday was the day that those depositions

117
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Yes

118
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Alex Paul Joseph Watson

119
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
And Rob to

120
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:48,223
And so we went over that on on Mondays episode and I figured like

121
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
See if there's any kind of a weird

122
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Response to that

123
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
Cuz Alex is pretty responsive

124
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,671
The news about himself

125
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:02,303
So I decided to jump in on Friday

126
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:07,167
On Friday you recorded a little introduction for the show that sounds like he's

127
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
Speaking from inside a Nalgene bottle

128
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:16,127
It is Friday 2019 I am your host Alex Jones this is going

129
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:22,527
A very important transmission is going

130
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
Steering the ship

131
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Those two things

132
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,159
You cannot exist still the same state

133
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
Informative show hosted

134
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
By Tom pappert is it

135
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
So I did not listen to that episode

136
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
ICare what's on peppers

137
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Springs

138
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,447
So we jump at 2 Sunday

139
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Sunday the 5th

140
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Kirby vacuum

141
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:50,687
We talkin about stuff and just taking a day whatever right

142
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
Alright so we got to go to this

143
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
And

144
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:01,183
Alex's and he's really easy to cover everything up today if we're covering the 13th through the 16th we really got gotten through

145
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:06,047
Through the 13th through the 15th quit 10 minutes of the episode where the last day of our coverage

146
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
Will be a 45-minute episode

147
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,143
Alex's in studio

148
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,959
And he starts off on a really weird now

149
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
I want to give you this

150
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,639
Upfront Maybe by way of an apology Maybe by way of the

151
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Explanation

152
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,527
Some of the way I'm going to cover this episode is heavily informed

153
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
By Alex

154
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Is deposition

155
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,623
And a lot of the

156
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
Other stuff in those Depp

157
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
The recovered on Mondays show

158
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
I figured

159
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
We Now understand

160
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
Away the Alex defense

161
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Is

162
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,751
It's all about his feelings about his feelings blurring the line of what's fact and what's opinion

163
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
I don't think there is another

164
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
As as an exercise

165
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
To an extent

166
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
I am going to

167
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
To frame

168
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
A lot of my response

169
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
In terms of asking these

170
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
These questions

171
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
And looking at this

172
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
As

173
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,391
Is this is feeling

174
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,975
But might get a little bit tired

175
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,071
I might have like a broken record at times

176
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,911
Only listen to the first half of whatever open

177
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
So Alex is a bit f***** up

178
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,239
At the beginning of

179
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Trump demanding action

180
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847
I've got feeling things have changed

181
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,967
The globalist had a deal to back off they haven't backed off and because of this impeachment that

182
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Behind the scenes.

183
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Update

184
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
Is

185
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:40,255
About the fact that impeachment is

186
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Proceeding is right-wing on going forward

187
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,423
And that's a really interesting clip to listen to in the aftermath of the deposition in that Sandy Hook lawsuit

188
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,519
There's a bunch of little things that Alex says that make what he's saying mean

189
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Literally nothing

190
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,895
But the intended impact of his words based on the context of his show in the reason

191
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
Is anything but meaning

192
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
The first point is Alex's

193
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,831
But he has quote a gut feeling that things have changed

194
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Granted we know that

195
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,927
He said approximately 10000 times it is gutted

196
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
It literally never wrong and he has

197
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Literal psycho

198
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
Powers

199
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
The end of the day all he's doing here

200
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399
Feel that's true nothing actually is

201
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
She has no proof that anything has changed

202
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,007
Just a feeling he has a things of Jane

203
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
Premier Alex jump

204
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,639
I'm still talking about and imaginary behind-the-scenes deals the globalist

205
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
Had to back off which

206
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
They're not honoring

207
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
This is not a field

208
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,063
This is something Alex's directly asserting as a fact

209
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
The globalist tented

210
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
Deal I had a deal in place

211
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
To back down they are not backing down

212
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
So date aunt is over

213
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
This behind-the-scenes deal isn't real

214
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,143
But the claim Alex is making involves a real imaginary thing

215
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
Now to further complicate the

216
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
Alex is using his feelings

217
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
Namely that something is

218
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:00,383
To assert that this imaginary deal is not being held up by the globalist side

219
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,735
The way Alex is reporting on this real imaginary thing is being effect

220
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Acted by his feelings

221
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,111
The headline is that they talked is over and the globalists are breaking

222
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
But that's strictly Bass

223
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
On Alex's feelings

224
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,975
About a real imaginary

225
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Yeah

226
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,839
Yeah not the reason why this is so particularly upsetting in this

227
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Case is because

228
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,935
The last week or so we've heard Alex very

229
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,751
Very consistently work himself into a frenzy

230
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
Particularly at the end of

231
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
The point where he declares it is the globalist

232
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Don't back off

233
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
It might be

234
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
Me time to start killing people

235
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
He's not directly saying that

236
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
The time is come here at the beginning

237
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Episode

238
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:44,671
But if you're a regular listener of Alex's program I think you'd be able to put two and two together

239
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
He's established that the global

240
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
Don't back down there's going to be just

241
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Certified violin

242
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
It's down against

243
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
And now here

244
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,655
He's opening his Monday show by explicitly announcing

245
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
That there's an imaginary behind the scene

246
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Scenes deal for the globalist

247
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
To backup

248
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
Off

249
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Which they have broken

250
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
And they taunt is over

251
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,943
The proof that his imaginary deal has been broken is just his gut

252
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
Feeling

253
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,295
I don't think that Alex's listeners will hear that is called

254
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Time for killing

255
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
Just come and then they'll start shooting

256
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
Nor do I really

257
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
That's how Alex cemento

258
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,791
I just think that because he's so reliable and made up s*** and Reporting things

259
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
Based on his feelings

260
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
Sometimes he is literally

261
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
No idea how the things you think

262
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
Play into the larger

263
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Stuff is work

264
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
And that is dangerous

265
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Yeah that makes

266
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,871
Yeah no he's not even tying together the fact that if the deal is broken

267
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Which he's already

268
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
Right we have to

269
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
We have to start killing

270
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,319
And then he's later saying that the deal has been broken he thinks that they start regular

271
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Yeah he

272
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,999
And we're going to move on and go to the next thing he doesn't realize that a week ago is like

273
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,351
And now we burn everybody to the ground he doesn't he doesn't realize the trailer

274
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,143
He's laid like

275
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
Picture I don't think it's leading

276
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
2

277
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
The worst case scenario

278
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
But if it did

279
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,175
Think it's an open-and-shut case

280
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,991
That he is inspiring people towards

281
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Certain

282
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,599
It does feel like he doesn't think reality is cereal

283
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:24,255
You know what I'm saying like every he thinks every episode is a completely independent thing

284
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:30,143
Not realizing that it's talking about an ongoing reality I also think it's so indicative of the fact that he doesn't believe anything

285
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,239
He's saying he doesn't think none of it's real time

286
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,823
It's all nonsense neeb stupid

287
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
Leave it there

288
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
Feel like that is

289
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
The case but

290
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
How you feel

291
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
So Alex is not really talk at all

292
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
About the

293
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
He doesn't even address

294
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,183
As being public he doesn't care at all

295
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
He does

296
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Care though

297
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
About

298
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
UK

299
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
Of course

300
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
Do dachshund little bit about that

301
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
And he

302
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,727
Wants to leave this in with narratives he has about the United

303
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
States 20

304
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
16 election

305
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:12,127
Primarily about how the media was saying that it was likely that Hillary was going to

306
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
And apparently Alex believe

307
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
That the media was saying that Labour was inevitably going to win

308
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
In the UK Alexa

309
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
Oh no they were not say

310
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
Well that's not what I

311
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
This election

312
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,463
All the media trying to deny

313
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
We're going to win

314
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
Just like they did three years ago for Hillary

315
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,775
Didn't convince people to say all will suddenly the Liberals are ahead I'll vote for them to feel like I'm a winner

316
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,591
The real poll showed

317
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,895
The conservatives 15-20 points ahead

318
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,223
The conservatives won by a whopping

319
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
20 + point lead

320
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
Meaning they have a

321
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,879
The majority wide in the parliament

322
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
I don't know of

323
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,255
Anybody who votes based on who they think is going to win

324
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,607
What Alex is expressing here seems to be a fundamental disconnect from how cumin

325
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Think

326
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:12,031
It seems like he believes that the media reporting it for example Hillary Clinton was going to win that would drive more people

327
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
Go to vote for Hillary who were previously uninsured

328
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Inclined to do so

329
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
That's absurd

330
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
And I would argue with anything

331
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
Media coverage of Hillary being in

332
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:26,367
Would only serve to Galvanize the opposition to work harder thereby increasing their likelihood of turning out more voters

333
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
I don't believe that a person who prefers

334
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
Republican policies

335
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
Going to hear that

336
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,279
The Democratic candidate is leading in the polls

337
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
And it annoys the likely winner

338
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,911
Then they're going to go out and vote for the Democratic cuz they want to feel like they're on the winning

339
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
What sense is there to be another winning

340
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,543
Team when that team is opposed to the things you want in society

341
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Yeah that I think

342
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
I mean this isn't like

343
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:54,271
Durant signing with golden state you know it's not like

344
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,831
He gets a ring because he wants a rigged

345
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
You know.

346
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
Yeah

347
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
This is wild

348
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,999
If Alex has any studies decide to backup this trend in voter Behavior I'd be happy to take a look

349
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,583
The but it seems like this is more him talking about his feelings

350
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:13,471
He desperately wants to be on the winning team in assumes that everyone else would sell out his heart as he has

351
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
The trump in order to make that happen

352
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
I think this is just about himself

353
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,615
Like people don't operate that way

354
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
At least none that I have ever met or no

355
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
No there there is

356
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,295
There is something far more Illuminating now that

357
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,087
He's admitted that the show is basic

358
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Really him talking about his

359
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Right

360
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
So much of the stuff you can now like

361
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743
Like really just go in and be like

362
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
This is you talking about you

363
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,375
What did you not used to match up with anything I can find

364
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
Jeff

365
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,703
Indications that a lot of people are motivated

366
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
To vote

367
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,567
Not motivated to vote for a particular but motivated

368
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
To vote

369
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
Because they want to not

370
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,455
Feel the shame of having to lie about Knoxville

371
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
Societal

372
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,039
To fit in and be a part of

373
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
The response

374
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
Stability of voting

375
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,903
B drive people to actually vote

376
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,463
That has nothing to do with two who they go for

377
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
I don't

378
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,791
Know what he I can't find

379
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
And indications of anything

380
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
So when he's

381
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
Pitching something

382
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
It doesn't seem to be

383
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Supported by any evidence

384
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,287
Damental human psychology

385
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
Is this about

386
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
You

387
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
And I think it is

388
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
So you know

389
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
Pause daily

390
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Because

391
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Cher

392
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,671
But Alex also lies about

393
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,999
Polls Trump has gained 5 to 10 to 15 points

394
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,815
Real Paul's Trump's 15 20 points ahead

395
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
Democrats right now they're in full panic mode

396
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,471
We're trying to get him out of office with this impeachment

397
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,287
But it has spectacularly

398
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
Fired on them

399
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,663
According to 538 aggregate of bowls

400
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:02,527
They have Trump looking at a 43.1 approval rating and a 52-point

401
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,855
5 disapproval or approximately -9

402
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
Net approval rating

403
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,231
RealClearPolitics list some of the more recent polls which are mostly

404
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
Not good

405
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,351
Quinnipiac has trumpeted -9 net approval USA Today has naked

406
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,911
To Rasmussen is -4

407
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,775
NPR in PBS there pull has them sitting in a -10 Reuters at

408
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
-15 and even Fox

409
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
News most recent poll conducted

410
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
Between December 8th and 11th is at negative

411
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
Simply put there are no really

412
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
Credible polls

413
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,831
They put Trump anywhere near a neutral approval rating

414
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
The polls regarding various

415
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,927
Possible 2020 democratic

416
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
Candidates are a little bit less

417
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Consistent

418
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,559
But most of the reputable polling Outlets are generally showing Trump losing

419
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
To most of them

420
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,143
If the election were being held today

421
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,799
A lot can happen between now and November and we don't really know who the candidate will be this hard to put too much stake into any of those

422
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
Specific polls

423
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,407
But it just isn't anything I can find the reflects the reality that Alex's

424
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Presenting

425
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Alex

426
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:08,063
Feels like Trump should be winning in the polls and so he says he

427
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
He is

428
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,671
You can't find any polls that show the Trump is up 10 or 20 points

429
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
But that's because

430
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,487
All you have is access to the cooked fraudulent

431
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
Where is Alex has the real

432
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Your numbers which was

433
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
Mysteriously are out of step with everyone else

434
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,655
But completely in line with his feelings

435
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
So what is this

436
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
Is this opinion or reporting

437
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:31,615
I mean Alex is definitely behaving as if he has proof that there are polls where Trump is beating the Democrats by

438
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
20 points whatever that mean

439
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,015
Vague notion of beating the Democrats B

440
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:43,391
These 548 from 3 to not be based on anything but Elaine's

441
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:49,279
I don't even know I told you was going to get a little tired already two clips in this is trouble

442
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
I don't know why

443
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Cook polls

444
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Wood

445
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,495
Even try why would cook polls be like well Trump is only + 10

446
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,311
Instead of the plus 20 that theoretical reel Pole

447
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,847
What's the point of cooking

448
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
If it's still going to look

449
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,479
Because Alex seems to think that like

450
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,271
These statisticians

451
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Are like

452
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
You know

453
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
Pushing up a

454
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,440
Wrongly pushing back against them

455
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
That there will

456
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
Cannot manage Trump is up by 10

457
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,936
Cursor keeps writing 7 and then

458
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:33,568
Yeah basically it's a Herculean effort to make it look like Trump is only up

459
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
10 points

460
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Squeezed

461
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,688
I feel like that could exist

462
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,784
So if you ever needed

463
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
Just a snapshot

464
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,856
Of why Infowars

465
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
Is the stupidest buck

466
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
TV show in the world

467
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,232
I think I can provide that for you in a very short

468
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,656
Companies in cos that's great scourges

469
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,240
Break that down at the bottom of the next hour with

470
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
Voorhees.

471
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,640
If you listen to Infowars and you take this s*** seriously

472
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,432
You need to wake the fuk up

473
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
And that clip is a good

474
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Example of why

475
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,296
Alex is going out a little late

476
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,368
Riff and then he announces that Zach Voorhees is going to

477
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,696
Maybe coming on to talk about it cuz he's done research on the issue

478
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,280
Zach for his only notable in anyway because he was

479
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,632
The Google employee who was the centerpiece of a project Veritas publicity stunt

480
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,544
He gave them a ton of documents that were ultimately meaningless and didn't show what they pretended they did and then after that report came

481
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,104
It was revealed that Zac was an anti-Semitic

482
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Conspiracy theorist

483
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,968
Posted online repeatedly about how the US has a z

484
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,112
Occupied government well I wouldn't call him a rabid anti-semite the web

485
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
That term

486
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,208
Zionist occupied government

487
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Azog

488
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Pretty unique

489
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
2

490
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,584
F***** up corners of anti-government

491
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
Conspiracy communities

492
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
The temp

493
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
Towards the

494
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Neo-Nazi

495
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,264
Yazoo dog and like Boogaloo now our

496
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:12,640
And are you can you mail those back to work has been for a while

497
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,688
That knows nothing about vaccines

498
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,552
Zack has no expertise he worked at Google he has no expertise on the subject

499
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
He's just a guy who camping

500
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
Much older than 30

501
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
Foodworks

502
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,488
Computer scientist at Google for eight years when he went public this year

503
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,280
He's not someone who you'd want to go to

504
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,816
Cooper conversation about Becky

505
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,376
If you were taking the subject seriously

506
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,192
He's someone you talk to about vaccines if you were trying to

507
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,032
Cultivate a new star in the world of right-wing propaganda media

508
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,592
That is I suspect with Alex's doing here

509
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Exactly

510
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,200
Clearly willing to keep coming on his show

511
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,224
You got a little bit of

512
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,064
Juice cuz it is Project Veritas video let's see if we can make

513
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,856
Just already

514
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,696
Because Zach is a snooze

515
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Really dumb

516
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
Yes but he's not

517
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:06,912
Busy dad and that's the most important part of trying to make a new star for Infowars that is true

518
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:14,080
Zach Voorhees coming on the show today to talk vaccines because he's studied the subject is a perfect example of how little

519
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
Alex cares about doing the good job

520
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,968
There was a time when he did least have the decency to have fake doctors on

521
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
To talk about anti-vax

522
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,368
But now f*** it let's just get that project Veritas guy who believes there's Azog

523
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,160
I can't even get Mike Adams anymore

524
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:33,024
They probably could bike might be busy too

525
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
Not busy

526
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
I had

527
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
Where and when

528
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
Did he study back

529
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
He did was it was it a Google

530
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,664
But at eight years was the only working on the vaccine beat at Google but they have a backup

531
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
No

532
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
Ironically

533
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:57,344
When he finally does show up at the end of the episode a bunch of the stuff that he says his

534
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,904
Probably just stuffy red on natural news

535
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,976
Probably just reading Mike Adams articles

536
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,536
That's great we need a Mike Adams surrogate

537
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,328
At 2 anyway

538
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
Preferably

539
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Towards

540
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:14,496
This episode because I have distain for anti-vax stuff which I do

541
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,824
I mean void of that

542
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
Really stupid

543
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,896
Like things that are disqualified

544
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
Basically anyway

545
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,712
They grow vaccines in

546
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Honey bees hive

547
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,016
Might as well

548
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
So Alex says that you know

549
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
Impasse

550
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,392
He's avoided being too optimistic

551
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
Stick about thing

552
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Listen

553
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
I feel like he is not

554
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
Easter games in the world

555
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,864
Okay something really revealing

556
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
At the end of this

557
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,192
To be too optimistic

558
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,288
And I want to say the president in danger and I wanted to say that we're not completely wanting

559
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,688
Twilight what are you

560
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,576
Because they are really screwed the pooch now

561
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,304
False Flags right now

562
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,656
I would Marley do that myself but if I was there right now

563
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
That would be

564
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
Opposition

565
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,032
If Alex were the globalists

566
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,592
He'd be doing some false flags and blaming his opposition

567
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,688
I feel like this is a very good example of how twisted Alex's thinking is

568
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,760
And how he forced it onto his audience to accept as fact

569
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
When it's just

570
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Is feeling

571
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,720
What strikes me most about this is that we've already heard Alexei repeatedly that the globalist are about to pull false Flags in order to blame the p

572
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,024
Patriots in the surrounding context of

573
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
Impeached

574
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,608
You said this as a prediction

575
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
Based on his gut

576
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
Which is never wrong

577
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:52,032
He said it was a certainty many times in the past week but now he's presenting this as a if I were there

578
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
And that tells me some

579
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Namely

580
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
That is

581
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,688
Alex's enemies are in his head

582
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,224
There's no concrete reason

583
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,040
For Alex to predict these globalist going to run false-flag

584
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
Everything he calls a false flag

585
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
Isn't one

586
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
And it's not like he's making

587
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,976
Prediction based on whistleblowers are leaked globulus documents

588
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
Discussing false

589
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Like plan

590
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
Space solely on his subjective

591
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
Perception

592
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,144
When Alex says if I were to go bust

593
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,424
I'd be running false flag

594
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,472
That is a pure distillation

595
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
Of his prediction the globalist

596
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,800
Are going to pull false flag

597
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,896
That is what he's really saying when he predicted they're going to do this

598
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:34,528
It's merely his own projection of his warped and violent mind being put onto his imagined enemies

599
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,856
Alex has created an overpowered but also ultimately

600
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
The powerless enemy

601
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
To fight in the process is

602
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,256
Convinced a not-insignificant number of people to buy into his Fanta

603
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,096
There are no globalist planning false flag

604
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,656
There's only Alex Jones imagining

605
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,472
But that is what his pretend enemies would do

606
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
Because that's what he would do if

607
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
Beware them

608
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,104
Then when a tragedy does inevitably happen Alex get

609
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,920
Gets to call it a false flag for no reason in order to fraudulent

610
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,200
Playing the role of a prophet

611
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,992
And then the cycle repeats

612
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,576
More brainforest gets old and Alex tells you that were so close to see

613
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
The Anthony's globalist

614
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
This time

615
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,720
They've been on the brink of defeat so many times before but never like this

616
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
This so close to

617
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,560
And they're definitely going to do some false flag

618
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,608
And when they do is crucial that I see

619
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,680
It'll be on the air so by warbrain force and that's how you can take

620
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,008
Like your ancestors did in the Revolutionary War

621
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
Not everyone gets

622
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
2B George

623
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:33,664
The Jordan some people are patriots only inasmuch as they can keep buying my b*******

624
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,992
Got a little worked up it

625
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,528
That is a cycle video

626
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
He's doing that's what he's doing.

627
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,624
I always think of that b*******

628
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
Like that projection

629
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,976
Because that especially to way too obvious

630
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm just like

631
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,792
If I were them I would be false flag

632
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,352
Are we Burton say similar things in

633
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,168
Look up 20 rare for him

634
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
2

635
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
Frame it in that

636
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,520
Yeah right away

637
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,080
I think of that in the same way that those like

638
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,176
Alright guys who don't want to go who like

639
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968
Toca talk just

640
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,040
Right before they get to all the way alright who are like

641
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
You know I do

642
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
Think when

643
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,904
If all the

644
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Oppress

645
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:22,816
People's right now get all their power they're going to do all that s*** to us man like nah nah

646
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
That's not how it works

647
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,656
That's what you would do in their sin

648
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,960
Make you the f*****-up person

649
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,752
Yeah yeah yeah

650
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,544
Not good

651
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
So Alex reports

652
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,408
That this Dyke you know this

653
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,712
Impeachment thing is going forward

654
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
Of course it's all bulshit

655
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,112
But there's still reason to be concerned because people are getting

656
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:46,880
Breton

657
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
Got Tricks

658
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,952
Their sleeves

659
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,280
And they are threatening all their menus right now

660
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,656
If you don't do this we're going to release this dirt on you if you don't do that we're going to kill your daughter or your son

661
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:02,752
Right now the threats are flowing like Niagara Falls

662
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
Okay is that news or is that Alex

663
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
His feelings

664
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,200
Is it opinion where's Alex actually asserting two people are being blackmailed and

665
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
Written that the kids will be killed

666
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,784
If they don't go along with this impeachment

667
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
What is what is it

668
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
Because if he's reporting

669
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,696
That is fact that's a very serious crime that he's presenting himself as having proof up

670
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
Of course you just making this s*** up

671
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
But it's presented

672
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
News

673
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,704
Started as a fact I don't know I think he might have some screenshots of Larry Nichols email that we're going to get to that

674
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,592
I'm sorry I keep framington things this way but after spending so much

675
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
What time with those depositions

676
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
Felt like it would be a good idea to take this

677
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,992
As an opportunity to demonstrate these real examples

678
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,040
Where these issues manifest themselves

679
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,368
Outside of oi don't know legally actionable places

680
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
What Alex says it's

681
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
Sandy Hook was closed at

682
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
I'm shooting for insta

683
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,792
Then pretend to stating an opinion that's a matter for the lawyers

684
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
Symbicort

685
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,120
But he does the same thing everyday surrounding

686
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
All these other issues

687
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,704
He's talking about quote-unquote minion

688
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,264
G b b anybody from government office

689
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
Does Clerks 2 Congress be

690
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
Being blackmailed

691
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
Threatened to railroad track

692
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,920
But I guarantee that he has nothing to baste

693
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,808
Hey babes will be no doubt that if you had to answer why you said this Underoath you would say it was his

694
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
It's true

695
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
It is opinion

696
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,416
It's my opinion the people are being

697
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
Threatened

698
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464
In order to

699
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,024
Make sure Trump gets out of office

700
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,352
It's my opinion that this is the case it's a vibe

701
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
It's the the zeitgeist

702
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:40,800
Do you feel like that's responsible for you to say that to a bunch of people who rapidly believe in this insane things that you say

703
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,992
H-E-B Mansion the back when the Mueller investigation was ongoing

704
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,832
Larry Nichols literally came on Alex's show and threatened to release damage

705
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,880
Information about Robert Mueller in ever

706
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,208
Remember of Congress if they didn't stop investigating Trump

707
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,560
There is no proof of the conspiracy that Alex is talking about right now

708
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,144
But his show has been host to the exact same behavior

709
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
Just directed at the people that Alex wants

710
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,032
Do Target well if I were them that's what I would be doing

711
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,568
So when I'm not them

712
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
That is what I will be doing

713
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:20,224
I'm against Larry Nichols impotently blackmailing people in Congress on Alex

714
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,784
To show in the same way I am against

715
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,112
People being blackmailed hypothetically

716
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648
2 / Trump

717
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,488
Yeah I am against it because I'm against that action

718
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,024
Yeah

719
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,328
Have you considered that maybe blackmail is a

720
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,120
Great thing so long as it doesn't have

721
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
Into you

722
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:42,240
I am now officially a sovereign citizen

723
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,032
Alex Russo

724
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
The worst

725
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,128
Is this is this is so

726
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
We're

727
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,480
I guess maybe you could

728
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,648
Possibly get the impression that he didn't like Larry Nichols blackmailing Congress based on the fact that he didn't have them on the show for like

729
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,184
The year

730
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,304
But that's only implied I never heard him denounce that I never pushed back on Larry when

731
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
Larry's on

732
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
Any Titan back

733
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
So you can't it can't have been too big

734
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,216
It's

735
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,264
But I

736
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,056
The fact that there is no

737
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Assistance

738
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,128
Practice of idea of a

739
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
Ethics

740
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
Through

741
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
Ideology is

742
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
Right

743
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:29,344
Is f****** right like Mitch McConnell like we'll never see it as Supreme Court Justice

744
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,416
If if you could you would

745
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:37,536
Or the day that's just how it was

746
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,328
Because he thinks probably

747
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,632
Bet if I were the other side

748
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,936
I would be doing the exact same thing

749
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,496
Even though that's demonstrable

750
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,288
Yeah it's

751
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
Hip Hop

752
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,104
Chrissy is no

753
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
Pointed attack

754
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,200
Or whatever accusations

755
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
Hold any weight

756
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:02,624
Not anymore but it's still it's worth pointing these things out particularly when Alex has been party to

757
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,000
Literal blackmail of members of Congress and now he's making up

758
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
This

759
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,352
Reportaj about Trump

760
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,144
Biddy the threats are

761
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,448
Flowing like Niagara Falls

762
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
If a buck out of here

763
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,544
Do you think he thinks that there is some like

764
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,896
Equivalent Force to Infowars that he just

765
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
You know like

766
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,480
Does he think that there is some

767
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,784
Bizzaro Infowars that has

768
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,112
Bizarro Larry Nichols on threatening to Blackmail

769
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:39,232
Bizarro members of Sphynx that's what MSNBC

770
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,584
I kind of like you just do what a lunatic

771
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,400
So you got that the spirit in them

772
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,192
I figured out about this

773
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
Like fighting back

774
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
And he

775
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,544
Expresses this

776
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
How do you think this is

777
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
Damn fake

778
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,688
Osceola spirit

779
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,088
Oh my God

780
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,488
So fake

781
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:17,120
Alex we're going to have to ask you to take that one again. Just let's start that over

782
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:22,496
This was a warm-up take I understand.

783
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,312
Yeah

784
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,944
Yellow leather yellow leather

785
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
What a dork

786
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,832
Anyway

787
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
Alex is thrilled about the UK allow

788
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,232
Primarily because Boris Johnson is a nationalist

789
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,536
Most candidates are we've got

790
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,584
Theoretically

791
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,912
Which is ironic considering he's doing everything possible to turn the

792
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
UK into a colony of these

793
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
State

794
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,800
Leaving that aside for a moment because we might have

795
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336
Time for some more

796
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Politic

797
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,152
In the UK just Josh

798
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
Inasmuch as

799
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,456
We can a little bit later

800
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:09,600
I was just thrilled that there's his nationalist getting elected over the world

801
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,184
That is the answer to his globalist prob

802
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,488
Yeah right a global

803
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Well

804
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Turns out

805
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,632
That even though these nationalist candidates are getting elected Place haha

806
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
There's still trouble

807
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:30,080
Everything they're throwing inhumanity journalist and populist are getting elected and of course

808
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:36,480
Those nationalist movements are infiltrated with global but it doesn't matter at least they're having

809
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
They're Patriots

810
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,344
To get elected and then it's only a process of removing

811
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,648
The globalist who are able to get in

812
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,184
Lying to the people

813
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:51,072
The case of the leader in Brazil and other areas

814
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,608
Patriots

815
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,936
So it's just their minion that we have been discovered and removed

816
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,288
You can see here why Alex's Griff will never naturally reach

817
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
It's an

818
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,336
Point on its own

819
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,128
It's entirely up to Alex

820
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
The site is wind condition

821
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,992
We can just change those whenever he wants

822
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,064
More importantly I think what you see here is that Alex

823
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,184
Given the authority and ability to do so would be an absolute scourge of a political forum

824
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,720
You'd be the sword

825
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,024
Runs all manner of purity test

826
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,328
Purges in order to make sure the party doesn't have any

827
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,864
Infiltrators at at

828
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,728
It has always worked out well as we can see from Russia's perfect example of solid

829
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,264
Worked out great

830
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,104
Yeah it definitely a natural end result of your worldview being in

831
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,896
Hayirli based on defiance

832
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,992
Only defined by being against something

833
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
Once you have

834
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,600
Ostensibly conquered that thing you have to be against something else

835
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Alex

836
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,392
Is defined

837
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,696
As a media entity

838
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,512
Higher personality isn't

839
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
Tire reason to

840
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,864
This is based on I'm against the globalist

841
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,216
If he has a situation where like now we have vanquished the global is

842
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,056
He has to create his own enemy he's already

843
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
Itau

844
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,896
I would be fun to see if he could hire somebody to photoshop

845
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
All of his picture

846
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,016
And how many people would he get rid of it all the sudden

847
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,832
He's just a load in every pic get Zack and fungal

848
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
To do that for us

849
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
Back to the Future

850
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,928
Everybody's disappearing

851
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,232
So these people they're against the globalist

852
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:27,584
But what's this A bunch of people that Alex is labeled as auntie globalist

853
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
Winning election

854
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,168
Which it signify that you've achieved your goal

855
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,192
Now you can go back

856
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
Creating the suit on Utopia

857
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,056
It would have been possible all along heading out for been for those

858
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
Meddling globalist

859
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,128
They can't do that

860
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,920
Even interested in that sort of thing

861
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
Even if they could

862
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Do the game

863
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
Changes

864
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,832
Some of these nationalist groups are infiltrated

865
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
So now it's not enough.

866
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
Get nationalist into

867
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:54,464
The office to make sure there aren't any globalist infiltrator

868
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,024
SB root it out at every turn

869
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,792
The thread

870
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
Internal and external

871
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,352
You can't trust your own man

872
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,376
Nationalist party

873
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,656
Probably got

874
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,448
Some Global spies in there

875
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
Again

876
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,776
This is just based on Alex's

877
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,824
Has no bearing on reality

878
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:14,176
On the one hand it's a way of escalating paranoia and the deeply on healthy way

879
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:19,552
But in another it's more likely than not this is just Alex's way of creating an excuse for why

880
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,136
After his pretend 1776 2.0 is happening

881
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,952
None of the things he says are going to happen happen

882
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
Because these Nationals to be elected or Secret globalist

883
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Do something

884
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,096
Because Alex gets to set these

885
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,912
These wind conditions in his imaginary infowar

886
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,472
There will never be an achievable when can

887
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,032
You be pretty naive to think that he's not

888
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,056
Keenly aware that he's

889
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
Pretty much useless once the globalist

890
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
Defeated yeah

891
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,408
Also Alex knows

892
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Nothing

893
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,456
About bolsonaro

894
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,760
Other than he's heard him refer to his Brazil

895
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,296
Trump I would bet

896
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
Anything that I own

897
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,880
Fit as Alex was saying that sentence

898
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
You didn't even remember

899
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
Davis

900
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
The awful

901
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:00,768
The worst

902
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,352
I think he takes that Syfy

903
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
Fantasy

904
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
That

905
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,264
Neither evil nor good can ever fully defeat

906
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
The other

907
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:15,104
And never-ending struggle and no matter what

908
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
If good

909
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,920
Defeat the evil in the seed of its

910
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Destruction is

911
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
Inside of it

912
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
Evil look

913
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,528
It's just everything is that

914
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
Titanic

915
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
Eternal battle the

916
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
Between good and

917
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
So no matter what

918
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
There is always going

919
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
Be somebody

920
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,232
It just boggles my mind

921
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,768
That nobody

922
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
Has ever opened

923
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,096
History book and been like

924
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,888
Well when people start talking like

925
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,960
That means their organization or their group

926
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
It's going to cannibalize

927
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
Yeah matter what

928
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,080
Yeah it always does

929
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,408
Yeah we're always soon as soon as you're like

930
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Alright

931
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,480
There's enemies Within

932
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
You're introducing

933
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
Call it out

934
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
You're you're introducing at least

935
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
The justification

936
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
Bad actors will not

937
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
In order to create

938
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Those division

939
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,512
End up completely

940
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
Destroying whatever you

941
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
Every f***

942
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
Cooking time

943
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
It's it's

944
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:13,472
It's the US versus them mentality brought into in the house

945
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
When

946
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,776
Even outside of the house

947
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,568
Let's say metaphorically

948
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,872
It's not a healthy Outlook

949
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,712
Cruising versus inclusion

950
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,016
Yeah I mean just that the

951
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
Praise

952
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,392
Destroyed by infighting should be like on at the

953
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,720
The doorway of everybody's house in there in those

954
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,792
Itsfunneh

955
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,352
Because we actually get a a literal exam

956
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,632
In this next

957
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:46,752
Split rates because Alex brings in Paul Joseph Watson to talk about the UK election okay

958
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,544
And Alex has some dumb things

959
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,872
That sounds right

960
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,151
You don't brag about it but

961
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,455
Yeah you're in the inner workings of

962
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,039
The brexit party and then W Koeppen

963
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,463
Quarterback for Raj

964
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
Behind

965
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,559
Boris Johnson this is really going to scare the globalist

966
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,351
The guy that kept way out in

967
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,423
For so long as now

968
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,751
Power behind the throne with the Nationalist parties

969
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,311
Taking over Europe at every election

970
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,103
How does an amazing time pull awesome

971
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,663
Well exactly

972
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:29,759
So before I get into this I'd like to make a caveat that I'm not an expert in UK followed

973
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:35,647
I know what I read on the issue and the sense that I get from that landscape is that Alex

974
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
Said isn't saying

975
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,207
The matches up with the analysis

976
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:45,119
It seems like Nigel farage in the brexit party or effectively completely neutralize now that the election is over in the

977
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,399
The conservative party won

978
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,191
He had tons of chips

979
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
In his hand

980
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,239
Prior to the election

981
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,823
Because he was threatening to field candidates and conservative held

982
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Constituency

983
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,895
Which effectively create

984
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,663
Complete split

985
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
In the Pro brexit voting block

986
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,015
Garage is only relevant because of that threat

987
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
And as soon as he announced

988
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,855
The party would back down he became a non-player

989
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,903
The brexit party has zero seats

990
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
In Parliament

991
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:13,535
So there's no real ability for him to be a part of the coalition government he's only relevant is

992
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,095
In the fact that he's a rabble-rouser and for the sea

993
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,679
City currently holds or the party holds in the EU Parliament

994
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,471
Which will see if they even hold on to

995
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,567
Their end goal is to not

996
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,871
Even have those seats in the EU parlor

997
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,407
It doesn't make any

998
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
For those to be any

999
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
The bargaining chip

1000
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,271
If your entire goal is Right lemonade

1001
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
It doesn't say

1002
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,319
Seem like there's much

1003
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
Since 2

1004
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,415
Garage being the power behind the throne

1005
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,207
For Alex to feel that way

1006
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,767
Because he's talked to faraj before

1007
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
Another important

1008
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,887
Important point is at the brexit party and you kept are not associate

1009
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:56,799
Nigel farage created the brexit party specifically because he was disgusted with the direction of you kid

1010
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,591
And their anti-muslim obsession

1011
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,919
He wrote an article in the Daily Telegraph announcing his departure

1012
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
From the party saying quote

1013
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,783
The very idea of Tommy Robinson being at the center of the brexit

1014
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,063
The debate is too awful.

1015
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,927
And so with a heavy heart and after all of my years of Devotion to the party

1016
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,207
I'm leaving you kept

1017
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:14,975
Today

1018
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:21,887
Garages full of s*** about caring about anti-islam sentiment is about to go there

1019
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,167
Party that field people like

1020
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
Count dankula in

1021
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
Tommy Robbins

1022
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,007
Candidate is one that can't be

1023
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,799
Successful on the ballot let alone

1024
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
McGovern

1025
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,383
The party he let it become unrecognizable.

1026
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
And the way it was unrecognizable

1027
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:38,527
Was it the fact that they were taking Alex Jones as guest seriously

1028
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,343
Paul is friends with you Kip esoc

1029
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,903
I'm pretty sure that he has nothing

1030
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,927
Thing to do like

1031
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,207
Formerly with the brexit

1032
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
Party particular

1033
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,023
Movie considering that he made of

1034
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,559
Big public spectacle of joining

1035
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,327
You kept

1036
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,863
Along with Tommy Robinson

1037
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
Thank you Lord

1038
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,423
Just a few months before faraj quit

1039
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,959
I'm sure the

1040
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,495
Paul has some contacts

1041
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
And they may mean something

1042
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,847
They made me not they may not I don't know

1043
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,639
I find it very unlikely who's involved

1044
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,407
Did anything relevant

1045
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,479
Where is Johnson would never be associated with Alex

1046
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,039
The Nigel farage probably wouldn't anymore either

1047
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,111
The wing of UK politics that Alex has access to

1048
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
You kept

1049
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,927
Might as well be a dead part

1050
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,207
Yeah so

1051
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,791
They made the classic mistake

1052
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
Starting to buy their own bowls

1053
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,631
Like a good politician

1054
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:32,031
Sargon of akkad in office

1055
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:36,895
All-you-can-eat can control that they're too but once they start Fielding those candidates are like

1056
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,295
Yep it's

1057
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:47,647
Yo it's exactly that thing though it's the division

1058
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,999
No they the UK and brexit party

1059
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
Conceivably be

1060
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,327
Well they agree on every

1061
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:00,447
Except for the believing this b*******

1062
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
Using allowing

1063
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
This

1064
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
Wing

1065
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
To have any products

1066
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
Somebody

1067
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,639
To the actual Party Guys

1068
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,919
We're willing to accept

1069
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
Exploit

1070
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,759
Anti-islam fervor we don't want to be

1071
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
Part of it

1072
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
You are so stupid

1073
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:22,463
Yeah and that for that reason I like I've seen some pictures of like Paul hanging out with some people who were involved

1074
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,815
Is it party I'm sure he does know people and it is so so

1075
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,143
But any kind of proximity to

1076
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,447
Actual s*** yeah

1077
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,495
I think they know better because

1078
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
Paul Ferreira

1079
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,543
All of his

1080
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,615
Increased popularity over people like

1081
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
Count dankula

1082
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,455
I don't even like him exist and his

1083
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
Decreased

1084
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,319
Toxicity that compared to someone like Tommy Robinson yeah

1085
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,855
He's still in that world

1086
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
Still that

1087
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,927
And associating with him

1088
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
To any

1089
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
Large

1090
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
Degree

1091
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,511
I think that's

1092
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,791
That's why

1093
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,839
Garage left the brexit party

1094
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,399
Not going to now allow that in

1095
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
That maybe you would I don't fuc

1096
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,983
I mean well

1097
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:12,639
I wouldn't be surprised if some UK people infiltrated the brexit party

1098
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,943
I mean a lot of people did

1099
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
Where they left yet

1100
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
I mean who

1101
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
Just the fracturing

1102
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
Anyway

1103
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,439
Paul has some weird political analysis

1104
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,535
Episode in the first one that seems to have to do with a Twitter poll

1105
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,095
Maybe sure

1106
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
Yesterday

1107
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,983
Tweets from Jeremy corbyn the Labour leader Boris Johnson the conservative leader

1108
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,031
On the morning of the election

1109
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,567
Pointing out

1110
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,615
Corbyn the Labour party tweet

1111
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,663
156,000

1112
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:49,247
Beacon 70 pops we got 12500 likes

1113
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
And that

1114
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,831
Message on the street was consumed on explained

1115
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,903
Support for labor

1116
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,231
Yeah we have a huge Tory majority when it comes to the election

1117
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,767
Voice because

1118
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:05,631
You created this massive Echo chamber on Switzer on social media

1119
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,167
By Banning people

1120
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,751
By forcing self-censorship of alternative opinions

1121
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,567
So don't be surprised when reality

1122
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:16,127
Does it reflect your social media

1123
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
This is great and Alla

1124
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:21,759
Alternate alternate Theory damn

1125
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,087
Victorious filled with f****** old people

1126
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,391
The end

1127
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,927
On the 2019 election

1128
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,743
To show the quote for every 10 years older of auteurism

1129
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,767
The changes in voting

1130
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,535
Conservative

1131
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:37,119
In the UK election increases by nearly 8%

1132
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,935
Conservatives got 16% of the 80

1133
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,751
18 to 24 volt 18% of the 25:2

1134
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,775
229 vote

1135
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,079
And 23% of the 32:39

1136
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,639
How else did they how did they do with the older the

1137
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,455
That's compared to 58% of the 70

1138
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
B+

1139
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,271
And 45% of the six

1140
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,551
T9 vote

1141
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,367
28 cohorts you're not likely to see shooting office

1142
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,159
Comment section to repeat it

1143
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,231
This variable alone could help explain the differences

1144
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
Between tweet

1145
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Votes

1146
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,583
And then you have to take into account the fact that

1147
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,863
Twitter users

1148
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,143
Exist who cannot vote

1149
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,191
UK I don't understand Dan Howell

1150
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
Bacon Rita

1151
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,239
Three things I would like things

1152
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,519
No it's British Twitter

1153
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:21,919
There's a far greater solidarity on the left internationally in space is like Twitter and you can see that in u.s.

1154
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,943
Jefferson Express

1155
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
Support for Corbin in labor

1156
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
Where is internationally

1157
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,575
How many Grassroots folks on the writer necessarily that

1158
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,599
Excited about Boris

1159
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,159
Just off the top of my head these are

1160
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,951
Two possible alternative explanation

1161
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
The phenomenon Paul is

1162
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
Describing but his opinion his

1163
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,815
Feeling

1164
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,351
Is that the differences in tweets

1165
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,655
Cuz I ain't no compared to vote is the result of

1166
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,935
Conservatives being banned

1167
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,519
Twitter and not being able to repeat their support for Boris or something

1168
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
Yeah how many

1169
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,823
Conservatives have been banned for

1170
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,223
Twitter 100,000 is that what he's so cute all of them for what it's worth Paul's Twitter is

1171
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,783
He's verified news over a million followers

1172
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,575
Stuff is all a load of s***

1173
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,159
Play Miss that Twitter victim game with your literally living proof that

1174
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:04,927
The Narrative is

1175
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,047
I I would I would ask him real quick

1176
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,375
Did you retweet the Boris Johnson

1177
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,935
He might have might have I

1178
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,239
Feel like he might not okay

1179
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,287
I'll let you report that is fact

1180
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,335
So you know

1181
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:25,663
Something we're talkin about here a little bit he's date

1182
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:30,783
Polling does show that the youth are far more into labor

1183
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,063
Far

1184
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,367
Higher support of the Tories

1185
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
Conservatives

1186
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,927
In the elderly

1187
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,463
Right which is why the old

1188
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,767
The same is true

1189
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,303
Phenomenology

1190
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,351
People in the United

1191
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,399
Midstates younger people

1192
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,447
Do towards the last

1193
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,751
An older people that like we want your door.

1194
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,287
Now that is

1195
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,311
A true thing

1196
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,103
That it's based on Pole

1197
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
Now

1198
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
Paul

1199
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,943
Wants to explain

1200
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
This

1201
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
Talkin about that

1202
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
Is

1203
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,551
Game

1204
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,575
As

1205
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
The great replacement

1206
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,927
Conspiracy theories

1207
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,207
This is a swing

1208
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,535
I think Paul is way out of line connect

1209
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,327
Snow people on the last descent

1210
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,679
Oh just be patient will win it with the demographics will win it with the mass immigration

1211
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:25,055
Is a white supremacist

1212
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:28,383
But if you talk about it in a positive way and you're on the left

1213
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,431
Then it's perfectly acceptable

1214
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,967
What does a sea of red

1215
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,039
The 18 to 24 year olds in this is the problem

1216
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,575
Because Tony Black

1217
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,135
Basically sent into policy

1218
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,695
This goal of having 50% of

1219
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
The people

1220
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,999
Go to university

1221
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
Now

1222
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:51,679
He's doing that because universities even more so in the UK than the US in many places

1223
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,055
So first of all what a shock Paul feels like colleges are marks

1224
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:57,823
Is brainwashing

1225
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,407
I should tell you that in his deposition Paul did testify that

1226
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,223
He didn't go to college so I guess he's not speaking from any personal

1227
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,063
You're so weird these people who run misinformation Griffith

1228
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,927
Really want people to shutter at the thought of people getting higher education

1229
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:17,023
Almost as if their business model depends on the population devoid of critical

1230
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,071
Either that

1231
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,887
Write Tony Blair the noted mark

1232
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,703
This could be just wanted kids to go to college so we can bring

1233
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,007
Absolutely I think that makes perfect

1234
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,567
The larger problem with that clip is hippolyta

1235
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,591
Disgusting Democrat

1236
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,639
What are you doing is advanced

1237
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,431
An argument that is very dumb on its face

1238
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,711
What the function of its

1239
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:38,527
To be in some ways meant to legitimize

1240
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,855
Is this great replacement theory that no matter how snarkily

1241
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
He says it

1242
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:45,183
He's Advanced by explicit white supremacist

1243
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
What national

1244
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:51,583
His argument fails for a number of reasons that aren't even worth breaking down but I think there's an important

1245
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,863
Distinction between the way Heat

1246
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,143
Discusses demographics

1247
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,703
And how someone noting that the youth support left

1248
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
Candidates much

1249
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,775
More

1250
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,567
And it's about the next

1251
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
Stout

1252
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:07,199
For someone who sees that the younger age cohorts are more liberal

1253
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,223
Tell Kelsey that

1254
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,271
Maybe they'll hope that they retain.

1255
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,551
These political ideas as

1256
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,319
They get older

1257
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
That's it

1258
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,391
For someone like Paul or been either

1259
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,671
Associates with

1260
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
Daisies

1261
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,023
Statistics that immigrants have a higher likelihood of voting democratic

1262
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,047
And that's not it

1263
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,839
They haven't Next Step

1264
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,119
And that's advocating

1265
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,911
Positions like closing the borders

1266
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,935
Mass deportation

1267
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:28,959
Building a wall

1268
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,543
Oh I don't see no I assume that what they wanted to do was

1269
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,895
Create policies that were more inclusive and get those voters onto their side

1270
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,943
That would be an interesting

1271
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,015
Possible way to go but it's not how they

1272
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,599
The next step in the logic is really the problem

1273
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,879
Because it's never analysis

1274
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,695
Like you're pointing out there's never a moment of reflection

1275
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:52,255
Good where you think okay please population segment over

1276
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
Particular

1277
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,071
Is there possible policy reasons

1278
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,119
Their response is a

1279
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,655
Pure need jerk react

1280
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,935
Betsy's a population

1281
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,727
Votes in a way that they don't like

1282
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:05,823
No responses to try and remove or limit that population from the country

1283
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:09,407
Equivalent for this in the age example would be a

1284
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
People in the life

1285
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,455
For holding rallies were they

1286
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,479
Change to the battle Logan

1287
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,831
Run style euthanasia program to remove the elderly from the boat in blocks

1288
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,111
Someplace kyuzo fart

1289
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
The bright

1290
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,719
Or maybe that's too extreme to let the magic they're just saying that no one over 49 can

1291
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Convoke

1292
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
You spoke

1293
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,583
Do note that the younger people skewed left aren't

1294
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
Advancing position

1295
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,399
Specifically designed to marginalize

1296
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
Pause the old

1297
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
People like Paul

1298
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,751
They note that immigrants cute

1299
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,031
To the left go to pattern

1300
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,055
And then advance

1301
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,847
Physicians designed to marginalize

1302
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,895
This is the primary difference

1303
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,431
And why his analogy make

1304
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,199
Makes no sense

1305
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,039
Yeah the rest of the stuff he's talking about I'm not even going to dignify with her

1306
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:51,903
All he's doing is trying to create a what about type argument in order to justify

1307
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,439
Is demographic justify

1308
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,463
Vacations for white Nash

1309
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,767
Because I don't

1310
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,535
Here

1311
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,583
People on the left saying

1312
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,727
All these immigrants coming in to vote for the left so hooray

1313
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,031
I've not heard anybody

1314
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,567
Use that as a Justice

1315
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,591
Application for

1316
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,871
Increased immigration

1317
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
Or maintain

1318
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,663
In current levels

1319
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:14,943
Nope

1320
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:20,831
Only heard that is a conspiracy theory by people advancing the great replacement

1321
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,367
From the right they go

1322
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,903
Cuz it's it's

1323
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,999
I know you are but what am I you're doing it so I have to do it in order to stop

1324
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,583
Of course we're trying to limit the Democratic voting population

1325
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,655
Because that's what you guys would do if you could

1326
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:39,519
It's so f***** up that these people think they're doing good

1327
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,079
But they're playing the game the right way

1328
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,615
It's it's

1329
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:47,711
Brutal

1330
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
The political party

1331
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,807
Similar to that

1332
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,855
So College

1333
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,647
Is Marxist brainwashing

1334
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
We know that

1335
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
Girls last

1336
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,999
Sklepy up bands are you speaks a little bit more about

1337
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,791
Some people would say

1338
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,863
Those 18-24 year-olds

1339
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:11,263
Begging to become Property Owners they going to have more wealth another than actually going to become more conservative

1340
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,055
That's not the case

1341
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:16,127
We don't have problem in the boxes brainwashing

1342
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,943
Because that social engineering last forever

1343
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:24,063
I would f****** love for Paul to even pretend he's not just making s*** up out of thin air here

1344
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:30,719
Colleges are boxes brainwashing km to the powers-that-be want more people to go to college so they will be brainwashed in order to make it

1345
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,279
So they don't naturally get more conservative as they grow older

1346
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,815
What a f******

1347
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,095
Idiot

1348
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:40,191
Saying you know how many assholes I went to college with who study business

1349
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,727
Graduated in their old

1350
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,751
Conservatives now

1351
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,031
Get the f*** out of here the week

1352
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:44,799
No

1353
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,103
Actual data doesn't backup anything

1354
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
Isaiah

1355
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,711
It's all just Paul's feelings the college is liberal indoctrination

1356
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,503
Well when I talk to somebody with

1357
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,783
The college degree they

1358
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,831
Say I'm wrong damn

1359
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,415
The conversation publishes study called ideal

1360
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
Back in February 28th

1361
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,487
The conclusion of a years-long

1362
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
Surveys

1363
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,583
Given to a representative sample of over 7,000 students

1364
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
More than

1365
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
20 colleges starting

1366
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
2015

1367
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:16,799
They were particularly interested in seeing how these students changed if at all and their perception of varying political

1368
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:22,943
They surveyed them when they were just entering college and then again during their sophomore year and the results are pretty interesting

1369
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:29,087
48% of respondents quote viewed liberals more favorably in their second year of college

1370
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,367
They arrived

1371
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,415
The poem must be right

1372
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:37,279
Almost half of these students got sway by Marxist brainwashed

1373
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:42,143
Problem is they also found that 50% of respondents also viewed conservatives more

1374
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
Early after going

1375
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,935
The college

1376
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:47,263
The proportion of those who view whose views worsened

1377
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,383
We're almost also identical with 30% towards liberals and 31 Floyds

1378
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,407
3 towards

1379
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,687
Conservatives their views of them

1380
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,015
I found this paragraph particularly in Port

1381
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,063
Quote the data show us

1382
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,111
That's the most growth and appreciation

1383
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,415
Can happen among people who were initially least

1384
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,975
If I'm either liberals or conservatives

1385
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,511
In simple terms

1386
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:11,071
First-year college students who began College

1387
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
Really

1388
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,375
Disliking liberals or conservatives

1389
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,911
Have their attitudes

1390
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
Softer

1391
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,447
In college

1392
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,007
Exposure to people with different beliefs

1393
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
The news

1394
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,359
In an integrating environment that helps people understand each other

1395
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,919
It seems that the effect of making radicalization

1396
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:27,967
It's not good

1397
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:30,527
For people whose business model is radicalization

1398
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:37,439
People like Alex don't want you to humanize people you disagree with he wants you to think that their demons who can literally only be defeated

1399
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,463
By his yelling

1400
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,511
Would you make possible by buying is dumb

1401
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,279
Pills

1402
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:45,119
According to the Pew Research Center something bad

1403
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,167
What is happening with the people who are on the right

1404
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
Right now

1405
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,471
In terms of higher education

1406
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,543
If you look at the proportion of people on the left

1407
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,567
To believe colleges

1408
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,847
The positive for the country

1409
00:58:55,103 --> 00:59:00,479
That number is been in the range of 67% to 72% from 2012 to the present

1410
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:03,039
Fluctuates a little bit but it's pretty much

1411
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:03,807
Barely

1412
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,391
Conversely on the right there is a distinct

1413
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,159
James

1414
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
It is very

1415
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:12,255
In 2012 53% of Republican

1416
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,535
Can psychologists positive

1417
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,071
And 54%

1418
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:15,839
In 2015

1419
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,655
In 2017 that number dropped

1420
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,423
236

1421
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,471
And now in 2019

1422
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,495
It's 33

1423
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,823
If you look at the graph the approval and disapproval

1424
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,591
For college

1425
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
Collect

1426
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,895
There's something happening

1427
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:32,735
And it happened in 2016 that is leading to a noticeable shift

1428
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,527
And right-wing opinion store Tire in

1429
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,551
Ooida

1430
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,111
You know it's anyone's guess why that's happening

1431
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,671
But I would imagine that the GOP becoming a party

1432
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,975
Completely infiltrated by scam artists

1433
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:43,999
Probably isn't

1434
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,303
Games

1435
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,839
Let me be clear

1436
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,167
I would welcome Paul to show me some evidence of going to college

1437
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,447
Resist

1438
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,239
Greater conservatism

1439
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,263
You're getting older

1440
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,055
But I suspect that's not coming anytime

1441
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,639
It's so obvious

1442
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,431
It just for my experience

1443
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,223
Just would like personal

1444
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,015
Experience on this regard is

1445
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,063
I grew up in a small town

1446
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,343
Isolated

1447
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,927
Everybody's the same everybody believes the same bulshit

1448
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,695
You get

1449
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,023
What would you call it I don't know brainwashed

1450
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,815
Because it's such a small

1451
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,375
Closed off Community it's not even brainwashed

1452
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:25,983
Culture

1453
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:30,335
And then you go to college or a city and you're exposed

1454
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,151
To so many different things and you realize holyshit

1455
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:36,479
I've been told that this was scary for forever

1456
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,759
Now I'm doing it

1457
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,039
And it is not just

1458
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,319
Not scary it

1459
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,087
Great

1460
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,623
A f****** great

1461
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,647
Yeah that's

1462
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,183
That's the way you explained

1463
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:48,255
All of this like why are City so blue and

1464
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,047
Rural areas so red

1465
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,119
Why is it that so many colleges especially on the right

1466
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,167
Are trying to create their own

1467
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
Isolated Edge

1468
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,727
Educational Systems

1469
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,799
Where they have complete control over what even can be said

1470
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,871
You know you look at that grass

1471
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,663
The

1472
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,199
Like the inverse

1473
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,247
From 2015 to 2017

1474
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,575
Yeah and if that should be

1475
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
Cause for

1476
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,367
Alarm

1477
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:19,231
Among the people on the right one of them

1478
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,839
But know what are your things of of like

1479
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,655
Something that you've said repeatedly

1480
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,191
How do we stop this

1481
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,983
Horrible right-wing propaganda

1482
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
Our only hope is

1483
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:35,871
And you're like well now that the people we need to educate the most

1484
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,687
Actively

1485
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
They hating education

1486
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,551
That makes that really really difficult

1487
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,599
Yeah I bet it's not impossible

1488
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,391
Yeah but I think that's probably

1489
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:53,279
It sound for that it's what they think we would do if given the opportunity

1490
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,047
Sure

1491
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,327
Sao Paulo

1492
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,119
Got some dumb things

1493
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,191
Andy wants to complain a little bit about you

1494
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:00,959
YouTube

1495
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,519
Then let's get into poodiepie that's pretty big nose

1496
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:04,799
Is it

1497
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:11,455
Well it's the Great Awakening the residents the great backlash with PewDiePie and social media censorship

1498
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,735
Widely

1499
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,807
YouTube Institute of this new policy

1500
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:22,463
About insulting people based on all these different vague new categories but the thing about it was they

1501
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,511
Retroactive

1502
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
So it's like

1503
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,839
Cuz I passed a new federal law

1504
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,679
Making marijuana completely illegal across the entire country

1505
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:37,055
I could then retroactively do you smoke

1506
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:41,407
2 years ago Wagon Wheel arrest you for it that's how dumb YouTube new policies

1507
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:46,271
The analogy Paul is trying to draw here is absolutely flawed and it doesn't work

1508
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:49,087
At all that's how dumb polish

1509
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,415
Recently YouTube roll.san new changes about moderation

1510
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
Content that is deemed to be

1511
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:57,023
Maliciously insulting people based on things that are

1512
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:57,791
Considered protect

1513
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
The classes

1514
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,095
Like race gender etcetera

1515
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:05,727
But that's what he said these vague

1516
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,287
Sing them I'm proactive

1517
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
Consulting

1518
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:09,823
Cool

1519
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,639
It's all part of YouTube's March towards pretending they're TV

1520
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,199
Network in anyone who's surprised by these or two moves

1521
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:20,319
Either a fool or somebody probably makes money by maliciously and smoke

1522
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:25,695
PewDiePie has far more to worry about regarding these new rule

1523
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,975
Set to kick in at the beginning

1524
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,999
2020

1525
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:28,767
Regarding health

1526
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:32,351
Lake Brantley YouTube is violated the children's online privacy protection

1527
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,935
Mostly because he has a gigantic audience of people under 30

1528
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,471
And their rule

1529
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:40,031
Regarding advertising to children that have been ignored by

1530
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,311
YouTube up till now

1531
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,639
And if they're enforced very likely cut into his bottom line.

1532
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,407
Mysterious

1533
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,711
That has nothing to do with RuPaul's complaining

1534
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,735
Yeah yeah

1535
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,503
Is a big deal

1536
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,783
Concern for something like PewDiePie

1537
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,319
PewDiePie's

1538
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,855
Long-standing

1539
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:57,183
Agreement with Camel cigarettes really

1540
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,743
Isn't going to help her out of trouble

1541
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:02,047
So the reason Paul's argument doesn't make sense

1542
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:06,911
Cuz that one YouTube deciding what content is or is not okay is not a law

1543
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,727
And therefore there aren't ex post facto rules

1544
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,751
Regarding of moderation

1545
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,799
But more importantly

1546
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,823
2

1547
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,615
Content The Toasted online

1548
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:19,455
Constantly new where is if you smoke weed a year ago that's one disc

1549
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,759
That makes no sense to take Act

1550
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,039
Turn against a person for 12

1551
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,599
You actually made prior to allow changing

1552
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,159
Because that action has no effect on the change you're hoping

1553
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,439
To make through the law

1554
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,511
The same is not true videos that are maliciously harassed

1555
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:37,375
If you made a video a year ago the effective harm the rules are seat

1556
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,167
Minimize is present

1557
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,215
Each new view of that video

1558
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:47,615
You could maybe make the argument that YouTube shouldn't harshly punish people for things that were okay before but are now again

1559
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:50,175
Proposed angles completely absurd

1560
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,479
But the other problem is that these aren't new Paula

1561
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,807
They're just saying they're going to expand on already

1562
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,831
Existing rules

1563
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,623
And suggesting that maybe they should

1564
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,391
Actually info

1565
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,671
Yes.fit already

1566
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,695
Expendable

1567
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
Yeah it's it's

1568
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,511
It's hosted

1569
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,791
Every

1570
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,815
Every click

1571
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,095
Is a new

1572
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,167
Running over and over and over again

1573
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,727
It's not it's not like I yeah

1574
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:16,031
That's that's stupid very soon

1575
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:21,151
If Mister Rogers had a YouTube channel and he was sounding the alarm on this rule changing

1576
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:24,735
And not doing with this super flimsy weed legality analogy

1577
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:28,575
I might take it a little more seriously because obviously he's not going to

1578
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,855
Be affected by that rule

1579
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,903
As it is Paul

1580
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,487
But you know damn well that a policy change word maliciously insulting

1581
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:38,815
People based on protected attribute that effectively Works Direct

1582
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,351
Play against his business model

1583
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:45,215
Kind of sounds like a bully trying to fight anti-bullying Rules by crying free speech

1584
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,495
If you don't Halo

1585
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,775
And more than anything

1586
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,799
Like

1587
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,823
It feel like

1588
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,615
Paul talking about his feelings

1589
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,639
Face mask

1590
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,663
Good as a political tool

1591
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,711
I really think that Paul should

1592
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
I should be best

1593
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,551
I really think you should strive to be best

1594
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,135
Also something we don't talk about much because you don't talk about Paul

1595
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,415
Much breathing is important

1596
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,207
I need to point this out

1597
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,535
Paul cannot form sensible analogies work

1598
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
Comparison

1599
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:15,679
He thinks YouTube content rules of the same as arresting someone for something that was previously legal

1600
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,471
Which is when there's a bunch

1601
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,495
Two reasons why that doesn't make

1602
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,311
Events with discussing voting pattern

1603
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,335
Songs based on ages

1604
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,359
The same as the great reply

1605
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:27,455
He thinks like Twitter likes and retweets should match up with voting

1606
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,223
Results

1607
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,503
He's not very smart

1608
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,527
Is what I'm getting at

1609
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,831
He delivers this s*** with a smug present

1610
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:35,647
Knowing what he's talking about but it's all ultimately meaning

1611
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:40,511
It's just a dumb guy saying dumb things that feel good to his audience because they give the veneer

1612
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,303
Of intellect to their bigoted

1613
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,607
You really could have used with some mark

1614
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
Marxist brainwash

1615
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:52,031
Little Community marks is brainwashing you know he doesn't need to go to a full four-year marks

1616
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:52,799
Brainwashed

1617
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:58,175
I didn't want to descend to that level Estee sound elitist

1618
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,711
I mean any basic

1619
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:03,551
Philosophy class would teach you why these analogies that he's drawing

1620
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,343
Legitimately make no sense

1621
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,927
It's not like I graduated I dropped

1622
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:12,767
I'm still not a displacement Theory

1623
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,047
So PewDiePie

1624
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
Right

1625
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,839
He's

1626
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,887
The biggest thing in the world

1627
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,423
According to Alex chair

1628
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,727
Annie's YouTube rules

1629
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,751
Going to screw them over

1630
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,543
PewDiePie

1631
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,567
According to Alex

1632
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,847
To make his own you

1633
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,919
Anybody could launch an alternative

1634
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,735
McDonald's

1635
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,039
He's like a hundred billion views on YouTube

1636
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,367
You talk about just

1637
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:41,183
Old anybody 225 knows who he is

1638
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,719
And the guys really funny

1639
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:46,815
Is he bigger than all of the other media combined

1640
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:53,471
We need we need him to join with us

1641
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,007
Join with Sauron

1642
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,847
Why do you always present yourself as the bad guy

1643
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:02,943
Secret protagonist

1644
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,991
Lord of the Rings oh my God

1645
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:09,599
PewDiePie was on our side that would solve all of my attention problems

1646
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:12,927
What's be the one trying to destroy nuclear weapons probably

1647
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
I think

1648
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,511
So it is next clip Alex says something that I

1649
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
Really think

1650
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,327
Kind of undermines his reason

1651
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,143
People are going to reject

1652
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,471
The NWO whether we're their opposing it or not

1653
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,287
And that's what she's so insane about

1654
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,311
Crazy left

1655
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,383
And the globalist in their Baubles and their big Tower of Babel

1656
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,663
Master plan

1657
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,455
So according to him

1658
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:39,807
Everyone just going to reject the New World Order because

1659
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,599
Why do you need to exist

1660
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:48,767
What is the point of his show if he's not doing anything that's not just going to happen naturally

1661
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,327
Somebody needs to point out that Kevin Nash is just too tall

1662
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,399
Sure that's why he's here

1663
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,191
Well I mean

1664
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:02,079
If this show is just Alex talking about his feelings and it's clearly not

1665
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:05,407
Going to bleed to the political goal that he's seeking

1666
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,687
Nope probably

1667
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,247
Get some therapy into cool

1668
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,015
He could do that

1669
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:15,647
Make way less money selling to you have to pay for therapy

1670
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,439
Where is people pay you

1671
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,719
For free lies

1672
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,487
True

1673
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,279
So Paul is Anisa

1674
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,047
Stupid s***

1675
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:22,815
He's done

1676
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,351
And now Alex has Owen

1677
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,119
Schroeder

1678
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,911
Okay and man

1679
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,471
If Paul is dumb

1680
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,007
Owen Shroyer

1681
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,031
Iraq

1682
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:35,103
Let's find out the clock back out if you remember

1683
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:40,991
In 2016 obviously most the audience will remember the Carl the cuck AIDS Skrillex video

1684
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:45,855
Bat video in 2016 created a new genre of content

1685
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,927
Or people not go out and confront Trump protesters

1686
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:53,023
Posing how they don't know what they're talkin about exposing how they're falling for false narrative

1687
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,583
Exposing how they're all parrots clearly being

1688
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,607
Train

1689
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,631
In practice

1690
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,959
Aziz AstroTurf protest that goes viral

1691
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:05,055
Now Alex we've seen in a very short time span

1692
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,127
It in the in the Cyclone of time here as it gets tighter

1693
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,711
Now we already have after what I did Monday

1694
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,503
Dozens of videos

1695
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,551
A politician being confronted

1696
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,087
This is some of the most

1697
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:23,231
Flagrantly self-congratulatory s*** I've ever seen I feel like I just heard him come a little bit

1698
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,767
He's jerking himself off

1699
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,791
So hard dick

1700
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,863
Unreal is getting up here on the bike and

1701
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:33,471
Pretending that he pioneered a new genre of entertainment when he yelled at some truck protesters

1702
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,495
2016

1703
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:38,847
And that was his publicity stunt at the impeachment hearing he's done it again

1704
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,127
Eroica

1705
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,407
We transformed

1706
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,431
Iron Man

1707
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,711
Media landscape

1708
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:47,807
Single-handedly Howard Stern

1709
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:51,391
Truly the most Innovative entertainer of our time

1710
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,463
Delete James in the game and elevating the art of yelling

1711
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,487
Based publicity

1712
01:10:55,743 --> 01:11:00,607
I would like a Pulitzer thank you very much anybody anybody out here publishers

1713
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,399
On the one hand this is sad

1714
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,935
But on the other hand it's

1715
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:08,543
Like I said he hosted the Sunday show this week

1716
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:11,359
And he started the show by reading basically the same

1717
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,919
About how we invented a new form of entertainment

1718
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,503
What are yelled at some Trump protesters and now after yelling at Congress

1719
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,807
Another new genre is emerge

1720
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:25,951
Leaving aside how Owen was definitely not the first person to record themselves arguing with protesters

1721
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,231
And how everybody

1722
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,535
Preferred the guy who threw a shoe at George Bush

1723
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,327
I'd like to remind him of something

1724
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:36,191
You may recall that video of Owen made the rounds in 27

1725
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,751
We're young girl calls him a f****** idiot

1726
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,775
And give them the finger

1727
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,567
9:30 is the new genres

1728
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
Actor Owen

1729
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,895
Start interview with her saying quote

1730
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,431
How are you young man

1731
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,223
It was real fun to see this

1732
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,247
Great kid out there

1733
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,295
But what you might forget is that Owen

1734
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:57,951
We got on air on Infowars and try to play the victim insisting that he'd open the conversation saying ma'am or not

1735
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:02,047
Man which makes no sense given that he literally says how are you young man

1736
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,839
Young amam

1737
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:09,471
Insisted that the media was lying about him and trying to malign him he said ma'am

1738
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,007
Leroy sane

1739
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,031
Manager

1740
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:12,799
Fair

1741
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:19,711
You might also forget that he started reading Bible verses on air that he took Comfort Inn in his dark time

1742
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:25,599
Which interesting Lee is my favorite genre of entertainment

1743
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,647
Self-serving victimhood wallowing with a

1744
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,183
Televangelism spin

1745
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,207
Yeesh

1746
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:34,559
Next to Alex reading Bible reading Bible verses

1747
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:38,399
Because a young girl that called him a f****** idiot and everyone loved it

1748
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:41,983
God just go to Marxist brainwashing School

1749
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,263
This dude is the worst

1750
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,543
But he also is

1751
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
So not interest

1752
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,663
Is just a desperate attempt to belittle Alex but he just doesn't have the

1753
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,431
The chops

1754
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:56,575
Like Alex Daniela but I recreated investigative journalism by breaking into Bohemian Grove and it's clearly bulshit

1755
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:00,159
But you kind of wonder if Alex actually believes what he's saying

1756
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,951
With all and you know it doesn't believe

1757
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,279
Something the Intrigue out of it

1758
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,863
Could who cried believe that they created

1759
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,423
It's so flimsy it's not even in

1760
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,471
Yeah that's that's been

1761
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,263
That is bananas

1762
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:20,383
You can create a new genre of clip-on Tik-Tok

1763
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:22,431
But you cannot do that

1764
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,455
On YouTube

1765
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,527
This whole thing with Owen is

1766
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:29,599
Largely just about how alike we getting

1767
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,367
Attention

1768
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:34,207
You know it's there talkin about creating these new genres

1769
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:36,255
As a way of being like we

1770
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,839
Really are like we get so many views on others

1771
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,119
That means we're good

1772
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,679
If they talk about another part of this

1773
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,751
President Trump tweeted out our great reporter will Johnson

1774
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,055
Out there at the cap

1775
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,335
He's got a mic

1776
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,151
Flag for his other words as we encourage him to use

1777
01:13:55,711 --> 01:14:01,087
And so they repeat those videos you noticed they don't retreat the Infowars videos unless they don't have the Infowars Mike

1778
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,439
We've done that so it makes it easier

1779
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:09,279
Alex is talking about here is how one of his employees will Johnson

1780
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,327
Send a host of Firepower

1781
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,351
Which may not exist

1782
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,119
Anymore I'm not

1783
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,423
Play sure he was interviewed by

1784
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,495
CBS News back on December 10th masquerading as

1785
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,775
Normal everyday Trump

1786
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:22,335
Supporter hanging out at the rally in Hershey Pennsylvania

1787
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:27,711
Will was not identified as a person who works in the median or is an employee of Infowars but just

1788
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:31,807
I'm a guy who believed that if Trump is removed there will be a second Civil War

1789
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:35,135
If someone who works on are like The Young Turks

1790
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:40,255
Was interviewed at a Bernie event Alex would never stop talking about media manipulation

1791
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:46,399
Pictures of plants you just they were there pushing a narrative Delta evoke lovers himself

1792
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:50,751
Just being shrewd smartest f*** out here buddy

1793
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,823
Not think about Larry Nichols blackmailing Congress

1794
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:54,591
On air

1795
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:56,639
Brian

1796
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:02,271
Define if we do it obviously it's sloppy as hell for CBS tonight vet this interview and presented how they

1797
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,039
They did

1798
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,599
And it's profoundly unethical for will Johnson

1799
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,623
Do not identify him

1800
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,927
So his interview could be taken and it's

1801
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:09,951
Contacts

1802
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,279
As it stands his behavior about to misrepresenting

1803
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,303
Himself by omission

1804
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,071
In order to

1805
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,607
To inject Infowars talking

1806
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,399
Listen to another network discovery

1807
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,679
Which normal journalist

1808
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
Would not

1809
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,215
Do

1810
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,495
But this is the thing

1811
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:27,359
Alex and everyone at Infowars knows full well by this point that taken in their property

1812
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:30,943
Contact they will always be ignored laughed at or yelled at

1813
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:37,087
That's why Alex tell people to misrepresent themselves when they're out doing interviews by using a dawn Infowars bikes

1814
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,879
Pretending you don't work at Infowars

1815
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:44,767
Because he knows that no one presenting themselves as an Infowars employee will ever be taken seriously by normal people

1816
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:48,351
They'll never be able to conduct an interview because everyone knows their brand

1817
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,119
Is s***

1818
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,167
Alex is keenly aware of this

1819
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,471
But seem to think there's a there's

1820
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
Virtue

1821
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,263
In baking

1822
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,799
Into all of his Fieldpiece

1823
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,335
Which is a really bad sign

1824
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:05,247
If you're a reporter in the field and you misrepresent who you work for because you know that your interview subject would respond

1825
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:08,063
Differently to you if they knew who you work for

1826
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,087
Anything that take

1827
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,367
Play some that interview esteem

1828
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,927
It's taking place under false pretense

1829
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,975
And that's fine without

1830
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,511
He can't do anything else

1831
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,375
Even jayleno man-on-the-street interviews the guy was like I'm from

1832
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,399
Jay Leno

1833
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:26,239
Like they know that if you're on Jay Leno as a man on the

1834
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
The street interview

1835
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,055
You're going to look like an idiot

1836
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:32,127
That's just how he even then they're like yeah sure okay

1837
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,919
You guys are what everybody

1838
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,687
Yeah

1839
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,015
So when Owen went to disrupt

1840
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:38,783
The

1841
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,807
Impeachment hearing

1842
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,111
He got arrested

1843
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,159
Jack Nichols

1844
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,183
What happened

1845
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,719
But

1846
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,279
Complain

1847
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,327
About people who interrupts

1848
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,351
The Kavanaugh hearing

1849
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,631
And how they didn't get

1850
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,167
Didn't make it arrested

1851
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:58,751
We'll talk about it yeah the only shorter Twitter

1852
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:05,919
Valiant was women

1853
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,247
Yeah and

1854
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:16,415
Well I don't necessarily want to get into some of the logistics of the legal battle that I made

1855
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,999
Encroaching on right now but you know

1856
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,303
I was arrested I was sent to jail

1857
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,071
They weren't

1858
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:30,239
Why am I such a criminal you know I was perfectly Cooperative I didn't even try to

1859
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:35,871
Point good point then firstthingsfirst good to see the

1860
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:36,895
The crushing bias

1861
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,967
Conservatives on Twitter somehow hasn't affected Owens f******

1862
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,247
Shroyer still having a

1863
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:44,831
Account which is verified by the way retweet Boris

1864
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111
Election

1865
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:50,207
If you do literally any research at all you'll find out

1866
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,743
A lot of people were arrest

1867
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
Surfer protest

1868
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,279
Kavanaugh hearing

1869
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,351
Emma Goldberg wrote about her experience getting rest

1870
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,631
Disrupting the hearing it up

1871
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:58,911
USA Today

1872
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:04,799
On September 4th 2018 as reported by Politico that the police announced they had arrested approximately two dozen

1873
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,567
Protesters

1874
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,127
And ultimately that number would reach 70 arrest

1875
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:11,967
That day among them Linda sarsour and actress Piper Perabo

1876
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,271
Or you can find articles in the washer

1877
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:18,623
The post about protest against the confirmation process leading to 128 arrest

1878
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,647
The Capitol building

1879
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,415
On September

1880
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,183
424

1881
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:24,511
Oh and then there's an article you can easily find in the guardian

1882
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:29,887
About how on October 4th over three hundred protesters engaged in a sit-in to oppose the impending

1883
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:30,655
Vote

1884
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
For confirmation

1885
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,703
We're all rest

1886
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:39,103
I just don't get it beat no muslim leaders are out here condemning these radical Islamic attacks

1887
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:43,199
None of them whole lot of people were arrested in cavanal related protein

1888
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,223
Including p

1889
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,503
People mostly women

1890
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,271
Who disrupted

1891
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,575
The hearing so that raises the question

1892
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:51,647
Why are Alex and Owen just sitting here lying and saying

1893
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,415
These people

1894
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,439
Arrested

1895
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,463
You like

1896
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,511
That's exactly right

1897
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,559
It feels like these women weren't arrested

1898
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,327
Alex

1899
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:01,119
His opinion is that that didn't

1900
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,143
Happened because it's

1901
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,167
Fit with his worldview

1902
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,191
So it's

1903
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,775
Fact that these women had no consequences for what they did

1904
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,055
Where's his Noble UPS

1905
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,335
Son Owen

1906
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,127
So unfairly treated

1907
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
For being paid

1908
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,967
This is legitimately how the sausage is made

1909
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:16,991
Lion

1910
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,807
Jane Fonda's out here getting arrested

1911
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,623
What are we what are you talkin about nobody

1912
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,647
F*** you

1913
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:26,207
Troyer engaging in Civil Disobedience

1914
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,487
Requires a certain amount of

1915
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,767
Acceptance of risk

1916
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,559
If you're going to disrupt it

1917
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:33,375
Congressional hearing you need to prepare yourself that you might get arrest

1918
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:35,679
That's just the possible cost of engaging

1919
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,983
In the contact you feel is morally necessary

1920
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,519
If you believe that

1921
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,287
You'll accept

1922
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,055
The punishment

1923
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,079
Carry on the fight

1924
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:46,175
If you're doing it for a publicity stunt you'll probably do it Owen and Alex are doing here

1925
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,735
You pretend it's an outrage you got arrested

1926
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:51,039
You lie that no one else gets arrested for this

1927
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,319
You'll try to get as much at

1928
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,111
Can for yourself out of it

1929
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,647
As opposed to keeping the attention

1930
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:58,207
Squarely on the matter they are civil disobedience

1931
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,487
It was supposed to highlight

1932
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,767
For instance

1933
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,535
Like

1934
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,863
You don't remember that Piper Perabo was arrested

1935
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:09,215
In the Kavanaugh hearing about herself

1936
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,239
Linda sarsour

1937
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:12,287
He doesn't even remember that she got arrested

1938
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,080
He doesn't remember because

1939
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:19,456
They were rarely on the protest

1940
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:21,248
Being self-aggrandizing bullsh

1941
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:24,320
Put simply Alex and Owen or children

1942
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,368
Who create completely fictional reality

1943
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,160
Which they presented factual

1944
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,720
Because the lies better conform to their feelings

1945
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,256
Then reality.

1946
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:36,096
Yeah yep if I if my reality is this

1947
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:36,864
I feel good

1948
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:39,680
If it's not I feel bad

1949
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,240
So just because reality is different

1950
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,008
That doesn't mean

1951
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
Get in the way of me

1952
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,056
Feeling good

1953
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,592
Feels good feels good

1954
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,128
I would rather feel good than bad

1955
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:48,896
Yeah

1956
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:55,296
So this entire Owen interview seems to be mostly an excuse to end up playing a video of a guy yelling at Joe Biden about his son

1957
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,832
Actions in Ukraine

1958
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,368
Chat about how Trump is innocent

1959
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,160
Danielle's infowars.com

1960
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,720
Owen and Alex revelant

1961
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,000
Celebratory laughs

1962
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,304
This is a big victory in a total

1963
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,864
Slam dunk

1964
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:17,056
They seem to be acting like this is completely organic and natural like people out there just out of their own accord or showing up and yelling

1965
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,336
Looking forward to politicians

1966
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,616
Does Infowars

1967
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,896
Is so successful

1968
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:21,920
So real

1969
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,456
But unfortunate

1970
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:24,992
I listen to Alex's

1971
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,088
MSI recall how on September 29th 2019

1972
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:33,952
Alex Donaire made a big deal out of telling his listeners to go to Democratic candidate events

1973
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,744
And do exactly this

1974
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:39,584
You talked about how in the past with the Bill Clinton is a rapist contest

1975
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,448
He paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to people that got on the news plugging Infowars

1976
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:51,104
He couldn't afford to do that now but the implication was still there that he would reward people who got him the Optics he wanted

1977
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,152
A very least you have to expect

1978
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,176
You get to be a guest on

1979
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:58,272
Show if you did what I was wanted I mean he's had that thirty-year-old guy who sued his parents

1980
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:01,856
Stickman house on more than once

1981
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,392
This under

1982
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
Liza

1983
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,976
Another Super unethical thing that Alex does

1984
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,000
As it relates

1985
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:08,768
Presenting the truth

1986
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,328
He interferes with the stories he's

1987
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,352
Pretending to report

1988
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,680
You cannot possibly report on a story like

1989
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,984
Guy yells Infowars at Joe Biden

1990
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:18,752
When you mix

1991
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,824
Listen to told your viewers to go yell Infowars it

1992
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,104
People like Joe Biden

1993
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,176
Unless you make clear that this person is doing the yelling

1994
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,456
They were directly

1995
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:29,504
He told to do this by your show

1996
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:32,064
Alex's actions at the root of this story

1997
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,368
I'm presenting it as a Grassroots citizen

1998
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,904
Infowars

1999
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:36,928
Completely just

2000
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:37,696
Ingenuous

2001
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,744
This person yelling at Joe is taint

2002
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:42,816
Because Alex has made it super clear many times

2003
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:45,120
The past that getting infowars.com in the

2004
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,144
The plug is part of

2005
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:46,912
The condition of

2006
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,704
As it was the case

2007
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,472
Case of the Bill Clinton

2008
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:52,032
It's part of the in forwards unit

2009
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,824
All of his listeners know

2010
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,848
Is you're going to do something

2011
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:57,920
Like this Alex will promote it if you promote him

2012
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:59,712
It's a reciprocal thing

2013
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:01,760
And not acknowledging that is unethical

2014
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:02,784
On Alex's Park

2015
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,808
Can you imagine

2016
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,576
If

2017
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,904
Presenter at

2018
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,672
Cnngo

2019
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,440
Just started going

2020
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:16,096
Yes or next week we'd really like to cover a war so if somebody could start a war for us that way we will have

2021
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:18,144
Have the coverage that we want we've already got

2022
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
Groundwork laid

2023
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:21,728
It doesn't matter who starts the war

2024
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:24,800
That example might be too extreme. Same behavior

2025
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:29,920
I would ask you to tell him that down and stayed a little bit

2026
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,504
I recognize that it's dumb of me to expect good work

2027
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,040
Please dude

2028
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,344
Things like

2029
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,624
Employees misrepresenting

2030
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,976
And themselves and failing to acknowledge how they are the cause of the stories they're reporting

2031
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,512
These are fundamental

2032
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,840
No organization that's willing to engage in those two

2033
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,632
Kinds of basic malpractice

2034
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,656
Can be trusted

2035
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,680
With anything they

2036
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,984
You like these are bedrock

2037
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,776
You should have to go to journalism

2038
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
Washing School

2039
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,080
It could help

2040
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:00,128
Man that's that's 101

2041
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:04,224
Marxist journalism Breakwater

2042
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:08,064
Yeah I saw a few things like CNN's should have done more wedding and I

2043
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,088
I got that but

2044
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,624
No

2045
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,672
Self-respecting journalist would not

2046
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,256
I would not be like hey I work for the guard

2047
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,048
Yeah and then we can

2048
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:18,816
Can still do the inter

2049
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:22,656
Yeah that's it it's insane to me that he just lied to them and people

2050
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,472
It made me uncomfortable

2051
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:29,056
When we learned that add-on Salazar one of Alex's producers

2052
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:33,152
Who's following us on Twitter because I was worried about the effect

2053
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,712
That our existence could have on the product

2054
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,992
We recovery

2055
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:39,552
And we're not journalist

2056
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:46,208
We play currently dismissive of it

2057
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,000
Because it works better boy

2058
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,048
So Alex

2059
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:53,632
Gets into this is just sort of shity setup

2060
01:24:54,656 --> 01:25:00,800
Nguyen give their systems are challenged that's why they drain the pool

2061
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,480
It always has

2062
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:11,552
A bunch of fancy high-tech systems and

2063
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:15,904
Communist China that is going to work here

2064
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,464
Communist China is on the verge of collapse

2065
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:20,000
This is not

2066
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:23,328
Going to go well if good men and women stand up and say no

2067
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,912
Operation yellow

2068
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:29,984
Beat this is so explicit

2069
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:33,824
Like your ancestors did in the Revolutionary War you stand up

2070
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,968
Also by the way 12 Days of Christmas sale currently

2071
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:44,832
All right.

2072
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:55,328
Second day of Christmas my true love gave to me

2073
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,120
LOL give you the burpees

2074
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,448
Whichever one is cocaine

2075
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:09,920
So interesting Lee I mean we have a lot of conversation on this episode mostly because of Owen Shroyer being on

2076
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,944
One of these stunts

2077
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,480
That they've been doing

2078
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,248
Lately

2079
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,832
And his next clip Alex makes it clear that they've paid off

2080
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:17,856
Sort of

2081
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,880
We probably had

2082
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:22,720
6 mods

2083
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:23,744
That is not

2084
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,072
Translate into any extra sales and imports for.com

2085
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:30,400
Watch they listen okay

2086
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:33,472
Interesting products

2087
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:35,776
But literally do all of this

2088
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:39,104
What's the most important part less than a bulldozer running over the

2089
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,432
The Treads the wheels the engine

2090
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:46,272
The scoop on the front it's all very important but the fuel

2091
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,320
Is Paramount

2092
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,600
Allegory

2093
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,368
So

2094
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,672
Alex is traffic

2095
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:57,280
Tripling now is so much smaller than it would have been in the past

2096
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,816
Like when we were going over the boss

2097
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,352
Embalming. Is traffic

2098
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,144
The doubling

2099
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:05,728
Multiplying by 10 million

2100
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,008
In this case

2101
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:10,848
It's probably just some people who are like a owen Shroyer interrupted the

2102
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:14,688
F****** dude is up to we went from 25,000 hits

2103
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
275

2104
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:19,296
Something like that maybe not that small but something like that

2105
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,064
It's not

2106
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:20,832
That

2107
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:21,856
It's not Millions

2108
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,624
Not good

2109
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,184
It's not

2110
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,232
People who are interested in what he's doing

2111
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:31,072
Now it's like

2112
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,912
You can't translate that

2113
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,448
Any

2114
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,472
Money now

2115
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,264
Really encourage

2116
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,056
That's actually very in Korean

2117
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,384
Don't ever make just as much then

2118
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,408
Sense for him to lie

2119
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,176
Like put a bolo

2120
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:51,552
Yeah let me this is a this tells me

2121
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,600
At least on some level that

2122
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,624
The thing

2123
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,392
That Alex

2124
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,672
Can work

2125
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,720
Which is getting

2126
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,000
More people to watch

2127
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:03,840
You know through publicity stunts doing all these are two things

2128
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,376
It doesn't work

2129
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,144
Translate into

2130
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,936
Thereby into his business

2131
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,216
And again

2132
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,264
That's only taking his word for it

2133
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,288
Rhinos with real

2134
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,592
Based on what he saying

2135
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:17,152
It feels it feels like there

2136
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,432
Probably aren't a lot of options

2137
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:19,968
For what what he can do

2138
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:20,736
Right the ship

2139
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,016
But we'll see

2140
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:24,832
His entire career attention

2141
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,600
Equals money

2142
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:28,160
And now no matter how much attention

2143
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,952
The money stays this

2144
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,744
Daddy just doesn't understand the map

2145
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,560
No that just means that I need more attend

2146
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,096
That's not how it works

2147
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:38,400
No attention no longer equals money

2148
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:40,192
So

2149
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,472
Speaking of attention

2150
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,752
Alex says

2151
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,544
Zacks The Whistleblower on

2152
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,568
And

2153
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,848
Jose

2154
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,640
Did this clip is a really good

2155
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,176
Assertive boil down

2156
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,200
Why this dude is

2157
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:51,968
Realtor

2158
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:58,624
Google what's a blower

2159
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,928
Tell me about the

2160
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,208
So dumb

2161
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,000
So dumb

2162
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:08,096
Google whistleblower Zach Voorhees is on to talk about vax

2163
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:11,936
Seen research he's done now you're telling me about nautical and Breitbart

2164
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:15,008
Every piece of that sentence is stupid

2165
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,544
Yeah I could

2166
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,872
Anyway you here

2167
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:26,272
Talk about an article on Breitbart you read and I didn't let's hear some brilliant analysis about somebody else

2168
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
This

2169
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:28,576
Is

2170
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,368
One of the more convoluted

2171
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:32,672
That I've ever seen somebody walk

2172
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,208
Okay alright

2173
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,512
So it starts

2174
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:38,304
Voting

2175
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,072
Issues

2176
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:39,840
Right

2177
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:41,888
It Ben gets into abortion

2178
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,216
Okay and then it comes back to voting issues

2179
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,496
Alright

2180
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:53,152
Are David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly going to show up because this is a labyrinth I had to take a walk around

2181
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:57,504
Around the apartment

2182
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,784
Oh

2183
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,368
Alright alright I'll do my best

2184
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,392
Someone's

2185
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:09,024
Really dumb and then you keep listening your like I overestimated

2186
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,560
So you're the first

2187
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,864
And now there's a lawsuit that says Hey look

2188
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:16,192
Detroit you're using dead people to vote

2189
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,984
And their responses

2190
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,056
Not that no we're not they're saying no

2191
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,848
Racist video

2192
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,408
That's happening it's a direct attack on people of color

2193
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,176
It's like

2194
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,456
Come on why is

2195
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,736
Accusing them of

2196
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,784
Floating dead people to vote

2197
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,576
A direct attack on

2198
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,368
People of color I don't get it

2199
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:38,720
So when I'm done look into it so what I saved that Zack is really

2200
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,744
Not that smart

2201
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,512
I'm

2202
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:45,376
Mostly talking about his inability to properly assess information and express it

2203
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,936
Because the level at which he's seen

2204
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:50,240
To be able to do that is startling

2205
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,264
Because he's an adult

2206
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:56,896
Although it does kind of go a long way toward explaining why he thought those documents again project Veritas mention

2207
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:57,664
Yeah

2208
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,688
You still don't understand

2209
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,504
The suit that he's talking about him.

2210
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,296
Detroit has nothing to do with any proof of

2211
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:05,088
Someone ever voting in a dead person

2212
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:05,856
Name

2213
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,904
It has to do with there being a lot of dead people

2214
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,184
Still on the voter roll

2215
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:13,792
It's less a problem of any kind of actual voter fraud and mourn issue of Shawty record

2216
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,096
This is true and probably

2217
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,632
Every city

2218
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:18,656
In the country

2219
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,216
These databases are really hard to maintain

2220
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:24,800
And if the political Capital that Alex and Zach want to expend on this

2221
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,080
Is solely

2222
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:29,664
Yo and initiative in order to make sure dead people aren't on voter rolls

2223
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,224
Then by all means they should make that their primary issue

2224
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,040
Yeah I know that anyone's going to ever contest

2225
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:38,624
Yeah except for people who don't want to put the money into that because they

2226
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,160
Just don't want it

2227
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:45,280
Alex him probably wouldn't want that anyway cuz that's funny compliment bureaucracy anyway

2228
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:46,816
But usually issue

2229
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:47,840
That's not

2230
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:48,864
Their issue

2231
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:52,960
The actual real-world concern is if they're poorly updated votary

2232
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:55,776
Which in no way proves the people are voting and dead p

2233
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:56,544
People's names

2234
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,336
In order to remedy this

2235
01:31:59,104 --> 01:31:59,872
These people like Alex

2236
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:04,992
Zach they don't advocate for more resources being directed to the Departments to maintain the

2237
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:05,760
He's rolls

2238
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,320
Instead they want voter ID laws

2239
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,088
To be enacted

2240
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:11,392
Which is solving the wrong problem

2241
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:18,048
Consistently Studies have shown that measures like voter ID laws disproportionately affect voters and predominantly non-white District

2242
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,328
The one that's

2243
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,864
The sort of solution you have to wake

2244
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,168
Sweetly unrelated problem

2245
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,704
It makes sense

2246
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,288
Be less interested in the real problem in mortgage than

2247
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,312
Justifying your

2248
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:30,336
Actual go

2249
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,872
Voter disenfranchised

2250
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,152
I think you might have

2251
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:33,920
Just answered.

2252
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,688
Tax question

2253
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:38,784
She didn't understand that it didn't make sense to him now

2254
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:43,904
Now I assume after you explaining it using reality Adonis will change his mind

2255
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:48,512
The probably not but honestly I don't really know if it is actual confusion

2256
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:52,608
False confusion for performance

2257
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,632
Zach I don't know

2258
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,424
Yeah he really could just be

2259
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,472
Incapable of comprehending

2260
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:00,544
That's one and that's borne out by the

2261
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:03,104
Because he gets onto another story

2262
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,896
I said it pivots to abortion

2263
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,688
Check wasn't sure why

2264
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,480
It seemed out-of-left-field

2265
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,272
Also there's an interesting story

2266
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,808
Botanica thumb

2267
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:12,832
My friends are gone

2268
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,112
We discovered

2269
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:14,880
Stats

2270
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,648
If

2271
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:18,720
Children California

2272
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,768
Don't have to be issued a death certificate

2273
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:24,352
There is truth this is true

2274
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:28,192
So I don't believe for a second that the small-government anti Barack

2275
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:30,496
Chrissy world of Infowars is really concerned with a

2276
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,800
A f****** government requiring more paperwork

2277
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:39,712
It's pretty hard to imagine that they're taking issue with some abortions not requiring death certificates cuz they're super into death certificate

2278
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,992
And the requirement

2279
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,808
Purple

2280
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,880
In reality I believe that this is just an attempt

2281
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:49,440
To frame the opposite side of a

2282
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,464
Conservative an issue

2283
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:55,840
The Republicans currently trying to pass a bunch of bills that would make accessing

2284
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,864
Did Healthcare board Borden

2285
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:59,168
C'Mon people particularly there's one in pants

2286
01:33:59,424 --> 01:33:59,936
Sylvania that's

2287
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:01,216
Disgust right now

2288
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:07,104
Many people interpret this just being purely based on trying to create subtle punished

2289
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:07,872
Meant for things like

2290
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,640
Like a portion

2291
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:15,552
The bill in Pennsylvania would require burial or cremation for all fetal remains and would require death certificates in all cases

2292
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,344
Even including miscarriage

2293
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,160
These sorts of measures don't do anything

2294
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:22,208
They don't provide better Healthcare

2295
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,744
They don't serve anyone's

2296
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,560
But they do create expenses for people

2297
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,352
Seeking reproductive Health Care

2298
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,120
And make things

2299
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,168
Like an abortion way more costly

2300
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,752
Because if you don't do the things that you're required to do based on this bill

2301
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,824
You could be hit up with a fine up to like $300

2302
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,616
It does feel like

2303
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:42,176
So many of these people are

2304
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:42,944
Are like

2305
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
Well

2306
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:46,784
All of our ideas are unpopular

2307
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,552
Stupid

2308
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:51,648
How about instead we punish the poor into the behavior that we want them

2309
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:56,000
Yeah how about we how about we financially destroy people who are

2310
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,280
Accident way we don't want

2311
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,840
These sorts of measures really only exists upon

2312
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:02,144
So the best way to frame the discussion is

2313
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,936
Not talk about those bills like

2314
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:07,776
It's to say hey did you know that some places don't require death certificate

2315
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:10,592
Pittsburgh Orscheln's and then feign outrage about it

2316
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,640
These dudes don't give a f*** about deaths

2317
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:16,736
Certificate is looking for whatever Trojan Horse they can use to attack

2318
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,528
Right or at least

2319
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:21,600
That's how people generally use the sort of rhetoric

2320
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,136
I should have known better

2321
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:25,696
Executive theory about this that without stupid

2322
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:26,976
I've ever heard

2323
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,256
And of course he does

2324
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:30,048
Certain aborted children

2325
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:30,816
California

2326
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:32,352
Don't have to beat you to death

2327
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,120
If it gets

2328
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
And

2329
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:36,704
Their yes true this is true

2330
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:43,104
And there is Dysteria why would they do that is it because they are registering to vote as

2331
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,640
As Democrats 18 years later

2332
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:56,672
Wow

2333
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,024
God is the Lord God

2334
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,584
That is the game right there

2335
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,864
Oli

2336
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,912
Pretty.

2337
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:13,312
Holy s*** that I think that all of the dead people who were on the voter rolls don't have death certificates for them

2338
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,128
What is going

2339
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:19,712
Does he think every aborted fetuses as a name

2340
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,504
This is

2341
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,880
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard it's staggeringly

2342
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:27,904
Shredabull

2343
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,952
Expressively

2344
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:32,000
It really is because that makes

2345
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,024
No sense

2346
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,632
If you if you are capable of putting yourself into anybody else's brain

2347
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:38,912
That

2348
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:42,752
That thought would never accursed

2349
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,544
Here's why they're not issuing deaths

2350
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:49,152
So in 20 years they'll be able to fake votes

2351
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,688
Right that makes

2352
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,480
Perfect sense

2353
01:36:54,272 --> 01:37:00,416
Start doing that are they only starting to program now you get to a certain level where you just like

2354
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:08,352
I can't believe Alexander in the interview after that ridiculous Theory

2355
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:12,960
That's a new one he doesn't push back on it either

2356
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,496
No no no not at all

2357
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:17,056
Of course that makes sense

2358
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:18,848
II

2359
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:23,200
But that means there has to be like a really cool

2360
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:26,272
Placated log of Xander with staggered

2361
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:32,672
Dates when people would be available to the infrastructure on that plan cost more than the

2362
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,208
The death certificate plan

2363
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:38,304
I just don't know I just want to hear stuff like that I'm like

2364
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,632
I can't imagine listening to this showing

2365
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,424
These things not being like Jake

2366
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,472
Kantik red flag

2367
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:51,872
Organic wake up calls you hear Alex not treat someone like that as if they are dangerous

2368
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:52,896
Totally insane

2369
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:57,248
I don't know I know how you can just think I do yeah Alex's got a good head on his shoulders

2370
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
Ethics

2371
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:01,088
He thinks this guy's worth talking to

2372
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,368
I don't think

2373
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,928
Fit physical violence is the answer but my

2374
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:10,560
My first like if I was going to go through the steps of how I would deal with this if he said this to me in person just

2375
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:11,840
Adebayor

2376
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:15,424
He says that and I'm going to start laughing like a lunatic

2377
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:21,056
And then he's going to stare at me weirdly Because he believes it's true right recognize he believes

2378
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:21,824
Strip

2379
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,360
And then I'm going to go no

2380
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:27,456
And my first instinct will be like the only way to solve this problem is with the flat

2381
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,480
But then I'll just walk

2382
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,016
Is it what do you say

2383
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:31,296
I know there's nothing

2384
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:37,696
To say if you know what the problem is too he was a software engineer or software person at

2385
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,488
A Google for 8 years

2386
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:42,304
Kind of got to assume he went to Marxist brainwashing

2387
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:45,120
So like I don't even know what sort of marks

2388
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:48,704
I don't know what kind of educational going to help this one

2389
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,472
Teach yourself to

2390
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:53,824
Dakota lot of people teaching

2391
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,616
That's that's

2392
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,152
This guy is

2393
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:57,920
That stagger

2394
01:38:59,200 --> 01:38:59,712
Staggering

2395
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:02,272
So he thinks that the others he's real problem

2396
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,296
With voting

2397
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,088
Andy

2398
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,392
He owes me an interesting

2399
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,952
Example of voting done right

2400
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,768
We should look to Iraq to really a hot event

2401
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,304
Down cold

2402
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,352
Your finger you dip it ink after you've

2403
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,120
And then

2404
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:19,936
You can only you know put your finger and pink one

2405
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:25,312
Does your finger

2406
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,872
Y'know notoriously

2407
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:30,944
Not full of

2408
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,224
Voting

2409
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,504
Problems Iraq

2410
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,112
Yeah

2411
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:44,768
I didn't think you could top it definitely thought you would have to do some work to Top-Up maybe they're both

2412
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:47,072
Voting in 18 years under aborted

2413
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:53,728
We should follow Iraq's example and you can only dip your finger in ink once

2414
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:55,264
Is a boy

2415
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:58,848
I mean this guy is like

2416
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,872
A pinata that's

2417
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:05,760
Just never a a little bit here in there

2418
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:06,784
Another thought

2419
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,320
Hear about

2420
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:12,160
I don't about voting scared Oregon

2421
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,696
You don't have to come in to do you can

2422
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:14,976
Send an email

2423
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:24,704
Father's going to come in

2424
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,592
Absentee voting in and of itself is

2425
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:33,920
Proof of intention to commit voter fraud

2426
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,688
According

2427
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,712
Into this guy

2428
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:36,736
Who believes

2429
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,016
Who's that aborted

2430
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,296
Fetuses are voting

2431
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,600
Betta rack system

2432
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:48,768
Zach in 2 seconds this is how long it took me to think of this so you think voters you think military people

2433
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:52,608
And US citizens overseas should not be allowed to vote okay well then we're done

2434
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,632
Goodbye

2435
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:56,448
What about people who are like

2436
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,008
Should be able to

2437
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,848
Okay only only able-bodied people we should also Institute a poll tax

2438
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:06,432
Text and I boy however many other ways to be racist

2439
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:10,016
What about people just have schedules

2440
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,040
Such that they

2441
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:13,856
Take the time to go to vote with a w

2442
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:16,928
Well the offer that option to people

2443
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:17,952
There are ways

2444
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:18,720
Twitter

2445
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,512
Super controllable

2446
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,280
This is

2447
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:25,120
I don't even know I remember respond

2448
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:27,680
This is so poorly thought-through

2449
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:28,704
No this is

2450
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,472
This

2451
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:36,384
Vaccine waiting for Zach to be like a lot of people

2452
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:42,784
The left want to make voting day an official holiday and I think we should Institute a 23 and a half hour work day

2453
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,368
A on their mandatory to make sure that everybody votes on time

2454
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:49,696
Yeah it's approved you wanted we get a lunch break

2455
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:53,280
Also all crime is legal for 24 hours why not

2456
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,048
Look dude

2457
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:54,816
This dude is

2458
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,864
IRA

2459
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:59,168
As bananas

2460
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:06,080
If we'd encountered him two years ago he might be up there with my favorite crazy

2461
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:12,480
Like you might be someone who I like

2462
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:17,344
He's not a white supremacist at the other day I didn't know that he believed in his dog

2463
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,416
Maybe I could see this through different eyes

2464
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,696
But for now I'm tired

2465
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:23,744
It could have been our original

2466
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:30,144
Guy with the telescope right here yeah I'm world-weary charmian

2467
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,984
Before

2468
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,800
I'm sorry I could have really enjoyed you over text

2469
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:41,664
But now I think you suck

2470
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,968
I just never

2471
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,016
I've never heard of anything this stupid

2472
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:50,368
I hurt his feelings

2473
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,160
His opinions are done

2474
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,184
He does he has a Feeling

2475
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,464
How is Alex

2476
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:57,280
Even responding to this with the straight face this is amazing

2477
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:02,912
Was it a project Veritas video and has a little bit of celebrity to him and Alex wants to

2478
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,192
To see if we can work with it

2479
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,728
So he's going to talk

2480
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:06,752
Vaccine

2481
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:13,920
Here we go.

2482
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:19,296
I was going to pull the computer chip out of it on Tuesday right they talked about like potential side effects of vaccines

2483
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:22,624
I don't think anyone's denying any of those things exist

2484
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,416
All

2485
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:25,696
Medicine

2486
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,232
But Alex

2487
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,000
Dixie

2488
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:29,280
He's found a slam dunk

2489
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,840
And if you listen to him read this

2490
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,888
He accidentally contradict

2491
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,424
Is entire narrative

2492
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,216
And then tries to just laugh

2493
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,240
As if he has

2494
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:40,800
Okay dad from various

2495
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:47,200
Following vaccination with measles mumps rubella vaccine however

2496
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,808
A causal relationship is not been established in healthy individuals

2497
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,600
See contradictions

2498
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,392
Contraindications

2499
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:57,184
No death or permanent

2500
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:59,232
Does that say

2501
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:01,280
Permanent

2502
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:03,584
Madekwe Lee Tukwila

2503
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:07,168
Reported in the published post-marketing surveillance study

2504
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,984
In Finland involving 1.5 million children

2505
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:10,752
Adults

2506
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:17,152
Whoops

2507
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:20,480
Great save

2508
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,272
Great save

2509
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:28,672
He just saw the word death infection

2510
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:31,232
Is that what's going on with that

2511
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:35,584
Did somebody forget to take their vaccines

2512
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,864
It is at its

2513
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:37,632
Ready

2514
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,656
It's spreading

2515
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:45,568
I mean this is what happens when you have a flimsy ass argument and you think you have the proof and you have no

2516
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:50,176
Miliary with the proof that you're trying to present you end up reading something stray

2517
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:54,528
In there and if you're unlucky like Alex just was yep you will end up reading

2518
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:59,392
How this literally is saying the opposite of what you're thinking

2519
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,416
So that's good

2520
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:01,952
Now Zack

2521
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:02,720
Though

2522
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:04,256
He is not an expert in any

2523
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:05,536
Did anything

2524
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,072
He did get

2525
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:07,840
A vaccine

2526
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:16,288
Feelings about okay I decided that I want to get

2527
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,080
Vaccinated

2528
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:20,640
Against fpd who won it

2529
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:24,480
Take a shot and all of a sudden there's one less thing to worry about

2530
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:28,320
And then after getting the shot I started getting

2531
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,088
Kind of sex

2532
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,624
Like headachy

2533
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:32,672
Striking like the flu a lot

2534
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:35,744
And now in retrospect what I suspect

2535
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:39,072
Is that I suspect that the vaccine was extruding Factor

2536
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,864
And I suspect this because of all the

2537
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,400
Poisons that are in the

2538
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:43,680
He's vaccine

2539
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:45,216
That's your feeling

2540
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:45,984
Onnit

2541
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:48,544
What's your definition of getting the flu

2542
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:51,104
I suspect

2543
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,128
How many hours

2544
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:54,432
This means nothing this is

2545
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:55,712
That's enough

2546
01:45:55,968 --> 01:46:01,600
A whole lot of what they present is just like Alex is like my uncle got a tetanus shot in Hackensack exactly

2547
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:04,928
Yeah I mean at least this is Baseline stupid this isn't it

2548
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:09,280
Way out in the following voting

2549
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:17,216
Yeah it's mostly anecdotal stuff that is like okay I don't know your uncle Ali I don't know

2550
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:19,520
If you're telling the truth about this and even if you aren't doesn't mean

2551
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:20,800
Okay Ali

2552
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:23,616
You just read a thing saying there was a study

2553
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:26,688
Done with 1.5 million healthy children

2554
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,736
That showed no

2555
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:29,504
Causal connection

2556
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,272
In between that

2557
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,344
And then you presented as evidence

2558
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,112
Against it

2559
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,904
Your uncle didn't like a

2560
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:39,744
And that got a Gardasil vaccine and suspect

2561
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:47,168
So so I'm going to go out on a limb here and say I'm going to trust the the big one this is how this stuff

2562
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,288
Spilling aspect is so dangerous

2563
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,312
Is because what he

2564
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:57,664
He's doing is he's appealing to people's parts of the brain that work on narrative

2565
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,712
Story story

2566
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:03,296
That may or may not be true of an exactly Nicole getting a shot

2567
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:05,088
Anime guy

2568
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:06,368
Got hurt by a

2569
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,184
That is more compelling than this

2570
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,000
Study of 1.5 million right people

2571
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:16,352
You can wrap your head around so I know somebody who's got in the shop

2572
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:18,656
Before and maybe I think they did act

2573
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,704
That's the part of the brain

2574
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,728
Being hijacked

2575
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,264
Now like I said

2576
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:24,544
Zach is dumb

2577
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,312
And

2578
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:27,872
Here he shows himself to also be dumb

2579
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:28,896
In the field of vaccine

2580
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:30,176
Ever know anyone with

2581
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,200
A peanut allergy

2582
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,248
Do you know why

2583
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:35,296
Stop

2584
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064
Stop right there

2585
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:40,160
They were using peanut oil as an adjuvant for vaccines and now they stopped

2586
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:41,952
And now the peanut allergies are

2587
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:42,720
At Conway.

2588
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:54,496
Alex knew the answer to that question but he didn't want to steal next on me

2589
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,032
Zach is very dumb

2590
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:59,616
There's a narrative an anti-vaxxer colls that is very calm

2591
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:04,992
The peanut oil was used in vaccines as an adjuvant

2592
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,528
And this explains peanut allergy

2593
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,064
That sounds pretty

2594
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,856
Be out there but it's very common

2595
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:10,880
And that world

2596
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:11,904
Really yeah

2597
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:15,488
Every single instance of this narrative popping up traces back to one

2598
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:17,792
There may be a bunch of books

2599
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:22,656
The make the claim and there may be a ton of websites repeating it but if they had to produce their concrete Source on it

2600
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:24,448
It would all point to one

2601
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,216
Single thing

2602
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:27,264
There's an article in the New York Times from 9

2603
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:29,568
Before that they were misrepresenting

2604
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:33,920
The article does mention that there were clinical trials being done by Merck

2605
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:35,200
Involved vaccines with

2606
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,224
The peanut oil based

2607
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,248
Adjuvant in it

2608
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:39,552
The article in no way demonstrates

2609
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:42,368
These trials resulted in the product being approved for human

2610
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:43,904
When or even non-human you

2611
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,208
This article

2612
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,256
As well as another for 1960

2613
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:50,304
See sex about a public discussion

2614
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,840
Anne of the clinical trial

2615
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:53,120
Are presented in the book

2616
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:54,912
Peanut allergy epidemic

2617
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,448
Heather Frazier

2618
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,728
Which is the source

2619
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:58,752
Zach probably thinks

2620
01:48:59,008 --> 01:48:59,520
Exciting here

2621
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,800
Very popular book

2622
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:01,568
Circle

2623
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,616
Snopes looked into the claims

2624
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:05,664
About the peanut oil adjuvant being used

2625
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,688
Vaccine given

2626
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,224
The public in frayser

2627
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:11,552
The author of this book reply to them quote

2628
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:13,856
Adjuvant 65-4

2629
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:14,880
The peanut oil

2630
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:17,440
Was never licensed for use in the United

2631
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:21,536
I did not mean to suggest that this Edgmont was used outside of her

2632
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:23,072
Clinical trials in the United

2633
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:25,632
This person who wrote the book

2634
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:27,168
Even says the peanut oil adjuvant

2635
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:27,936
Wasn't used

2636
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:29,472
Clinical trials

2637
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,008
And yet the narrative

2638
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:31,776
Persist

2639
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,568
Because it makes sense

2640
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,336
Feels

2641
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,360
Right I hate

2642
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:36,384
These people sell by date

2643
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,688
Feels like it makes sense I hate them so much

2644
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:39,712
Peanut oil

2645
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:43,296
Feels right

2646
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:44,832
Meredith

2647
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:45,856
Send

2648
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,416
I'm not saying that

2649
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:49,952
That's

2650
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,000
Text against the law

2651
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,024
There should be a law

2652
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,816
Zach is repeating complete bulshit

2653
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:56,864
Probably read on natural news

2654
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,656
Announces allowing this

2655
01:49:58,912 --> 01:49:59,424
Because this

2656
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:02,496
Accurately depict other field vaccines work

2657
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:03,776
None of this is real

2658
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:07,104
Public Health

2659
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:07,872
Risk

2660
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:14,272
Shouldn't there be some sort of like FCC like will send him a couple letters of like clearly this is Falls content please take

2661
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:16,576
We got plenty of time

2662
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:21,440
We're not being ain't we're not angry with you maybe you didn't know maybe this wasn't malicious

2663
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:24,256
I don't I don't I don't know I don't know how you do that

2664
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:29,376
Like eagles like you got to be something because that's just

2665
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,656
Evil

2666
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,960
Killing people with

2667
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:34,496
Dumb bulshit life

2668
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:35,264
Damn

2669
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,824
There's not much really in terms of the meat

2670
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,616
About the vaccine stuff

2671
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:43,456
That's not a surprise if there is a lot of peanuts there is

2672
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:44,224
Not a lot of me

2673
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,504
Really dumb

2674
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,528
So

2675
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,064
Big talk about

2676
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,088
Dislike

2677
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:54,464
Think about how vaccines are evil

2678
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,000
Conspiracy fact uyurken

2679
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,280
Conspiracy fact

2680
01:50:57,536 --> 01:51:00,352
And then Alex talks about how he's not allowed back on Rogan

2681
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,120
Anymore cuz Hill

2682
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:05,984
I'm not allowed back on right now cuz it's because of the number of podcast.

2683
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:07,520
Was your

2684
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:16,992
Because will tell you read them

2685
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:25,184
Small Point Alex's second appearance on Rogan show does have

2686
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,976
16 million views

2687
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:29,024
Second most popular episode

2688
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:32,608
Rogan's interview with Elon Musk has 28 million views

2689
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:33,888
His way boards

2690
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:34,656
16

2691
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:39,520
Alex's first appearance has less views than what a Rogan's interviews of Ben Shapiro

2692
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,288
Is less than

2693
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:43,616
The time you sat down with Bernie Sanders Edward Snowden

2694
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:44,640
And less than

2695
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,920
Two episodes

2696
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:47,456
Featuring Neil deGrasse Tyson

2697
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:51,040
I suspect Alex just isn't someone Joe wants to have on much right

2698
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:52,832
As a special event

2699
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:53,600
Insanity

2700
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,368
Sure

2701
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:56,160
No need for that ship more than once

2702
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,696
Two-year yeah you do that reggae

2703
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:00,768
At the log diminishing returns with

2704
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:02,304
That kind of a show is

2705
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,328
Instant

2706
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,096
Yeah

2707
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,888
They're talking about these backs

2708
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:06,912
Brave

2709
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,192
And they go to

2710
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:10,240
Perfect

2711
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:12,544
They took

2712
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,080
They took out a Nutty

2713
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:16,640
Vaccine and I'm not talking about peanut oil adjuvant

2714
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:17,920
I'm talking about cuckoo

2715
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:19,712
Cuckoo bananas guy okay

2716
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:21,248
They come back from commercial break

2717
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:25,088
I don't even start talking about cannibalism

2718
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:29,952
I don't know what I don't feel like this relay

2719
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:31,488
2D surrounding Conte

2720
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:32,512
List of anything

2721
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:36,096
But Alex just starts talking about cannibalism

2722
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:37,376
Inform you Jordan

2723
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:38,912
Alex Jones

2724
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:44,032
Kind of pro cannibalism I actually thought that was going to be the

2725
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:50,432
Voorhees myself about different pentagons studies they've done in situations

2726
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:56,832
Food most people become cannibals

2727
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:04,000
I wouldn't go out and grab other groups of people in them

2728
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:09,888
But I'm just being honest with the lizard brain kicking in the lower brain

2729
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,680
What's a trading party comes your house

2730
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:16,288
That you haven't eaten in about a week and a half there trying to eat you

2731
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:29,856
Alex is a cannibalism apologist

2732
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:30,880
REI

2733
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:34,464
I think I used all of my laps on Zack's first clip

2734
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:40,864
When does the

2735
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,912
I didn't know what to do with myself

2736
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:49,312
Okay did you look into the exact numbers of people

2737
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:51,616
I don't care

2738
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:54,688
Somebody to

2739
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:56,224
That's my plans.

2740
01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:01,344
Start people for 10 days it turned its like the Stanford Prison Experiment but if

2741
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:06,464
Cannibalism is 1.5 million people in 1982 they founded

2742
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:08,256
80% of them

2743
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:14,656
Wind up eating the 20% that killed themselves and everybody was fine it was the only people who really got bones

2744
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:19,776
Existed it would never be back talk about a lot

2745
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,360
One of the biggest

2746
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:25,920
In human history

2747
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:27,200
How much does it take

2748
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:28,736
To turn people into cannibals

2749
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:31,552
What was the great thing is your torture

2750
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,088
Yeah for the study

2751
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:35,392
Another one result of it is

2752
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:39,488
Either they commit suicide or they each other

2753
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:42,304
And if there's one thing I know it's that

2754
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:46,656
The ethics in scientific

2755
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,960
Dutch that that's okay

2756
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:51,520
That's just okay it's all for the pursuit of science

2757
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:54,080
And if there's one thing that I know

2758
01:54:55,872 --> 01:55:02,016
HobbyKids

2759
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:04,064
Party

2760
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:08,160
Only eat self-defense humans

2761
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:10,208
Waukegan

2762
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:18,144
There is such a joy to listening to Infowars

2763
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:20,448
When this happened

2764
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:23,008
I hate the show so much and listen

2765
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:28,128
Listen to Paul be a f****** idiot not be able to make an analogy to Owen Shroyer pretend

2766
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:28,896
Years like

2767
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:33,248
The liquid the Innovative showing the century

2768
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,784
Creating new genre

2769
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:36,320
Listen exact be

2770
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,600
Completely

2771
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:38,880
Doll and dumb

2772
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:40,416
Like that's all

2773
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:41,440
Hartford

2774
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:44,512
Then 3 hours into the show

2775
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:49,376
Hey man you know what I'll eat a raiding party I'll just be honest

2776
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:51,168
I will eat people

2777
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:00,640
No he's not re-elected today

2778
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:02,432
You can handle

2779
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:04,736
Let's all grow up

2780
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:06,528
Come on guy

2781
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,296
Come on

2782
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:13,440
Where where it's all it's just us here now we can all just admit to Arizona wild weed eat people

2783
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:17,024
And some of us have eaten

2784
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,048
Pooped in the sink

2785
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:23,168
If you don't think that we can all relate to as something we did or would do

2786
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:29,312
It also really calls into question what other fundamental human taboos Alex would break

2787
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:30,336
In

2788
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:31,360
Do you have

2789
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:32,128
Tactical apps

2790
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:35,456
If you're if you're willing to

2791
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,480
Let's say

2792
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,784
Humans as opposed to

2793
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:39,808
Borage

2794
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:40,576
Yeah

2795
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:42,368
Of course

2796
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:44,416
I'm going to tell you I'm going to tell you right now

2797
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:49,792
If there's one bad guy that I know Alex identifies with it would be a more tanjo

2798
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:52,608
Mad Max Fury Road

2799
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:58,752
Okay no doubt in my mind that he's like no drinking breast milk I'm loving it

2800
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:00,032
Eating people

2801
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:03,360
The poor are going to starve to death I'm all about it

2802
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:06,176
So this isn't the only thing Alex has to say about cannabis

2803
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:07,456
Apparently

2804
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,992
It is there more there is

2805
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:11,808
Disgusting

2806
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:12,576
You know

2807
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:25,888
True story

2808
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:32,288
They'll send the logs

2809
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:37,152
What

2810
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:39,968
Okay

2811
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:44,064
Ambiance about it

2812
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,088
Lesbian

2813
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,416
I'll be honest I didn't look into that because I don't care but

2814
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:49,952
What's really seems to be like

2815
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:52,000
No qualms

2816
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:54,304
About eating peanut he's fine with it

2817
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:56,352
He's he's ready for the epochal

2818
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:59,424
He has been preparing and now it's.

2819
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,960
I don't remember Humphrey Bogart

2820
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:07,360
Eating anybody a movie but I guess that must have been the case if you are so blase about eating p

2821
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:10,176
People why do you sell survival food

2822
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:16,064
I will tell you the answer to why you sell survival food

2823
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:17,856
Made up

2824
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,648
I think

2825
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:20,416
That like

2826
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,440
Okay yes

2827
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:22,720
If put in

2828
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:24,000
Into that situation

2829
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:25,536
Where it was I'm going

2830
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:26,560
To die if I don't eat

2831
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:27,328
A person like

2832
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,352
Let's say

2833
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:33,472
It's a are we doing this I want to draw an important comparison

2834
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:35,520
Put in the

2835
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,288
Situation

2836
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:39,360
I don't know what I would do but has a really decent chance

2837
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:40,128
I b

2838
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:43,712
But if I did it would f****** up forever

2839
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:47,808
One of the most horrifying thing that I would have to do

2840
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:49,600
I probably never be able to

2841
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:51,648
To deal with it could never leave you alone

2842
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:58,304
Alex is printer Beyond 24-hour suicide watch

2843
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:03,168
Hannibal apologist

2844
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,704
I've no way

2845
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:11,104
No way I'm in the 20% all the way I'm I have a hard time making it through the day and I eat well

2846
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,664
Yeah I think there's a decent chance

2847
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,712
I would go that way

2848
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:16,992
Expressing is that like

2849
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:18,528
Sitting here with you right now

2850
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:20,064
I don't know what I would do

2851
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:20,832
In that circumstance

2852
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:27,744
There's a possibility but I recognized it would be traumatic it's not traumatic and Alex's

2853
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:30,048
It's not weird

2854
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:31,072
It's inevitable

2855
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:33,376
You know what you might as well get past it now

2856
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:34,912
It's going to happen

2857
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,472
So it's like you might as well deal with it preemptive

2858
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:43,360
I think you're I think you're just not preparing yourself to eat somebody's Alex

2859
01:59:43,616 --> 01:59:44,384
Is embodying the

2860
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,688
The end result of doing that preparation

2861
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:53,344
I don't want it I'm looking up recipes right now on my phone I'm going to find a way to sautee it

2862
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:54,368
A person pretty well

2863
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:55,904
I wish you the best

2864
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:58,464
Sitting here right now with you

2865
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,000
One accident and I'm eating

2866
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,536
Yeah that's

2867
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:03,840
So they have this cannibalism

2868
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:05,120
Conversation

2869
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:08,448
Gets back to vaccines right the end of the episode

2870
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,728
And

2871
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:11,776
Overseas like

2872
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:17,408
Hungry right I don't know why I just turned into a roast

2873
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:19,200
Lego Looney Tunes

2874
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:21,504
They talk about vaccines

2875
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,272
Access

2876
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:23,808
Come on man

2877
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,088
This so dumb

2878
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:25,856
Japan

2879
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:30,464
15 years ago band children under 2

2880
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,768
You actually got

2881
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:33,536
It right

2882
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:36,864
Zack should be made aware

2883
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:42,752
You might be surprised to learn this that your pain is currently battling their largest measles outbreak in over a decade

2884
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:46,080
Directly traced to people not being vaccinated out

2885
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:50,176
I think if he says they've got it right

2886
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:51,456
Then he asked you

2887
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:52,224
Explain

2888
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,016
There and they should have.

2889
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:55,296
Iraq's voting policy

2890
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:56,576
Well I think that would be

2891
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:57,600
Everybody needs

2892
02:00:57,856 --> 02:01:01,184
Dip the finger pretty soon Japan will be right all across the

2893
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:02,464
This episode is

2894
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,000
Terrifying

2895
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:06,048
Glimpse into

2896
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:08,352
The show into the way these guys

2897
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:09,376
Actually think

2898
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:11,168
It's insane like

2899
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,984
They need the amount of this that when

2900
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:16,032
Viewed through the prism of like

2901
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,824
He feels no obligation

2902
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:18,592
To say things

2903
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:19,872
That he can

2904
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:20,896
Defend

2905
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:27,040
When pressed on it does result like Underoath saying I did a lot of it's me talking about my feelings

2906
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:28,576
One click

2907
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:29,600
Through that prism

2908
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:30,880
It does make a lot of sense

2909
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:34,976
Never presented that way

2910
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:35,744
It's always

2911
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:40,096
I'm telling you things that are based on reality

2912
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:41,632
It's it's

2913
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:42,656
It's terrifying

2914
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:44,960
Also everyone around Alex

2915
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:45,728
Is

2916
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:46,752
A different

2917
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:47,776
Kind of loser

2918
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:49,056
That is just

2919
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:50,080
Profoundly

2920
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:54,432
Paul Joseph Watson Owen Shroyer this exact fella

2921
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:56,480
Just

2922
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:57,504
Just

2923
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:59,552
Bombers mix you what like

2924
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,856
Because of the way that this feels

2925
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:02,880
To me like

2926
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:05,184
The the show is very much like

2927
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,232
We're ripping around

2928
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:09,024
It's very personal

2929
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:10,304
And it's

2930
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,584
It's very much like

2931
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:14,656
I'm bouncing stuff back and forth off of you

2932
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:16,448
Like that's what it it feels like

2933
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,472
To me like nobody

2934
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:19,008
Nobody's really paying attention

2935
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:22,080
Lifeforce yeah yeah

2936
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:24,128
It seems to me like it

2937
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:27,712
How many how many of these guys if you scratch them

2938
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:30,528
You know if you wanted these famous pub

2939
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:33,600
Commentators are Congressman or whomever if you just like

2940
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:36,672
Scratch them too far on one subject how many of them would have

2941
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:37,696
Dumbbell fly

2942
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:39,488
Oh I'll tell you right now

2943
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:43,072
They're not doing death certificates because they're voting 18 years

2944
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:46,144
I like how many of them

2945
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:49,472
Cuz that's pretty far out

2946
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:51,520
Yeah I don't know

2947
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:52,288
Yeah it's

2948
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:53,824
It's pretty

2949
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:54,592
F***** up

2950
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:56,384
To think that someone

2951
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:57,920
Willing

2952
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:59,200
To espouse that

2953
02:02:59,456 --> 02:02:59,968
Believe

2954
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:01,760
Yeah would have access

2955
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:04,320
To a radio show

2956
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,856
Theoretically has

2957
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,648
A million listeners Harvard I would like

2958
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:08,672
That's

2959
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,024
I mean he did like

2960
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:19,424
Iran has in a certain level I think part of it is just the unfamiliarity with that

2961
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:20,704
Insane

2962
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:21,984
Bang

2963
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:24,800
Which which is why it feels so crazy

2964
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:27,104
Cuz I've never heard anybody say that

2965
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:31,200
What does aborted fetuses are voting

2966
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:36,832
The other thing too is that

2967
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:37,856
Like Alex

2968
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:38,880
Clearly

2969
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:43,744
Is is not heard the aborted fetuses are voting Theory either

2970
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,608
You kind of want to surprise and he feels

2971
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:49,632
No need

2972
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:52,960
To discuss it further

2973
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:57,824
He has no he feels no responsibility to do anything

2974
02:03:58,336 --> 02:03:59,360
Tube frame

2975
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:02,688
The presentation to his audience so they can take the information in

2976
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:03,968
In a better way

2977
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:06,016
This allows it to be presented as a

2978
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:09,088
Hey this is Zach is real credible guy and here's a thought

2979
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:09,856
He has

2980
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:13,184
I mean you have to very unhealthy the only reaction

2981
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:17,024
He can have it has to be like because it's a human reaction

2982
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:17,792
It is like

2983
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,328
Get out

2984
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:20,864
