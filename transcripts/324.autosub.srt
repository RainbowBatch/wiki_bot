It's something I felt what we needed

75
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
To do is something a little bit

76
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,855
I didn't feel like talking about the present day out

77
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391

Belongs riling people up with artificial passion about made-up subjects

124
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:01,279
Connected to reality and would like a union boss collage

138
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
Rhetoric in it

139
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Kind of

140
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,671
Passionate oratory that like

To know how do you

Is very scary

149
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,759
Because you don't have Alex in the studio and he's such a

150
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
Without a crowd to work off of

151
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
He is kind of

152
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879

With

158
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,615
A group of people in the palm of his hands

159
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
Something amazing to behold

160
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431

161
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,503

Now first things first just a small quibble

197
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
Thousands of percentile point is 8.

198
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
Musical phrase

199
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
Specifically

200
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
Out of 100

201
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
You know that scent

202
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,151
In the middle of a giveaway of 100 100

203
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
I know that there are four months

204
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Thurso left

205
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,087
In 2019 it was still in the clear to fact-check Alex's

206
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Conspiracy

207
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,231
Is going to give 40% of the people in the United Kingdom cancer by 2020

208
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
It turns out

209
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
It's one that was

210
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
Nope

211
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,727
According to most recent data from the cancer research UK

212
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,383
595 person diagnosed with cancer per 100,000

213
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Some people

214
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
So that would be

215
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:14,367
I would even go with thousands of a person if they were 40%

216
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:19,999
About 640,000

217
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,399
Prediction Alex

218
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,239
It literally

219
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
Boris Johnson is the new p.m.

220
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
And he still got four months

221
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,455
Large-scale like nuclear disaster

222
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,527
It would take something that would steal the headline

223
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
People have cancer

224
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
Soca 2013

225
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,423
2016

226
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
Next Step

227
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
Evil globalist they're somehow going to give

228
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:08,639
A million people in the United Kingdom alone cancer

229
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,967
For real I don't know how anyone could just

230
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
Evil globalist cabal could pull that off

231
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
If they existed and wanted to

232
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
For some reason given the entire population

233
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,607
Here's an insanely short. Of time

234
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
426 million new

235
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Go to be diagnosed

236
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,751
Alex is all trying to play this game where you staying at the globalist

237
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
Slowly trying to talk kill everyone

238
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
Put in the same breath

239
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,407
Cancer rate in the United Kingdom is going to jump

240
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
4.6

241
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
Percent to 40% in less than a decade

242
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
This is

243
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
Breakneck speed

244
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
Stupid

245
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:53,695
How long does it take to build

246
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Freeman

247
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
That seems really really hard

248
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:03,167
Especially

249
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:07,263
Put their minds together a lot of cool stuff

250
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
So

251
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,687
Look there are plenty of people in the world who are trying to sort out why can't

252
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Answer racing

253
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,039
In the world

254
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,903
And one of the biggest reasons that every scientist point is that we're living longer

255
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,511
In statistics clearly show that the risk Rises dramatically

256
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,583
And jumps again in the 80 or older

257
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,935
As our life spans of extended so two of the numbers of people surviving

258
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
The point

259
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
To become more dangerous

260
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
To excel

261
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
It's very easy to see how the single variable

262
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
Can explain a ton of Verizon cancer

263
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
Rate over the past

264
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
Fifty or so years

265
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Some researchers in the UK

266
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Suggested that

267
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Two-thirds of the riots

268
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,343
Cancer rates in is

269
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Clearly and see

270
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
Singularly attributable

271
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
Do that one variable

272
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
People living longer

273
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,559
As well to Rising rates of Obi

274
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
B3 putting people at a greater risk

275
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Development

276
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
The popularity of

277
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
Tanning played a role in the rise of

278
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,007
Pollution

279
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,799
Factor carcinogenic

280
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,663
Access to our exposure to

281
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
Alex is also

282
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,759
So I dipped it in those trying to figure out like

283
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
What could you pay

284
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
We be talking about

285
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,623
Yeah cuz it's so crazy that sounds

286
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
And I figured out that he's misusing his

287
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
Statistic has included

288
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
A study done by a guy named Peterson

289
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Gary

290
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
Cancer research

291
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
UK

292
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,167
A preliminary study in 2011 that Alex is most likely just

293
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
And then

294
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
Sesere followed up his

295
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,079
Study with a more in-depth study

296
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,639
It's flashed out his original finding

297
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,735
His show that approximately half of the people born

298
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
Since nineteen

299
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
60 would be diagnosed

300
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Cancer in their lifetime

301
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,599
But

302
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
Intentionally misrepresent

303
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:06,559
An important qualifier with these data is

304
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,631
What's the Define their lifetime is being a fool

305
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
85 years

306
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:15,519
This is David's heavily skewed by the elevator

307
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Set up to round

308
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,431
Answer ateez estimating our product

309
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
You see the general population

310
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
The number jump

311
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
60

312
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
August

313
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
There's a heightened risk of

314
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
Among the elderly

315
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,719
And if we all lived until we were 85

316
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,815
Then you'd expect about one out of every four people to have been diagnosed with cancer

317
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
The study literally says quote

318
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
The cumulative risk

319
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,447
Answer to age 40 is small

320
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Teresa

321
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:50,079
The children teenagers and young adults will have little impact on the eventual lifetime

322
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Business class

323
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
He's taking a headliner a study that says

324
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
Pretty Twisted to make his own son

325
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Sensational

326
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
Completely absurd

327
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,343
Right I generally try to give his audience

328
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
The really big Ben

329
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
Personality

330
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:10,303
But I don't know how you can hear someone say that's 40%

331
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
In the next seven years

332
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
And not pick Theory

333
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
Complete idiot or a liar

334
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
It's just a testament to

335
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
And not even worried for a second that

336
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,615
His status is a leader of a guy who

337
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
Reads things

338
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
Is going to be threatened

339
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
It's not yes

340
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Stranglehold

341
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
Do use the name of the song by guy you like

342
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
It's it's crazy

343
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
It's so beyond

344
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
The pale of what's acceptable

345
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,023
How you interpret those statistics

346
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,887
Suspect for a lot of those people especially the one that

347
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
Rally there

348
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
He started saying like

349
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,567
40% they were like okay cool

350
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
Let me know when you get back to yelling

351
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,247
Now they loved it really loved him just going like

352
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,807
I saw an article

353
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:08,671
Said 40% of people in the UK are going to die how about that

354
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,791
I don't know man

355
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
A terrifying

356
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,143
To think about like there was

357
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
Video that I found that was like

358
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,751
About Alex

359
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
And they interviewed some people who are there

360
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
And

361
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
At least a couple of them

362
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
Words

363
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Confuse

364
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,343
About what was Alex Jones

365
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
He is informed

366
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,231
Conspiracy

367
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,815
So it might be a lot of them are just there because people like Alec

368
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
Around them

369
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,911
Well I don't like the

370
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Power

371
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
And

372
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
Seems like a place where I can

373
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,591
This is where things are happening

374
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,895
You know the same way that people in the 70's

375
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,967
60s might end up at some weird hippie event

376
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,039
Don't really know exactly what's going on

377
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,599
I was told to come to San Francisco

378
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
Vectren

379
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:17,279
There might be a little piece of it.

380
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,071
Really scary

381
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
If you just wandering about

382
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
Good stuff I don't like

383
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
Yell so much

384
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Breakthrough

385
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,175
Because in the middle of us had a power outage

386
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,031
Never fear the boulevard

387
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Butts

388
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
It's pretty quickly

389
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,151
He doesn't actually enough

390
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
He probably just

391
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
Zaragoza

392
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,087
Freeman forum

393
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
F****** rock band

394
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
Yes

395
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,720
Dramatic

396
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,048
Super paranoid people where the power just goes out they must have been like

397
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:28,448
Professional wrestling

398
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,544
That moment when the power goes out is

399
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:42,272
We are about to get bombed

400
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
Physically look for themselves

401
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,280
Alex dimensions of secretive

402
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,192
Stylecraft

403
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,456
Sterilizing

404
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,696
How would you know if he wasn't there

405
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,512
Find I was there

406
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,888
We get back to this

407
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
But Alex's

408
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
One of his big narrative

409
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
In this

410
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,432
I don't know why

411
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,248
About how they're all going to get cancer

412
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
It's weird

413
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,016
Remember

414
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,064
When is Serena Williams child

415
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,304
Donating money to find

416
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,944
It's not a good metaphor

417
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
Analogy

418
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
Metaphor

419
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
You can do both

420
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
41

421
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,024
You're killing all the cops that's why we can't find out who

422
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
The budget

423
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
The problem is

424
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Metaphors

425
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,216
Like that you really get

426
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
To have his brain

427
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
So essential

428
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
If someone is doing

429
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
Yeah

430
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,760
Just be something that is naturally occurring

431
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
Yeah we have to study it

432
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
To be able to

433
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
Understand better

434
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,136
Cars

435
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,672
Preventive measures

436
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
The early

437
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
Signal fires

438
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
Early

439
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Didn't catch it

440
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
In time

441
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
All of this is

442
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,728
You can study and understand

443
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
And we have

444
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Amazing

445
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:52,224
A beetle

446
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
Even then in his analogy

447
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,368
He's like why are you trying to

448
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
That's stupid

449
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Well

450
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,352
No cancel

451
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,752
Zippyshare no totally that's someone's job like

452
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
Make the medic

453
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,080
Solve the Jack the Ripper mystery

454
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,616
And you shouldn't make the cop

455
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
Treat people in a hospital

456
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,480
It's a different job

457
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,112
So Alex gets towards the end of his pee

458
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,672
Features a lot of filler and a lot of just rambling

459
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,744
I am you start screaming about how you need to take all this very purse

460
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,872
Fremont

461
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
Question

462
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,824
World population

463
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,344
Debilitating

464
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:44,352
It's really good that he reframed rephrase the question long

465
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:50,752
Tell with his rhythm and meter on

466
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,872
This is definitely like

467
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:04,320
Ono Ono Ono water release

468
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:10,976
It's only sullenberger of here

469
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:15,328
Landing Landing question right in the hubs

470
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,728
Make it personal and take it

471
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,544
How you get angry about something

472
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,592
He wants everyone there

473
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
And what's the gold

474
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
You have like a thousand

475
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
We going to storm the castle

476
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,992
What's the goal

477
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,576
What do you mean like afterwards like when the rally

478
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,368
It's obviously making more money for our

479
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,416
Alex

480
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
What it like does

481
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
Distend

482
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:49,632
I don't like full video of what happens like 2 hours after

483
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:55,008
Blow up the Bilderberg

484
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
And some it's something

485
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:01,920
I never went back to their lives and their Infowars

486
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,272
Everything was good everything was copacetic

487
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,624
Especially because

488
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,440
Alex

489
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,744
I don't actually want any action.

490
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,584
Like if you go to

491
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:25,984
This is Bi-Rite

492
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,848
Whatever you do

493
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:36,480
By becoming aware of the things that I'm telling you

494
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,040
We have already taken the necessary action

495
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
No

496
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:46,208
If I went to a Bernie rally and he was just

497
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Alright

498
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
You heard me

499
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,168
Let's get on out of here we had a great time hearing my message we have

500
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:02,336
Now how many yellow box

501
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,616
Crazy rally

502
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,456
With almost

503
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
No effort

504
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
It's crazy

505
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,304
That's bananas

506
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,488
Right now I tell you what my camera person

507
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:57,888
Huge crowd of people thousands and thousands and thousands more than turned away

508
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,984
That's so Trump

509
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
Who did turn away from this

510
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
Beatles

511
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,384
I don't know what

512
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,920
Overflow

513
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
It's

514
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
Just cuz I don't believe it

515
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:17,600
No it's not true

516
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,120
That pathological need to over blow

517
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
What kind of

518
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,960
Draw you have a malignant narcissism

519
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,544
Very strange it manifests in such a similar ways

520
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
Any people who

521
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
The time had nothing

522
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,456
Become in

523
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
Text Rick

524
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,272
From each other

525
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
Very bizarre

526
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,856
So Alex

527
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
Great

528
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
The sun setting

529
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
Time of day perfect match

530
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,496
Magic hour

531
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,336
So I wanted to do this and I wanted to talk about this

532
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:15,968
2013

533
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016
Like his ability

534
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:22,368
With a crowd is important to not forget that

535
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,928
Maybe he's lost some of his step cuz I don't

536
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,744
Do that now he probably freak out

537
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,424
No not not know about of her before

538
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,008
It's going to allow him to

539
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
Just six years

540
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,128
That I think it's important important part of his story

541
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
Stump speech

542
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,016
Without trying to get into narrative

543
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,320
And just like

544
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
It's pretty remarkable

545
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,880
Incredibly bizarre

546
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
The Jordan

547
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,976
Do an episode that was

548
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
Just about

549
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,792
I need to tell you something

550
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
It was somebody else who gave us

551
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,912
YouTube that exact same Rally's

552
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
No

553
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:12,800
Hi again I a go do you f****** don't

554
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:19,200
Don't you goddamn don't how dare you

555
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
Call your lovely face

556
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:27,136
Kerry Cassidy

557
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:33,536
The fluid to the United Kingdom ticket to hangout if you Fringe

558
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,840
Or whatever it was

559
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
And us

560
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
She gave a speech

561
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,704
Yes I think earlier in the day

562
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,008
I don't think she got as Prime of

563
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
And believe me she complains

564
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,456
She did not get a prime placement on the schedule

565
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
Seems to be a little bit of a sticking point

566
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,136
To give a 20-minute speech

567
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
That is

568
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,952
Completely bizarre

569
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
Bilderberg

570
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,792
Right

571
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656
You know pretty receptive audience

572
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Don't you

573
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
Insane conspiracy-minded people who

574
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:19,104
Who gather there to Galaxy World Elite

575
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,920
Be a billionaire a billionaire

576
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
That's it

577
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,064
Yeah and I don't want to come down too hard

578
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,648
Define past

579
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,720
Certainly

580
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,328
Even so it does attract

581
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
May have some

582
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,728
Even if the actor yelling at billionaires

583
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
Completely

584
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,288
Good on you

585
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Security gives the speech

586
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,384
And we'll get into it we're going to ever going to listen to

587
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,432
Eclipse here.

588
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
Is a 22-minute

589
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,528
Also

590
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,344
Here we go this is her complaining about her

591
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:12,352
So I don't know if I should wait until the rest of the crowd gets back over here so

592
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,400
Repeat myself

593
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:18,752
I'm at living here because actually I was supposed to speak

594
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,336
Try to grab my spot again at 6

595
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:26,176
Because we were hoping to broadcast it live in California

596
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:31,552
As you know the time difference is kind of bizarre so

597
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,624
It's sometime in the morning or like a weekly ad

598
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,928
Something like that in California right now

599
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,560
Cover Springs

600
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,864
Complaints about the time fly

601
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,264
Had some kind of router whatever kind of things go in from

602
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
And that

603
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,944
The government

604
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,736
What

605
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:07,136
Carpet of course I don't know if other reason why

606
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,976
Why you walk in here and do that because you had nothing better to do

607
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
So the router is gone

608
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
Got2b

609
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,912
Yeah the government is coming taking the router

610
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,008
The Chicago boy

611
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,568
That's like when you're on stage opening riff

612
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,128
So bad that you have to derail everything

613
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:34,784
Visible

614
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,904
There's a number of times but it does look like she's responding to someone giving her a light

615
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,488
I don't know what happened

616
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,072
Schedule time slot was supposed to be how long

617
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,888
If she is going long I have no idea

618
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,680
But this is not a good set

619
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
I don't

620
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
Feel bad criticizing

621
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,056
For reasons it'll come up later

622
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,128
It might seem like we're being very hard

623
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
Embarking

624
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
What is

625
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Probably 20 minutes

626
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
Thrilled

627
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,528
Are recorded

628
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,832
Consideration

629
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,624
The first is you posted this on Broadway

630
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Second

631
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
Hold those thoughts.

632
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,840
Text Carrie talking about how she

633
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
She's too big

634
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
YouTube

635
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
She's too big

636
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
To be giving a speech

637
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,704
In the morning

638
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,752
On a hill deserve by

639
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,616
English-style because I don't understand

640
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
How do you have a prep

641
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,480
Area that's the same as the place where the people demonstrate

642
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,576
The meeting goes on over there

643
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,464
A from for example The Washington Post the New York Times

644
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,048
UK Guardian

645
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:56,448
Or other papers that that might want to interview

646
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,008
You me tomorrow or actually Sunday

647
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:06,176
At least have a shadow

648
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,968
Obviously has a pretty big

649
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,504
Profile out there

650
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,552
I have a fairly big one

651
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
You know not

652
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:17,184
Trying to to be egotistical here at least we have a problem

653
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:23,328
She kind of insulting literally everybody else is there

654
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,912
It's kind of sociopathic Behavior

655
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
You got it was soon

656
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,728
At least

657
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,800
Adorable

658
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
Cross-section of the people who are there

659
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,408
Who travel to Bilderberg BLT billionaires

660
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,200
Fancy themselves citizens

661
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,784
There's probably a great number of people who have

662
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,832
Their own blogs their own

663
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
Vlogs

664
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,136
At this point

665
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,208
For her to be like you know like you know there's

666
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
Notable media

667
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,072
Places they're not even here

668
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
The somewhere

669
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,912
The other than Alex Jones I got a following

670
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,192
That was really

671
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,288
Brood

672
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,568
Bilderberg

673
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,104
What is she

674
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
What is she

675
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:14,272
She didn't have anybody

676
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,600
I don't I don't know where Bill and I do know where

677
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,904
Partner Bill Ryan

678
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,304
Project

679
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,192
You know there is a very rare type of

680
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
Performer

681
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,664
And they love it

682
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,456
Can get up on stage be like

683
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,272
Absolutely

684
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:56,768
Very rare steak be able to pull that off around 7

685
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,352
As the example

686
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
Kind of clothes

687
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:07,008
Insult people

688
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,032
Jeselnik

689
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,824
I guess some people

690
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,176
Charming

691
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Carrie's

692
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
Even

693
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
Trying for that

694
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,648
The very people

695
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
H2O

696
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
I'm big

697
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:32,608
The router got stolen dumbfucks don't even realize that the government

698
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,912
Crazy

699
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,240
I don't know why she brought up the router

700
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,520
Call I don't know

701
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,336
That's interesting to me

702
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,640
You solved the mystery that no one else has

703
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,968
Elevate yourself

704
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,272
Above the rabble

705
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
Even more

706
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:57,184
For those of you who don't let me just say that my specialty is whistleblowers

707
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,976
From Above Top Secret

708
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,816
And 7 years

709
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,656
Long before Wikileaks with Denver and ideas somebody's head

710
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,752
Suck it. They're actually traveling the world

711
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:17,408
Interviewing whistleblowers and what we do is we would put the camera there and I would ask them really the heart

712
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,176
Hard question

713
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,832
For like 2 hours straight and narrow Boris Intuit

714
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
Shimoni's on the web

715
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,440
We have luckily been able to certify

716
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:35,072
History speaks

717
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,632
Made a pilot for a TV series

718
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,192
Scare the s*** out of them

719
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,264
TruTV that they put it on the shelf for two years

720
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:47,360
Finally released

721
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,176
He just slipped it in on truTV

722
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:56,832
You got touch with us at just ahead of time 24 hours in advance

723
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,392
Theirselves

724
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:04,768
The money from various

725
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
Witnesses that we do have

726
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,864
I have an alternative theory about how that went down

727
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,424
This show is

728
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,240
We can't put this out

729
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,544
Let's bury it sometimes luck is work

730
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,872
Contractually obligated

731
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,480
TV show

732
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,112
Very bad

733
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,184
You're not worth it

734
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
I would say

735
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
The child

736
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:45,728
Recovering project

737
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:50,336
Camelot I mentioned a guy named Andrew basiago

738
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,175
Doing a project Camelot interviews

739
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
I don't think

740
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
He has

741
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
Weird

742
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
Speeches about how

743
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,879
Time travels with Obama

744
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
Children

745
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,487
Teleport it to the moon and works on a base

746
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,791
Something along those lines

747
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Half dolphin

748
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
Ikea open

749
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,935
He's got a lot going on

750
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:22,847
He doesn't need to have that right

751
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,687
One of my favorite not of this world

752
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,479
I've always been very disappointed that I couldn't

753
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,503
Find it

754
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,783
Kmart project

755
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,807
Warren

756
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,599
Them team

757
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
It seems like they be chocolate and peanut

758
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,695
He's in the season

759
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,767
You one of the people that interview with the truth

760
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
PVC

761
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,815
So I was like

762
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,351
Maybe that's what I

763
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
Thought

764
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
I don't know

765
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,167
I don't

766
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,239
Future give you some f****** idea with it

767
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,591
V-series what threatened to put it on the Shelf

768
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Carrie

769
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,719
Billiard name

770
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,279
Now she's doing a promo

771
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,607
Problem Child

772
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:23,775
Adele-hello Rothschild I know after I visited him here

773
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,127
Okay

774
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:34,527
So I want you to understand for the past

775
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
7 years

776
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:41,951
Legitimately so to speak in the public what the New World Order is really doing

777
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,023
Secret government is really doing

778
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,327
Who's really running the planet

779
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:52,447
And what's going on and how do you put those sort of ducks in a row so that you understand it

780
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,519
And then once you understand the planet

781
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,895
I'd like to draw Sharp

782
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:05,247
Attention to how when Alex was speaking the crowd was going nuts

783
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
There was a crowd

784
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:11,391
I don't think there's much of a crowd here you can kind of hear babies walking around

785
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,927
People talking in the background

786
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,975
I don't know if I have any of the

787
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,815
Where is having somebody else having an interview

788
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:25,215
Like on stage

789
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
Today there was a

790
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:32,895
I think I built the stage later

791
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:37,503
Victor junior varsity tent

792
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,855
Somebody's somebody's like do you want to go across the field and see Belle and Sebastian cuz this

793
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:51,071
Okay festival or whatever

794
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,191
So important to point out like this

795
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
Various

796
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,727
Exquisite connect

797
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,751
Between Alex

798
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,823
Project

799
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,871
B-both soffit

800
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
To travel to the

801
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,663
The UK

802
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,199
To give a speech in the same

803
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,759
Around Bilderberg 2013

804
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
Crazy

805
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
Weird

806
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,087
It's very weak

807
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,391
Sing everybody

808
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
Through the beginning of this I'm too big

809
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,511
To be given speech

810
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,839
For WikiLeaks

811
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,887
Sure why not sure lock nuts

812
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,191
And she continues being insult

813
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,751
If you give you some

814
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,287
Set up

815
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,359
This was part of a much longer stretch

816
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,431
It was still unclear to talk about

817
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,783
Is talking about how

818
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063
The real people hookah

819
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:44,831
Control the world

820
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,135
Underground

821
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,439
So then what is she doing there

822
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:54,047
Exactly

823
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,351
There's a piece of this like

824
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,887
Bilderberg ain't shitt

825
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,775
Spectro vs. like if they're having this

826
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,311
I'm here then that means

827
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,383
They're not afraid of being open about what they're doing

828
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,199
Okay

829
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
I don't know

830
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
Insulting

831
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,807
The very idea of all these people who have called

832
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:19,391
Yellow billionaire the Bilderberg

833
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,415
FaZe this isn't

834
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:26,047
This isn't the real go to aldebaran or whatever

835
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,071
Instead of the marionette

836
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,095
Bright

837
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:35,775
Actually do it from underground and from planet so they're doing it replaced

838
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,823
A base on Mars and the Moon

839
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:44,479
Interstellar

840
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,551
Maybe radical thinkers

841
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:56,767
Let me Translate

842
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
You don't

843
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:01,119
Talk to the same nutty people that I do and believe them

844
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
You guys think you're smart

845
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:08,799
You didn't talk to this guy in the Rothschild

846
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,615
You haven't talked to a murderer

847
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,735
Who hangs out with rapper

848
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
Nope

849
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:21,599
From The Darkside into the light

850
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,415
Can deliver a message

851
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,975
It has been weighing on your mind

852
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:33,631
Import of what they know and what it has what's the meaning of that is for Humana

853
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:41,311
That's the nature of a whistle

854
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,943
Tasha Smith

855
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
Has Ashley

856
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:56,159
Cuz they start to realize

857
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,975
What's really been contributing to

858
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,767
Which is the device

859
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,327
Humanity as we know it

860
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,959
No claws

861
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,983
You cut that part out

862
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:10,751
Nope

863
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,823
Not really there's one part where she gets the round of applause

864
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,871
When she says the people in charge of the United

865
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,199
Another route

866
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,527
It's not it will receive

867
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,807
Upset

868
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,623
With the Whistleblower stuff

869
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,695
I think our investigation

870
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,975
Of the people that

871
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,511
CiCi's Pizza

872
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,791
Indicate

873
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,095
Are monkey Rosewell

874
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,863
What

875
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,239
One part one cross-section of America

876
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,311
Like someone

877
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,151
Cross-section of the people that you talk

878
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
Post-traumatic stress

879
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,711
Disorder

880
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,247
Or something else

881
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,295
That is leading them to class

882
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
Taking advantage

883
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,135
The second group are continents

884
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,951
Just people like Sean David Morton

885
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,975
Outright car

886
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,047
Mark Richards is a f****** conman murderer

887
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,399
I don't know exactly what Simon parkes is up to but he is a f****** cock

888
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,615
It's so speed through its

889
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
Pikachu

890
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,455
These people are just people

891
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
Waze on their country

892
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,527
I want to help Humanity

893
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,575
Get the f*** out of here

894
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,623
Fun mythology

895
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,463
Feels like she's trapped yourself into it

896
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,535
Like she is completely trapped into that mythology

897
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,095
For her to go from

898
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:43,679
These people are heroes traveling from the dark

899
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,703
Into the light

900
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,751
And then wind up with like

901
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:52,639
Oh my god I've spent the last two years in 2013

902
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:56,479
6 years ago

903
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,527
Teen years of herb saying

904
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,063
Cogman are heroes

905
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,367
It all ripped away from her at 8

906
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,159
Bit too much of a blow to recycle

907
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,463
Yeah there's no

908
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Like

909
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:14,399
That's basically being deprogram from a cult after you your entire family has

910
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,447
Chosen to stay there

911
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,263
You know there's more

912
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
She might

913
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,335
Beyond board widths

914
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,127
That I might have some

915
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:30,015
Give a s*** about making fun of her having a bad day

916
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,831
I think I might turn the corner on this lady okay

917
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,767
Her expressive narrative

918
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,351
Global Elite

919
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,375
They're trying to create

920
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,399
Anu

921
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,935
Human

922
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,703
You're not

923
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,239
Involved

924
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:54,335
You and your family are not apart of the future according to the

925
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
Club

926
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:59,711
So they're working very hard on Humanity 2.0

927
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,271
You're not perfect.

928
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,695
And if you're not at the right bloodline

929
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,231
Combination

930
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:17,375
You are simply not part of the future here on planet Earth and neither are your children

931
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:23,519
Well yeah they're in your children

932
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:31,455
To figure out what their genetics are coming in

933
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,247
Where am I

934
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,015
Alright

935
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,807
I'm on board I don't believe

936
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,599
Leave you but this is where I kind of like

937
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,135
To go where

938
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:48,607
F****** Wolverine

939
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
We're going to get into

940
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
Fanfiction

941
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,727
Can get onboard

942
00:51:53,983 --> 00:52:00,127
Oh no but it's almost route no no

943
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,455
Different riddle

944
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:13,951
Why are autistic child

945
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:20,351
Children

946
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:29,567
So that there was more autism now than ever before and the reason

947
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:33,151
They're doing that because they're looking for precogs

948
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,783
Between being a vegan autistic child

949
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:43,135
Autism

950
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,671
Oh God

951
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,975
How how do you f****** ruin

You're making s*** up why you have to Moline

955
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,431
It is like a weird simultaneous

956
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,247
Dehumanizing of all autistic people is

957
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,015
His creation

958
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:11,807
The government

959
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,135
Will the same time attributing their autism

960
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:15,903
As a superpower

961
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,439
Like

962
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,999
Dick move

963
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,815
Dickish all over the place

964
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:26,655
What fun we could have had absolutely

965
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,679
To be like there

966
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,007
Autism or the water gives

967
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,287
Autism or whatever

968
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,567
In order to be like

969
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,103
There's just something missing

970
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:41,247
Physical happening

971
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,783
Blame

972
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,551
Bothers me

973
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,159
It also

974
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,695
Clones are in

975
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,231
Play okay that's good

976
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,119
Presidents of United States

977
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:04,031
George Bush for example is one example that has been used numerous times that you know the younger

978
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,967
Understanding is

979
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:17,855
Who are you

980
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:21,695
Wednesday really clone a lot are the sort of

981
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,999
Pyramid

982
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,047
The second level

983
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,351
Those people like

984
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,911
The people in there actually

985
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:34,239
Notice of the crowd didn't laugh

986
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:38,591
Settings

987
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,639
Or something

988
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,223
Now this is where things get real weird cuz what do you think

989
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
She's talking about

990
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,271
Like with clowns

991
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Interesting

992
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,183
That's how I that's how I usually take

993
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,207
These people

994
00:54:54,463 --> 00:55:00,607
Is there feel on clones right right

995
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,911
Quesadilla

996
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
More

997
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,727
Reasonable

998
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:09,311
Conspiracy universe

999
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,847
Motive

1000
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,663
Send

1001
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,199
Have like

1002
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,479
If I am

1003
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,831
Two or whatever I become political

1004
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,111
Relevant figure

1005
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,135
You could start

1006
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,927
Clone

1007
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,719
I don't know 2002

1008
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,255
You have the forming organ

1009
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,327
How to grow the clock

1010
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,935
That's dumb but it makes sense

1011
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:38,239
Are we are we carrying these as

1012
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
Are we are we

1013
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,567
Creating

1014
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,359
Clowns and then putting them in

1015
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,407
Women to give birth to

1016
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,175
Growing them

1017
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,223
Like a like I tried to grow meat

1018
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,759
Here's the problem

1019
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,903
No

1020
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,695
Carry Steam

1021
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,487
To be operating under the assumption

1022
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,303
Like if I were to call myself right now I could

1023
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,327
You just have another day

1024
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,399
Like another 45 girl thing

1025
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,983
Wonder One

1026
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,335
In this next

1027
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,127
Scorpi talks a little more about the Clone

1028
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
They use them to

1029
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,527
Menial tasks.

1030
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:25,855
So if George is George W bush needed to give us

1031
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,135
She didn't want to give

1032
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:33,279
He could send a poem but the way the truth operator

1033
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:39,679
Clone doesn't last all that long but they can certainly control them

1034
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:46,079
Ashley

1035
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,359
Transparency

1036
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:54,015
So David Cameron to come out giving a speech about

1037
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,343
They don't last long how long do they last

1038
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,647
Terry

1039
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:04,767
Mary what is the median

1040
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,095
Just like welcomes only last about 2 to 3 weeks

1041
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
Have

1042
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,983
Form of consciousness

1043
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,519
But they can be controlled

1044
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,311
Are there identical

1045
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,079
To you

1046
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,919
Wow also

1047
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,967
The top of the older topic

1048
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,551
The Clones would be old

1049
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:33,183
You're not replicating you're not like creating a new generation of rice rice

1050
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,743
You can't transfer The Conch

1051
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:41,119
Dismissed

1052
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,983
But you can different process

1053
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,151
Is real

1054
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,199
And then refuses to explain it

1055
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,735
It's very frustrating

1056
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,343
Scary insults

1057
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
Harper Hempel

1058
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:10,559
Especially someone as far as The Fringe as I am is one

1059
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:16,959
Have a few people even with all due respect

1060
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:23,359
Baby

1061
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:29,759
For sure

1062
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:34,879
Probably at the same hotel with Bilderberg people are at

1063
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:38,975
Give a f*** about all you people sitting out in the fields

1064
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,047
UPS

1065
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,191
Security guards

1066
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:52,543
He's a billionaire operation compared to you Podunk

1067
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,079

00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,615
He's out there

1069
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151
Million-dollar Steakhouse

1070
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,991
Getting getting his meat on before he has to go out there and sweat from

1071
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,527
The face yelling about the global

1072
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,575
That's always one of those

1073
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,879
F*** you for

1074
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,927
Yelling about

1075
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:14,815
If Jesus was a rich person also is Legend wouldn't have

1076
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,095
Gone on as long as

1077
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,631
Be like

1078
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,655
F*** you

1079
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,703
You know there's that there's a really interesting

1080
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,727
Ecosystem

1081
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,495
What's going on here

1082
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
Inasmuch as

1083
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,311
Alex

1084
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,359
As the celebrity

1085
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
Either comes in

1086
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,407
Endgame

1087
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:32,735
Exposure for the people who are all there

1088
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,551
Some form of alternative credibility

1089
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:42,975
All the failures who are there

1090
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
Mysteries

1091
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,535
Support

1092
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,815
Feedback in

1093
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
This is

1094
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,399
How many parasitic for Alex

1095
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,423
But it's also

1096
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,983
Tubi

1097
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,055
Yeah.

1098
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,335
Symbiotica valix list

1099
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:01,151
Did those people

1100
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,431
No

1101
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,967
Or even

1102
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,503
Behind it never make

1103
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,527
Any progress

1104
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,575
Towards something

1105
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,367
Sitter if there was truth

1106
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:14,207
I realized

1107
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:18,303
Oh that's never going to think about that help make it more

1108
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,911
Symbiotically right advancing towards working together

1109
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:27,519
We're in reality what's going on conscious or not all of those people who are

1110
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,055
You're not necessarily carry

1111
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,335
Because she's on some other s***

1112
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:35,711
Billionaires in Bilderberg and I have blogs about it

1113
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,783
Aspire to be is the Alex

1114
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,367
The person who gets the

1115
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:45,951
Rousing cheers

1116
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:52,351
They don't actually want to take down anybody what does that look like

1117
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,423
No of course not what do we do do we

1118
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
Keep yelling

1119
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,471
Yep

1120
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,543
They want to be on the neck

1121
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,847
Next level of the hustle

1122
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,639
And because I was understand

1123
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,943
Daddy can't allow more talented people

1124
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:09,247
Access to

1125
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,783
Embarrassed

1126
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,087
The hustle is all very transparent

1127
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,111
Hey take a step back

1128
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,439
Watch some of the speeches of other people

1129
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
Comments

1130
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:26,143
Situations like for Alex it absolutely is a zero-sum

1131
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,471
Means that I lost

1132
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,055
It's not like

1133
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,079
This comes around and everybody

1134
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,919
It's like f*** you

1135
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
Didn't get out of my face

1136
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:43,039
So curious one last clip we're going to listen to hear from her speech

1137
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,343
I told you she did get Applause

1138
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,879
USA

1139
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,903
Is run by Nazi

1140
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,439
Woohoo

1141
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,463
60 years later

1142
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:52,767
She's finally right

1143
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,791
Well she's going

1144
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,631
What you got from that

1145
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,167
And she's going to explain why she

1146
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
She came to the UK

1147
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,031
Free American

1148
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:10,431
I'm over here because I was really important for America to come to Britain

1149
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,271
And my truth

1150
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,807
And basically

1151
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:22,207
I know I'm on a mission and I'm not going to stop

1152
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:28,607
Human being on the planet

1153
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
So she wanted

1154
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,191
Eagle this riff

1155
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:32,959
Between the United

1156
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
State mean

1157
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,615
But I'm here to say that

1158
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,687
I think she brought

1159
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,735
Long-standing Alliance

1160
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:50,879
Special friendship between countries back to homeostasis

1161
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,415
I think we should all appreciate it

1162
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,231
History books

1163
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,511
Remember this day

1164
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:02,655
As first of all the beginning of the end for the globalist absolutely

1165
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,423
Between

1166
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,703
The United Kingdom in the United

1167
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,775
Text Carrie

1168
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:10,847
12

1169
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
Between the United

1170
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:16,991
Which is why

1171
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,295
Needed to go there

1172
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:25,183
You know what you're probably not far off that I was farther off

1173
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:25,951
Probably

1174
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,487
You are not true

1175
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,279
So

1176
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,375
One of them things that led me down this road

1177
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
Towards

1178
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,215
No I don't know if there's any Redemption

1179
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:37,983
Profound

1180
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,031
I was watching

1181
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,055
Some new

1182
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:44,383
Please put out a couple things I think she was on vacation

1183
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,431
Or something and now she's come back

1184
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,711
Boring shift

1185
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,479
She's posted

1186
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,527
What you posted one video that was just

1187
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,855
Her sitting in a webcam

1188
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,159
Talking about alien intervention

1189
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,463
And how there's aliens

1190
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,231
Real messed up

1191
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
All around

1192
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:04,095
I watched the video and I realized

1193
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,119
Massive

1194
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,191
What we have never done

1195
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
Is really heard

1196
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,263
Explain what

1197
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,127
He thinks is going on

1198
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,175
And then is at most she's like

1199
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:23,295
And I agree with you this is also

1200
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,343
I realize that there might be

1201
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,135
Some stuff babe

1202
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,791
Because she is just

1203
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,815
In front of a camera

1204
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,887
Okay and

1205
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,167
This is Rick

1206
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,447
Her beliefs are really f*****

1207
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:42,751
This works

1208
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,567
Clippers

1209
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,103
Expressing how little

1210
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,151
Evidence she requires to believe

1211
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
Hi everyone

1212
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,599
About my lady

1213
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,623
Article

1214
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,767
He was drinking

1215
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,423
Or

1216
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,079
Real quick I did try to go to website

1217
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,359
I got a warning

1218
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:25,759
Message that it was trying to install

1219
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,647
First of all the

1220
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,695
I got on my website

1221
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,719
The Anunnaki

1222
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,487
Escorting

1223
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,511
Human

1224
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,047
Prisoners along the beach

1225
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,911
Actually that came out a long time ago and

1226
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,447
I just

1227
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:47,519
Brought it to service again I can say that

1228
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,335
Orillia photograph

1229
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,127
The movie

1230
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,663
Or or what

1231
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,687
But it looks

1232
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
Real to me

1233
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:00,063
Anyway I thought it was accurately

1234
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:00,831
Depict

1235
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,599
What is really

1236
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,367
Going on

1237
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,415
I did find this picture

1238
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:10,815
I don't care

1239
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,727
Kind of proof of aliens

1240
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:22,079
Pictures of it looks real

1241
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:25,663
This is how you get tricked by someone like 80-page give you a picture of a f******

1242
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,687
Completed your ship its

1243
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,991
Video game like this is hot like

1244
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,783
Your bar is Sophie

1245
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:31,807
Walking low

1246
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,879
Busy with crazy

1247
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,671
These people who are in these

1248
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,207
He's questioning community

1249
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:42,815
I'm out there I'm asking the hard questions

1250
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,375
About this stuff

1251
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,423
You don't ask any questions of your own shoe

1252
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,727
It's that it shows

1253
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,519
WowWee lawyer

1254
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,287
Walking bar

1255
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,383
I saw this picture

1256
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
That could

1257
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,455
Could be from the movie

1258
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,503
I have no independent verification of it

1259
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,111
I don't know

1260
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,695
Bobby maybe if she was maybe if I heard the whole thing I would

1261
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,231
She would say I think this

1262
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,255
Picture itself is real

1263
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,303
But from what I understood her to be

1264
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,071
Expressing

1265
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:15,839
It was.

1266
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,631
The picture is a good representation

1267
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
Is

1268
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,935
She said that at the end

1269
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:22,751
Right

1270
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,519
She said it looks

1271
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,799
3

1272
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,359
So well I mean

1273
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
That

1274
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,479
The picture doesn't matter

1275
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,759
It doesn't matter if the picture

1276
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:37,855
Real or not because it represents what I think is going

1277
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,671
Terrified

1278
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:45,023
Proof proof

1279
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,047
It's confirmation

1280
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:46,815
Bias

1281
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,839
That flies in the

1282
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,119
Space of

1283
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,423
Where's the need for absolute

1284
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,727
Pretty scary cuz you could talk yourself in

1285
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
Like she has

1286
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
With

1287
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,591
Here's where we get in

1288
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,895
It was a picture of the Anunnaki

1289
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,431
Who are transporting

1290
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,759
To the spaceship

1291
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
2 in her cancer

1292
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,063
Tuner the good guy

1293
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,599
Nice like the Raptors

1294
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,903
The Palladium

1295
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,463
Nordic race

1296
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,487
In Lavale

1297
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,559
The Graze their meddling no good

1298
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,863
Just like little robot workers

1299
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:23,167
And then of the bedside you have the reptilians

1300
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
And the Anunnaki

1301
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
Together

1302
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,495
We're all that s***

1303
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,311
Here's where she talks

1304
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,103
It's about some people who are involved

1305
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:37,503
I don't want a problem with any assessment of the future is

1306
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,599
They do not seem to incorporate an understanding of

1307
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,391
The fact that the dinosaur

1308
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,415
Actually descended

1309
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,207
Call boy

1310
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:48,767
And that they have an agenda which is

1311
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,303
As an alien race

1312
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,911
Call Valerian tablet

1313
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,959
Zachariah stitching information

1314
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,751
Stitches

1315
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,775
That reveals

1316
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,567
Here on Earth

1317
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,871
Zecharia sitchin had no business

1318
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,639
Translating

1319
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,711
Sumerian Tablets

1320
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:11,295
She's been roundly criticized

1321
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,111
Horrible

1322
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,135
Information

1323
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,695
And here we have Carrie saying that

1324
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,719
Because of

1325
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:20,511
He's information that was released

1326
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,559
She has an understanding

1327
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:29,727
Are the ancestors of the Anunnaki who are they

1328
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,055
I don't believe that she's things I missed

1329
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:33,823
Didn't mean any

1330
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,103
Other than Jews

1331
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,407
She was just Hawaii

1332
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,735
Like

1333
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,759
The Jews are

1334
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,551
Descended from the Sumerian

1335
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,671
The Sumerians are descended

1336
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,439
From the Anunnaki

1337
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,463
As well

1338
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:57,887
Are all weapons

1339
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:58,911
Yeah

1340
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:04,799
Whatever wherever the Sumerians come from

1341
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,151
What's important is that Designer

1342
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,943
Which I have to stress

1343
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,503
Of course he doesn't

1344
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,527
Zionist

1345
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:17,599
Political philosophy

1346
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:20,671
Jewish

1347
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,695
Little boy

1348
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,023
If you don't understand the role of the Anunnaki in our

1349
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
Pass

1350
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,839
Then you're never going to understand

1351
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,607
Israel

1352
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:33,471
They are a fierce race their highly intellectual

1353
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,031
Kazari and Jews have the Anunnaki

1354
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:36,799
Bloodline

1355
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,359
They're also involved

1356
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,151
With Antarctica

1357
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,455
I may say that

1358
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,503
Disclosure I have some Jewish

1359
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:49,855
Lucky and me

1360
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,647
And I whisper

1361
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,951
Respect I on Wednesday that

1362
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,303
David ickes work

1363
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,583
Although I

1364
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,887
I don't think his analysis goes to

1365
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
Corporate

1366
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,191
The bigger picture

1367
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,983
Picture of the ET involvement on

1368
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:06,751
On planet Earth

1369
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:07,775
To the degree

1370
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,311
Project Camelot does

1371
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:15,455
So when she's saying that she has some Jewish blood in her which means she has some Anunnaki in her that means

1372
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,735
But she believes that

1373
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,783
Jews are on an

1374
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,879
Fuk up

1375
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:27,999
So f***** up David Icke

1376
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,023
David Icke

1377
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,047
Is very gorgeous

1378
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,095
He tries to fight back

1379
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,631
What you're talkin about what shape

1380
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,655
Shifting lizard

1381
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,959
That's your just you mean Jews

1382
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,751
Right you're using anti-Semitic

1383
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,543
Troop to describe these

1384
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,335
Lizard beings

1385
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,359
Control the world

1386
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:46,431
And he says no I'm not saying that I'm saying

1387
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,711
Lizards

1388
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:55,135
Factory

1389
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,463
Joe Haden

1390
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:03,839
It's crazy to me and I know that we've heard Slickers

1391
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:07,423
Suffer being a kind of anti-Semitic

1392
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,215
When I watch this video is like

1393
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,055
Juicery

1394
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,615
In front of a camera by herself 40 f****** minute

1395
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:18,175
If he starts explaining that the the Jews

1396
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,199
Are the Anunnaki

1397
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,527
It's really really f***** up what you

1398
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,551
It's

1399
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,599
It's an indication to me

1400
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,623
Of

1401
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,391
Very

1402
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:28,927
80 summative

1403
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:32,255
Yeah so what's your first name

1404
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:36,095
Are the descendants of Anunnaki

1405
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,631
Say that

1406
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,215
Laters

1407
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:41,983
She says

1408
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,007
That

1409
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,031
You have to understand

1410
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,823
Anunnaki or behind Israel is

1411
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,871
And then what you said that

1412
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:50,175
She has Jewish blood and that makes her

1413
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
Four-part Anunnaki

1414
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,735
That to me was like

1415
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,759
You have gone

1416
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,063
So far beyond the point where this is

1417
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,087
Defensible

1418
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,111
This is just you

1419
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,647
The Jews are aliens

1420
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,695
Is what you were saying

1421
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:03,999
Look in this

1422
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,559
You'll see

1423
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,119
There are many International

1424
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,655
National instruments that way

1425
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,191
Involves only

1426
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:12,959
Human

1427
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,727
But it was Ashley

1428
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
Standoff

1429
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
One set

1430
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,383
Incident

1431
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
USA

1432
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:23,967
Liberty

1433
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,527
Israel

1434
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:27,807
Is another such

1435
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,599
WWE

1436
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,135
Spiders in

1437
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:31,903
Vietnam

1438
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,183
Spider-Man

1439
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,719
Touch

1440
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,791
Situation

1441
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,559
And

1442
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:43,423
So we got the spider leadership in the mix

1443
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,519
Like that is

1444
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,055
It seems pretty cancer

1445
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,591
She has

1446
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
A

1447
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,895
One last hurrah

1448
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,663
Devices

1449
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,711
Explain what she believes about the world

1450
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,247
Israel and Jews

1451
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,527
Are Anunnaki

1452
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,295
They are alien

1453
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:01,599
Right that is unacceptable

1454
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,135
This is a completely

1455
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,999
She's crazy grandpa at Thanksgiving dinners

1456
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:12,095
Just like and you know what I think

1457
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,887
Oh my God I mean like

1458
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,911
Exist

1459
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,679
Disorder

1460
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,215
Next Level Auto

1461
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,287
Why

1462
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,079
What

1463
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:27,711
You're a hop skip and a jump away from Holocaust denial whatever you're you're into

1464
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,831
You were

1465
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:38,719
You're in that ballpark baby

1466
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,255
SA

1467
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:43,071
So if they are Anunnaki

1468
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,863
Frank

1469
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,423
You're basically saying that they did the Holocaust

1470
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,191
Themselves

1471
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,215
Essentially

1472
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:55,615
If you want to follow that kind of logic of the Anunnaki or always eat

1473
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,199
The Holocaust was a good

1474
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,503
Whoa I mean

1475
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:08,159
Yeah that's why you really have to write

1476
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,743
YouTubers are on and not really have to ask her

1477
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,607
I don't want to speculate what you might believe

1478
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:24,031
The possibilities you're bringing up I would not be surprised anymore to here I come out

1479
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,943
Yeah makes sense for you to say that yes

1480
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,759
She doesn't believe that the Anunnaki are good

1481
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:37,343
There

1482
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,135
This is bad

1483
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:43,231
Various

1484
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:43,999
She's proven

1485
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,023
But you have a bruise

1486
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,583
For a little bit

1487
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
Condescending

1488
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,031
Bulshit

1489
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:56,799
Would you like

1490
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,335
If you don't understand this

1491
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,871
Stuff you sound

1492
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
Dumb

1493
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:07,039
A picture of a Deadpool

1494
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:12,415
I think we mostly hear her when she's in a good mood I just come from talking to me

1495
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,559
Everybody knows things knows that you sound stupid

1496
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,327
If you don't

1497
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,095
Understand

1498
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:26,751
Holy Ship

1499
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,079
Big hat

1500
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,615
Video izle

1501
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:38,783
Nothing else matters

1502
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:45,183
Directions to another episodes Project Camelot

1503
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,487
Listen to layout that you believe

1504
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:51,583
Jewish blood makes you a descendant of the Anunnaki f******

1505
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,375
Hell

1506
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,167
Beautiful pictures

1507
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:02,847
More life

1508
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,687
Jesus so whenever she says that you sound stupid if you don't know the

1509
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,503
To me I take a little bit person

1510
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,855
To be called stupid

1511
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:16,927
And

1512
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,255
Then there could be some other races I I do things

1513
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,303
The name Antarctica

1514
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,607
Actually sounds to me like

1515
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,655
Dominated by ants

1516
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,959
Our inspector

1517
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,751
Okay alright

1518
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:33,055
That's what it called

1519
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:48,415
I love that I love just that idea of Illinois

1520
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:54,815
That is I know everyone's

1521
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,423
Yeah

1522
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,447
This is

1523
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:03,263
Bizarre kind of carryout like

1524
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:07,103
I want to listen

1525
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,407
That's fine

1526
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
Fight

1527
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,199
Can't accept

1528
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,223
Also

1529
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
Cutest

1530
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:20,159

60s James Fetzer on the show

The guy who wrote that no one died

1552
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751

Being racist

1576
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,135
It is incredibly

1577
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:55,903
Stupid

1578
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,439
It is so dumb

1579
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,999
Because it doesn't make any sense based on

1580
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,607

But explain races

1585
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,152
It's a business strategy

1586
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,176
It's easy to do but

1587
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:22,784
Just amazed

1588
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,880

01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,744
Ugly bigotry

1600
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,840
