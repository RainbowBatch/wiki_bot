27
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,928

00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,399
Indeed we are

97
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191

98
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
11th Hour

99
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495

Oh my God have you been dead this whole time

102
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,199
I saw a ghost home in Hawaii

103
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,623
I knew it was too good to be true Dan Friesen is been dead for 17 years with this is

104
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439

105
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,023

106
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815

Happy birthday

120
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
Although you could go with a Gingrich on this one but you should

121
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
No actually

122
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
That's my grandfather's

123
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
Is that right it is his name to me

124
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,791
Is it his birth name I believe it is not I believe his name is Noble

125
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,119
Oh okay somehow they just started calling him I guess

126
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
At a certain point in time newt

127
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
Was short for Noble

128
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
I'm so that's how he goes

129
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,079
Wow how about that I don't dislike it

130
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,383
And also while we're in Hawaii

131
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Come down

132
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
Ton of lizards and newts

133
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
Chose

134
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:26,879
So iguana I might come back with a bunch of iguanas

135
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:31,231
Them holes in it and you're just gonna have a bag of lizards that you're wandering around with

136
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,071
Think that that was one of the most important parts of my childhood

137
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,983
Hawaii was a little lizard was reclaim a little bit

138
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,567
The Plains of central Midwest

139
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,943
The Jordan I hear I hear that we have a conversation about Nazis and Haley

140
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,343
Indeed we do today we will be talking about an interview that Joseph Ferrell gave with

141
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
Richard Serra

142
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:05,279
Who does the conspiracy show with Richard syrett he's also a regular guest host on

143
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
Coast to Coast

144
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:13,983
Kind of the junior varsity guys are just keep track of those guys unfortunately

145
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,311
He's pretty

146
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,639
I don't know we'll see how how much you liked him but

147
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Pharrell

148
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Is

149
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
Call

150
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,319
Has from what his

151
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
Bio says

152
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
A doctorate of

153
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Patristics

154
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
From Oxford University

155
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
Which is basically a theology

156
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
That kind of thing

157
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,839
If you go by what

158
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,655
Many people who have interviewing have given him credit

159
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
It's for he has a doctorate of physics

160
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,775
If you go by Ryan

161
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,847
He has a doctorate of

162
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
What was it not patristic see that philosophy

163
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
Sticky hats

164
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,319
I kind of don't think that he went to Oxford

165
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,111
Mainly because

166
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,671
He has one story about his time at Oxford

167
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,487
And I can find no evidence that

168
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Vista

169
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
Saforelle went to Oxford

170
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,375
Harbor there's another Joseph Burrell with a doctorate of Economics remote

171
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Okay

172
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,751
That's possible in his story from Oxford his years there is he was at 8

173
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
Debate

174
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,615
At the Oxford Union society that lasted for 8 days

175
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:29,247
Oh my God for the Ethiopia

176
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,831
Food relief right around Live Aid all of that stuff

177
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,927
And endurance debase

178
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Here's the thing

179
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
If this is true

180
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Then Boris

181
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
F****** Johnson was there

182
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:49,471
Was running the union debate society and so we should know

183
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:54,335
About where they on opposite sides of the issue or they don't know

184
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,407
But what I'm saying is he doesn't mention Boris Johnson

185
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
At all

186
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:03,039
It seems like it would be a headline seems like you would know if 8-day debate with the

187
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
The future f****** prime minister of the United

188
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,951
The debate went so long that I had to

189
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:15,839
Brake pencils and make a little fire in order to keep food warm yeah like Wade Boggs

190
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
Absolutely

191
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,471
He also according to himself

192
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,031
Grew up in South Dakota

193
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,663
And what fun story he tells is that when he was growing up he was around six or seven years old

194
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
And his best friends

195
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
There were more than one of them

196
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Who had

197
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Fathers

198
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Who fought

199
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,391
For the Germans in WWII

200
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,535
He grew up around

201
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,911
Here is the really want to keep

202
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,495
Closer that I don't want to tell people

203
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
Tosses it up like

204
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
Yeah it's weird enough of that like

205
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
Yeah we we do shower Alex

206
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,479
Talks about like being Confederate Royals

207
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
I would I would think that like

208
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
I know people and I hung out

209
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,647
So we're not doing nothing

210
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Still no big deal

211
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:19,071
But he is however a scholar I think the fact that he grew up around Nazis

212
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,167
Will explain a lot of his later on his later life

213
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,775
However he is definitely a scholar he's got at least a master's degree that I can

214
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,847
Confirm and he has written a total of maybe

215
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
4045 book

216
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
Too many books way too many

217
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
Here's the strangest part

218
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,295
Okay his first books

219
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
Are all about

220
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,951
He translated the mystagogy of the Holy Spirit by patriarch photios

221
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,351
From the Greek and apparently it's a really good translation and he's excited

222
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
Writing the forward in in Chris

223
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
Holy cow

224
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
They also

225
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
This is foreign to our show

226
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,127
He wrote Free Will in St Maximus the Confessor which is

227
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
Him trying to deal with Calvinism

228
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
He does not do well

229
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
Bye-bye and then the disc

230
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
Mutation of parrots

231
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
As well as

232
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,647
What was the other one

233
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
God history and dialectic

234
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
Which is his final religious

235
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Now

236
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
That was published

237
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,119
In 1997

238
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,935
In 2002 he published

239
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
His neck

240
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
Book which would begin the

241
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
The future of his career

242
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Would you like to guess what

243
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
The title of that book might be

244
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,455
Well I mean you've already sort of tilted some of these cars

245
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,295
I think there's aliens involved from play

246
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,391
So I would have I would say

247
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
That

248
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
Likely

249
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,487
It had something to do with space Raptors

250
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Being

251
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,863
Involved with the Holocaust

252
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
If you thought that the pyramids were just

253
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Tombs Yuri

254
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,543
Idiot turtles that pyramid is a Death Star

255
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Exact

256
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,895
Really like the one from Star Wars I would like to bring up the

257
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
They were

258
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:16,063
Storing grain guy told me that

259
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,927
He went on an absolute tear that continues to this day

260
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
He keeps crying

261
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Checking out books

262
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Some of which

263
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
The titles can be

264
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
Like that

265
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,447
Grid of the Gods the aftermath of the cosmic war in the physics of the pyramid

266
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Peoples

267
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Not a bad title

268
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,895
Right the black Sun Nazi secret weapons in the Cold War Allied Legend

269
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
Hellboy

270
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,271
What's a financial vipers in Venice

271
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,623
Alchemical money magical physics and banking in the Middle Ages and Renaissance

272
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
Of all of his titles

273
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
There is

274
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
Four of them in his early life that are like

275
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,887
I am a good Christian I read the ology I'm focused on this and he's a good historian

276
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
And then something happens and he's just

277
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Off the map

278
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
Yeah like completely off the

279
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
The map

280
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,383
Wind up on the splc's hate watch

281
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
List

282
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Because

283
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,503
He is a y

284
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
You know that's something that I have been struggling

285
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,647
Because I think if you'll listen to him

286
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
As we go along

287
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
He's not enough

288
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
What I think he is

289
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
Is a Nazi femboy

290
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
That's

291
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,423
Can be as bad

292
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
It is

293
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:41,567
Weird really weird strange

294
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:46,687
Big distinction it no one in that I don't think he wants the Nazis to win

295
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
But I do think

296
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:53,343
He's amazed at how good the Nazis were at finding alien technology

297
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,207
Which is a very strong

298
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,303
A subset of anti-Semitism sure but it's there

299
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,119
It's definitely

300
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
Well I mean it's so

301
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,239
So he's he's another of the he talks about globalists

302
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,383
Makes the makes a bunch of puns about them he's he fancies himself a bit of a Dennis Miller type

303
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
Sure

304
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,247
But yeah I don't know we'll see we'll see how that go

305
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
Then

306
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,367
There are another thing there another few things that are

307
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Incredibly annoying about

308
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
For instance

309
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
He always wears a hat

310
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,791
And it is always

311
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,607
It is either a Indiana Jones hat

312
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
Classic English bowler

313
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
A little bit well

314
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,711
War I wore a bowler for a little while in high school

315
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,575
People you went to Oxford know it was a

316
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,159
Desperate affectation

317
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
Here's one that's even worse

318
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
He chain-smoked

319
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
Chain smokes

320
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,119
With a Cruella Deville cigarette holder on my God I love this

321
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
And he does not inhale

322
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Chainsmokers

323
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
And you just pups

324
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
The Smoke Out

325
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
The whole time

326
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,359
So it's so infuriating to watch this bad

327
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
I'm just screaming at him like

328
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
I quit

329
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:30,879
Stop doing that cuz it's so intentional it's not in the picture

330
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
No it couldn't be more pathetic

331
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
Or or

332
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
Use life is art

333
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,863
And this is a piece of the

334
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
What will all of

335
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Wolfie

336
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,215
But he if he was Perry dating

337
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
The type of

338
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
If

339
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
He got Kaufman

340
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,663
So say that what happened

341
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
After his religion

342
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Just Books and did

343
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:00,319
Is he was like oh s*** actually religion might be stupid

344
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,879
Create this carrot

345
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
Pull-off

346
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,719
A decades-long scam

347
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,303
To show people just how easy and how similar religion

348
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,191
And gizadeathstar really are Andy Kaufman

349
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
Do his wrestling toys

350
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Serta stretch

351
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
And he's like

352
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:24,383
I could do this but with religion

353
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
Aldi's translating game

354
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,967
Yeah he came across attack

355
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:33,599
Didn't tell anybody about it translated it upright Ono

356
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,903
Oh no

357
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:43,583
Satirized nobody else is stepping up to the plate

358
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,167
He's he's a he's a real life

359
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Professor type

360
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
But the kind who kind of creepily

361
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Talks to

362
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,895
Antique box with acrylic nail thing but doesn't inhale

363
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
So on and so forth

364
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
Almost at the end of

365
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
Everything he says

366
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
It is the most

367
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
He's just an annoying

368
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
He's just such an annoying

369
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,927
You know what the I mean I say be that as it may

370
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Totally

371
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:14,047
Interesting like you can't fault somebody necessarily for their

372
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Ticks

373
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:19,423
Those that you know cliches and no no no problem but after every sentence

374
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,239
But people just have ways of speaking

375
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
And so on and so forth

376
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
That's fair

377
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
That's fair and so forth

378
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
So on

379
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
Wego

380
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,967
What is going to happen I've listen to probably like

381
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
15 hours

382
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
This guy talk

383
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
And none of it was it all remotely usable little behind the scenes

384
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
George Steele you were telling me how interesting this person isn't how much you wanted to talk about him

385
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Dude watch

386
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
Hours and hours and stuff

387
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Nothing here

388
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
And then

389
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
And then last night

390
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,799
Hugo's on rich

391
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
Surat show

392
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,431
Surprisingly enough and there is a lot of interesting stuff up there

393
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Also

394
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
In this particular interview

395
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Joseph morel

396
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Is

397
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,879
Looking into the webcam on his computer

398
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:17,023
And he is holding an old-time phone up to his ear like a big old timey phone like

399
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Peach

400
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,959
Which ones that you could really slam with a wire cord the ones that had like that yet to put your finger in and

401
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,287
Then go around the Rotary

402
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
It is

403
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,639
It is so ridiculous to watch a man in a webcam holding a

404
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,967
Phone up to his ear I like that

405
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,063
Open house phone that's tacky you should have just done audio

406
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,903
Intel on this

407
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,951
He has a hamburger phone

408
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,607
What is the hamburger yes

409
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
And upgrade

410
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
Oh yeah

411
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:01,311
We are going to begin this interview and you are going to hear Richard surrett

412
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
Give you some whiplash

413
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,967
If we get there doing the Canada open up they say in face

414
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,015
So the first phase if

415
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,575
60% of the population is vaccinated

416
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,623
Will give you a little bit of your normal

417
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,416
If then in face

418
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
Is too if 70%

419
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,072
You'll get a little sliver of your normal life back and then finally face three we need 80

420
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
Percent

421
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Evax

422
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,496
I don't want to argue the efficacy or the safety of vaccines

423
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,312
People want to have the vaccine that certainly their business and those

424
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,104
The don't that's their business but

425
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
This disk

426
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
Level of course

427
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
Are we forgotten about

428
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
The Nuremberg code and

429
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
How can people

430
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
Have such short memories

431
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
That's a mean that's that's

432
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,464
Very in line with Infowars

433
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,792
What's fun about the I find it so interesting that he is

434
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,352
Reasonable all the way like

435
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:01,472
You know what if you want to get the vaccine I'm not going to be huge and it's killing you

436
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:07,872
And if you don't want to get the vaccine I'm not to be like I'll kill you if you don't

437
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,200
You know like that

438
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,600
I don't want to argue the knot

439
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,928
I'm on board I don't want it

440
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
I don't want to deal

441
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
But like the Nuremberg

442
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Code

443
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
Kind of argument is is very

444
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
Present

445
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,192
Infowars World by Francis Boyle

446
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,984
Brings that up a lot

447
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
It's annoying

448
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,824
It's just them saying hey

449
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
This is how

450
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Science and math works

451
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:47,040
If we have this level of protection then you can do this number of thing the argument that I would

452
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
Make back to this I think

453
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:53,440
Would be like all right let's imagine a scenario where this isn't all fake

454
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
For whatever

455
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
Season actual

456
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Panda

457
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:03,168
How does what's going on now look different than what would be the best thing to do

458
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,728
What is

459
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,288
Do you do you do you accepted this

460
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,128
Vaccination quota quota quota or quotient

461
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
Is

462
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,480
Appropriate in the case of a real outbreak

463
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
Yeah so

464
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,392
That's that's what I would I would like to see a

465
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,672
Can you plan a better

466
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:32,608
We open the interview and of course we're going to talk about

467
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
Covet denialism in the light

468
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,704
We brought up Nuremberg and I have to do is not

469
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,728
So I assume

470
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,312
You got it Joseph Ferrell has some things he would like

471
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,848
Like to say is he happy

472
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
Sorry

473
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
Pharrell joke

474
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
If these

475
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
Vaccine

476
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
We're so safe

477
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Why

478
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
Why are they resorting

479
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,672
Such Draconian measures

480
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
2

481
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Push people

482
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
Into receiving

483
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
They're not

484
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Exactly

485
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,912
And the answer to that even if they were is

486
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,496
Because of assholes like you were telling everybody not to get them

487
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,800
I feel like they're being like people are being

488
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Pretty

489
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
Aware that like

490
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,616
It's important

491
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
But like

492
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,968
I don't know I don't think I've ever

493
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,552
Seen anything that would indicate to me like coercion

494
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
Jackson

495
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,136
I think that most of the people who I am

496
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,672
In Social Circles with

497
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
Have been

498
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
Chomping at the bit

499
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:38,656
Mnf hunted down Vexy we almost drove 5 hours to get you a vaccine

500
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
In-N-Out

501
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:44,544
Vino the CDC had that that recommendation that people can stop wearing masks

502
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
In public that

503
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
If they've been vaccinated

504
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,920
And that is just a

505
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
Measure of

506
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,248
Trust

507
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,088
That's not like everyone must wear a special shirt

508
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
Did they only

509
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,952
Only get from vaccination centers and they cannot wear mask right

510
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
Or whatever like

511
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,280
There's no course and no

512
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,608
What Draconian policies are you talkin about

513
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,704
Recommendation

514
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,360
Go to sleep

515
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,640
You're totally right

516
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
It's always

517
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,016
It doesn't matter it doesn't matter

518
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
Especially with this guy

519
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
Anyting

520
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
That you say

521
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
Confidently

522
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,720
You are either right about but

523
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
Here's what you're missing

524
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:40,096
You are completely wrong about and I have a completely different idea

525
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
So

526
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
Here is

527
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Let's

528
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:48,544
Going play this is a long clip because I want everybody to get an idea of what this dude talks like

529
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
And how

530
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
So just see if he answers this question

531
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
Richard is going to ask him

532
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
How much of this

533
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,552
Is preparing us for a world without

534
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
Here is Havana

535
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,904
Well I think a lot of

536
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
It is at least in there

537
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,048
But I'll tell you something Richard there's something very peculiar going on

538
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584
In in Railroad

539
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,400
People that know me know where I'm

540
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,424
Going to go with us

541
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
Because my dad

542
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Does a railroad

543
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
Engineering

544
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Voloco

545
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
Engineer

546
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Text attraction

547
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,408
When I was very very young

548
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
And

549
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
He got me fasting

550
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
T-Mobile

551
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
And

552
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Effusive

553
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
I've been following

554
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Been happening

555
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
With Railroad

556
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
This country

557
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
Union Pacific

558
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,024
Railroad has been restoring

559
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
Steam locomotives

560
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
A breathtaking rate

561
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Master restoration

562
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Articulate

563
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
Big boys.

564
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,472
Steam locomotive

565
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
4884

566
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
2

567
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
You know Hall Freight

568
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
And so on and so forth

569
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Now

570
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,664
The interesting thing is Union Pacific isn't

571
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
Investing all this money to basically

572
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Who created local

573
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Imodium works

574
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
Cheyenne Wyoming

575
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
Enhance railroad heritage

576
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
There's something else going on

577
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
And my sis

578
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
Station is

579
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
That would be

580
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
Increasing reliance

581
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Samsung

582
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
Will technology

583
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
Digital system

584
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
Suddenly realized

585
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
The favorite

586
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Bozeman

587
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
Call Xander

588
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
They're precious

589
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
Systems

590
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,728
A little thing called electromagnet

591
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
Call Thor

592
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
For that matter

593
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Kayaking

594
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,384
Colonial pipeline

595
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
So I think

596
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,760
Afterglow bologna is also kind of

597
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Hoist by his

598
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
Picard

599
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
They're trying to put in digital

600
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Systems

601
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
Particular

602
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
Current is

603
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
So what you're seeing

604
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,232
Has pushed back at least here in the states

605
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Be prepared

606
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,048
Canadian province

607
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
But in

608
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
In several States in this

609
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
Country we've seen some pushback

610
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
Very unusual nature against

611
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
This idea

612
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Digital currency

613
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
South Carolina pass

614
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
Measure recently

615
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,104
To acknowledge

616
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,456
As legal tender for all transactions

617
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
And interest

618
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
That legislation

619
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
Did not stay

620
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,368
Point had to be to nominate

621
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
It in dollars

622
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
Texas open

623
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Downstate bully

624
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Depository

625
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
And so on and so forth

626
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
So you're seeing

627
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
I'm very honey

628
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
Unusual push

629
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
That towels

630
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
Made at somebody

631
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
At least in

632
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
Some of these days

633
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
Knows what

634
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
Is an

635
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Their act

636
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
Accordingly

637
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
226

638
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
Secure some sort

639
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,408
Basis for currency should they try to roll out at

640
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
System

641
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
With her helicopter money

642
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,760
Nothing jobs

643
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,040
Universal basic

644
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
Look

645
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
Did he answer the question

646
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
The yeah

647
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,560
No I forgot what the question

648
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,632
I was going along with what he was saying

649
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
About Railroad

650
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,448
Railroads

651
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
I think he was

652
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
Speculating that

653
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,384
Steven Jen locomotives could get hacked

654
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,712
And I don't know what was going on with that and that wasn't

655
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,040
First and I was I was thrilled to find out about

656
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,320
Stephen Hawking

657
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,392
Converted to digital currency

658
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,696
I don't know what's going on anymore

659
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
So the quest

660
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,792
How much of this whole lockdown

661
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
It's preparing us

662
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
For a world without job

663
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,008
His answer was the railroads a lot of it is at least the way that they say it

664
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,872
And then he goes on for two full minutes about something

665
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,408
Completely unrelated

666
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:43,808
Completely unrelated I resent this because I'm not a

667
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,880
Cryptocurrency nonsense but I am

668
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:51,488
Justin the locomotive would you like to know about the local markets like

669
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,840
I definitely would like to hear him talk about about hacking training

670
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:02,496
Hear it well his his thought and Auntie said that anybody who knows me knows this oh yeah

671
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,056
Maybe it's a big thing of it's a big thing

672
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
Hat is a huge thing of his

673
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,408
You know what you know it's very hackable

674
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,224
Cole

675
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,528
He's saying that Union Pacific

676
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
Is restoring old

677
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
Steam engine trains

678
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,440
Because they know that eventually all the electromagnetic

679
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Trains

680
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,512
Are going to be disabled by an EMP

681
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,584
Oh yeah that actually makes more sense

682
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Slick as a

683
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:33,984
Coherent thought that I thought it was cuz I thought you was speculating

684
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
Lake Steam would be happy

685
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,592
It makes sense that it's like all these trains are digital

686
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,408
Then we have to have these of the backup

687
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
These theme

688
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,224
Etsy steampunk

689
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,880
Yeah and then of course futuristic giant mechanical robot spider

690
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,464
Steam engines Olive Back to the Future 3

691
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,864
So would you like to know what's going on with Union Pacific rebuilders

692
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
This is from Justin Franz of Atlas

693
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,752
What's Gareth I'll just go ahead and read you the headline real quick

694
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:11,360
One of the world's largest steam locomotives is about to make a triumphant return

695
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,152
Hold onto your engineer caps

696
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,688
Railroad history lovers

697
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,992
Choo choos that sounds like

698
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
This very very simple

699
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
6 days

700
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,672
After six decades after the last big boy was taken off the rails

701
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,024
The Union Pacific is rebuilding one of the famous locomotives in honor of the up

702
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,352
Coming sesquicentennial celebration

703
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,632
Transcontinental

704
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,168
That's kind of like a

705
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,216
Tourist

706
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
Celebrate

707
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,104
As far as the digital currencies go

708
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,176
What he's talking about is

709
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,504
States having repositories for gold bullion and

710
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
You know like certain

711
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
State saying

712
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
You have to

713
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,856
To take gold if somebody gives it

714
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Sitting right right

715
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,672
And I don't know why

716
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,256
He's bothering about that because you'll notice what states

717
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,048
Specifically he's referencing

718
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
They are states that

719
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,680
1 are filled with people who say

720
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:14,336
Would rather have the state have a gold bullion depository then sending a large amount of money

721
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,664
Do Ted Anderson that would be that would be smart

722
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,992
Sure and then of course with South Carolina and the like

723
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
There

724
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
Filled with people who are like the

725
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,136
Money is the dollar is going to explode so they

726
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,184
All these laws all the

727
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
It's just random ask

728
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,280
I would really love for you to

729
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
Sit me down

730
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,168
Weather map of the United States and tell me state-by-state

731
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,496
It's full of

732
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
But I know it's

733
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:56,832
Potato my version of the Animaniacs song

734
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,904
Africa Panama

735
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,464
That is

736
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,256
That is kind of the way that he talks

737
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Oxxo

738
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,096
Pass that I've tried to kind of edit it down for clarity

739
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,656
Yeah as you will

740
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,240
I'm like a guy who is boring as hell

741
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
But also

742
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
Teasingly

743
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,080
Slightly interesting thoughts

744
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
Anyway that's

745
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:25,248
It's frustrating realize why I was like I got to talk about this guy but he

746
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
Yeah

747
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:33,184
This is this next clip is basically another in very similar stray

748
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,232
So

749
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,512
You mentioned

750
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
The colonial pipeline

751
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
And the other

752
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,120
The yes cybercriminals

753
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,912
Effectively shut that down

754
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
And it caused

755
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:50,336
Long line up Cynthia the gas stations and so forth in end up really

756
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,408
And about I think a warning shot of things to come

757
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,528
And then Colonial admits that they ended up paying $5000000 in Ransom in crypto

758
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Do currency

759
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
I think

760
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,672
We're probably not getting the full story

761
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
Hear what what are you hearing

762
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
What really happened

763
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,024
What's this really just an isolated

764
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
You know what incident

765
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Some

766
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,376
Gang of cybercriminals

767
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,448
Decided you know to roll the dice and see what would happen

768
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,496
Long behold yeah they paid up I mean

769
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
What are you hearing a

770
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Okay so

771
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
That is the question

772
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:29,248
Very simple also

773
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:34,624
Every show that I think I've seen him doing interview on is at least 3 hours long

774
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,024
Thankfully only an hour and 51 minutes I'll save it like a lot of the stuff that I listen

775
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
In conspiracy

776
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
That that that sort of

777
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Sweeter

778
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,680
I will at least these guys be

779
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,472
Precise

780
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
It's

781
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,568
It's not good or all that like

782
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,872
I don't know if we're going to get any truth

783
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,432
Asking a specific question

784
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:04,832
For that kind of I I like that Richard Surratt is doing a

785
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
Casey Kasem impression

786
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:12,768
We're going to talk about the

787
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,096
You were down south going to the left

788
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:22,752
Billion dollars and ramp silhouette about you and also

789
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,288
Here

790
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,104
303

791
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,992
303 really don't know where did that one come from

792
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,296
I don't know man

793
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,368
Trying to think of bad music enter the first thing with you

794
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
You could have done worse man

795
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,048
Simple question what do you think is what are you hearing what's going on

796
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,608
Do you have the deer feelers out

797
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
Well I've heard they see

798
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
The same thing but

799
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
I'm like you I don't think

800
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
We've heard all of this

801
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Story

802
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,032
And one of the interesting things

803
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,568
What about the colonial thing that

804
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
I don't know what house

805
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Was recorded up

806
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
Bear butt

807
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
The media down here

808
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
Fighting

809
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
Government official

810
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
I'm saying

811
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
Affected

812
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,600
This is are there will be more of though

813
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
So you

814
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:20,096
He's citing government officials saying that there will be more of this and all he's really responding to him with his

815
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,888
I think you're about right there

816
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
And then he goes off

817
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
On a different

818
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
You didn't know about

819
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,824
Like that kind of every time you

820
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,128
Introduce something or ask a direct question

821
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
It is

822
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,688
Immediate like

823
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
Spell maybe

824
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,784
And then going off into whatever it is he really wants to talk

825
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,856
Everybody just listens to him like that's fine

826
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,416
I've watched him talk for almost

827
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,464
10 minutes uninterrupted

828
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,000
And people are rats

829
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,536
By this and it's

830
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:54,656
Blowing Me Away by people you mean to you the interview

831
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:01,056
This is not a small thing neither

832
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:06,432
People like constantly doing all those things that people aren't riding him off

833
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:10,528
Like 3 minutes in your answer you should absolutely be doing that

834
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,600
So the answer is yes

835
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,648
It'll probably happen again

836
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
Obviously

837
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,488
That mean like what he's doing is playing that game of like

838
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,048
The the government is is

839
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
Beers like

840
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Hey

841
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
This is a new threat

842
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,704
This is something that we can expect might happen again

843
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,496
No need to prepare strategies

844
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
To deal with this

845
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,312
Iqra

846
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
Business

847
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,640
Like the colonial pipeline

848
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,456
That has like maybe infrastructure-related

849
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,272
Necessity in your operation

850
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
Be aware

851
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,672
Presenting that is like the government being like

852
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,000
I do this about happening all the time

853
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,792
Again I would I would ask

854
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
If like

855
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
This is real

856
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,424
There are these hackers doing this

857
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
How is that

858
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,264
Statement from a government any different than

859
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,848
The best-case scenario harvesting potatoes

860
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
As a war

861
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,432
What is the differentiation between

862
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
Well they never do that

863
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:18,624
I assumed you would think a that answer is over you've answered the question

864
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,416
Yes probably in a probably false

865
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,696
He is not done

866
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
He's not help he keeps going

867
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
About a week after that

868
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
Story broke there was a

869
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
The story about the

870
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
The interstate Bridge

871
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,168
Interstate 40

872
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,472
From

873
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
See

874
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
The bridge was shut

875
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
Because they had

876
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
Discovered a crime

877
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
In one of the tile

878
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:41,920
I'm at Bridge

879
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Crack

880
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
The crack is

881
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,576
Is a perfect straight line now the effect

882
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
Bridge shut down

883
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
Was that

884
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,928
Barge traffic

885
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Mississippi River

886
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
South

887
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,256
Ignored

888
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,024
Of Memphis

889
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,816
Came to an abscess

890
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
Standstill

891
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
Somebody

892
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
He appears to me to be

893
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
Working off

894
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
Hard

895
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,008
To take down

896
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
Infrastructure of

897
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,080
The United States

898
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
These kinds

899
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,152
Creative ways

900
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,200
So I think Colonial pipeline

901
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
Is kind of a tip

902
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,272
That they're getting

903
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,040
Ready to

904
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Nothing major

905
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
Alright

906
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Get it

907
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Yeah

908
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,256
See what happened was

909
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,048
Has the colonial pipeline was hacked

910
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
Now what all so happy

911
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,912
And was surprisingly enough very near to where he lives

912
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,448
There is a crack in the bridge

913
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Right

914
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,800
But I mean that the government gave for repairing it was

915
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,384
Pesky barges need to get in and out because it's a massive

916
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,688
Actually

917
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,528
Do you realize

918
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,808
For the last like

919
00:39:54,112 --> 00:40:00,256
The globalist have been planting stories in the media about how bad our bridges are

920
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:06,656
Subtly warning right

921
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:11,776
You have to you have to tell everyone you have to give them

922
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,312
How's make a choice

923
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:19,712
There have been these op-eds about have more resources should be funneled toward

924
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,528
A sneaky

925
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,392
The real story behind the heck is actually really really fast

926
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,952
And if they had bothered to look

927
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,024
Intuit

928
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,096
Now the bridge is not in traffic

929
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:40,448
Text maintenance just maintaining the bridge I had a hunch

930
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,288
You can turn anything you want into a conspiracy

931
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,568
Theory if you just go

932
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,640
Well they hacked the pipeline and there's a crack in my bridge

933
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:53,248
The government's working against if you just if you if you play the insinuation game

934
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
You can

935
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,064
You can make a lot of mileage

936
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,368
But the real story

937
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,720
It's not obviously they didn't mention any names of the p

938
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:07,840
People were hacking they were like is it a one-off event or anything like that

939
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,656
This is a hacking group called Darkside

940
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,960
You've done this

941
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,800
They are ransomware master

942
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:22,944
They have been taken s*** ton of money and then they disbanded immediately following the colonial pipeline

943
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,552
Smart from what people are saying is after they got paid 6 million

944
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,088
The small Collective

945
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
The hackers

946
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,904
Disbanded and then just took all the money

947
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,536
The way that they normally work is almost 70% of the money goes to all of these like

948
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,864
Subsidiary hackers who do all of the the grunt work

949
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,936
And and then they take their cut at the end

950
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
Not so this time

951
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,312
So what happened

952
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
Lights out 2

953
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,175
Yeah brutal right

954
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Nobody

955
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
Not too surprising

956
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:02,879
So this story actually begins before the Colonial pipeline hack

957
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:07,231
Whatsoever so from technology review by Renee Dudley and Daniel golden

958
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:11,583
On January 11th antivirus company bitdefender said it was happy

959
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Happy to announce

960
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
A startling breakthrough

961
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:17,983
It had found a flaw in the ransomware that a gang known as Darkseid was using

962
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,543
Antifreeze computer networks of dozens of businesses

963
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,591
In the US and Europe

964
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,687
Companies facing demands from Darkseid could download a free tool from bitdefender and

965
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,735
Boy paying millions of dollars in Ransom

966
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,087
That's a great thing right it's a good idea now damn

967
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,671
What should you do when you find a

968
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,463
Flaw in a hackers

969
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
Kroger

970
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:46,143
Wait who am I am I a hacker your job is to protect people from

971
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,447
So you find a flaw use your brother trying to patch

972
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
They did that

973
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,775
They fix it up

974
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
Okay

975
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
Here's the problem

976
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,615
They released it

977
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
As a

978
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,919
Public relations

979
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,735
And within

980
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
12 hours

981
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
Darkseid

982
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:09,439
Was like oh they found a hole in our software another hole it was over with

983
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,231
Bitdefender has

984
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,815
Basically and this is happening over and over and over

985
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,607
Constant back-and-forth

986
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,143
Well and here's the thing though

987
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,423
People who are good at

988
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,727
Don't tell any

989
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,055
And all of these antivirus scammers

990
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,639
I basically announced the moment publicly like hey

991
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,967
We fix this that hackers can no longer get to us

992
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,503
And then 5 hours later

993
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
It's all

994
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,343
Write all of these antivirus

995
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,623
Company

996
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
Are trying to get

997
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,183
The positive

998
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:47,839
You know like look at how great we are aggressive we fix this to their goals

999
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
You got it

1000
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,679
Continue to go on

1001
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,751
There's a bunch of really kind of

1002
00:43:55,263 --> 00:44:00,383
Interesting little details here are intent left a Chicago cybersecurity attorney

1003
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,711
He is he consulted with

1004
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
10 companies

1005
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,503
Attacked by sharks

1006
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,039
He said that

1007
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,343
Darkseid's representatives were shrewd bargainer

1008
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,183
If a victim said it couldn't afford the ransom because of the pandemic

1009
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,023
Darkseid was ready with data showing that the company's Revenue was up

1010
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,631
Like they had all of this already

1011
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,935
Hackers

1012
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:29,055
I'd like to refer you to the accounting wing of our hacker Collective

1013
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,895
And not only that but they have this like

1014
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,967
A half way we're only

1015
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:40,319
Attacking corporations that we know can Robinhood contact

1016
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:44,159
And yeah they even came up with like

1017
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:50,559
Actually we do know how much covered it has impacted your bottom line and we have adjusted our Ransom

1018
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
Accordingly

1019
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:59,519
Even if you don't want to pay the rent if it's like God damn it they make a lot of sense listen we're not heartless

1020
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,287
Cracker

1021
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,103
So what wound up happening

1022
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
It is

1023
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,431
Darkside just

1024
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,479
Blue ever blue them

1025
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,783
Away because bitdefender is

1026
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,063
Very very stupid

1027
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
And they're going to continue doing

1028
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:14,879
It's just

1029
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,647
How it goes

1030
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,951
And all this bear talkin about

1031
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,719
Like always

1032
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,047
Conspiracy are these Rogue actors or anyting

1033
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,607
If you look into it you'll see that this is a

1034
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:31,007
Hugely sophisticated operation with people who are incredibly successful at all of this and it's kind of

1035
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
An inevitability of

1036
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,847
Like digital progression

1037
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,871
A girl like

1038
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,919
As there is more stuff that is

1039
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:43,039
Is is online and digital there will be the The Highwayman

1040
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,879
The online space

1041
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,159
It's just

1042
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,999
It's exactly what you would

1043
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:56,607
Expect to grow more sophisticated as

1044
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,887
People who would Rob

1045
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,167
Stagecoaches

1046
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:05,567
Turned into a mafia

1047
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
Get more

1048
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:10,431
Skated more organized it makes sense that the inevitability would be something

1049
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,455
Been like that

1050
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,503
And instead they just

1051
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,783
Say they're so boring

1052
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,087
It's so much more boring there bad can

1053
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,367
Conspiracy theories then

1054
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,671
What is a real conspiracy

1055
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:26,559
Yeah I feel like this is the exact same thing that we talked about with like that guy in the ira

1056
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
You know like it's

1057
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,655
Did the reality of it is fascinating and it is a really

1058
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,935
Interesting piece of how

1059
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,495
Like history and

1060
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,567
Like human interaction works

1061
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:40,127
You're turning this into

1062
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,175
A conspiracy there's actually more boring

1063
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,711
Then the actual

1064
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
Otherworld

1065
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,551
You're trying to fit into your large conspiracy theory

1066
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,087
Where it doesn't belong

1067
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,391
No just be interested just be curious

1068
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,487
It's just not hard you don't have to distrust everything

1069
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
Exactly

1070
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,839
So real soon we're going to get into space

1071
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,911
Despite this one I just have to

1072
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
Saint Michael

1073
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,543
Joseph what about the

1074
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
Halo

1075
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:14,687
Bobby wants to add to go a secret space program I guess here or something related to

1076
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,967
Eleanor Landing hoax

1077
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
Joseph

1078
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
What about the

1079
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,063
The Apollo 12 Ascent stage

1080
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
Experiment

1081
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
Crashing into the lunar surface

1082
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,647
And it rang

1083
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,743
Like a bell for a long. Of time while I don't know that it raining

1084
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,791
See

1085
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:33,119
I accidentally cut it off just a little bit early but he is saying

1086
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,959
He's got a question from the audience Michael

1087
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
Saint Michael

1088
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,263
He's asking Joseph

1089
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,055
Hey how is this pause

1090
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:46,943
And as Richard is answer is asking the question is like they say it rang like a bell

1091
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,967
Well let sound

1092
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,247
Silly thought I didn't

1093
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,575
So would you like to answer the question that I have

1094
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,367
Negate

1095
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,415
And here is the answer

1096
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,511
Thoughts on the

1097
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,791
Apollo 12

1098
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
Ascent stage

1099
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,583
Experiment

1100
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,375
Crashing into the lunar

1101
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
Individualism

1102
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
Actually siding

1103
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
The languages

1104
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,519
The scientist

1105
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
Reported on that

1106
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,847
Experiments that would

1107
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
There were

1108
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,151
Hello I'm a scientist

1109
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:20,735
It rang like a bell excuse me mister cigarette

1110
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,807
It did ring like a goddamn Bell okay

1111
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,391
Immediate immediate responses just now

1112
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,927
It read like a ring like a bell

1113
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,231
That's literally verbatim

1114
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,023
From the saint

1115
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,095
Literature it despite being

1116
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,655
Physically impossible in the world we inhabit

1117
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:45,055
Event Event in space in the universe we inhabit apologize

1118
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,127
Then

1119
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,919
We have introduced space

1120
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,711
And this

1121
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,527
What is the conspiracy

1122
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
To hear that

1123
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:01,695
The Moon is hollow about to find out is that is that the thrust of it ringing like a bell

1124
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,487
Because they were Beach sound vibration

1125
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,535
Sprite is it was Halo

1126
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,583
But then I have to have an opening

1127
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,119
So

1128
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,167
It's Earth hollow Earth but the Moon

1129
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,959
So the Moon is a base

1130
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,007
Okay I'm putting pieces together

1131
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,799
Okay here I'm going to spit ball

1132
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,103
The Nazis are inside the Moon

1133
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:19,871
Okay

1134
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
You're not far off

1135
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,247
In fact you're terrifyingly close

1136
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,831
Go ahead and this is basically that movie Iron Sky

1137
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,743
I think of the early seventies I don't

1138
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
Remember exact

1139
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,791
That was

1140
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,815
Magazines

1141
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
Soviet

1142
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,887
Periodic

1143
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
Probably stay

1144
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,959
Set of articles

1145
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Bison

1146
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,751
Soviet scientist

1147
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
Actually

1148
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
Have the feast

1149
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,079
Let the Moon

1150
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,383
A big huge artificial spaceship

1151
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,711
Explain the physics

1152
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,759
How it got there doing what

1153
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Doing

1154
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,575
On any of the natural bottles

1155
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,599
4 or 2

1156
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,367
Consistency

1157
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,647
Capture model

1158
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,439
Armored model

1159
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
I'm so far

1160
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,743
So I

1161
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,535
Credence to those

1162
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,815
The story isn't even to that

1163
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,839
Barry because he

1164
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
It's like

1165
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
Isaac Newton

1166
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,959
Decide about the Moon the Moon

1167
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
Gives me a headache

1168
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,287
Have a good way of

1169
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,591
Explaining how it got there doing what is

1170
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Doing

1171
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,151
I mean the guy quoted splooting

1172
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:31,551
Magazine from the 70's or 80's some Russian scientists speculate

1173
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,111
Maybe the Moon is a spaceship

1174
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:41,279
50 years later Joseph p4l thinks that that's probably true

1175
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,911
It is it is that

1176
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:50,751
That's the type of thing that we're dealing with absolutely right

1177
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,519
There are not

1178
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,799
Nazis up there

1179
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,335
I mean I feel like

1180
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
You know in the 70s

1181
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,431
To the late 70s

1182
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,479
Smite have been after

1183
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,319
Particular deathstarr showed up in movies

1184
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,487
Looks sort of like the Moon

1185
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,559
It's a space station

1186
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:19,679
Biting their time with like doing anything with it

1187
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
So yeah

1188
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,127
The second death star was like

1189
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,151
Under construction

1190
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:34,783
Makes sense for like a why it wasn't doing much

1191
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:43,999
They they would have blown up a planet by now or something like the idea that instead

1192
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,047
Whatever in Star Wars Aayla

1193
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,119
It's fully operational and said they like listen

1194
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:55,263
We're going to have to hang out here for about 56 years and then we'll get to him I swear to God

1195
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
Right there

1196
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:01,407
F****** move unnoticed

1197
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,991
Don't leave the Moon

1198
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:11,391
Not just that but you always need to have like MREs to like a dude have so much food and such

1199
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
But not just said

1200
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:15,231
You have to then say that the moon has

1201
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,023
Always been a space station

1202
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:23,423
Right because everybody is

1203
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,239
And there needs to be like some

1204
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,007
I'm kind of

1205
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
Like

1206
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
A biome

1207
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,079
Inside

1208
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,359
It has like

1209
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,175
Something there is no light source so you can

1210
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,479
Like planetary photosynthesis

1211
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,295
I don't know how you keep animals alive

1212
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,343
That seems like it would be prohibitive

1213
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,743
I guess you could have like an elaborate fungus kind of

1214
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,303
Economy is true

1215
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:54,655
It could be like a like a lost world scenario where you going

1216
00:52:54,911 --> 00:53:00,031
The moon and it turns out that there's actually brush and beautiful burden tropical isle

1217
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:03,615
I think you would still need something to

1218
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
To give

1219
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,199
Like energy to that

1220
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,759
That's flora and fauna

1221
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:16,159
Atlantis and Magic

1222
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:16,927
Citizen play

1223
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:20,767
Thank God we're at the midpoint they just started talking about space

1224
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:24,863
And now I'm just I love this clip I just love this

1225
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,423
Hey thanks for inviting me into your home

1226
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,191
Long Haul

1227
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,471
RV camper

1228
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
Taxi

1229
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
Your parents

1230
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
Well-appointed wreck

1231
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,591
With a simulated wood paneling

1232
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,895
Electric fireplace in the painting of dogs

1233
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,663
Playing poker

1234
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,943
Your loft beds

1235
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,991
Greasy spoon just off the interstate

1236
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,527
And your cabin in the woods

1237
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,831
Hello to everyone listening in and our

1238
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,135
Flagship station AM 740 96

1239
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,927
6.7 FM Zoomer radio

1240
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,719
Here in Toronto and

1241
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,511
I added those of you tuning

1242
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,791
I just love it

1243
00:53:54,303 --> 00:54:00,447
It just reminds me so much of Casey Kasem here just so much case let me describe a Norman.

1244
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,983
Rockwell.

1245
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:06,079
Give a shout out to the only station I'm on

1246
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:13,503
There's something about that that just reminds me of literally a road trip in the middle of the night

1247
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:19,903
Listening to some terrible radio station that you hear that and you like a that's what radio is about

1248
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:25,791
Go to be like junior varsity guys on Coast to Coast smells like that

1249
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:30,143
The reason that I wanted to do space

1250
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,983
Aliens are obviously in the news these days

1251
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:40,383
And we don't get enough of it these are these days on the podcast

1252
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,967
Now how am I using

1253
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,503
That

1254
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,783
One question that I was

1255
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,807
Interested in

1256
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,087
Especially is

1257
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,927
Everybody normal now everybody who is not a

1258
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,463
Space weirdo before

1259
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,511
Is now like holyshit

1260
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,583
Government saying there's aliens or something going on here

1261
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,887
How is the UFO Community take

1262
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655
Taking this

1263
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:09,055
Impulse life and the fact that the government stole UFO from them and changed it out of

1264
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,359
Nowhere just because they didn't want them to look so

1265
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,383
It's fate

1266
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,663
Siletz

1267
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
Okay

1268
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
We have this Tech

1269
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,759
And maybe

1270
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,319
You know that might explain

1271
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,367
These

1272
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,391
Tic-tac-toe

1273
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,927
UFO videos

1274
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,719
Even though the

1275
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,023
The Pentagon is saying they're not ours

1276
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,047
They're not ours

1277
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,327
Well maybe that

1278
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,375
Underwater

1279
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,655
Well

1280
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,959
The Tic Tac videos

1281
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,007
You know I'm in all of this stuff

1282
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,311
You know you can go look up patent

1283
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
Online

1284
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,383
For triangular shape

1285
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,151
Vehicles

1286
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,687
Let's use some form of few

1287
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,455
Propulsion

1288
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
What bothers me about

1289
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
All of this

1290
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,295
This is not so much

1291
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,063
Too bad

1292
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,855
The technology apparent

1293
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:55,903
What bothers me is

1294
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,439
The constant rush to attributed

1295
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,207
To e.t.

1296
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
And

1297
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
Well

1298
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
I mean that's a thought

1299
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,071
Yeah

1300
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,351
The guy

1301
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
Who just

1302
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:10,751
Told us that the moon was a f****** spaceship Pyramid of Giza

1303
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,567
Death Star

1304
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,127
Everywhere cloning people all Vista

1305
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,663
He's telling you

1306
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,735
People are rushing to judgment on this e.t. stuff

1307
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
Yeah

1308
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,527
You don't that you can

1309
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,319
Sure

1310
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,135
He's being real dismissive

1311
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,207
And I will admit

1312
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,511
If this is one of those situations

1313
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,303
To where I've looked into it

1314
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
And

1315
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,863
Z's the

1316
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,655
Original UFO folks

1317
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
Arnaud's

1318
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
Debunking

1319
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,239
The government's videos

1320
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,567
Cuz it doesn't work for the stories that they

1321
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,615
The folklore of

1322
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,151
In this situation

1323
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,687
They're doing a good job

1324
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,503
The government's videos

1325
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,295
Very easily be explained

1326
00:56:55,807 --> 00:57:00,927
And it's kind of disappointing whenever you look into the Simplicity of their explanation

1327
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951
Oh s***

1328
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,487
What a surprise

1329
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,535
Human error in machine error

1330
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:11,167
That's never happened in the military before yeah yeah like a lot of like headlines

1331
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,191
Bike

1332
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
Excitement

1333
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,031
Can get ahead of yourself a little bit

1334
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:22,431
That's something that I actually think is really fascinating is that like a lot of these communities are capable

1335
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:29,343
Of decent critical thinking just misdirected attacking their bulshit

1336
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,927
Apply very rigorous and solid critical thinking

1337
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,463
Skills do your b*******

1338
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,487
They can

1339
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,255
Yeah

1340
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,791
It's just not usually

1341
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,071
Exactly

1342
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,119
Never done

1343
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:44,959
So that's why I want to hear that Clippers like okay. People are

1344
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,727
Really

1345
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,799
Eager to attribute this to aliens inside

1346
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:54,687
Yes they are I don't disagree with that statement

1347
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,479
Exactly exact

1348
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
And he is

1349
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:01,343
He is getting he's getting a little bit salty

1350
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:06,207
These days don't know what is UFO information

1351
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,767
The idea that the

1352
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
This was a vehicle

1353
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
Reconstruct

1354
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
On the basis

1355
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
What they had

1356
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
They had

1357
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
Recovered from

1358
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:14,911
Crashed

1359
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,215
Recovered UF vehicle

1360
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,239
UFO vehicles

1361
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,775
That

1362
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
Could be a cover

1363
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,079
Story for what they really are

1364
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,383
Another is that this might be holy

1365
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,663
When product I don't know

1366
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
Alright I'm increasing

1367
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,247
Skeptical Richard

1368
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,015
About

1369
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,575
Bet Naruto

1370
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,855
Particularly from Ghana

1371
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
Could have been willing

1372
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,159
To lie to our faces

1373
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,951
About you no mask

1374
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,975
Vaccines

1375
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,023
Self

1376
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,375
Yeah he thinks everybody

1377
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,399
Job

1378
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,191
What if it's an actual

1379
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,751
What if it's just

1380
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:57,151
Buzz Marketing

1381
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:01,503
Put pictures up and they got bomb threats

1382
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:04,319
What attacks been biding their time

1383
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,879
Shorehaven up their address America

1384
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,207
There's a secret program

1385
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,487
To give Tic Tac

1386
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:16,351
The power to create extraterrestrial vehicle I believe it

1387
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Terribly wrong

1388
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,423
Everything that you think

1389
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,215
Is wrong everything that they think

1390
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,007
Is wrong and if you know something

1391
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,055
You're wrong about it and here's why

1392
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,335
Oh and

1393
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,103
No

1394
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,127
He's starting to get

1395
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
A little bit

1396
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,175
Possessive as well

1397
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,015
Are you thinking that the the technology

1398
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,831
Exists and it that these are

1399
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,135
Made in the good old USA or

1400
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:42,207
Did this technology find its way into

1401
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,743
The hands of our adversaries

1402
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
Russian China

1403
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
Well I see

1404
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
Take a lot of it

1405
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,607
I go back to

1406
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:52,191
To what I've been writing about him right now to series of books I wrote a book

1407
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,727
A few years ago

1408
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:54,751
Ufology

1409
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,775
She loves to ignore

1410
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
Call Roswell

1411
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:04,479
I pray that I never do anything

1412
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:08,319
That the UFO Community loves to ignore

1413
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,647
I pray I pray

1414
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:18,047
That that is not a face that I have my career where I'm pissed off

1415
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,351
Community ignores my book

1416
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:26,751
It's very strange that the UFO Community is not also willing to toss the Nazis in with the

1417
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
Roswell Circle

1418
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:32,383
Some of them do though that's true I feel like this guy is being a little bit

1419
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,175
I don't know

1420
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,199
Salty

1421
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,479
Like you said I'm in like

1422
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,759
There are that is a

1423
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:41,599
Before it's not something that's like

1424
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,623
Verboten

1425
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,415
And conspiracy in space

1426
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,183
Communities

1427
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:51,583
I have read a little bit of his book though and movie called

1428
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
The novelization of

1429
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,471
The movie Iron

1430
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,519
No it's

1431
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,287
It's just

1432
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,335
Nobody reads my book

1433
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,687
Yeah I know

1434
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,991
I have professional

1435
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
Misgivings

1436
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,295
About

1437
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:15,135
More people could listen in or

1438
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:15,903
No

1439
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,671
No no

1440
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:20,255
You would prefer generally like anybody who creates things

1441
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,047
Like we could have a wider audience

1442
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,583
I feel like that's what you saying

1443
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:26,143
Yeah but he's more saying they don't

1444
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:26,911
Respect me

1445
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,959
So on and so forth

1446
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:34,335
I just love if this is this is kind of fun for me

1447
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,615
Just because

1448
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,663
Everything is Everything is obviously false

1449
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,735
He's obviously had ET

1450
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,527
Giza Pyramid is a Death Star

1451
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,831
All of this stuff is

1452
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,879
True simultaneously

1453
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,647
But

1454
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,671
Somehow

1455
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,439
These guys

1456
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,743
Don't take it to a meme place

1457
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:56,863
Like it even for all their covid denialism which is inherently mean and cruel

1458
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:01,215
It's not like they're they're not the type of person that I'm used to hearing sock about this

1459
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,751
Where they almost relish

1460
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,823
Like that the inflicting of Cruelty or the expression

1461
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,383
Great Lakes for someone like Alex

1462
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,431
It's less about the point

1463
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:13,247
It's more about getting to yell at somebody

1464
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,039
About how they're wearing a mask

1465
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,087
He's kind of

1466
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,647
Feature of a lot of stuff

1467
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,719
Louis c.k.

1468
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,511
It's not malicious

1469
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:28,863
He strikes me more as almost a hoarder of

1470
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,143
Nazi U-boat

1471
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:33,727
Leica instead of somebody collecting Beanie Babies

1472
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,519
He's collected lore

1473
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,311
And he's just hoarded

1474
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,335
And so

1475
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:42,943
I don't know how much of it is anything about how he

1476
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,247
Feels or thinks or even has like

1477
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,295
Prescriptions or what we

1478
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:50,879
Do I don't think he takes any of his like here's what we should do

1479
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,903
Seriously

1480
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,951
All he's really interested in

1481
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,743
Is hoarding all of this in

1482
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
Information

1483
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,047
None of it is true

1484
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:02,143
But he's so hoarded it over there you know it's just like he did with

1485
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,703
When he was a theologian

1486
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:11,359
He hoarded all of this biblical knowledge all of this history and integrity wants to be the dungeon

1487
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,639
Master of

1488
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,431
Nazi space

1489
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:17,759
Exactly he wants everybody to Kiss the Ring because he

1490
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,039
He's hoarded the most now

1491
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,343
That's the way that he operates

1492
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,903
And so yeah in this situation it's just

1493
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,183
Just ridiculous

1494
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Alright let

1495
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:29,279
Let's see oh you betcha

1496
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:30,815
You betcha asks

1497
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:33,119
Joseph how do you compare covid vaccine

1498
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:38,495
Sports compared to the long-standing requirement to have your kids get a vaccine to go to school

1499
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,311
Or vaccines for yellow fever to travel

1500
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,359
Which is an interesting point

1501
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:46,175
So getting another words why we getting all upset about in work

1502
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:46,943
Stuff about

1503
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,711
Vaccine pass

1504
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,479
Passports

1505
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,039
Right that's a good question

1506
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:55,391
That's a really good question I got excited when I heard that question because

1507
01:03:55,903 --> 01:04:00,511
That would be a moment's if that shows up on Infowars where Alex is like

1508
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,815
And hang up real quick cuz it's a very solid

1509
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:06,911
Yeah I honestly was listening to it

1510
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Got lost

1511
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:08,703
Because it

1512
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,471
Boardman

1513
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,359
Alright

1514
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,383
This is great

1515
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:22,783
Because it's a reasonable question so the only way out of it is you got to take a big swing you know I got really a

1516
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,647
I simply don't buy the universality of

1517
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,439
Vaccines I grew up

1518
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,255
As many people in

1519
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,279
States that

1520
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,071
Interstate where this

1521
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,095
Is not a

1522
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,655
Exactly only back

1523
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,679
Singing I've ever had

1524
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,447
My wife

1525
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
Polio vaccine

1526
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,007
Saving vaccine

1527
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,031
I was very young

1528
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,823
I've not had

1529
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
Antivirus

1530
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,615
Clean ever since

1531
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,687
So it's not

1532
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,967
An entirely universe

1533
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:52,991
Experience

1534
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:57,343
Nope no big swing it all he just says I grew up and I didn't have to get vaccine

1535
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,647
Except

1536
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:06,047
Now why are we not talking about how the polio vaccine is also evil let's not worry about it he's already had it

1537
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,351
Sure that

1538
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,655
Does big the question are some vaccine

1539
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,423
Good

1540
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,447
Right but

1541
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,239
We're not going to be

1542
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,311
Is that a real I was so disappointed

1543
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:20,895
I was so disappointed because his answers just basically like

1544
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:27,295
Well maybe if I had grown up in that culture I would understand what you're saying but since I didn't I don't care

1545
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,367
I wanted I wanted Nazis to be behind

1546
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:33,183
Yeah yeah yeah it is a little bit of

1547
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,255
A swing-and-a-miss that's a real bummer

1548
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,279
It's a real bummer

1549
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:40,351
Interview with

1550
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,375
Conspiracy theorist

1551
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,703
Equivalent of stepping on a banana peel

1552
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:50,079
Somebody should have thrown a pie in his face immediately following that

1553
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,103
Put a little comedy in

1554
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:58,271
So now we get to some of the things that Pharrell is right

1555
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,551
So he also has a Blog

1556
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,623
Any post stuff all the way all there

1557
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,671
Did you know if you looked at his blog

1558
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:09,535
Driver ed a lot of it does he have any post about have no one ever really dies

1559
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:13,887
Don't think he has post about how no one ever really dies

1560
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,167
But

1561
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,703
Any Rd

1562
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,239
Victor B Pharrell was in all my God

1563
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,775
Sorry

1564
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:25,407
Sorry killing me I'm trying to do this I'm not great at running a show and dealing

1565
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,967
With references this is what I

1566
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:32,575
After I put up with the from you fly regularly

1567
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,855
Screw

1568
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:38,463
They talked about one of the things that's

1569
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,999
Joseph has written

1570
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,815
Oue posted a Blog

1571
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,887
I'm not sure how long ago was too long goat

1572
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,167
Discussing some

1573
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,959
Rather interesting formations

1574
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
But you've spotted

1575
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,287
Fauna on March 1st

1576
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,847
There was some discussion about

1577
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,383
Some ice

1578
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,175
Top formations on the planet

1579
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:02,527
And that led you to look a little further in and what did you spy

1580
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,343
You buried the lede

1581
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,695
You didn't tell me this guy maybe has a telescope he does

1582
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:12,767
Because that's enough

1583
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,559
Unfortunately he does not have a tail

1584
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,935
Talking about pictures posted from 2001 by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft

1585
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,215
Charanda

1586
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,239
Richard

1587
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,007
Set this up

1588
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,079
As though this is a very important article

1589
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:28,895
And Joseph is response we're not going to listen to because

1590
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,175
It's eight minutes long

1591
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:36,063
And all you really saying is nothing he saying stuff like it looks like it could be

1592
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,599
Let me let me read you the

1593
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,671
So the pictures that Richard is talking

1594
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,975
Saying this article is very good

1595
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,279
Let me read you the captions on these two

1596
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Quote

1597
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:51,935
When I look at this with my Layman's eyes I'm not seeing much about

1598
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
Ice floes

1599
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:58,591
And a whole lot of weird stuff that borders on things that look like nearly perfect circular whatchamacallit

1600
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
Huh

1601
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,175
Good you think that's

1602
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:02,943
Good stuff

1603
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,735
Yeah okay

1604
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:11,135
The scientists said that the moon rang like a bell

1605
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,951
The doodads it what's it called

1606
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,487
Quotes

1607
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,535
And then there are lots of odd little

1608
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,303
Be things

1609
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:21,631
Obstinately arranged in rectangles triangles and so on

1610
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:26,239
And then finally we have lot at someone's lots and lots

1611
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:29,055
Rectilinear and structural looking

1612
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:32,383
Thanks I somebody who'd spend a fair amount of time

1613
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,407
Reading

1614
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,431
Things in journals

1615
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,783
I'm used to things being described as bumpy Little Things

1616
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,111
Whatchamacallit

1617
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,391
To cut your chest open

1618
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:46,463
And perform some surgery on your you who's it

1619
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,815
And then we'll take the WhatsApp and put it in your hole

1620
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:53,119
You fell off

1621
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:57,983
This high place in the problem is that really hard thing inside your arm

1622
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,311
Got a headache

1623
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:06,943
I got a crick in your heart sexy all I all I hear is

1624
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:14,111
And unfamiliarity with scholarly writing on your part unfamiliarity with a

1625
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
Research

1626
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,951
Wow that me not to let that does that doesn't

1627
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:21,023
Not sound very soon sound like

1628
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,583
Somebody should bring it up in an interview and be like

1629
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:29,983
Now you just wrote this interesting thing and I mean that you have an uphill battle whenever you're starting an interview of being like you wrote

1630
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,775
Roblox

1631
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,567
Is that alone is

1632
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,359
Telcel

1633
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,967
Whatchamacallit

1634
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,759
Whatchamacallit starts not great

1635
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:44,831
Now I'm assuming you're asking it how is it that they can

1636
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,367
Can pay for these whatchamacallits

1637
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:49,439
And structural looking

1638
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,463
King things

1639
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:58,143
Okay mister mister Global annoyed as I think he likes her instead of saying Global as he likes to Dennis Miller

1640
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:02,751
Clear it up with mister Global innovator when I got to avoid the global annoyed

1641
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,287
There we go that one I got

1642
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:08,127
So yeah so now we're going to talk about

1643
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,663
How everybody paid

1644
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,479
We were talking about Mars and

1645
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:16,063
And I will be about the secret space program you mentioned Catherine Austin

1646
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:18,879
If it's earlier and that the missing trivia

1647
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:19,647
Something like

1648
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:22,463
21 trillion dollars missing from

1649
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,255
The US government

1650
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
So is it

1651
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,839
Your belief that

1652
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,375
That much of his money is

1653
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,167
Is being funneled into

1654
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,447
The secret space

1655
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,239
The secret space program for 1

1656
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,775
What the construction of deep space

1657
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,311
Platforms and so forth

1658
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,335
I know Catherine off

1659
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,615
Austin Fitts

1660
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,663
Block personalized like cheese

1661
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,687
She comes up in

1662
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,223
Various places

1663
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,015
So

1664
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:50,623
She's a former HUD official in the W in ministration

1665
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,415
And then when she left

1666
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,951
She created a brokerage

1667
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:57,023
Search firm and she started business doing business

1668
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,071
You guessed it BH

1669
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,119
Now

1670
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:04,191
What was going on is while she was doing the accounting

1671
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:08,031
For these contracts with the HUD and the Pentagon and not

1672
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,359
Captain look

1673
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:16,223
It didn't look right at all things are going wrong

1674
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,527
And so Joseph is going to tell us

1675
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,551
That's what it is she fell

1676
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,087
So if we go back

1677
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:21,855
2

1678
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,391
To let's say the Baylor

1679
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
2080

1680
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,207
Enormous amount of money

1681
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,743
End of the system

1682
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,023
Or did they

1683
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:34,655
I like that

1684
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,191
For the bailout

1685
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,215
Yeah

1686
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,799
We're for like upgrades to the Moon

1687
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,103
Siri I guess

1688
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,175
Is that if the bailouts happen than inflation

1689
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,199
You should have Skyrock

1690
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,247
Which

1691
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
Okay

1692
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,599
That doesn't exactly work

1693
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,367
But that's fine

1694
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:55,903
What

1695
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:56,671
He is

1696
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,695
Completely ignoring

1697
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,487
Is that

1698
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,535
The 21 trillion that we're talking

1699
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,095
Sing about it's not missing in the sense that it's like

1700
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:07,423
It was taken away and now it we could be anywhere right

1701
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,471
It's missing in the sense that the pay

1702
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,239
Pentagon

1703
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,775
By Design

1704
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,055
Does not

1705
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,591
Keep track of where it spends money

1706
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,151
It doesn't keep track of it it doesn't

1707
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,199
That you can't audit it you can't

1708
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:21,247
Nothing happens they tried to have

1709
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,295
So many accountants go in and just

1710
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,063
Give it a shot

1711
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,111
Right and you can't do it by Design

1712
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:30,207
Because if you know exactly how much money you're spending you might get less

1713
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:34,047
Well there's that and then also I would assume that there's probably some

1714
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:34,815
Some kind of like

1715
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:40,191
National security reasons why you wouldn't want that information being somewhere where people could

1716
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:46,079
Possibly get a hold of it sure that I would assume that maybe there's some of that

1717
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,383
Even then you would have a budget

1718
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,991
Right they just have money and then they spend it

1719
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:56,319
So even whenever they're talking about passing a military budget

1720
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,599
It's just

1721
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,367
It's just better

1722
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:01,695
And they spend money and if they spend more than that budget

1723
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,719
The government still going

1724
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,743
Nobody cares

1725
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,767
Right right

1726
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,887
Missing money is is the the same kind of

1727
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,703
Single people talk about with like

1728
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,751
There's this unfunded

1729
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:21,151
Social Security until

1730
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,687
Future exact

1731
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,759
People paying into it will pay for it in the future

1732
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,575
You know like it's the same sort of

1733
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,367
Semantical trick

1734
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,159
The people used to Tryon

1735
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,695
Argue against

1736
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,719
Any kind of government spend

1737
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,743
Exactly

1738
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:44,191
Maybe there's more to it that everybody who is looked into it everybody who has looked into the Pentagon budget

1739
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:44,959
Has

1740
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,751
Immediately

1741
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:53,151
Like they they open their computer they look at one line and they raised a red flag up into the f****** sky and shoot Flair

1742
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:58,271
This is not good

1743
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,063
It's a misunderstanding

1744
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,599
Based on like the waves being

1745
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,367
Describe

1746
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:06,207
This is a problem for a different reason

1747
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,023
Yeah you got it now Joseph has a different Theory than

1748
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,119
So I've actually speculated

1749
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,935
That somehow

1750
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,471
This money may actually be

1751
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,007
We going off world

1752
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,799
How I do

1753
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,823
No sure

1754
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
I'm in

1755
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,687
I just love that

1756
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:31,551
I just love that he does not go on this is the one time that he really doesn't go on further

1757
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,831
Cool here's his response

1758
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,903
Well I think it's probably off-world

1759
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,439
And I don't know how it got there

1760
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:41,023
Now I should say for the mechanical this

1761
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,303
I got no idea

1762
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:46,655
Write a gas but I will say

1763
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,679
That I'm just

1764
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:52,031
Literally just saying

1765
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:56,383
I might be in that empty Moon up there I would love to be the guy doing this interview

1766
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:00,991
Cuz my response would be like oh you speculate

1767
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,295
Google

1768
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
Oru

1769
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:08,415
Interesting I'm speculating that money stayed on world

1770
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,183
Now what

1771
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,743
We have reached an impasse

1772
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,047
Just agree to disagree

1773
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,887
Yeah I mean it's just

1774
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,679
It's just that so often

1775
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:23,007
So what he always has money in space

1776
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,311
Moon rocks

1777
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:28,895
No no no it doesn't mean anything

1778
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,711
No Intergalactic treaties recognize money

1779
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:38,111
All right otherwise how could we do business with bet if they don't recognize our currency would suggest we don't

1780
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:41,183
Please go on

1781
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,255
Yeah and so that's it

1782
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,279
Exactly

1783
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,303
What Joseph does

1784
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:47,583
A with ever

1785
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:48,863
Specular

1786
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:53,215
Yes the only difference between that clip and what he normally does

1787
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,495
Is the trick

1788
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,031
He uses of being like

1789
01:15:56,287 --> 01:16:02,431
I'm going to flood you with names I'm going to flood you with information because he's an incredibly knowledgeable guide

1790
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,711
Right

1791
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,271
Hits you with so much references

1792
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,551
All the time

1793
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,135
That's people skip over the fact that most of his response

1794
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:11,903
Questions

1795
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,927
Are essentially

1796
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,975
I'm speculating here

1797
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,999
I don't know anyting

1798
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,791
I might be making this up

1799
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:18,815
Totally

1800
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:21,887
I need stitches just mind-boggling how

1801
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:22,911
Popular

1802
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,447
This guy really is

1803
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:28,543
It's not cuz he's boring and he doesn't have anything to say

1804
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,335
It doesn't seem like it

1805
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,871
And then this

1806
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:35,199
I believe this is the last clip because I just couldn't do this after

1807
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,503
Do

1808
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,807
One of your blogs recent blog

1809
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:43,903
Books on Giza Death Star, this it's entitled how to get that

1810
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,927
Precognition

1811
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,951
And

1812
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:48,767
As you point out it's a it's a wild article

1813
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,303
I guess someone

1814
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
Shared with

1815
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,375
If you want it it has to do with the scientist

1816
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,399
Has to have discovered

1817
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
The heart and brain

1818
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,471
Can respond

1819
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,775
To future events obviously beef

1820
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,543
For they

1821
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,311
Appen

1822
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,079
Tell me more

1823
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,895
Well I find that very

1824
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,175
Because

1825
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,991
The present of physiologic

1826
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:09,759
Okay slip

1827
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,319
The structure in the brain in the heart

1828
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,599
You have a very very

1829
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,647
Somehow

1830
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,183
Represent or

1831
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:17,951
Mirror

1832
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,743
The fabric of

1833
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,511
The universe

1834
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,095
And the reason I find that very interesting is you can go online

1835
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:25,887
Pictures

1836
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,423
Galactic

1837
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,191
Clusters

1838
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:28,959
And what they say

1839
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,727
Tank RV

1840
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
Plasma

1841
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,519
Nostrand

1842
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,543
Connect them and then

1843
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,311
Compare those

1844
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,359
2

1845
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,895
Actual neural

1846
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Mapping of

1847
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,687
Neurons in the brain

1848
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,967
Have a remarkably

1849
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,855
That's that's what I was I was listening that just going

1850
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,159
Supposedly

1851
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:48,927
I'm supposed

1852
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:51,999
To take you as an authority on this

1853
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:57,119
And you're telling me your response to precognition possibility

1854
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,143
It's to say

1855
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,471
Look at the pictures of the stars and people similar

1856
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,519
Yeah maybe we are little

1857
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,799
Little bugs

1858
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:11,199
Is inside a brain is like their Universe G another person

1859
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:13,247
Fine man but come on

1860
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:18,367
Come on you're supposed to be the expert in this s*** and you cannot come at me with

1861
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,647
You know they look alike

1862
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:26,303
Sure it's so disappointing to me and I just can't handle it I couldn't handle it past that point I was like I've heard too many times you

1863
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,863
You just go do it looks like a whatchamacallit

1864
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:35,263
And then be done with your with your evidence my head up I see the Whatchamacallit and it looks like a doodad

1865
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:40,895
Is probably true or not or whatever

1866
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,711
