Usual Suspects

8
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,888
I was actually thinking of Calvin and Hobbes when he orders for the

9
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,824
Have you ever ordered anything

10
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
Like four to six

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,296
You know what I'm saying positive I have but like my parents growing up were not into that s*** at all

13
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,696
Cereals that had

14
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,232
General rule no sugar cereal

15
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,792

I don't know I don't have any Vivid memories of that

22
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
But that package

23
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
You saw that triggered your question

24
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
I just recently out the shirt

25
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,512
I was so disappointed when you were like

26
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,840
What a shity question is like

27
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
That case I'm sorry

28
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424

I didn't realize the flowers that I got this so crazy out-of-control it is a climbing Vining

34
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,048
Really

35
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,352
No flowers yet but it is going crazy

36
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,472
I wish I had it looks like

37
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,520
Vine all over the place

38
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,312
Really cool

39
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
But then beyond that

40
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,688
The peppers are coming in fine no fruit as of yet

41
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968

00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
Cracked up so today

56
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
We are stuck in the present

57
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,536
You know the world

58
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560

59
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
To go back to our fun

60
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
Fun relatively speaking of

61
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,920

62
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,552
Really f***** up Olaf happened

63
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,184
Going over June 13th Thursday and Friday of last week

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
There is a lot of messed-up stuff

65
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
That happens on these episodes

66
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,096
Politically messed up so emotionally

67
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,936
So consider this a fair warning

68
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
Be pleasant to listen to

69
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
You have been warned

70
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,056
You personally and listeners

71
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Abstractly

72
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Wonderful

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,968
Episode

74
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
Take a moment to say thank you

75
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
We appreciate it

76
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,368
So first

77
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,536

00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
Heroin

89
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,647
Freakishly large

90
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,167
Destiny's Child era or Beyonce era

91
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:32,031
I don't think she called herself babe

92
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
Alright alright

93
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
Alright I can't see your computer

94
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:52,255
Do that by going to website

95
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
Yes please let's defeat these f****** hands

96
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
Start on the 3rd

97
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,727
As you may recall on the 13th

98
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,055
We had a situation where that was Thursday

99
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,615
In the morning there was a ship

100
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
They got hit

101
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,783
Ministration

102
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
Don't look at me later on please everybody know that it was a Ron it was a Ron

103
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,767
He was around here right

104
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:31,167
I want to say before I don't know what happened I can't pretend that I have any kind of

105
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:37,567
Parties on this or any kind of intimate knowledge of the of what happened

106
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
It's a good idea to go to

107
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
I joked that I don't trust the people

108
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
At the helm

109
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,991
Of our let's say

110
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,575
People named John V Department

111
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,231
Has been looking for an excuse

112
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
I don't know what happened

113
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
I just think the

114
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,983
The calmer heads should prevail

115
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
We talked about Alex covering this

116
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,895
Coming from a place of saying it was around or it wasn't I don't know

117
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,967
The facts will bear out as they bear out Ness

118
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
We have more information

119
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,879
I'm not ready to condemn Iran and I'm not here to condemn

120
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,671
This is a false flag

121
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:30,303
No but I will say right now I'm leaning towards trusting around more than the United

122
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
Midstate so maybe maybe we're in a

123
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:37,983
Like a motive perspective it definitely seems

124
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Like it makes more sense

125
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
For them

126
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
Do not do this

127
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,711
Alex heard about it it's happening

128
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
Play Believe

129
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
Sure the exact time

130
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
It's fresh

131
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
As he's on air

132
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
And so Alex

133
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Gets into the story

134
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351
Responsible behind

135
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
Another ship

136
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:12,031
Well if the mullahs are really that crazy

137
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
World War 3

138
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:24,319
So Alex is coming in pretty hot with a

139
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,135
Realsense do you get that he doesn't pick

140
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
This is a false flag

141
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
Yeah yeah

142
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
To be thinking

143
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
That this is sincere

144
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
And what we're going to witness

145
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,143
Alex's Thursday

146
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Show

147
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,007
Is he talked himself into believing this actually happened

148
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
And that it was a rock

149
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,383
That is needs to figure out a way to be like I know I say everything is a f****** false-flag

150
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,199
But this one's got to be real because

151
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
What am I going to do

152
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,343
It's a struggle and he knows the destination

153
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
Somebody's trying to get to

154
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
Trump

155
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:09,119
Career

156
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,519
All the pretense

157
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
I don't like

158
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Coward

159
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
I can't stand up to

160
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,735
So defensive

161
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
After that clip

162
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
That we just heard

163
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,623
Start listing off boat related false Flags

164
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
And

165
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Lusitania

166
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,327
This is not a great list and we're going to go through it one by one you're correct on the first one Alex does bring up the Lusitania.

167
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
Whispers Club

168
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
She is a dumb dumb

169
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,079
Was that crazy

170
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
Infowars.com horse.com

171
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Not good

172
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:07,231
I didn't hear a?

173
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,071
False flag

174

Beaded hard to prove forget it

179
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
Started

180
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
With a

181
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
And I quasi false flag

182
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,839
Quasi.

183
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,495
Little bit regular

184
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,687
If you're a f****** conspiracy theorist truth-teller and use terms like Define however you

185
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
Depending on your mood

186
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,783
You were signaling that you're an idiot and you're just making

187
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
18

188
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Both side gathered

189
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Together

190
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
To cause

191
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:15,071
Naruto double false flag

192
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:21,471
Another ship

193
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
Maybe flying a different flags

194
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
In the country or group they represent

195
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
Instead there be flying the flag of

196
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
The group that they wanted to be blamed for the

197
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,967
In the case of a sinking of the Lusitania a German U-boat

198
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,159
So I'm not even sure where a quasi Falls flight comes in

199
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,791
I guess maybe Alex could be referring to the Lusitania itself

200
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
Do you are u.s. flag

201
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
In an attempt to appear neutral

202
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
Is really irrelevant to what happened

203
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,287
That boat was getting sunk no matter what flag had on it unless it was a German

204
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,895
More importantly Alex's misrepresenting history pretty egregious

205
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Just like here

206
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,247
First of all this start World War

207
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,575
World War 1 started in July 1940

208
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
And the Lusitania sunk in May night

209
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
1850

210
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:18,559
What Alex means is that the Lusitania

211
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,191
Recognize

212
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
The ship sank

213
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
But even that thinking is flawed

214
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,615
The US didn't enter World War

215
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,735
The powers-that-be to false flag attack this boat then wait two years

216
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,063
To follow through with the plan that had false flag allowed them to put in place

217
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
That's nonsense

218
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,255
Africa Lusitania was sunk Woodrow Wilson demanded a stop to sinking of merchant boats by the German

219
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
U-boat

220
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
Germany agreed to cut it out

221
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
On January 31st 1970

222
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,727
Germany unrestricted submarine warfare

223
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,823
Wilson responded on February 3rd that the United States

224
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Unless

225
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
Germany committed over tax

226
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
Against the United

227
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
In the following two months

228
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Germany

229
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
9 American ships

230
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
None of whose name's Alex Jones

231
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Even though

232
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,695
Most historians agree that the sinking of the Lusitania was not the reason the US got involved in the war

233
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,487
But that its members

234
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Asthma cost

235
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
Spell eight

236
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
And the reason for that is probably classes

237
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:30,239
The passengers of the night merchant ship sunk in the weeks before the US declared war

238
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Mariners

239
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,079
The passenger focused ocean liner

240
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
Which carry people of an elevated social stamp

241
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:43,551
Here are the nine ships that were sunk by Germany that actually caused Woodrow Wilson degrees on his campaign

242
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Which was

243
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
He kept us out of War

244
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,231
There was the the Housatonic which was sunk on February 3rd nineteen

245
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
Great named Eli

246
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,399
Ultrasound on February 12th the Algonquin sunk on March 12th

247
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,775
Which was sunk on March 16th

248
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
Crew members who were killed

249
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Six of whom were American

250
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
The city of Memphis

251
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,175
Suture sunk on March 7th

252
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
The Illinois sunk on March 17th again

253
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
The Herald

254
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Sunk on May 21st

255
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,367
Killing 21-7 Okumura Bergen

256
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,671
That one is actually attempt entry on this list

257
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:26,815
Because it was actually suck and it probably or may not have been Germany

258
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,887
Who was at fault but it's still part of the reason why we entered the war

259
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:34,495
Everybody American's die

260
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
So it is definitely part of

261
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Consideration

262
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
The Aztec

263
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
The song called April 1st

264
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,919
Killing 28110 who were American

265
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
The margarita

266
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
Sunk on April 4th and the Missouri

267
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Sunk on April 4th as well

268
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
Each of these boats as they were some

269
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
Debate

270
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,439
It's about whether or not they constituted overactive

271
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,743
The first three involved no casualties

272
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
In the case of the Housatonic

273
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,375
It appeared that Lieutenant Collins Rose captain of the u53

274
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,007
Given the crew warning and then told them in lifeboats to a place where they could easily be rescued by a British ship

275
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
Continue to

276
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
U.s. boats

277
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,407
They're probably would not have been any legal just

278
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Application for

279
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
To enter the war

280
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,759
The Housatonic was carrying food stuff

281
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
Smite for the German

282
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
An under international law they had every right to

283
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
To consider that contraband

284
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,719
This sort of thing could be said for the alignment am lost

285
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
The crew that ship was Warden advance

286
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,095
The ship was sunk in the passengers reported lifeboats and towed to land

287
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,143
It was a very courteous thinking

288
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
If there is such a thing

289
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
But here's the thing

290
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,055
Those thinking that happened pretty soon after Germany announced

291
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,151
To resume full scale submarine warfare

292
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:50,527
In their announcement they made clear that some of their ships had already launched before the announcement was made

293
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,575
As you might expect more lenient

294
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,135
From something from U-boats you might encounter in

295
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
The future

296
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:01,279
Nuvet is one area where they hit a real leg up on all other belligerent parties

297
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,119
But in a central problem if they exerted their full force

298
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
The United States would end up getting

299
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Involved in the war

300
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
They need to be able to act with him

301
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,287
The ocean and not worry about.

302
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
So the best way to achieve

303
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,383
She that was disturb some other s*** that we would have to deal with

304
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
On February 24th 90

305
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
17

306
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
Woodrow Wilson received the Zimmerman Note

307
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,319
A telegram that was intercepted by British intelligence

308
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,879
Vince from the German foreign minister Arthur Zimmermann

309
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,207
The German ambassador in the United States Johan Von burst off

310
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
Zimmerman request that burn stuff

311
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
Reach Out

312
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Mister Mexico

313
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,935
To offer an alliance with them on the condition that they attacked the United States from the south

314
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,239
The offer was to involve the promise

315
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
To give Mexico back when it was lost

316
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
The Mexican-American War

317
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,175
After Wilson received that message Andy U-Boat attack

318
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Mexican

319
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:57,855
He was a no position to argue with a more fish side that have been arguing that Tampax constituted over

320
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
The next attack

321
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Of the Algonquin

322
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
And on March 12th did not involve such courteous German

323
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
As we've seen with the hondros

324
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,375
They didn't give a warning and they didn't help the stranded crew find rescue

325
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
But there was still a problem for the Warhawk

326
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,031
The shipping recently transferred from British to American ownership

327
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
Break before

328
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:23,455
Belligerent flag to a neutral

329
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,271
Thinking didn't qualify as a justification for war

330
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,855
Because there's every reason that Germany could have not known

331
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
It was now in American Shepherd

332
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
U-Boat straight-up torpedo the vigilance PS4 days later and ended up killing American civilians in the prom

333
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,911
International

334
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
That merited declaring war

335
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,007
Reinforced

336
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,847
United States

337
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
I was not going to stop

338
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,711
And with the Zimmerman Note it was clear there also trying to promote attacks against

339
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
It's for my neighbor's which ended up

340
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
Justifying a declaration of war

341
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
The public arguments about the jester

342
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:07,231
Application for declaring war rarely mention the actual ships that were sunk in change Wilson

343
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
His cabinets mine

344
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,911
Instead they often revolved around the much sexier story of the British cruise ship that was sunk two years prior

345
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
That ship was never the reason

346
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
The United States got involved in the war

347
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,335
But because blowhard didn't really care about the loss of working-class wives

348
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,663
They use the Lusitania is a proxy to talk about the other ship

349
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
Misunderstanding

350
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,527
Is carried out through history to people who don't look too much into stuff

351
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:35,903
People like Alex Jones by The Victors 100% accurate

352
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,191
The Lusitania self is really controversial topic even to this day

353
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,799
It definitely does seem like a British government in particular was eager to cover up something

354
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
About that boat

355
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,175
The claim that you know what that thing is reflects a little bit of hubris

356
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:05,855
What are the things that they might have wanted to cover up is that the British knew that the u-20 was nearby and they didn't warn the

357
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:10,207
This is a hugely consequential decision Sensei put civilians

358
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
Is it risk but it happened because

359
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:16,607
The British have cracked German Naval code

360
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,191
But they couldn't give the commercial ship specifically

361
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
Tipping off the German

362
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
Some forthcoming about what happened

363
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
Effort

364
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
Protect room 40 from being a

365
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Exposed

366
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,295
There plenty of lingering Quest

367
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,391
Think about whether or not they were Munitions being transported on this boat full of civilians

368
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
If you look at all the

369
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Details

370
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:49,887
Making your boat full of non-combatants at Target is pretty unacceptable

371
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,007
If anything it was only used as a after-the-fact Justice

372
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Station 4

373
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,127
Because it was their Express purpose to be out at sea

374
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:09,087
I'm open to the idea that possible negligence led to the sinking of Lusitania book from all the information I have available

375
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,647
They don't seem sufficient evidence to claim any kind of

376
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,743
Conspiracy existed to have the boats sunk in order to get the United States into World War

377
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
That wasn't the result

378
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
The came from the sea

379
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,351
And the second one is absolutely

380
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,399
Completely in line with what the German U-boat

381
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
Campaign was doing at that time

382
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
They were at war with Britain

383
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
Britain is an island nation

384
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
They could be best

385
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,615
Defeated by aggressively isolating

386
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,967
Churchill had expressed a desire to increase neutral shipping traffic

387
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
Back to Britain in hopes of causing

388
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
The flare-up between

389
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,183
In the same way that he was super stoked that Pearl Harbor Got Back

390
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,559
Bring in more neutral Merchant

391
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Traffic again

392
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,447
Hope something happens. The problem is the Lusitania was not a neutral shipping

393
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:01,567
It was a British cruise ship that would have absolutely not been seen as neutral to the German

394
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,639
So whatever goal he hope to achieve from a US Merchant

395
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,943
Ship being attacked by Germany

396
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
So this one's not

397
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
This one doesn't work

398
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
Alex believes

399
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,184
Is the Lusitania sink a Glide to the start of World War I

400
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
So imprecisely Ortiz silver

401
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
I'm not tired

402
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
He's got another boat

403
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,776
You know the game started the Spanish-American War

404
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
In Spanish.

405
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Alright

406
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,576
Well Kaiser Wilhelm was actually on that way

407
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
So that's okay

408
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:53,280
He's not even in the midst of the USS Maine

409
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,072
Started the Spanish-American war sword

410
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
Sort of

411
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
Set some of the conditions

412
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
In place and was a

413
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Sparks

414
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,264
But use expressly wrong about everyone being off

415
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
The ship

416
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,616
The USS Maine had a crew of 355 man and when it blew up

417
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
250

418
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
The three of them were killed

419
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,712
With eight more dying later from their injury

420
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,808
There were 16 additional man injured leaving a total of 78 out of the

421
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,856
355 not injured or killed

422
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,440
And the survivors didn't survive because they were off the boat and they staged

423
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,000
Explosion happened at the

424
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
The front of the boat

425
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,328
And their quarters happened to be at the back section

426
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Complete lock

427
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
On February 1st

428
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
1898

429
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:39,104
Immediately debates flared up about what it caused the explosion with the results

430
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,712
Where

431
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
Dick Cheney

432
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
No he's cool

433
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,440
He's old but not that old

434
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:59,840
Others noted Roosevelt

435
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,168
Probably a mine that blew up the USA

436
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:12,128
In the immediate aftermath really arguing from a place based on evidence to push toward the result

437
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
Calmer heads didn't want the

438
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,528
It was trying to escalate and then people like Roosevelt were eager to start a war

439
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:24,672
Left to their own devices decide probably would have just argued between each other until the formal investigation have been done

440
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,488
And ultimately never have actually even happen

441
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,560
I base that assumption on the fact of President McKinley was

442
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,912
Not interested in declaring war investigations that have happened

443
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,960
So generally confirmed the it was an accident

444
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
In the 1890s though

445
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:46,688
There was a bit of a media Feud New York newspaper Market New York

446
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
Randolph Hearst

447
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,504
The New York Journal

448
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,904
Great everybody remember them super no similarities

449
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
Propaganda

450
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
0 Timberland

451
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:06,400
Not like each other and wanted to

452
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:10,496
The market

453
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,800
And how Sensational there news could be

454
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:17,152
They're competing in a profit-driven zero-sum game where the public were the pond

455
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,224
They found they were able to sell more papers if they were more

456
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
Sensational

457
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
Inflammatory headlines

458
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:27,392
Add frame to news stories and more creative ways whether or not those creative tellings of that

459
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
Depicted reality or not

460
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,024
They knew that if they built an air it isn't pushed it with enough vigor animotion

461
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
It would drive people to buy their product

462
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,912
I would work people up into an emotional fervor then you sell to him

463
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:45,312
It is not a business model weird all familiar with I believe

464
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:55,552
The setting of the main United States

465
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,880
Largely owing to evolving ideas about colonialism

466
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,440
Particularly surrounding an ocean of Cuban Independence

467
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,256
First and Pulitzer were both in favor Cuban

468
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,072
Independence

469
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Expressly

470
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:14,496
Revolutionaries

471
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,080
I mean even if you're in favor of the cause behind their actions

472
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
You can still see the

473
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:26,784
Promotion of is bad

474
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Yeah

475
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,392
They've been playing that game for a while and making a lot of money off it by the time the main

476
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:41,376
With no more information than the dogs in the government or the hawkish Teddy Roosevelt

477
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
Explicitly arguing this

478
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,800
Republic other papers pushed the slogan remember the Maine

479
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,128
I did everything they could to advocate for war with Spain

480
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,968
They did this partially because they were biased in favor of Cuban Independence

481
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,528
But more importantly because it raised their profit margin

482
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:05,696
Give me to secure and argue that her staff Pulitzer responsible for the outbreak of the Spanish-American War

483
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,256
Sucking a simplistic and.

484
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,400
But it would be equally stupid to not recognize the part they played was a piece of the puzzle that

485
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
They were massive propaganda Oregon

486
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,008
Making up stories in sensationalizing

487
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
Kernels of free stories

488
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,104
Intent on bending public opinion towards War

489
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
Alex didn't get Trump elected

490
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
But he did play a goddamn partner

491
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,528
Sure

492
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,576
Hurst

493
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,672
Exactly idea of a military intervention became more and more popular

494
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,256
Heartstrings and embellished

495
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
They never would have been able to start the war on their route

496
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,400
They needed influential people like Teddy Roosevelt the drama

497
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,448
Internally within the government

498
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
He's kind of a Jon Boat

499
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
Is that time

500
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,896
They are similarly no one ever would want John Bolton become president

501
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
To somebody younger

502
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,304
Do I remember a story of trump telling him to shave his moustache

503
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,704
Subsequent investigations most notably by Admiral Hyman G rickover

504
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,776
Conclusion

505
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,848
In the main use of a new type of coal

506
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,224
The ship has previously used anthracite coal but it just gets coal

507
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,552
Largely because that type of coal would be able to make ships

508
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Move faster

509
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,440
Unfortunately was also way more Coptic and prone to spontaneous

510
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,512
And this type of coal being present as well as the significant

511
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,072
Significant amounts of pyrite that were found

512
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,400
At least two strong indication that the ship suffered an accidental Kohl's

513
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,752
The absence of any external evidence of like penetration from the ship

514
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,568
Come outside

515
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,616
Who was hit by a projectile or a mine

516
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
They'll really just drank

517
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
That conclusion

518
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,968
The sinking of the Maine was not a false flag

519
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,576
It was a horrible accident opportunistically by Propaganda

520
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,160
Stop delivering stilted news in an emotionally compelling and dishonest way

521
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:17,024
I'm not doing the same thing here in the yellow journalism

522
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,168
But I'm single probably reason you'd rather called that a false-flag then examine the actual forces that were at play during the time

523
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,776
So you think he's got another vote

524
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,872
I remember specifically about this

525
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
Cuz I read the

526
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:39,040
Can't remember the drums of war the fog of War by Barbara

527
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,832
I keep thinking about that

528
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
The chicken hawk

529
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
We need to go to work

530
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
F****** hypocritical bulshit that

531
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
They're they're scary but the ones like

532
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:58,240
Teddy Roosevelt who are like

533
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,336
I want blood

534
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:07,968
Like Andrew Jackson just walking around just drinking f****** all the blood of the enemies that he's

535
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,016
Destroying your leg

536
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
Yeah cuz it's like oh it's

537
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,392
Crut talked to the people who are like like those chicken hawks

538
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:21,792
Describe

539
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,888
The escalation of like

540
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
Be careful

541
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,984
I just

542
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
You scare me

543
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,360
Of course this is

544
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
About

545
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
That he's going

546
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,272
And of course there's so many other famous Naval events the u.s.s. Liberty

547
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,768
So the u.s.s. Liberty

548
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,120
Anyone is unfamiliar with that on June 8th

549
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,448
Fired on an American

550
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
As it's not in the Mediterranean

551
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,104
It was in the middle of the Six-Day War

552
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
The US was a neutral party

553
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,712
And the ship was an international waters so there's really no just

554
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,736
Application for the

555
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,320
Israel said that they mistook the ship for an Egyptian war

556
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:23,744
Complicated conspiracy theories that I'll get into later in this Epic

557
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:30,656
Is it there's no possible reality have done what they did in order to try and trick

558
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
United States into war with each

559
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472
It'll be a bad eye

560
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:41,152
Say that pretty

561
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:46,528
Is there

562
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,856
And there wasn't any real cover-up or attempts to make it look like a jet

563
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Egyptian craft

564
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
Is there anything

565
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:58,048
There's no way that the us would have had that attack happen in Israel comes over as like sorry about that we met

566
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
And they decide alright let's attack

567
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,448
Alex believes that Israel's objective was to kill everyone on the Liberty

568
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,520
So there's no survivors and they could just say that Egypt

569
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,312
This doesn't make any sense

570
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,872
The airships were marked as Israeli

571
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,408
Anyone on board

572
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,736
The ship survived

573
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,040
There's any ship nearby that sell what happen

574
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
The whole plan will be bust

575
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:27,232
If they really were trying to set up Egypt they could have easily park there helicopters with Egyptian markers or just not head

576
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,584
One of the survivors testified that he could see the ships where is Wrigley

577
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
From 2000 yards away

578
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,448
Which I give them ample time to radio that Israel was attacking

579
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,288
Given the technology that existed at the time that eats party possess

580
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
He would have been in

581
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
Impossible for the signals

582
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
To be jammed

583
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,384
Coming out of the boat

584
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,784
How to distress call

585
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,320
Ended up being

586
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,928
I'm not going to pretend that the Israeli military hasn't definitely use false flag

587
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,744
Before like in the case the 1954 Lavon affair

588
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,840
This case it doesn't look like Alex's argument makes much sense

589
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,912
If only I knew where you was getting this information from

590
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:11,776
Well I believe it was maybe he'll bring it up later

591
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,336
Pretty sure the only reason Israel

592
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
Had the Six-Day War with two

593
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
Inspire app

594
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:23,040
I'm pretty sure that was why

595
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
Define song

596
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:31,488
I lied there's one more boat situation that Alex brings up with so far I think he's over 3

597
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
None of these

598
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:39,168
Seem like fall swags to me they're just complicated he would rather not deal with the realities of

599
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,264
And of course you've got

600
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,872
Show many other big events

601
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
There's the one

602
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
Bring it up

603
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:56,320
Vietnam I'm sure the headline news today Alex Jones says that the

604
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
I did not

605
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
I said that

606
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:14,240
Yeah I know it's weird

607
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,800
Be like maybe out Scott at this time

608
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,104
No the headlines would be

609
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,176
Alex Jones bucks tradition

610
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,344
I don't know it was just a dismissive

611
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,976
What happened to the Gulf of Tonkin

612
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,512
That was that on August 2nd

613
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
60 for the USS Maddox

614
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,608
Engaged with

615
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,192
Second confrontation

616
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
Which was just totally made

617
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,800
Also we lied about not having fired first

618
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
In the August 2nd

619
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,920
It was all definitely part of trying to get more directly involved in Vietnam

620
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,224
This is close enough for jazz on this

621
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,808
Right about this kind of makes

622
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
Things worse

623
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600
Here's what I mean

624
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:07,744
You would sound crazy and paranoid if you just insisted that everything was fake because he had one example from 55 years ago

625
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
Alex

626
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
Create the appearance of a

627
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:14,144
Pattern in order to justify thinking that everything could be a false

628
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,192
And that leads him to believe completely under

629
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,240
Lusitania

630
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,288
Call just to get into World War 1

631
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,616
Or that all the men were off the main when it was false

632
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,688
He has to think that those things are false to

633
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:30,016
Because the reality of the Gulf of Tonkin incident isn't enough

634
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
For him to just

635
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
Defy his stupid

636
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Way of

637
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136
And

638
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,928
Don't speak

639
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,864
The war but that's unsatisfying to Alex about the

640
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Books

641
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,936
Tons of books written about it

642
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:53,056
Ifucking McNamara has gone on record and interviewed about it

643
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Like

644
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,152
You don't get any f****** credit out of that but

645
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,432
Tell you what

646
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,248
Whatever one's off the main

647
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,552
It's just his way of making

648
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
Something sexier

649
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,856
And it's lame

650
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,160
That is one of those things

651
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
Every part

652
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,536
The real history of every part of the Vietnam War

653
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Is the most

654
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Horrific

655
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
Stability

656
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
That you can have like

657
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
That it was

658
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,216
Started

659
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,800
Set Nixon went by

660
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,592
Find lbj's back in order to

661
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
Keep the war going

662
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,920
For an extra couple years so I'll be Jake

663
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
Really

664
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
Fuct

665
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
Absolutely

666
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
Possible for anything

667
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,112
Sing like that to ever

668
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,792
Position that were in right now

669
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,584
Is Alex has a bunch of boats

670
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,336
Here's where we get to Alex

671
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,880
He starts to get closer and closer to saying it was real it around it

672
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
Large military equation

673
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
Roll the dice

674
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,936
Vacations

675
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,312
Still use it to push me into a larger War

676
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:35,456
Hezbollah Sleeper Cell

677
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,904
Nashville shooting down a couple of Iranian Special Ops

678
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,328
Talking about

679
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,352
Can chlorine in your

680
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
Forgot

681
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,400
C Unit Subway

682
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
Yeah

683
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,896
Down this road

684
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,432
False flag

685
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,528
What do you mean by that

686
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
As a false flag

687
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,416
Convince people to start a war with we might have to disentangle this

688
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,976
I think what he is expressing

689
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
Is it definitely did

690
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,120
Right and then now they're saying

691
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
To attack them so they can play the victim

692
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:32,544
So I mean

693
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,568
I don't know

694
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:40,224
Alex has nothing to base any of this allowed so it doesn't matter

695
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,344
The Trump doesn't like that kind of thing

696
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Nopales

697
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,584
But I'll talk to her in the room

698
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
Shrimp

699
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,472
Why does it matter the size of the room

700
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,336
Got out the dirty stuff

701
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
Trump told

702
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,808
The CIA

703
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,584
It's not but those items

704
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,168
Interesting kind of

705
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,728
Isn't interested

706
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,568
I'm the new sheriff in these parts

707
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,688
You might have said stop looking into my dirty

708
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:57,792
Cut up at 12:35

709
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
It's all nonsense

710
00:38:59,328 --> 00:38:59,840
But

711
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
You know

712
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,216
In a place

713
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,312
Driving doesn't know

714
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:15,456
He kind of wants to keep his options open here we're only about 10 minutes or so into the actual show

715
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,992
And he's still

716
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
You got this ambivalence

717
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
But

718
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:32,352
You got quote

719
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
What the boomers are

720
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
Unstable

721
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,360
You have a powerful military and they are crazy

722
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,968
You know you got this

723
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:53,600
You got Alex

724
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,648
What am I going to do

725
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
I been

726
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,696
Angie's on air

727
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
Light bulb

728
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,352
Flash is over his head

729
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,376
Is on its last leg

730
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
It's flickering

731
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,216
But he still considers it a memory and an idea

732
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
You remember

733
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
Something that

734
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
Evidence

735
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,360
Set the mullahs did the

736
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,944
I just remembered though

737
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,528
Ayatollah

738
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,112
Rock and roll over there

739
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,768
L l

740
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
Supreme leader

741
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,704
Vows to retaliate

742
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
Claire's

743
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,784
Charms

744
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
There

745
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,976
Around the world and that

746
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
Huge if true

747
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:13,216
So I looked

748
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,544
I looked all through presstv I looked all through Infowars

749
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,104
The closest I can find

750
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,152
Is Lidl close

751
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Maybe

752
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:27,040
Impress TV from February 13th 2019 were around valve

753
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,856
Against terrorist groups who attacked their guard troops

754
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,648
Until 27 of their soldiers

755
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
Yeah I'll give him

756
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,304
Play me some clothes to the time periodic to talk

757
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,264
Is an article on the Christian Science monitor

758
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,056
Pretty in favor of regime change

759
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:54,943
How the title at Battlefield 4 internal Wars

760
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,503
It's not that close though

761
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
You describing

762
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,343
I'm kind of at a loss

763
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,487
Doesn't pull up an article

764
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
The Iranian

765
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,559
Smashing Pumpkins cover band

766
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,631
The world is a Battlefield

767
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,471
No vampires

768
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,967
I mean I couldn't find any

769
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,247
That's just to be expect

770
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
At this point

771
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
Right after

772
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
Hubris

773
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,159
Sturms a little bit

774
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:44,351
Just pull up Iran's leader threatened to retaliate to us sanctions

775
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
A month ago

776
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,567
I wouldn't believe it when it was on the bottom of singing in

777
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
I meant to cover that

778
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,247
That's a big deal

779
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
Yeah just move the needle

780
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,647
Who is move the needle

781
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:14,047
So I couldn't I couldn't find Alex's talking about

782
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,095
Really helped you search for these words

783
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,887
Alex's Express

784
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,703
Closest thing I could find to the May 16th 2019

785
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
Nautical and MarketWatch

786
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,287
Which I do know Alex excited about the times

787
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,079
The past so it makes sense that he would have read it

788
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:31,455
The headline is Iran's foreign minister responds to unacceptable sanctions by the United

789
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,551
Foreign minister Mohammed

790
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,111
Threaten retaliation or does he just got soft

791
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:43,487
Those words only exist coming out of the mouth of Anwar gargash

792
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,559
Who is the Minister of Foreign Affairs

793
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:52,191
Against

794
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,775
Or does a Reuters article from a 26-20

795
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,591
16th that's reporting on something from presstv

796
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,943
The headline is quote Iran's Khomeini calls for vigilance against

797
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
West soft War

798
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:09,599
Starkel doesn't say a single word about Hezbollah or unleashing terrorists or any of the stuff Alex

799
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
The talking about

800
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
However

801
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,439
There was an article from May 19th

802
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
Android

803
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,255
We're Ayatollah Khomeini

804
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
There won't be any War

805
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,839
Biryani a nation of chosen the path of resistance

806
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,679
We don't speak of war and they don't either they know it's not their inter

807
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,055
I still do not know what he's talking about

808
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,335
I'm still

809
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,383
Somewhat at a loss

810
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
You know what the thing I learned

811
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
About

812
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,479
Mainly

813
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,551
The big takeaway for me with this story

814
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,831
What's up

815
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,903
It's wholly Khomeini Twitter account has a blue check

816
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,183
I don't think he's verify

817
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,743
It's all right I think

818
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:51,071
Because there were a couple of tweaks

819
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
Being like

820
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:56,959
Do this wasn't us I don't know what happened this is

821
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,519
Everybody was reporting on it like it was his ikaw

822
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
Stupid

823
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
I'm not saying it's not his

824
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:13,599
But I would also be totally I believe the world exists is not on Twitter

825
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:25,631
The guardian has a Twitter account

826
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,959
My brother

827
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:36,383
They were visiting

828
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,943
So why would he

829
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,647
Hey let's try and get Iran in the US

830
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,439
Stop starting

831
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:52,255
And then all the sudden a Japanese boat

832
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,911
Perfect time

833
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
So

834
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,335
Remembers that I can't find it all

835
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,359
Fairies

836
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
Alex

837
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,735
Remember some other details

838
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,271
Really gets him

839
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
2

840
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,391
Stepping close to the line of calling for war

841
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,559
To put pressure on Trump

842
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,911
A month ago to

843
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,215
Damn speech

844
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,543
I'm so used to false flags that

845
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
I hate you

846
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,295
Threatened

847
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,831
Everywhere

848
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:53,695
So he's decided to go

849
00:46:54,463 --> 00:47:00,607
April 22nd 2019

850
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
Ron put out

851
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:06,495
Specifically that they would close the Strait of Hormuz if they were prevented from using it

852
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,031
It's a conditional state

853
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:13,151
An absurdly high amount of the world's oil traffic runs through hormoz and Arantes

854
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,199
Control a large portion of that

855
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,271
Oman controls of a fair amount of it on the other side of the

856
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,831
Straight but if I were to be prevented

857
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:24,671
Confirm using it does make some sense if they would shut down

858
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
They're part of it

859
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:29,279
The threat being presented coming out of

860
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,351
Conditional statement about their own Waterway

861
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,911
It doesn't really seem all that out there

862
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:41,311
Close the Strait of Hormuz

863
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,615
What's going on in the prison

864
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
But that wasn't what they threatened to

865
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
To shutdown

866
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
Block traffic

867
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
Every other week

868
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087
There was always a threat

869
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Shutdown

870
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:59,999
Sports talk about in terms of threat

871
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,023
Anytime

872
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
But they were going to

873
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:06,911
Shut down the street

874
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
Flexiv movie

875
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:14,591
Ministrations clear strategy

876
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,359
Do with it

877
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,151
But they haven't done that yet

878
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,431
Instance

879
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,455
Of the tanker

880
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
Is not

881
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,807
Closings

882
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,831
So whatever Alex

883
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,791
Is not accurate at all this isn't an embarrassed

884
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
So absolutely

885
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,167
Alex has convinced himself

886
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:39,935
This is a rock

887
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,495
Really when I woke up this morning and heard that

888
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,103
In the Gulf

889
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,407
Right off the coast of Iran

890
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,711
I said are they really that crazy

891
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:59,135
Get started with a false flag where a country to blame

892
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,927
Nation they want to attack Iran

893
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:10,143
I'll go in the shop already

894
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:14,495
And then some us officials started

895
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,639
I was sitting here

896
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,687
Earlier

897
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
I don't need

898
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,831
Credit for this

899
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,623
4 months ago

900
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,439
Two months ago at about a month ago

901
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,095
I hate you so much

902
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,399
Iran is the

903
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,423
Suspect

904
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,495
And I ran

905
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,055
H2 taken

906
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,407
Options

907
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,479
The sabotage

908
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,503
Ships in the Gulf

909
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,319
That

910
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,463
Look like

911
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:12,863
Yeah real hard into this position which is

912
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,399
I mean

913
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:18,239
If it does end up being the case the Rhonda this is a I don't

914
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
I don't

915
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,847
It's possible that I have no idea

916
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:28,479
I mean the Alex is thinking it's still terrible conclusion is correct

917
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,575
This is real bad

918
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:39,999
Start talking directly to the heads of state of Iran

919
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,303
Crazy narcissistic

920
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,351
Announcement

921
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,519
What did Iran right now

922
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,543
I know what you're up to

923
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,079
Because you shut your mouth song

924
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:06,623
Price that's crazy

925
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,695
I mean it's bizarre that he actually thinks that like Khomeini

926
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,975
Watching Infowars

927
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:19,679
Where do you think

928
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,703
John bowne

929
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,727
Bayside

930
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,007
A great thinker

931
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:29,919
What are you talkin about in terms of the controlling the choices it's like no matter what

932
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,455
The choices you come out looking

933
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:35,551
Does

934
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,879
Gets into the primary source

935
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
Balthazar

936
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,767
Why do I know that because

937
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,559
Presstv

938
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,351
I've been on presstv

939
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,887
About a hundred times

940
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:54,751
I just got too tired I don't know I'm really young.

941
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:01,407
Susie's tires

942
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:05,503
I think you work for the government

943
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
I got it right here

944
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,559
They said they're going to do it

945
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:23,423
Revolutionary guard

946
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,727
Organization that was April 9th

947
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:32,639
So that's

948
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
Stop

949
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,759
An article about an article and presti

950
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,807
Alex would know this

951
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,343
Snapchat

952
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,183
Headline

953
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:50,303
Rcg warrants reciprocal action against US forces it labeled terrorist

954
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,375
Also the Articles from April 7th not April 9th

955
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:59,007
That's a little petty but

956
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,823
I read I read the real stuff

957
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:07,711
Google

958
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,063
Recipes in English

959
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,159
Blog

960
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,695
The website

961
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,719
I read a bunch of stuff on

962
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:25,119
The article doesn't

963
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,655
Decision to label virc

964
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,935
CG a terrorist organization

965
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,239
But you really have to look at it in the big picture

966
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:36,895
VG's branch of Iran's Armed Forces recognize terrorist group is really close to

967
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,663
Declaring war

968
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:42,271
Who be like is France decided to declare the u.s. Navy an enemy of their country

969
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,599
It's an incredibly hostile act from a geopolitical standpoint

970
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,903
For a country to respond by saying if you

971
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,719
Do that you're crossing the line

972
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,279
What's a normal response for a country to have

973
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,095
It's not unfair to look at what the Trump Administration

974
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
It is kind of beta

975
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,471
And also that article doesn't say that they're going to sink boats or activate sleeper cells

976
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,263
Oldest rap label them a terrorist organization

977
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:09,407
It specifically about putting an urgent motion through the government to label the US military personnel is Blacklist

978
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
The terrorist

979
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,711
Like the headline says

980
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,503
Reciprocal action

981
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,575
This first article that Alex is bringing up does nothing to prove it

982
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,159
It's all just misrepresented and you know how he is

983
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,719
Press tv article instead of

984
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,559
He's dumb

985
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,863
But he thinks he's cracked

986
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,631
Dakota

987
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
He thinks he's God

988
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:35,519
Yeah

989
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,359
Smart 26 yeah they went on

990
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,639
What's the guard about

991
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:53,695
Imelda Imelda

992
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,535
With zero evidence of anything

993
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,327
Just weird

994
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:03,167
Articles he kind of half remembers and never read to begin with

995
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,471
Vague

996
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,263
Conspiracy theories about boats

997
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,823
Yeah

998
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,407
Not too far into Alex's show

999
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,687
Axolotl

1000
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,503
At the beginning of this episode

1001
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:21,343
Yeah but it's important to recognize that came out of a gateway

1002
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,903
He did over the course of the first hour of his program

1003
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,951
Was talked himself into

1004
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:32,351
Getting to the point where he's doing like he's at a wrestling promo at the mullahs in Iran

1005
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,935
He's talked himself into that position

1006
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:39,007
Now that is not to say that that's where he's

1007
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
But

1008
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,591
That is something casting

1009
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,615
He is

1010
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,895
Reinforcing

1011
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,663
Defending

1012
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,223
And that's who stated line

1013
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:52,319
For now get some serious vacillating back and forth between

1014
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,087
Each position

1015
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,439
Not so much but we'll get some

1016
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,767
Okay

1017
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,535
You know

1018
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,071
What's going to happen is

1019
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:07,679
Is that if there's a war all these Hezbollah Irani and super cells are going to activate

1020
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,495
He's something good Alex's

1021
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,055
Right

1022
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:18,175
He brought up for a long time and that's why Google and Facebook and YouTube

1023
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,223
Because he talks about the Hezbollah

1024
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:30,463
15 million dollars

1025
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:35,071
Private outside groups

1026
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:46,591
The things was that I was talking about Iranian Sleeper Cell

1027
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,151
Because I laughed he's working with

1028
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,431
Say that again

1029
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:57,855
Years ago

1030
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,903
Beetle with the Democrats

1031
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,719
Help launder money

1032
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:08,095
Absolutely

1033
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
Sure

1034
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,495
I don't have much of a response

1035
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:18,591
That because I don't I can't take that seriously but I do want to say that every time

1036
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,383
He says I'm going to say it again

1037
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,431
I always think

1038
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:28,831
Cisco

1039
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:33,695
It really impedes my ability to listen to

1040
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:40,095
I just get James Brown in my head everytime I wanted to do that I want to do

1041
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,423
So bad this is our generation

1042
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,471
The three years

1043
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,287
Boulder

1044
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,383
What are the reasons are not going to respond to that

1045
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,687
Rank.

1046
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,831
Hip misrepresenting

1047
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,367
Some emails

1048
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,391
They got released

1049
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,975
Prove it anyway

1050
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:12,095
Is nonspecific

1051
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:15,423
Go fuc yourself

1052
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,263
Not necessarily not necessary to respond to especially because

1053
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,543
Next clip

1054
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:23,871
I'll explain about specifics of how this works

1055
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,407
And it's crazy

1056
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,711
Obama can give the order

1057
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,527
Your house

1058
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,463
Congressman

1059
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,655
I want everybody about this last year

1060
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
Asthma

1061
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,127
Have your house is listed that's why I told you

1062
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,711
Bible study

1063
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,991
Who's the real estate

1064
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,551
Course

1065
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,087
Carjacking

1066
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,135
Why not just shoot you in the head

1067
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:19,167
They believe

1068
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,727
Surrounded

1069
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,751
Embedded assassination

1070
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
Missouri City

1071
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
Okay

1072
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,127
So we got a we got Trump's embedded assassination team

1073
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,967
Are there sleeper.

1074
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,039
American Diner

1075
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:39,135
Otherwise because if it wasn't Bedlam already

1076
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:45,535
So is everybody here working for one of the other like

1077
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,679
This is a strange way to view the world

1078
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:55,263
Also recently two former state senators have been killed

1079
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
Conspiracy thing

1080
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,919
One of them is from

1081
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:07,807
Qanon folks lectured at to Hillary Clinton

1082
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,367
It's nice to see Alex resist that easy pass

1083
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,159
Will have

1084
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,719
If ever a much more challenging Narrative of

1085
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:21,119
Obama been in office

1086
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,167
Alex Jones is audience

1087
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:29,567
Direct path

1088
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,663
Alright got a lot of proving that you're making Alex

1089
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:38,527
Soda state senator from Arkansas

1090
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,087
Please put gag order on details

1091
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,879
Other than to say it was a murder

1092
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
Which isn't all that suspicious

1093
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,207
Considering she's a former state senator

1094
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:50,815
She lost the 2018 primary her death she was just privates

1095
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:54,911
But extend that courtesy to areas up like that I think is appropriate

1096
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,215
I don't think there's anything weird about that at all

1097
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:02,079
Last week 48 year-old Rebecca Lynn O'Donnell was arrested for Collins murder

1098
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:07,199
Active volunteer for Collins's campaign appears to have had a friendly relationship

1099
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:12,063
I'll wait until more information comes out on this to make a decision

1100
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,111
State Senate Celine type situation

1101
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:20,255
Either that or Hezbollah in MS-13 her employer

1102
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,535
Speedway might be the

1103
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,583
We'll see who else

1104
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,863
Go anywhere

1105
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,031
The other States senators from Oklahoma an officer since 2013

1106
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:37,663
Gunshot wound

1107
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,711
I don't think they're related

1108
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:44,575
Habitat

1109
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:48,671
He died from gunshot wound they have not been specific and labeling it as murder

1110
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,695
Instead

1111
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:52,255
Investigation

1112
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:55,839
It's really sad and I feel bad for everyone involved their families

1113
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:58,399
Community but we don't know anything about what

1114
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:05,311
Nichols could very well have committed suicide for all we know

1115
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,591
Do use their death is a

1116
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,383
The prop which is exactly what

1117
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,967
Because I like

1118
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,295
Well that's what I'm going to get a million phone calls

1119
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,111
Memories

1120
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,135
Prematurely

1121
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,927
But unfortunately because

1122
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,719
Movie toxic environment we all live in

1123
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,511
The absence of information is

1124
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,071
A conspiracy Worthy

1125
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,447
Bye-bye man I guess it's

1126
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,215
Just

1127
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:33,983
Be scared

1128
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:41,151
Do you understand

1129
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:49,855
Lisa didn't get cut off by the break I'll respect his timing on that

1130
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:56,255
Very rare instance of him timing out to commercial for a prelate

1131
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:00,607
Not a registered Democrat now because I don't want to be your

1132
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:04,959
Erroneously

1133
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,967
So everybody voted for

1134
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:22,623
Undoubtedly

1135
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
And that business

1136
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,511
This is making much more.

1137
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,535
Definitive statement

1138
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,935
Is overwhelming

1139
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
Revolutionary guard

1140
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:48,223
Around the world

1141
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:54,367
Misinterpreted

1142
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,391
Keep in mind

1143
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,951
Overwhelming

1144
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:03,327
There isn't anything that's different

1145
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
So

1146
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,167
We will block the Strait of Hormuz

1147
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,727
Akashi trillions of dollars

1148
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,591
You do it you didn't deny it

1149
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:18,175
So you can get the US

1150
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,295
Watercraft

1151
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,087
Our sailors

1152
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,903
Marcille

1153
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,719
That doesn't sound right

1154
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,535
Yes there's a long history

1155
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,095
The false flags and staged events

1156
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,935
No one's talking about how the Iranians know where

1157
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,495
April

1158
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:48,127
And in the subsequent months that they would do this and now it's happen

1159
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:51,199
He has no doubt

1160
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,807
Yeah that's quick note out

1161
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,951
We talkin about A-Rod detaining

1162
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,231
January 26th

1163
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:09,631
What is implying like it something's happening last Thursday

1164
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:16,287
Is completely dishonest manipulative the only reason someone

1165
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,639
There's no other reason to bring this into a modern conversation

1166
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,943
About what is unless you are

1167
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,223
Trying to

1168
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,015
Sway people in tubes

1169
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,319
Supporting war in Iraq

1170
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:32,927
In 2016 those US troops that are on detained international waters

1171
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:37,279
Navigation and entered Ronnie and territory

1172
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:42,399
I guess what John Kerry called up his errani and counterpart talked it out with a little bit of diplomacy

1173
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,215
And the sailors were released 15 hours later on harm

1174
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:50,847
This was a situation where our troops made a little mistake and it was a faux pas

1175
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:55,711
But because calmer heads were at the helm everyone is able to talk it over and recognized there was no harm

1176
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,735
No foul

1177
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:01,855
This will never happen again

1178
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
I mean

1179
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,183
Kind of situation

1180
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,743
Easily spiral out of control that people aren't

1181
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,071
Able to discuss things that people are treating each other with

1182
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,863
Respect and understanding that like

1183
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,983
Hey look I'm sorry I know that's your water and we're not we're not allowed to be there they made a mistake

1184
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,519
Their Compass was off

1185
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:25,919
Because if you did

1186
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,943
What kind of situation

1187
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:33,343
So good on you for the photos on an ounce

1188
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,367
Yeah so

1189
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,927
Yeah

1190
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,255
Search up yelling something stupid

1191
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,559
Trump tweeting us into war

1192
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,863
Or Alex

1193
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
Speculate

1194
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,935
Towards

1195
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,703
Republic

1196
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:52,543
You know what the only thing that I think we have going for us

1197
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,871
There's very few people who probably will be square

1198
01:06:56,383 --> 01:07:00,223
Rattles and tries to kill people

1199
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:02,015
Riled up towards

1200
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,087
Supporting award I don't know how much effect

1201
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,367
Um sell for

1202
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,927
Anymore

1203
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:12,767
Saving Grace

1204
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,559
Butter and

1205
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,583
Clear and compass

1206
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,375
Of the current Administration

1207
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,911
Combined with the fact

1208
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,447
Pretty sure most

1209
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
American dirt

1210
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,263
Dude we

1211
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,543
We played this song

1212
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,895
This is a

1213
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,943
The tune I don't need to hear any more Springs

1214
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,735
In this rest

1215
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,551
Baby constantly will be surprised

1216
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,599
Inability to learn

1217
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,391
Past mistakes

1218
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,671
So a

1219
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,951
Sparrow

1220
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,023
So in the next Cliff Alex gets pretty extreme

1221
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,559
Ecology starts wargaming

1222
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,095
What's going to happen

1223
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,167
So let's say that Iran

1224
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:55,519
Witchy is that he is enough and overwhelming evidence

1225
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
No.

1226
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,567
So what happens next

1227
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,639
Now let's talk about what comes next

1228
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,527
A couple more of these ships get blown up

1229
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,295
We have cookie

1230
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,855
You can bet your bottom dollar

1231
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,695
It's going to back a Saudi Arabian attack

1232
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,231
On Iranian

1233
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,511
Shipping lanes

1234
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,071
Iranian military targets

1235
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:22,399
I don't have a bunch of stealth bombers

1236
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,215
Thousand feet flyover

1237
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,287
2000 lb Bombs all over Iran

1238
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,311
That's a war crime

1239
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,479
5 minutes later

1240
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:40,575
Sleeper cells every

1241
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,231
And Shiite sleeper cells in Iran

1242
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,303
And Shiite sleeper cells

1243
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,631
And Shiites

1244
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:56,447
Country that Maxwell Trump Dodge

1245
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,495
To have

1246
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,775
Soft targets yet

1247
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,311
Moms

1248
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:05,151
Conditioning supply systems

1249
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,455
Iranian specialize in

1250
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:17,183
Machine gun

1251
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,487
Vehicle

1252
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,583
Houses down

1253
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,655
That sounds pretty bad

1254
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,679
That doesn't sound good

1255
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,983
Yourself

1256
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:36,383
What about it

1257
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:41,247
Is only there cutouts

1258
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,039
Professor type

1259
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:47,135
Child molester

1260
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,671
Seriously what

1261
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,535
Hezbollah

1262
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,887
13 hit squad

1263
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,215
People's houses

1264
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,943
Because the Democrats want

1265
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:15,551
When Iran

1266
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:19,135
Democrats are domestic farming

1267
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:25,791
Election with a foreign domestic

1268
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:32,447
Smooth grooves taking us out to break while Alex informs us that

1269
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,495
That over half of the country is

1270
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:41,407
Definitely

1271
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
You know II

1272
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,455
I always want to

1273
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
Questionnaire

1274
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,807
Is every major city

1275
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,391
Especially in the context of

1276
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,671
What is it

1277
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:59,071
Okay Rapids

1278
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
Strategic

1279
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,823
Multiple metropolitan areas like what about Pennsylvania

1280
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:16,223
Route for the Big 3 or do you go down to like read it

1281
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:20,063
Suburbs all just get along with Amanda

1282
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:24,415
What about the Twin Cities like

1283
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,231
What about Minneapolis

1284
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,839
Hezbollah hit the Quan

1285
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,863
MTV hits

1286
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:40,287
So this is all stupid

1287
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,567
To his narrative

1288
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,615
Starting to come together a little bit

1289
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,895
Are you starting to

1290
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,431
Acclimate

1291
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,711
To what he wants

1292
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,735
The idea

1293
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:55,903
I'm your host Alex Jones out the Iranian mullahs very very

1294
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:01,023
Work

1295
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,143
And Mary

1296
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,311
On their revolutionary guards it is the government

1297
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,359
They are the praetorian guard

1298
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,407
They are the mullahs

1299
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:22,015
They are the Shiite aristocracy the royalties

1300
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,807
Muhammad

1301
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:27,135
A Shiite group everywhere

1302
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,951
Military prepared for major terror attack

1303
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:36,863
Announcements

1304
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,983
Remember them closing the Strait of

1305
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:47,871
Clip is the point where Alex's narrative takes a turn towards Genesee

1306
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:54,783
All this stuff about a rattling completely opposed to everything Alex's ever pretended to

1307
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,343
Is that for sure

1308
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:01,695
However is that clip what he's presenting is another level of unaccepted

1309
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,487
Be as he sees it

1310
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:07,327
No big thing for Trump to take out the mullahs in Tehran in the war

1311
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,495
So it would be easy

1312
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:18,847
You'll be the easy thing for Trump to go ahead and win that war but there's a problem

1313
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,407
Iran has secret Hezbollah terrorist cells

1314
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:26,783
And literally every Western will respond to attack on

1315
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:30,623
I guess we'd have to do is preemptively lockup all the Irani it's just

1316
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,391
To be safe

1317
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:34,463
And just like that Alex has talked himself into the exact

1318
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,023
What are the more disgraceful chapters in our history

1319
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:40,095
When we put Japanese people because we were afraid of

1320
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,703
What are the reasons it so important to respond like to things like this

1321
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:51,103
Either way that's not my criticize me for being overly cautious

1322
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,383
I'm making a leap in logic

1323
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:55,967
I think it's important to understand how easy it is for this rhetoric

1324
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,991
To make that jump

1325
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,295
If Iran is wantonly attack

1326
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:05,951
And it would be easy for us to win the war if it weren't for the case that Iran and Hezbollah sleeper cells are in all the varsity

1327
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,231
It follows that the solution

1328
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
Alex Wood

1329
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,815
Proposed is rounding up all the Ronnie Anthony's West

1330
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,351
Sleeper cells

1331
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,631
Would be neutralized

1332
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:23,103
Considering we're keeping refugees in internment camps now

1333
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
Mixed up in

1334
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,943
The process about that

1335
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,991
And here's where it's worse than it sounds

1336
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:32,063
Because Alex isn't just talkin about a roni and you should be

1337
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:32,831
You scared of

1338
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,391
Dumping nerve gas out of the capitol

1339
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:42,047
Hope everybody enjoys

1340
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:46,143
Islam is Shiite

1341
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,471
Shiites from

1342
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,239
Country

1343
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,519
In the world

1344
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,079
Steve all purposely immigrated

1345
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:11,231
I know him off the air. That's a crime I know he's not like we need to round up Mosley

1346
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:15,583
Or whatever

1347
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,351
It's

1348
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,631
So close

1349
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
Yeah that's f***** up

1350
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:23,263
This is so close to a rationalization for the internment of Muslims

1351
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,543
Which is something we already

1352
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,591
Kind of know he's in favor of

1353
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:30,943
It's almost like he's using this crisis in order to fit into

1354
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,991
That already islamophobic worlds

1355
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,527
It's almost like a workaround

1356
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
He's doing

1357
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,975
Patient it's so it's

1358
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,999
So f***** up

1359
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,839
And what makes it even more f***** up is in this next clip

1360
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,399
Prefix concerned that things are going to escalate

1361
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,775
Biscuit bearing

1362
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,311
Easily escalate

1363
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:02,175
In fact it probably will you got right now

1364
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,271
No one is on the news

1365
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:11,391
Threatened to bomb ships

1366
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:14,463
If we put sanctions on them and they just did it

1367
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,023
They admit to it

1368
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:23,679
He's responding

1369
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,983
Articles

1370
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,663
I really really want

1371
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:36,479
Till I get these Muslims out of our country

1372
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,759
And I willing

1373
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,319
Into completely misrepresented

1374
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:46,207
Why aren't they

1375
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,487
Lie that I have

1376
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,791
Misremembered or am making up

1377
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,839
They never should have got rid of Ales

1378
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,119
It's insane to me man

1379
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,143
It's really insane

1380
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:58,751
The idea that he's like this is probably going to escalate as if it's like

1381
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,543
Lamenting

1382
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:02,847
And then in the same breath being like

1383
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:13,343
Because I Ron has sleeper cells everywhere

1384
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:21,791
We get away from Iran for a bit thankfully

1385
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,559
Take a little break

1386
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,447
Then I've got

1387
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:34,079
All around the country

1388
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,687
MS-13

1389
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,711
Really

1390
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:44,063
A video of that coming up with a new

1391
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,087
Sure

1392
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,647
Guess you heard me right

1393
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,951
Albatraoz

1394
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,487
Are the United States

1395
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,703
Hope you enjoy

1396
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,543
Alexandria

1397
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,615
Portage Park tennis Wilmington Ashley

1398
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,431
Really

1399
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,111
Who is

1400
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,391
She's a democratic social

1401
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:25,535
Mixed up all the time the hard-right it seems like

1402
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:32,191
She didn't say anything about a violent overthrow or anything about putting people in camps or with organ with Hezbollah

1403
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:35,263
There's a clip of talk about how capitalism is failing

1404
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,287
And we need to do something

1405
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:40,895
And believes in his community ownership of land resources labor etcetera

1406
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:44,479
Alex wants to make a cogent argument against that position fine I'll listen

1407
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:53,183
I don't have the energy to respond to that dumb s***

1408
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:04,959
It should be pointed out that The Daily Beast reported last week that Trump is planning on housing 1400 detained immigrant children at 4

1409
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,239
Still in Oklahoma

1410
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,287
That's pretty shocking inoffensive to beep

1411
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,335
People particularly older Japanese-American

1412
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,383
Because Fort Sill is one of the camps where they

1413
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,687
We're held during World War II

1414
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:20,575
I know that every day brings a new Alex Jones related horror and every day there's something new that directly contradict

1415
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,367
One of his long-standing position

1416
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,415
This is profound Lee disgusting

1417
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:31,071
All he ever did in his career was yelled by the federal government because they were

1418
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:31,839
The New World Order

1419
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:36,959
Now we have a federal government locking up children these f****** Stylin supports

1420
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,543
I remember back when we were covering the 2009 episodes

1421
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:44,127
Huge deal out of the idea that Obama was reopening

1422
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:46,943
Where Japanese-Americans were held during World War II

1423
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,015
This was the next step towards

1424
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:53,343
Opening the campus Museum

1425
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:57,439
As a memorial to remind us what this country did when we let fear overwhelm us

1426
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,743
Reminder is dead

1427
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:04,351
Trump is doing exactly what Alex lied about Obama doing and Alex doesn't say s***

1428
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,655
But all the Democratic Socialist

1429
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,215
Capitalism is necessarily exploitative

1430
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,007
She's the one who wants to put you in a can

1431
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,799
Not Alex's f****** hero

1432
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,336
Is literally doing that right

1433
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:18,688
She must have had a really good platform otherwise for her

1434
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,832
But also

1435
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,880
Healthcare for all

1436
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:33,280
What kind of like overcompensation would you need to do to go around Denver wandering around 4

1437
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,072
City council position be like

1438
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:41,472
Not by the way knock knock with MS-13

1439
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,944
Elevator pitch

1440
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:54,016
Also community garden

1441
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,904
You know what I think that's the part

1442
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,928
If it's really offensive

1443
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:04,256
Just a little bit racist

1444
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:08,352
It's all about cauliflower

1445
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,656
I just think this is like

1446
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:11,424
Particularly

1447
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,752
Disgusting every time we see something or Alex

1448
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,800
Flips on one of his old position

1449
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,896
Of course you're a hypocrite

1450
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,968
But something like this

1451
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:30,368
It is like I would only know that Alex yelled about Obama opening these camps

1452
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:34,208
Alex

1453
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,024
Do you have Trump opening up

1454
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,096
You know using these places

1455
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,400
Where Japanese-Americans were held

1456
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:44,192
To house immigrants that are being

1457
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,984
What is the

1458
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:49,824
Why would you yell about Obama doing it and not now

1459
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,360
Why we know why

1460
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,408
I think we know why Alex

1461
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,200
I think what would be a fascinating

1462
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:00,832
If if you were running and if you're going for a historic

1463
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
I would wonder

1464
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:03,904
How much

1465
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,440
Of the right-wing

1466
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,208
Character is a

1467
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,280
As Obama of Obama

1468
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:14,144
Dictator who is destroying your life actually wind up getting the right wing

1469
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,168
Comfortable with

1470
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:20,288
They're actually being what I'm saying like if you spent the last eight years old

1471
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,104
If you know the difference yet

1472
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,176
You know it's just that now he's working on your side

1473
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,200
Yeah that is interesting

1474
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,248
Brilliant

1475
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,016
Interesting idea

1476
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,320
I think it's probably a bit of it

1477
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:38,720
Cool that's a bummer

1478
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,000
Alex gets on to

1479
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:40,768
You know

1480
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,840
We heard him drunkenly talked about how I eat

1481
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:46,656
Woman RH daughter is 4:30 father

1482
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:49,728
Any song is half his mother and there is no sex

1483
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,080
Unfortunately he is

1484
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:58,176
Strongly against the lgbtq

1485
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:04,832
Hands clap

1486
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:08,928
That is fine

1487
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:13,792
You forgot protect

1488
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:14,560
Children

1489
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:18,400
And future Generations in this nation

1490
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:24,288
Throughout history there have been that form inside different

1491
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,568
Civilizations

1492
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:30,176
They're obsessed with sex with children

1493
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,248
Chats with sacrificing children

1494
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,320
In the world

1495
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:43,232
You will find

1496
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:47,072
Having sex with children

1497
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,376
And then

1498
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,728
Cool

1499
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:57,824
Now the vehicle used today for all of this is

1500
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,616
Lgbtq

1501
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,920
Q x y z

1502
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:02,944
F*** you

1503
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,880
I got is The Bachelorette

1504
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:17,536
Because

1505
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:20,352
Tax on the income and I also

1506
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:24,192
The vehicle for exactly

1507
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,984
Is the lgbtq

1508
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,752
Community

1509
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:30,336
What are you doing like what are you saying

1510
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:33,152
Aztec facts

1511
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,224
To save Aztec civilization from falling

1512
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,760
If you knew what to do.

1513
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,040
Takeout

1514
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,368
Tell me what isn't that kind of implied in there

1515
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:46,208
Be a hero for the western civilization that's going to be destroyed

1516
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,704
Did I just pick that mean

1517
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,752
Rank bigotry

1518
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:03,360
It's rank bigotry masquerading as historical insight

1519
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,408
It's just it's just disgusting

1520
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:08,992
I can't I can't think of any group that

1521
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,528
Black what is he missing

1522
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:14,368
I suppose I do too much about like

1523
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,904
East Indian

1524
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:20,000
Yeah like people from India

1525
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,024
The Japanese

1526
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,048
I think he likes them

1527
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,328
Yeah I don't

1528
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,888
Usually

1529
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,936
Just now too so he's probably on their tip

1530
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,984
Do you know what else

1531
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:35,360
You know that's a little bit of an argument he had some

1532
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:39,712
Bad words to say about the Australian

1533
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,552
Like non-white population

1534
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:46,624
To be pretty okay

1535
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,392
His book

1536
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,352
Hey we're going to weather this f****** storm

1537
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,656
Pretend Trump is a cool dude

1538
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,680
Everybody be quiet

1539
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,448
Will get past

1540
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,216
Sit on the other side

1541
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,032
Indian

1542
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:06,080
People

1543
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,616
Japanese

1544
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:10,176
Be all that might be

1545
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,016
Yeah

1546
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,672
It's not a pic of what group

1547
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,488
That's probably about

1548
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,632
Specific

1549
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,936
The lgbtq community is up to

1550
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,216
And this one

1551
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,752
Is a punk

1552
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,968
For the shoes

1553
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:49,856
You get to get out of class and it's encouraged and go to the game

1554
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:57,536
Michigan

1555
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:02,912
Are you sure it wasn't

1556
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:06,496
I was walking across the street to Segovia restaurant

1557
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,408
Pride

1558
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,320
Broadcast

1559
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:24,672
Glad

1560
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,720
Rashes

1561
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:30,816
Is pedophilia

1562
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:34,656
Took whatever

1563
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:39,008
First of all I'm going to guess that I was a story about seeing gay men having sex is embellished

1564
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:42,080
Quite a bit I bet he saw two guys kissing was scarred by it

1565
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:47,200
Chicago

1566
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,784
Never seen outright public sex celebration

1567
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,856
I believe some people might be f****** an hourly

1568
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:57,440
Wandering around seems like more risk than it's worth

1569
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,912
It's not like it's a gay or pricing

1570
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,960
People sometimes f****** alleys

1571
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:15,360
It's shocking to carry on

1572
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,896
And I was I was like

1573
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:26,112
Hello hello

1574
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:30,464
Super common but I have definitely

1575
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,512
We are definitely walk past people f****** and

1576
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:36,096
Just on Halsted

1577
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:41,728
I'm right.

1578
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:48,384
Probably

1579
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,992
The article that I was covering as of course

1580
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:56,576
It's using an Austin american-statesman article is a

1581
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,880
Complain that the Austin Independent School District

1582
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,904
Does using some fun

1583
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,952
To quote boost student involvement

1584
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:07,072
Alex is really interest

1585
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,912
The school district has its properties

1586
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,448
Two churches who hold their service

1587
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:17,568
It's really common thing a lot of parts of the country and honestly I don't think that's even really a big deal

1588
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:23,456
The Comedy Club in Columbia Missouri that I used to perform at rented out their church on Sunday

1589
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:27,296
I think it's the sort of thing that could be really Mutual better

1590
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:29,344
An arrangement in a lot of cases

1591
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:31,392
I do support the separation of comet

1592
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:39,072
In this case however one of the churches who rent it at the Performing Arts Center in Austin was a church called the Celebration Church

1593
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:42,400
Which priest a pretty anti-lgbtq version of

1594
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:47,008
They likened homosexuality to bestiality in as much as their abomination

1595
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,032
Cicadas forbidden

1596
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:53,152
Naturally lgbtq activists were not super thrilled at the church renting out School District

1597
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,176
Workspace and protest

1598
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:01,088
The Texas Attorney General against the First Amendment for the school district

1599
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:03,136
The government to discriminate against

1600
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,672
The church based on their religion

1601
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,976
Complicated thing for the district

1602
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:07,744
Stop renting

1603
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,792
Space space

1604
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
Two other people

1605
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:13,632
In an attempt to find a solution everyone can live with

1606
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:15,424
Lgbtq advocate

1607
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:20,288
Suggested that the church was going to remain able to use School District

1608
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:22,336
Then some of that money raised should be redirect

1609
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,360
To towards initiatives that's

1610
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,128
Supported LGB

1611
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,408
Q students and staff

1612
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,736
The school board said for sure that's a great solution

1613
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,272
Here's why

1614
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:34,112
The school district has raised

1615
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:37,184
180 $2,000 from renting out their spaces

1616
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,512
And they're setting aside $10,000 for lgbtq students

1617
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,864
172,000.

1618
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:45,888
Do use for

1619
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:50,496
It's really a win-win solution for everyone including the Celebration Church

1620
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:52,288
Everybody wins

1621
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,616
Nothing in the story mentions anything about the ages of the students

1622
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:57,408
It's involved in the being busted

1623
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,688
Ryder

1624
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,992
Austin Independent School District

1625
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:04,320
Includes schools covering Pre-K to high school

1626
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:10,720
Because it's a school that they can't even if it's anybody without parental permission slip

1627
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,816
Probably have to come up with them

1628
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,376
Fourth graders

1629
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:20,960
Ten-year-olds to Pride on their own without parental permission

1630
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,240
Guardian

1631
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,288
Impart that $10,000 is

1632
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,336
Protection it's like you know

1633
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,360
You can't take

1634
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,128
Kids

1635
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:35,040
You can take kids to the Saint Patrick's Day parade for school thing without chaperones insecurities

1636
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:38,880
Examples

1637
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:42,976
Play 100%

1638
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:47,072
There's nothing suspicious or weird here this isn't Austin School District realize

1639
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:49,120
They made money off renting outer space

1640
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,168
To a group it's offensive to the lgbtq

1641
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:54,496
VQ Community but he's also group they can't kick out without causing a

1642
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,776
Huge legal battle

1643
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:59,872
Play disciples make a symbolic gesture of support

1644
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:01,664
To participate in Pride

1645
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:08,320
Is Austin is enough that's probably

1646
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:12,928
The fitting headline Celebration Church

1647
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,696
Atq causes

1648
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:18,048
So I don't know if this is a lot of

1649
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,328
Alex

1650
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,120
Yard work with that what you has

1651
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,936
And what Alex does have is a gift for impression

1652
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,472
Oh God

1653
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:28,032
I think I might have been a little bit

1654
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:30,848
Capricious earlier saying Alex doesn't do anything

1655
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:31,616
Against

1656
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:38,272
Cuz I pick you might do an Indian operation

1657
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,552
Asian is in the mix

1658
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:42,368
I think you might hit Indians

1659
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:48,512
Pan-Asian like I'll just put it on

1660
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,816
He's more of a shotgun

1661
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:56,960
When it comes to racist Impressions sniper rifle

1662
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,240
But I know it's not good

1663
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,680
Yikes

1664
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:33,312
The PC police coming down on people who do clunky hockey racism

1665
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:39,712
Yeah it's it's it's not said because I would not have

1666
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:45,600
Yeah it was no idea what he was trying to do and then he said it was Indiana's like that's just a bad accident

1667
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,624
Major races

1668
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,512
Defensiveness on his part in the present day

1669
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:57,120
Never leave that aside that was just a little bit of a

1670
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,144
I don't look

1671
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,168
I mean okay

1672
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:01,472
If I did something offensive

1673
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,264
And I was really bad at it

1674
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,800
I wouldn't insist on

1675
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,336
Continuing to do it just

1676
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:09,920
Because people were offended by

1677
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:16,320
Looking great at it continue to do something

1678
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,136
Just the worst at impressions

1679
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,160
Terrible

1680
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,232
Academy in level skills

1681
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,024
He was a mimic

1682
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:31,424
And he was like why won't people

1683
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,192
Call Alex Jones

1684
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:32,960
What's ridiculous

1685
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:36,288
Alex is desperate for fun

1686
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:44,736
We don't even the middle of the plug that opposed to being caught off guard by the pivot

1687
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,528
Something else

1688
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:52,160
Free Bonneville / 12

1689
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:58,304
You the best deal we've ever offered if you're if you're keeping track

1690
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,864
8 pack power stack is 50% off

1691
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,144
And you get a bottle of alter

1692
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,168
For 12 for free

1693
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,704
This is we a need

1694
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
To move the

1695
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:12,640
I promise I'm only running until

1696
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:13,920
Next Friday

1697
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:16,992
Because we probably shall have her all the 12

1698
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,344
Until that point

1699
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:24,416
Show me water bottle for 12

1700
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:27,488
There's other people chances to get it for free

1701
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,768
4life.com

1702
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,304
Okay

1703
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:36,704
ITube

1704
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:47,456
Pointless conversation on the phone at the audio terrible

1705
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,016
Kohl's coupons but also except

1706
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,952
The other shirts

1707
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,472
Also

1708
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,776
I think you might do better if you

1709
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,824
Exude

1710
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,616
Yeah don't

1711
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,384
Say like

1712
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,480
So this is 50% off and you get something else with it

1713
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,528
3 bottles for the price of one

1714
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:25,088
Don't do that I remember

1715
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:30,208
Tire play in movie about how being desperate and a sad fact does not help you sell things

1716
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,792
So here's the last clip from 13

1717
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:36,608
And Alex

1718
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:39,936
About his

1719
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:40,960
The case with a rock

1720
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:47,104
We're getting calls we're getting messages

1721
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:56,832
Where we

1722
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:59,648
Think I shouldn't

1723
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:14,752
Do something

1724
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,504
Also by the way

1725
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,600
Completely forgot about Ebola

1726
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:32,672
Iran's doing something opal is next week

1727
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:39,072
Leaving aside the fact misrepresent border on

1728
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:41,888
Alex Jones is really just accidentally

1729
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:43,168
Himself into a corner that

1730
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,192
If he's not careful

1731
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,472
This is going to undo

1732
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:46,752
Most of his career

1733
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:51,872
If you're listening to his justification for why he believes that this was a real attack in not a false flag

1734
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:54,688
It all boils down to the fact that Iran said they were going

1735
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,968
How to do X action

1736
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:57,248
FedEx

1737
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,344
That's all good and well

1738
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:07,744
If someone threatens to do something and then that thing happens it's generally a good idea to start your investigation by checking on the person who

1739
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,768
Who made that threat

1740
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:13,632
But Alex isn't starting his investigation they're ending his investigation

1741
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:17,216
They said they were going to do it therefore it's not a false flag

1742
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:23,616
If you apply that logic to the broader spectrum of the things out a career literally everything falls apart

1743
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:28,992
One of the biggest career-making issues for him was the argument that 9/11 was a false flag

1744
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:32,832
If you use this investigative technique is currently using about a run

1745
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:39,232
You should have immediately come to the conclusion that Bin Laden carried out that attack

1746
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,256
Threatening that

1747
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:46,912
Same building in April 2001 Ahmad Shah massoud of the Northern Alliance warned that a large-scale attack

1748
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,752
That information

1749
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:53,056
Presidential

1750
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,336
What the headline bin Laden

1751
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,872
Determined to strike us

1752
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,408
Intention

1753
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:59,712
Clear before the attack.

1754
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:03,808
Alex Jones

1755
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:08,928
It was set up at the Oklahoma City bombing was a false flag meant to demonize The Patriot

1756
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,232
Put tons of people have testified to the fact

1757
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,280
Timothy McVeigh was going around discussing

1758
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:17,632
Threatening letters to the ATF

1759
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:19,168
Before putting his plans into action

1760
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,960
By Alex metric

1761
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,520
Timothy McVeigh threatened to bomb the Federal Building

1762
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,056
That a federal building

1763
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,592
Dear God

1764
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,688
Purple Swag either

1765
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,088
I could go on and on without slippery the way Alex

1766
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,208
An attack on a ship

1767
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:47,328
Is his impression that they said that

1768
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,608
We're going to do something like this

1769
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:49,632
The new processes

1770
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,656
Completely shattered

1771
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:52,960
I know that I can bring this up a lot but I think

1772
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:54,240
Essential to understand

1773
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:56,800
Accusations of false flags are almost

1774
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,336
Never sincere

1775
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:01,152
False flag has become a rhetorical weapon

1776
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:05,760
Accusations of false Flags the weapon that could be wielded both offensively and defense

1777
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:09,088
Obviously we know that Alex uses

1778
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,648
Type arguments to deny that people like him

1779
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,696
Could possibly ever commit a crime

1780
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:16,000
But the alternative this one wasn't

1781
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:20,096
Is used as an offensive weapon against before Alex wants targeted

1782
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:24,192
Anytime a Muslim or immigrant hurt somebody that's definitely not

1783
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,008
Because

1784
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:27,776
Those people

1785
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:31,104
So their crimes are all definitely real. Definitely happen

1786
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,896
In this case with a Ron

1787
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,176
Alex's meal ticket

1788
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:40,576
Trump wants to attack Iran

1789
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,600
Occasion

1790
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:44,416
It was a false flag is not a good

1791
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,952
It's not something that you can do

1792
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:46,976
Kind of feel out

1793
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,000
It's not something that you could do

1794
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,304
Terman for water too coincidental detail

1795
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:53,376
That's disrespectful reality and research

1796
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,936
Bowflex definitely do exist

1797
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:57,216
But my senses are there

1798
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,240
Steven Lee rare

1799
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:00,544
And they are it's not just an explanation

1800
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,568
For everything that's pink

1801
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,848
Convenient for your worldview

1802
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:08,736
The mythology of the false flag is something that allows certain certain subset of bad thinkers and Bad Axe

1803
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,272
The hijack reality

1804
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:15,136
False flags have existed in the history of the world

1805
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:19,232
And extrapolate that out to imply that it means that everything is possible

1806
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,816
Once you internalize that idea events are no longer

1807
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:25,120
The pieces of a story that's being told

1808
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,656
Everything needs to fit

1809
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:27,424
With that story

1810
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,960
You believe

1811
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:35,616
Alex believes the government is evil and militia Patriots are always good

1812
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,640
It's imperative

1813
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:38,176
To find a way to make what happened

1814
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:39,968
Set the store you're already telling

1815
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:40,992
This event

1816
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,296
To threaten

1817
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,064
Sabina pants

1818
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:46,112
Before you know it everything set

1819
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,648
You have now made the story

1820
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:51,744
The government looks even in the militia Patriots look even more good

1821
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,792
This is all false Wagner

1822
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,584
There a crutch

1823
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,144
He uses to hobble his broken down there it is along

1824
01:41:59,424 --> 01:41:59,936
It's packaged in the

1825
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:01,216
The sexiest of wrapping paper

1826
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:03,520
The wrapping paper that just says what

1827
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:05,056
Over and over and over and over

1828
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,848
So what I'm saying is it

1829
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:07,616
Who's my boy

1830
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,408
Be skeptical

1831
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,480
What's the question

1832
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,296
But for your sake and

1833
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,064
Publix

1834
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:19,648
Don't start from a position of most things are probably fake

1835
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:21,184
I've been trying to work backwards

1836
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,976
Then try and justify your suspension

1837
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,000
That is

1838
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,280
Psychosis but Alex

1839
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,048
Discount Tire

1840
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,608
In those Sandy Hook depositions that everyone took

1841
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:31,424
What weed

1842
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,472
Kind of trap

1843
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,264
So I

1844
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,568
Just the longer longer we do this

1845
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:38,336
Amore

1846
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:40,128
Read and understand

1847
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,944
The more just becomes clear that this is not a sin

1848
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:43,712
Sphere

1849
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:45,504
Belief system is not

1850
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,528
What's your worldview

1851
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:47,296
It's a tax

1852
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:49,600
Circle and I don't know how conscious that is

1853
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,416
I think there may be a piece

1854
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,184
It is

1855
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:54,976
But I think it might just be

1856
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:56,768
He's done it for so long

1857
01:42:57,024 --> 01:43:00,864
Ingrate

1858
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,272
Like paying but just like

1859
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:25,696
A certain extent you probably was trained

1860
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:26,720
Along these lines

1861
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:32,864
Predecessor

1862
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,888
Where's the people who

1863
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:36,960
We're his intellectual

1864
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,752
Probably

1865
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:40,288
Functioned along the same lines

1866
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:42,592
Terribly

1867
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,992
These justifications are these bad

1868
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,272
So I don't

1869
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,600
I don't know I think it's probably just the mindset that he got into

1870
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:55,904
Never grew out of

1871
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,976
Event with like 911 seems like a real outlier

1872
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,256
Because it doesn't really makes

1873
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,048
Yeah in terms of this

1874
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,632
The path of

1875
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:08,960
Jism

1876
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:11,520
Demonizing groups he doesn't

1877
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:14,336
You could say that it's demonizing

1878
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,360
Bush

1879
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,384
Anthony

1880
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,664
You can make that are

1881
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,456
There's a possibility there

1882
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:22,784
But I think the reason for the outlier is he idolized Bill Cooper

1883
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,576
And he was ripping off Bill Cooper

1884
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,600
Eddie Duran

1885
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,648
Yeah I think that one makes sense

1886
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:30,720
If you look at it as an isolated case Within

1887
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:34,816
You can see how even though it doesn't fit

1888
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:36,096
It's still face

1889
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:40,448
I mean at the same time you could just see it as such a large event

1890
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,008
Stats in the immediate after

1891
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,288
Nobody

1892
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,824
How to process

1893
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:46,848
Tripped

1894
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:49,152
To that one because

1895
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:51,712
Well I would say Vicky predicted 9/11

1896
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:56,320
Because he was ripping off Bill Cooper and of course you're going to run

1897
01:44:56,576 --> 01:45:00,672
Okay Behavior after-the-fact make Sprite

1898
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:02,976
He's like I forgot that theoretically pretty

1899
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:10,144
How do you not try and make the most

1900
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,960
It is obviously

1901
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:17,056
A ripping off of Bill Cooper

1902
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:17,824
Piece of s***

1903
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:22,688
I don't know I think it I think it's still fit I think the broad picture of using

1904
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:24,736
False flags of the rhetorical weapon

1905
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,784
Both authentic pensively

1906
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,088
To protect your world narratives

1907
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,368
That you wish to tell

1908
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,904
I think it makes total sense

1909
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,208
9-11 flight outlier but that's why I think it's

1910
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,792
So we get done with the 13th

1911
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:41,120
Who takes very clear perspective

1912
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:47,008
Bollocks,

1913
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:49,824
I mean it just seemed like even if I rent

1914
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,384
So

1915
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:58,784
Analysis may not be that far off it could be the wrong reasons Wells is always off

1916
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,088
You takes

1917
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,880
E-juice home I guess

1918
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:07,488
They got a bunch of calls

1919
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,768
People who were like

1920
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:12,352
What the f***

1921
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,120
Yeah that makes

1922
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:16,704
Perfect because as soon as he gets back on air on the 14th

1923
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,984
Is Tunis a little

1924
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:22,592
I want to get into the latest

1925
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:26,176
The push for full for

1926
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:36,928
Largest

1927
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:40,000
Normally

1928
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:43,584
Able to suss out who's behind

1929
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:46,912
Cloudy and really foggy

1930
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:51,776
I got to take a step back

1931
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:57,152
Get over here on this phone

1932
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:09,952
I don't know what's going on

1933
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:15,072
I had evidence

1934
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,192
What possibly could shake

1935
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,008
Your confidence the next day

1936
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:26,336
Exist on the 14th

1937
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,360
Whatever

1938
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,896
Such such stupid

1939
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,688
Such backtracking.

1940
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:35,040
Pictures of what he does

1941
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,576
With the Iran narrative

1942
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,856
Its soda mods

1943
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:38,880
Sturtevant house stupid

1944
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:42,720
I will talk about it

1945
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:45,792
Waffle

1946
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:48,096
The little bit

1947
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:50,912
Gets off the wrong picture and

1948
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:51,936
Gets back to just

1949
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:52,704
Define

1950
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,496
Zach Boats were false flag

1951
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:55,520
Sinbad

1952
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:58,336
And I told you to get a little bit more to the u.s.s. Liberty

1953
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:01,152
Because he brings it back up here

1954
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:03,712
And we specifically find out where he got some of this

1955
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,464
Watching

1956
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,768
Doesn't sound like

1957
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:22,400
The dumbass white supremacy

1958
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:24,960
Covering for Israel

1959
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,752
I'm reporting history

1960
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:27,776
Just because

1961
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:28,544
LBJ

1962
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,104
Israel's okay and

1963
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:32,640
Government

1964
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:40,064
The logic is just incredible I had for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on before he died

1965
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,600
2 weeks before he died

1966
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:44,160
He had heart failure his brain was all there

1967
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:45,696
Let it all out on there

1968
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:52,352
I got him on by news

1969
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:58,496
16 years after the fact

1970
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,056
Detail City game

1971
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:10,528
More

1972
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,320
Really hate to hear something like this

1973
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:16,416
S'more is literally the commander-in-chief of the Pacific

1974
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:18,976
Incident

1975
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:24,864
Incident was a false flag salute

1976
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:28,192
100% commander-in-chief of the

1977
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:30,240
Pacific Fleet during the Gulf of Tonkin

1978
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:32,288
Yeah that seems like he would have at least

1979
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:34,336
Do you know what's up

1980
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:36,896
Or the fact that he was in that position

1981
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:39,200
The fact that he was the chief of Naval operations

1982
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,736
For most of the Vietnam War

1983
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:43,808
Villain

1984
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:44,832
Analysis world

1985
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:52,768
Yoki could be used by Alex to reference about how the u.s.s. Liberty was a false flag but mysteriously doesn't

1986
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:54,816
Weird

1987
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:59,936
Thomas More was the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1970 to 1970

1988
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:01,472
Before any other resume full of him

1989
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,752
Impressive titles on paper

1990
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:07,360
However if I interviewed him right before he died he would have been 91 years old

1991
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:13,504
But even assuming his brain was all there the best-case scenario for someone in failing Health was born in 1912

1992
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,040
Is generally not so great

1993
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:21,184
At the time of the u.s.s. Liberty attack more was just beginning his three-year stint as the chief of Naval operations

1994
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:24,256
After having already served 34 years

1995
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,024
Send that in the service

1996
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:26,816
It was 3 years

1997
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:27,584
The Gulf of Tonkin

1998
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:34,752
Give me the pilot in World War II need received the Purple Heart as a result of his plane being shot down by a Japanese attack

1999
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:37,824
He survived the crash and was rescued by an Australian ship

2000
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,360
Which was that stopped by the Japanese

2001
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:42,688
Have you tried to survive in a Lifeboat

2002
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,712
And water

2003
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,528
Later in life you testify before Congress

2004
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:49,600
About the need to provide adequate machinery

2005
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:51,904
Since the cause of his crash was that a bullet hits

2006
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,184
The unarmored fuel tank

2007
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:53,952
Is playing

2008
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:55,232
Reply to suggestion

2009
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:57,536
Providing Extra Protection with a waste of money

2010
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,096
That perspective quote is great

2011
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:02,144
Until you're in the sea and someone is shooting at

2012
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:03,680
You got a different View

2013
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:04,960
Fairborn

2014
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:07,520
Can't really argue

2015
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:13,664
Because there's a piece of Moore's personal life story that matches the story that's told bike

2016
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:16,480
Conspiracy theorist about the sinking of the USS Liberty

2017
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:19,296
That they claim proves that it was a deliberate prolong

2018
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:24,672
They say that the Israeli forces were shooting at the crew as they tried to leave the ship on Lifeboat

2019
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,208
Which is matching

2020
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,744
Thomas Moore's life

2021
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:30,304
The problem is that the investigations

2022
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,888
Testimony of the crew of the survivors of Liberty

2023
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:35,168
That's one thing isn't mentioned

2024
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:35,936
Once

2025
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:41,312
In fact Captain McGonigle testified that he had ordered some crew members who were lowering lifeboats

2026
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,592
The water to stop

2027
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:46,688
Not because they would end up getting shot at that because there was no danger that the boat would sink

2028
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:50,016
And who knows if they might need the lifeboats later

2029
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:51,552
Take Five Points away from Griffin

2030
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:54,368
Bronco mechanical

2031
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:55,136
McGonagall

2032
01:51:56,416 --> 01:52:02,560
I don't know about a reference

2033
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:10,496
So none of the accusations of shooting a testimony of the survivors or the investigations about the event

2034
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:11,520
The only begin to

2035
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:15,104
The pop up later when some of the crew members begin making media appearances

2036
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:15,872
Start Direct

2037
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:17,920
Contradicting their prior Sports

2038
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:20,224
Who probably be impossible to prove it

2039
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:25,344
But some might say that this change of perspective might be the product of anti-zionist intimate

2040
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,624
Becoming much more popular

2041
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,672
The United States through the 70s

2042
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:33,024
With me term Zionist occupied for mentors

2043
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,816
Being coined by Neo-Nazi Eric

2044
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:36,864
1876

2045
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:40,960
Two years later the term would be featured in William Luther pierce his book The

2046
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:41,984
Diaries

2047
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:42,752
We should go on to

2048
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,032
Inspire

2049
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:44,800
Supremacist

2050
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:50,432
The book also inspired the white supremacist Outlaw group

2051
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:56,832
The order who helped bring the term to a much wider audience at 1984 when members of the group murdered prominent Jewish radio host

2052
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:57,600
Kellenberg

2053
01:52:58,368 --> 01:53:02,976
In the late seventies early eighties the sentiment that Israel controlled the US government begins

2054
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,256
Creeped out of the sewer

2055
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:06,048
Just plain old white supremacist groups

2056
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:08,096
It's a slightly more mainstream conscious

2057
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:09,376
Another group

2058
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,656
It's not justification

2059
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:14,496
The attack on the u.s.s. Liberty is a prime example of an event

2060
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:15,520
To fit the mold

2061
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,568
Of a US Government bending over backwards

2062
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,360
To allow Israel to attack.

2063
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:23,456
Then going out of our way to cover it up for them so no one finds out that the government

2064
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:24,736
Israeli Azog

2065
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:29,344
Subsequent investigations of Liberty event and found that it was a

2066
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:32,928
And a series of miscommunications were responsible for how things played out

2067
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:35,744
Well all investigations except

2068
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:39,840
That was an unsanctioned investigation headed by Thomas More

2069
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:46,240
In 2000 crank years old

2070
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:51,360
His findings have been roundly criticized by people who have reviewed the court records and transcripts

2071
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:53,152
The communications from that day back in 19

2072
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:55,200
7 is being an opposition with the

2073
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:55,968
The fact

2074
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:57,760
Everything I can tell they're not wrong

2075
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:59,040
Investigation

2076
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:01,344
Boris said to Rivermark

2077
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:04,672
I've never seen a president I don't care who he is stand up to

2078
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:06,208
It boggles the mind

2079
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:07,744
They always

2080
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,792
The Israelis know what's going on all the time

2081
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:14,656
If you American people understood what a grip these people have on our government they would rise up in arms

2082
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:17,728
Our citizens certainly don't have any idea what goes on

2083
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:24,384
This code is largely circulated on websites that also see the traffic in Holocaust Denial in Russian

2084
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:33,344
I mentioned it to illustrate how more is used by

2085
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:35,136
Particularly anti-semite

2086
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:38,976
Argument that we live in a country with a Zionist occupied govern

2087
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,768
This is what he

2088
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:41,536
Izzy's

2089
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:42,560
Place

2090
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,584
In culture

2091
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:49,472
Yeah.

2092
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:51,776
He was he was on

2093
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:55,616
Some of that tip for a while before that investigation

2094
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:56,640
Still

2095
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,920
Spearheading a lot of this

2096
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,712
U.s.s. Liberty ship

2097
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:02,528
Also the next sentence after that was

2098
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:07,136
Zinus operated government their controlling everything also

2099
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:11,488
16 cats are ripe

2100
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,536
I don't know what his

2101
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:18,144
Full intentions were in his life or if it's just something where he's been co-opted

2102
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:20,704
Yeah by these

2103
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:23,264
Real buckhead's

2104
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,800
But whatever the case

2105
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:25,568
You someone who

2106
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:26,848
Bigger figure

2107
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:31,200
Also more is apparently bit of a race

2108
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:35,552
He wants that the idea of Cuban immigrants coming into Miami

2109
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:42,976
They won't take a bath at least once a week

2110
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:50,656
In one sentence

2111
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:55,776
Thunderstorm in my brain of like who is he

2112
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:59,872
I think it's the black

2113
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,152
Still there

2114
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,968
He also wrote a memoir

2115
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:05,504
Where he included that

2116
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,808
If you're going to be an American you've got to be an American

2117
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:11,648
If you want to be a Greek go to Greece if you want to be a black go to Africa

2118
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:13,440
She is

2119
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:22,400
Conspiracy theories about the u.s.s. Liberty

2120
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:24,448
I don't think I would be surprised

2121
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:27,264
I don't have that evidence and I'm not going to

2122
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:28,544
But I don't

2123
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:30,080
Take that his record is

2124
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:31,104
Great

2125
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:38,016
So a lot of this information about the u.s.s. Liberty

2126
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:41,088
His personal life story is a p

2127
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:43,136
Piece of what's co-opted and put in

2128
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:46,464
To the story of the u.s.s. Liberty

2129
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,744
Attack

2130
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:51,584
What's the historical record

2131
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,352
Suspicious

2132
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,888
I think that you something

2133
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:54,656
Pretty tough

2134
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:57,472
How to get around whatever your evidence

2135
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:01,312
Or way or when you're a Yorkie

2136
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:02,592
Mercy theory about the

2137
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:04,128
It doesn't match up with history

2138
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:06,432
Your life

2139
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:08,992
Right

2140
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:11,296
Weird

2141
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:14,880
Kind of leaving a little bit of a

2142
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:17,696
It's a little bit like William Barber

2143
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:19,232
Nominated

2144
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:24,352
Seems like he had one

2145
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:27,424
Very weird

2146
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:29,984
Little bit of information about what's going on

2147
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,032
Studio here on June 14th

2148
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,824
This clip really

2149
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:39,200
Got

2150
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:47,136
That's why are they here and somebody else was coming

2151
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:50,208
Wish I was about something else and now they're here on other

2152
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:53,024
God help me

2153
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:55,840
It just never ends

2154
01:57:56,864 --> 01:58:03,008
He sounds like someone like on a sitcom whose in-laws are in town

2155
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:05,824
Black God

2156
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:09,152
I think

2157
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:13,760
People that they don't speak

2158
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:20,416
What are you doing hiding in the crawl space

2159
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,696
My mother-in-law's

2160
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:24,000
Olay back she's French

2161
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,120
So

2162
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:31,168
Did we get this Alex's

2163
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:33,472
Sing a big story about

2164
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:34,240
Flagrant

2165
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:36,032
That's coming up

2166
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:40,640
Extreme

2167
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:41,408
The story is going

2168
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:51,904
It's so flagrant show

2169
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,208
So

2170
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:59,328
McCoy

2171
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:02,144
Real bona fide

2172
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:05,984
Call nightmare vision

2173
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,520
Tyranny

2174
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:08,800
Give us 8 more adjectives

2175
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:12,896
And it's just openly announced to shareholders

2176
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,968
Announce to the world

2177
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:17,504
Like

2178
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,296
They're talkin about

2179
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,112
Having a couple

2180
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:29,024
How old is a wonderful new ride

2181
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:32,608
We're going to teach your five-year-old how great it is to have their genitals chopped off

2182
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,400
Did they don't want him shot.

2183
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:37,984
Oh how wonderful we're going to ship in

2184
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,800
Everyday of weapons

2185
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:43,872
Killed most people liberal

2186
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:46,944
When I get

2187
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:52,064
It's a culmination of everything we knew that was coming

2188
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:56,672
Thoroughbred

2189
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,840
You got nothing left...

2190
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,144
Play Just Do It

2191
02:00:08,704 --> 02:00:13,312
How to stop right there as always do and

2192
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:22,528
50 years only first came out

2193
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,088
2

2194
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:27,392
The real sponsorship

2195
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:28,672
Goes on

2196
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:29,696
Deering

2197
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:31,232
The wife

2198
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:37,888
The least amount of money talk show host

2199
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:39,936
Sponsorship

2200
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:42,496
No no.

2201
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:48,384
Security

2202
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,408
Kind of yeah

2203
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,432
He does

2204
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:51,456
Facebook

2205
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:53,760
Whatever

2206
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:55,808
Whatever

2207
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:57,600
30 minutes

2208
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:00,416
Defensive

2209
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:05,280
Unplugged

2210
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:12,448
Did I don't listen to a ton of other radio show

2211
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:19,872
Distracted the level of

2212
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:21,152
It's about

2213
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:21,920
To write

2214
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:26,016
If you

2215
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:28,320
It would be much more power

2216
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:31,904
It's it's really really f***** up

2217
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,696
The way he does it with the

2218
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:36,256
Getting

2219
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:42,656
Lakeview Thoroughbred tyranny we all knew this was coming

2220
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:46,752
Manipulative

2221
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:48,288
It's a advertising

2222
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,312
Techniques

There they will chop anything just so you know the government is going to come and find all of your knife

2226
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,696
Take them away from you and Destroy them unless you buy this knife

2227
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:06,976
Right now

2228
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,072
There's some similarities

2229
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:15,168
Play Billy Mays and those dudes

2230
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:16,704
Even though I probably would

2231
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:17,728
Do that

2232
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:29,504
Famous congressman

2233
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:33,344
Do actually got the lands of Alaska signed over to people

2234
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:37,440
Senator Inn

2235
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:40,768
Fridays 4th hour

2236
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:47,424
Shut up

2237
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:53,056
I'm at my lawyer

2238
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,688
Connecticut

2239
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:02,528
I want you to know the stakes

2240
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:05,856
What the system is willing to do

2241
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:10,464
Protectus operate

2242
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:11,744
Because they know

2243
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:13,536
This is the real deal

2244
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:15,840
So I thought this was the

2245
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:20,704
Yeah I thought this was the unbridled Thoroughbred tyranny news

2246
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:21,984
Right

2247
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:25,568
This is not news

2248
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:28,896
You've got this massive the culmination of all the things that we

2249
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:30,176
Nick begich

2250
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:32,224
She's got to go

2251
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:34,016
Angels go play your harp

2252
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:39,648
I thought that I thought that was the case but it's not the it's two separate

2253
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:41,696
And here's the first one

2254
02:03:41,952 --> 02:03:43,232
Which is the actual tyranny do

2255
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:48,096
It's basically a racial slurs

2256
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:50,656
Breach of service or something like that

2257
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:51,936
I don't even believe that

2258
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:54,240
The case but whatever

2259
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:59,616
This is like five hundred times worse than I change

2260
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:01,408
This isn't science fiction

2261
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:03,712
Dystopia

2262
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:06,784
Watching

2263
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,064
Listening to you

2264
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,344
Real-time

Figure

2271
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:25,216
And then we can use it to as a

2272
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:27,776
To tell all the other people

2273
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:29,056
You better

In your house

2279
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:47,744
Building a politically correct on you

2280
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:51,328
Your job

How small your crew is

2285
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:13,600
If if you have

2286
02:05:13,856 --> 02:05:15,392
Proof that Facebook called

2287
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:16,416
I told you

2288
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,696
What is about to say

2289
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:19,744
You put that immediately

2290
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,024
I don't care

2291
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:24,608
Recording laws

2292
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:25,632
You put this out

2293
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:26,912
You're Alex Jones

2294
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:27,680
Absolute

2295
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:30,752
You know why you know how I know that if he had this he would put it up

2296
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:32,544
He's outed sources on air

2297
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:39,200
You know it has

2298
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:39,968
No

2299
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:40,992
Interest

2300
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:43,040
In protecting any kind of journalist

2301
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:48,416
If he had this information it would be everywhere

2302
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:50,720
What's the Telly zombies

2303
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:05,568
It's good for children

2304
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:07,872
Just

2305
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:09,664
We let you

2306
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,200
On Facebook

2307
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:21,696
Weather announcement

2308
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:34,496
Supposed to do

2309
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:38,080
Curious

2310
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:43,712
How much him saying I'm serious twice is an indication that he's joking

2311
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:47,808
I think he's trying to do an Indian voice

2312
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:50,880
Yeah

2313
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:55,744
Oh

2314
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:03,936
If you did say that and you didn't own your own business

2315
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:08,032
You would be fired in your bank account would be ruined

2316
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:10,080
There is a reason that you can't say the

2317
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:16,480
How much of it is what he thinks is being funny

2318
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:19,040
Embellishing of the call

2319
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:23,648
Bright

2320
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:25,952
Just don't believe any of this

2321
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:28,000
I mean I don't I don't believe any of it

2322
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:30,304
Can't tell his how much he's signaling

2323
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,072
Being like

2324
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:32,864
He's trying to be funny

2325
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:36,960
People with a really bad stupid sense of humor Tuesday

2326
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:38,496
I can't tell

2327
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:40,800
Honestly at the point where I can't tell

2328
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:43,872
In this next clip really was where I struggled

2329
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:48,736
I can't tell if he's joking or not

2330
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:54,880
This is so

2331
02:07:56,160 --> 02:08:00,512
If he's being serious this is one of the funniest things I've ever heard if he's trying to be funny

2332
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,816
I tip my hat to it but it's like

2333
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:04,608
There's no indication that he's

2334
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:05,376
I don't feel safe

2335
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:10,240
Classify

2336
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:12,288
Crawfish Bash from

2337
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:14,080
High School to college

2338
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:15,360
You're scared

2339
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:16,640
Accommodate

2340
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:18,688
I can change song

2341
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:24,320
They have a girl

2342
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:26,368
Stuck on You

2343
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:27,904
That works at college

2344
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:37,888
Lamborghini

2345
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:42,496
I can't tell if hilarious or not

2346
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:52,480
Yeah you do you get all your freshman to come in and go to one of these leftist groups

2347
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:57,088
Sucks you didn't

2348
02:08:58,112 --> 02:09:01,696
Now admittedly if that doesn't work for everybody

2349
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:03,232
Ayahuasca

2350
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:05,024
I admit that I'm

2351
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:08,352
10 years out of college or so at this point you know

2352
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:09,888
At the same time

2353
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:12,704
When I went to college Alex was 10 years out of

2354
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:15,520
Dropping out of Junior College

2355
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:19,104
Particularly know if he's deeply in touch with what's going on on campus

2356
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:26,272
I'm going to go ahead and gas is not an accurate depiction

2357
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:27,808
Yeah

2358
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,344
I mean depends on which college

2359
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:34,208
I heard Arizona State this is what they do

2360
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:37,536
Dispositive

2361
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:42,400
I think this would be at like a Oberlander like

2362
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:53,664
When is real hippie School

2363
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:06,720
It's like an upset

2364
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:09,792
Yeah I don't know I think this is pretty stupid

2365
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:15,168
Here's the struggle that is really funny weather it's based in ignorance

2366
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:17,472
If you trying to be funny I think it's last

2367
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:19,008
Absolute

2368
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:23,872
Assuming that he's actually presented

2369
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:24,896
F****** hilarious

2370
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:29,248
It's too much because

2371
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:31,040
He says things like in this next

2372
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:32,832
Really

2373
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:34,880
Really toeing the line

2374
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:36,928
I think

2375
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:41,536
Old dictionary

2376
02:10:44,352 --> 02:10:48,192
Muslim call to prayer

2377
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:50,752
Cuz I just still cute

2378
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:54,848
Mo Problem releasing

2379
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:57,408
Just a little problem

2380
02:10:58,688 --> 02:11:00,224
I just don't think Jesus would like to

2381
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:05,344
But you know I think the world's going in that direction show

2382
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:07,648
So f***** up

2383
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,720
Is so f***** up

2384
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:17,376
He said we should have a race specific bioweapon the kills all Muslims and Arabs

2385
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:23,776
But I know they wanted to destroy me they want to take me out and now I just picked up killing them all

2386
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:24,800
But I also think

2387
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:26,592
Think that's the way the world's going

2388
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:30,176
I think it's inevitable we're going to have to commit genocide against these people

2389
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:34,016
Yeah yeah yeah

2390
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:39,904
Blase about the idea of an inevitable genocide

2391
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,720
No no I do remember that

2392
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:44,000
Kids like you should

2393
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:45,024
Turn the other cheek

2394
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:47,072
Only to release a bioweapon

2395
02:11:47,328 --> 02:11:48,352
Specifically targeting Buzz

2396
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:49,376
Right

2397
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:50,656
Really prophetic

2398
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:51,936
Parable

2399
02:11:52,448 --> 02:11:53,984
This is an interesting way to

2400
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:55,264
To preemptively

2401
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,056
Pretend that you're the victim in

2402
02:11:57,312 --> 02:11:58,336
And some sort of an aggression

2403
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:03,200
They could be

2404
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:03,968
You put forth.

2405
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:08,320
TI No matter what any time you had this like

2406
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:11,392
Suck on a dick dog turning into a liberal the college

2407
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:14,720
Call Michael.

2408
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:18,304
We might end up having to kill all Muslims

2409
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:21,120
You know

2410
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:24,448
Unbelievable

2411
02:12:24,704 --> 02:12:25,472
That's insane

2412
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:27,008
Impossible

2413
02:12:30,592 --> 02:12:31,872
Become on back-to-back

2414
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:33,408
1 hour

2415
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:34,432
Snow

2416
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:37,248
One of them is Matt Bracken

2417
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:39,296
His special forces

2418
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:43,136
Idiot

2419
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:46,720
And here is a clip of Alex introduced

2420
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:47,488
Joel skousen

2421
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:48,768
About to

2422
02:12:49,024 --> 02:12:52,608
Eclipse

2423
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:55,168
Important

2424
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:56,192
Because it indicates

2425
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:57,984
It from a very early age

2426
02:12:58,496 --> 02:12:59,776
Alex Jones Is Dead

2427
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:02,592
Lived in an environment of rabbit

2428
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:03,360
Rampant

2429
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:04,384
Communists

2430
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:19,232
That's growing up

2431
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:24,096
Was a super John Wayne American World War

2432
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,984
Megatropolis

2433
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:33,824
Playing the game

2434
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:37,152
You got to get there and do it

2435
02:13:45,088 --> 02:13:46,112
14 years old

2436
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:47,648
And

2437
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:50,976
So

2438
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:52,512
Indicate

2439
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:54,816
Next to me that Alex Jones is Dad was involved

2440
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:55,584
In some groups

2441
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:59,424
Yeah probably

2442
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:05,824
I would love to go buck wild with this if you like unsolved crimes

2443
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:09,920
1979

2444
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:14,272
Yeah I would love to try and do that

2445
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:18,112
Site like meetings

2446
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:22,464
Reading meeting set up

2447
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:23,232
At the home

2448
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:25,280
You do realize

2449
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:27,328
Casino it's presented as something else

2450
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:28,608
Right

2451
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,960
Good picture of

2452
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:34,496
At least the way Alex

2453
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:36,288
Experience

2454
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:37,056
His childhood

2455
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:41,408
If you're living in a household like that you're going to end up with some

2456
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:42,432
Lingering beliefs

2457
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:43,712
Unless you go to college

2458
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:46,016
Tex-Mex get your big dog suckin challenge

2459
02:14:46,272 --> 02:14:48,576
Those beliefs that you had from a young age

2460
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:51,904
I think I would get

2461
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:52,672
The ayahuasca

2462
02:14:58,048 --> 02:15:04,192
Yeah I don't know what's going on

2463
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:06,240
Alex's references are 20 years old

2464
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:12,128
So on the show like I said

2465
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:16,992
Is there to argue that the people who are caught on video

2466
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:19,296
In the boat coming up to the tanker

2467
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:21,600
They were clearly retrieving their Limpet mine

2468
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:22,624
In a row

2469
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:25,440
No two ways about it it is absolutely around

2470
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:27,488
They couldn't have got that mine out of the boat

2471
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:32,096
Unless they knew about the mine ahead of time and knew how to diffuse it otherwise

2472
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:35,168
Bracken it is around Alex Jones

2473
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:36,448
Completely agrees with him

2474
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,336
Came on to justify Alex

2475
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:43,104
Texas yesterday

2476
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:46,176
Yes

2477
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:46,944
Who argues that

2478
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,224
The Japanese

2479
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:53,344
It was a mine it was a missile

2480
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:55,648
Play contradiction

2481
02:15:55,904 --> 02:16:02,048
And Alex

2482
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:05,376
5 minutes

2483
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:06,912
Completely disoriented

2484
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:09,472
And I know that this is Alex's version of what

2485
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:11,520
Looking at both sides

2486
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:17,152
In the end

2487
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:18,688
Credible sources of information

2488
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:19,712
Forsaken

2489
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:20,736
Completely different thing

2490
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:23,552
With complete confidence and pretend Authority

2491
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:26,368
It's one thing for a news program to talk to both

2492
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:27,648
I could see

2493
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:31,744
A credible news program talkative a 1000 back-to-back

2494
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:32,512
You could do that

2495
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:34,816
But you'd have to maintain an objective

2496
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:35,584
Position

2497
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:37,888
It's a totally different thing

2498
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:39,168
Hypothetical newsperson

2499
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:40,704
How to talk to both of them

2500
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,752
And how the audience witnessed

2501
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:45,568
Like within the span of

2502
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:46,592
Be convinced

2503
02:16:47,104 --> 02:16:48,128
Contradictory

2504
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,408
It's jarring

2505
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:50,176
Nadia

2506
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:51,968
And it leaves you with the position of like

2507
02:16:52,224 --> 02:16:55,552
I trust Alex I think Alex is a good

2508
02:16:55,808 --> 02:17:01,184
Gauge of information

2509
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:04,768
It would be jarring if like you and I you are

2510
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:06,816
Uncomfortable and

2511
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:08,608
Held by cognitive dissonance

2512
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:10,656
Where is if you are

2513
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:11,424
If you

2514
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:14,496
Cognitive dissonance on a

2515
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:16,032
Minute-by-minute

2516
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:17,824
I doubt they would be

2517
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:19,104
Affected by that

2518
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,640
Steelix.

2519
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:21,664
Yeah

2520
02:17:25,504 --> 02:17:26,016
It's still tough to

2521
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:30,880
Earlier in the July 14th episode

2522
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:35,232
We had Alex say that there was unmedicated thoroughbred

2523
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:36,256
Hernia foot

2524
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:38,048
And then also he said that

2525
02:17:39,328 --> 02:17:40,608
Baggage

2526
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:44,192
Got to go we got taken for that workers resume

2527
02:17:44,704 --> 02:17:49,056
So they're not the same thing Facebook is going to

2528
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:52,896
And now we get to Alex

2529
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:54,688
Simulating what the second

2530
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:55,456
In part was

2531
02:17:55,712 --> 02:17:56,736
The attack on Infowars

2532
02:17:57,248 --> 02:17:58,016
Interesting

2533
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:01,856
You might show some cards

2534
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:07,488
Almost in the fourth hour don't want to tell you what they're up to

2535
02:18:09,024 --> 02:18:10,560
Because you have scared some employees

2536
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:11,584
Okay

2537
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:14,400
I really haven't told people what's going on

2538
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:15,936
Best Buy

2539
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:17,216
Voice families

2540
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:20,544
Biopsy

2541
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,848
I try to have women beautiful women

2542
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:24,384
Get up

2543
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:26,432
Grocery stores at work right now

2544
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:32,576
It's because we're doing something very important

2545
02:18:32,832 --> 02:18:35,648
Hours a day

2546
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:42,304
They are so pissed

2547
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:45,376
Ford's the FBI

2548
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:46,912
They say where the victim

2549
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:50,496
I'm not a victim I just want to

2550
02:18:51,008 --> 02:18:52,544
Cheap

2551
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:53,312
Finish strong

2552
02:18:54,336 --> 02:18:55,104
Play kill me whatever

2553
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:57,664
Money

2554
02:18:59,456 --> 02:18:59,968
Yeah

2555
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:04,064
Vaguely discussing

2556
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:05,344
What is this

2557
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:08,160
Attack

2558
02:19:08,416 --> 02:19:10,464
Preemptively being set up even before it

2559
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:11,232
Anyone list

2560
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:13,792
Has any information as to what he's talking about

2561
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:16,096
He's trying to use this to get money

2562
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:18,400
For himself from the audience

2563
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:19,424
Which I find suspicious

2564
02:19:20,448 --> 02:19:21,728
I find that to be

2565
02:19:24,032 --> 02:19:27,616
Everybody ice

2566
02:19:27,872 --> 02:19:31,200
Now has already figured out what it is he's about to talk

2567
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:37,856
Alex

2568
02:19:39,136 --> 02:19:40,416
The one thing that there

2569
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:41,952
That I have not read any

2570
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:48,352
Raising

2571
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:49,120
Pretty weird

2572
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:52,448
That

2573
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:58,336
So also did Alex saying that he has a problem with

2574
02:19:58,592 --> 02:19:59,104
Which is greater

2575
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:03,456
Here I mean I guess there's some sort of insight they're busy at solutely

2576
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:04,224
Boost

2577
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:06,016
Feel a little less

2578
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:09,856
Here is that by the time the third hour is rolling around

2579
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:11,904
He's clearly drunk again

2580
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:13,952
Like I think that he had that jarring

2581
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:16,000
Tabac interviews with

2582
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:19,072
Sweetheart

2583
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:20,864
Who votes that contradicts everything

2584
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:23,424
Galveston was a little bit of a longer interview

2585
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:26,496
It's clearly talkingshit on Trump

2586
02:20:26,752 --> 02:20:28,288
I don't think Trump knows anything

2587
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:31,360
Like if you or I were in these meetings

2588
02:20:31,616 --> 02:20:32,384
We could tell him about

2589
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:36,480
What Trump doesn't know s***

2590
02:20:36,736 --> 02:20:38,528
He is not part of the movement

2591
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:44,928
I'm sure he stupid

2592
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:46,976
The Godfather

2593
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:53,376
Thought

2594
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:56,192
And I

2595
02:20:56,704 --> 02:20:58,240
Base that on his behavior

2596
02:20:58,496 --> 02:21:00,032
Completely changed

2597
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:02,336
He has Owen on Owen Shroyer

2598
02:21:02,848 --> 02:21:08,480
They're talkin about the drag queen story time that's going on in Austin right now

2599
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:11,808
Went down there to go cost

2600
02:21:12,064 --> 02:21:12,576
Problems

2601
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:13,344
Yeah

2602
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:16,928
And then they made it really their story is about how antifa

2603
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:18,208
Was going to show up to

2604
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:23,584
Counter whatever anyway is only important

2605
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:25,376
Because you can really see that

2606
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:26,144
Is pretty f*****

2607
02:21:27,168 --> 02:21:30,240
This isn't Linda Blair

2608
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:31,264
This isn't

2609
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:32,288
This is

2610
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,104
You understand that

2611
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:40,224
Silver ours

2612
02:21:44,064 --> 02:21:45,088
These are the skeksis

2613
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:56,352
A drag queen story time

2614
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:29,376
Who started the fake fight

2615
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:31,168
This is a drunk dude

2616
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:37,056
Cuz I mean like the yelling and stuff all kinds of

2617
02:22:37,312 --> 02:22:38,080
Completely

2618
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:47,296
And I also probably a little bit uncomfortable about having to make the 4th hours

2619
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:50,368
So I think the following talking about

2620
02:22:51,392 --> 02:22:54,464
I think that there is a whole lot of influences probably

2621
02:22:56,256 --> 02:23:01,376
And it comes out when you sitting here with Owen like I got a bit

2622
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:03,168
That is exactly what he did to Steven

2623
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:05,984
Crowder when he went out after he drank

2624
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:07,776
Episodes

2625
02:23:08,032 --> 02:23:10,848
What do you want out to Steve Crowder's demonstration

2626
02:23:11,104 --> 02:23:12,128
The fake fight them too

2627
02:23:13,664 --> 02:23:17,248
Started fake fighting because Steven Crowder

2628
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:22,112
Fake fart with

2629
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:23,904
Gavin McInnes

2630
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:26,464
It's just sad

2631
02:23:28,256 --> 02:23:31,584
The shows up

2632
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:32,864
Cuz he wanted to talk to

2633
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:35,424
How we need to start using everything

2634
02:23:37,472 --> 02:23:37,984
Preservation

2635
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:41,056
Very

2636
02:23:41,312 --> 02:23:42,080
Topic

2637
02:23:42,336 --> 02:23:43,616
It's so Alex is just

2638
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:45,152
We won't let go

2639
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:45,920
Talk you just keep

2640
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:46,688
Screaming at

2641
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:49,760
Thinks he's doing a bit

2642
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:51,552
You just keeps yelling at him about Satan

2643
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:54,880
And you won't stop

2644
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:57,440
They will face their father Satan

2645
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:01,792
He will pay

2646
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:08,192
I'd like to remind you that Joe Biggs was calling in to talk about data preservation

2647
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:27,648
Jesus is Alive show

2648
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:29,440
I love shape

2649
02:24:29,696 --> 02:24:30,464
I want to kill babe

2650
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:31,744
Join

2651
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:34,560

Jojo Jojo

2653
02:24:48,128 --> 02:24:50,432
This is a completely different

2654
02:24:50,688 --> 02:24:51,200
Princess purse

2655
02:24:58,112 --> 02:24:59,136
Knox

2656
02:24:59,392 --> 02:25:00,160
I mean

2657
02:25:00,416 --> 02:25:00,928
You do it

2658
02:25:02,208 --> 02:25:02,976
Completely drain

2659
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:05,792
Mikey's his manner is completely different

2660
02:25:06,048 --> 02:25:09,120
He's acting like all those other times in the past

2661
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:12,448
What he was holding it together before like

2662
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:13,472
Absolutely

2663
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:15,776
Completely

2664
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:17,824
Pretend

2665
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:25,760
To the point where they're trying to deliver his report but haven't gone out to

2666
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:29,344
One of their Marquee

2667
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:31,136
Make propaganda about

2668
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:34,464
He keeps trying to talk

2669
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:39,328
To the point where I think

2670
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:40,608
They had a conversation

2671
02:25:40,864 --> 02:25:42,400
And Alex had to leave the studio

2672
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:44,704
A real to get his report

2673
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:46,240
Here I is

2674
02:25:46,752 --> 02:25:48,800
Blowing Minds

2675
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:50,336
When he's finally allowed to talk

2676
02:25:50,848 --> 02:25:51,616
And then you find out

2677
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:56,480
Church was raining out

2678
02:25:56,736 --> 02:25:58,784
An independent school district performing

2679
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,064
Performing Arts Center

2680
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:03,392
Now that independent

2681
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:09,792
School district for forming Arts Center

2682
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:13,888
Now when I asked why they were going to be

2683
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:15,936
They said it was a little

2684
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:22,592
There was a little outraged over the fact that this church

2685
02:26:24,128 --> 02:26:26,432
Call Dan quired

2686
02:26:26,944 --> 02:26:31,296
I was told that there is an lgbtq initiative in Austin

2687
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:36,928
Why is there an lgbtq

2688
02:26:40,256 --> 02:26:41,792
Why is there no heterosexual

2689
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:43,072
Finish date with the kids

2690
02:26:47,936 --> 02:26:49,984
There wouldn't be any people at all

2691
02:26:54,336 --> 02:27:00,480
Play for the Panthers

2692
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:09,440
Congratulations

2693
02:27:10,464 --> 02:27:16,608
Theoretically, it doesn't look like

2694
02:27:16,864 --> 02:27:19,936
St.Louis

2695
02:27:20,192 --> 02:27:22,240
Entirely sure

2696
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:25,312
That's crazy

2697
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:29,408
It's indicative of his thought patterns

2698
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:30,688
This word of childish

2699
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:33,504
Level of justifying

2700
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:37,088
You just got a little taste of the world does Alex let him talk

2701
02:27:38,112 --> 02:27:38,624
Stupid

2702
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:39,392
Now

2703
02:27:39,648 --> 02:27:40,160
Here

2704
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:41,184
Is

2705
02:27:44,512 --> 02:27:47,328
Barging into scream something right at the end of Thor

2706
02:27:49,888 --> 02:27:51,424
Infowars

2707
02:27:58,080 --> 02:28:02,432
Why not tomorrow

2708
02:28:04,992 --> 02:28:11,136
You can also like I see that little cartoon where he liked

2709
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:17,024
Under the desk

2710
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:21,120
That is a show that I would watch

2711
02:28:21,376 --> 02:28:27,520
Obsessed it look if Owen Shroyer said dumb s*** for three straight hours but every now and again there's just a

2712
02:28:27,776 --> 02:28:28,544
Some weird-ass

2713
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:31,616
I would I would

2714
02:28:31,872 --> 02:28:37,504
I'm surprised I still don't

2715
02:28:43,392 --> 02:28:48,256
Simultaneously believes that are on did this and I was taught by the bubbler

2716
02:28:48,768 --> 02:28:53,888
Clips from the last 2 days

2717
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:55,936
Acme sandwich wanted

2718
02:28:56,192 --> 02:29:01,824
I like to guess that's about and it least one of those

2719
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:08,480
He seems to think it's some sort of virtue and they like

2720
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:12,832
You Are Family

2721
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:17,440
Owen Shroyer just said if it weren't for heterosexual people we wouldn't have

2722
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:19,488
Actual people which implies if you have

2723
02:29:19,744 --> 02:29:22,560
Days that much what you should really be doing

2724
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:23,840
Is killing straight

2725
02:29:24,352 --> 02:29:27,680
Wolfie now that's you using this pathological is

2726
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:30,496
As I would scream

2727
02:29:33,056 --> 02:29:34,848
And that is that Alex's other lawyer

2728
02:29:35,104 --> 02:29:35,872
Norm pattis

2729
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:37,920
Has been flown in from Connecticut

2730
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:39,200
Superior on the show

2731
02:29:39,968 --> 02:29:40,736
I got to say

2732
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:42,272
Norm kind of won me over

2733
02:29:44,576 --> 02:29:46,624
First of all

2734
02:29:49,952 --> 02:29:50,464
Memes

2735
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:51,232
Stopping

2736
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:53,024
Behavior in that deposition

2737
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:53,792
It was pretty shity

2738
02:29:55,328 --> 02:29:57,120
He comes off better than Robert

2739
02:29:57,888 --> 02:29:59,168
And this

2740
02:29:59,424 --> 02:29:59,936
Display

2741
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:02,496
Introduce

2742
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:05,312
Throughout little bit of a

2743
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:08,384
Also feeds into my

2744
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:09,664
He's drunk

2745
02:30:10,432 --> 02:30:13,504
Constitution 1st Amendment

2746

Sprinkler

2747
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:20,928
Wow

2748
02:30:21,952 --> 02:30:23,232
Questioning

2749
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:30,400
The daddy of

2750
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:37,312
Talking about this Norm is

2751
02:30:37,568 --> 02:30:41,920
Trying to be as good a side

2752
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:47,296
Barely

2753
02:30:47,552 --> 02:30:49,600
The Matrix

2754
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:52,160
But then Alex gets off track because he wants

2755
02:30:52,416 --> 02:30:52,928
To brag

2756
02:30:57,024 --> 02:30:58,048
Why what's wrong with him

2757
02:31:01,376 --> 02:31:03,680
The top clips on YouTube

2758
02:31:05,472 --> 02:31:06,752
It has over 100 views right now

2759
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:08,032
Jojo

2760
02:31:09,568 --> 02:31:11,360
It's barely almost it's a biggest

2761
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:12,384
He's ever done

2762
02:31:13,408 --> 02:31:14,688
14

2763
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:18,016
The average video videos

3 million m

2765
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:21,600
Guess what the lowest video

14 million

2767
02:31:26,464 --> 02:31:27,488

Prosecutor

2772
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:07,936
I do that's a good turn of phrase one of those rare instances

2773
02:32:08,192 --> 02:32:09,472
Anger ends up turning

2774
02:32:09,728 --> 02:32:10,496
Like a good set

2775
02:32:10,752 --> 02:32:14,336
Yeah that's a solid

2776
02:32:14,848 --> 02:32:17,408
Are you may put too much for printing

2777
02:32:20,224 --> 02:32:21,760
Is always the paper you got to recycle

2778
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:28,416
He is not impressed at all

2779
02:32:28,672 --> 02:32:33,280
Those that Alex is a blowhard

2780
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:36,608
I guess it's time to get into it

2781
02:32:38,656 --> 02:32:40,448
Infowars

2782
02:32:40,704 --> 02:32:43,776
It's 3 minutes long because I wanted Alex to

2783
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:45,568
To be able to present the situation

2784
02:32:48,384 --> 02:32:51,712
And then see how quickly he takes it to the

2785
02:32:51,968 --> 02:32:52,736
A conclusion that he wants

2786
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:01,952
My family

2787
02:33:08,096 --> 02:33:09,632

That's Chris

02:33:39,328 --> 02:33:41,120
Very interesting individual

That's alright

2805
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:11,072
And so we learned

2806
02:34:11,328 --> 02:34:13,120
Just last few days step

2807
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:16,448
One day one of these hundreds of thousands of emails

2808
02:34:18,496 --> 02:34:22,336
No one would know what they were we

2809
02:34:35,904 --> 02:34:40,000
No you wouldn't know it was an attachment that you would know what they like to

2811
02:34:51,776 --> 02:34:52,800

2815
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:01,248
I get these emails a few weeks ago

2816
02:35:02,528 --> 02:35:03,296
And I go right

2817
02:35:03,552 --> 02:35:04,576
To the FBI

2818
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:06,880
We've got him a child

2819
02:35:07,904 --> 02:35:09,440

2820
02:35:10,208 --> 02:35:10,976
It send it

2821
02:35:12,512 --> 02:35:15,072
They act like older our friends they're not.

2822
02:35:16,864 --> 02:35:17,376
Go to hell

2823
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:19,168
I wasn't born yesterday

2824
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:20,960

02:35:49,632 --> 02:35:50,912
We're going to release the metadata

Force.com

2845
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,776
The email address that company

2846
02:35:56,288 --> 02:35:57,056
Prosper company

2847
02:35:57,824 --> 02:35:58,336
Back

2848
02:35:58,848 --> 02:35:59,360
Going to find out

2849
02:35:59,872 --> 02:36:02,432
If you're going to go to prison

2850
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:09,856
First of all I want to say immediately that I don't believe based on the information that's currently available that Alex

2851
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:11,904
This kind of accusation

2852
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:13,184
Pretty serious stuff

2853
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:16,768
And it does seem entirely plausible to me that someone could

2854
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:17,536
Defiled

2855
02:36:17,792 --> 02:36:22,656
If more information comes out I reserve the right to my position

2856
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:25,472
But for now I have no tolerance for people

2857
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:26,240
Guilty

2858
02:36:27,008 --> 02:36:31,872
I understand that it's my lot in life to be overly say or to Alex but I don't think that this is an example of

2859
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:38,016
I think it's being that this is one of the few instances where he does make sense that someone would do that to him

2860
02:36:38,272 --> 02:36:40,320
And things have played out this way it makes

2861
02:36:40,832 --> 02:36:43,136
Remix ability

2862
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:49,024
Play it's Alex's ability to make propaganda out of his own victim

2863
02:36:50,048 --> 02:36:53,120
From the way you talkin I can barely track what he saying happened

2864
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:57,472
Someone sent him

2865
02:36:57,728 --> 02:36:59,264
Threatening emails about Sandy Hook

2866
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:01,824
They contain attachments that included illegal Toronado

2867
02:37:02,592 --> 02:37:03,872
His team didn't see him

2868
02:37:04,128 --> 02:37:09,248
Didn't notice them until they were handed over as part of the batch of emails that were deemed relevant to his lawsuit in Connecticut

2869
02:37:13,088 --> 02:37:16,672
That seems to be what it's saying as his narrative

2870
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:18,464
Coming from hymns there's a grain of

2871
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:20,000
Assault aspect to it

2872
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:21,536
But honestly it seems

2873
02:37:21,792 --> 02:37:23,072
Plausible is a series of events

2874
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:26,400
What happened

2875
02:37:26,656 --> 02:37:27,936
Exist

2876
02:37:28,192 --> 02:37:29,472
It could be a PR stunt

2877
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:32,032
I'm coming from is very much one where I think

2878
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:33,568
It's wise to exercise caution

2879
02:37:34,336 --> 02:37:37,920
Narrative about this

2880
02:37:38,176 --> 02:37:39,456
Eclipse is that

2881
02:37:40,736 --> 02:37:42,272
Is that the people who are suing him

2882
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:43,552
In Sandy Hook Center

2883
02:37:44,064 --> 02:37:49,184
And that's the only way they would have been able to know where to look to find it to take to the FBI

2884
02:37:52,512 --> 02:37:53,024
Assumption

2885
02:37:53,536 --> 02:37:57,120
Because any kind of data analysis firm would be able to

2886
02:37:57,376 --> 02:37:58,144
Run script

2887
02:37:58,400 --> 02:38:00,192
On large amounts of data

2888
02:38:00,448 --> 02:38:01,984
Specialized

2889
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:02,752
This sort of thing

2890
02:38:03,008 --> 02:38:05,568
It would not be something that would be a needle in it

2891
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:08,896
It would be if you were manually searching through emails

2892
02:38:09,152 --> 02:38:10,944
Because of algorithms

2893
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:12,480
Programs that people can run

2894
02:38:12,736 --> 02:38:15,040
It is the sort of thing where you can look for suspicious thing

2895
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:20,160
First second you would be able to

2896
02:38:20,416 --> 02:38:20,928
If you had

2897
02:38:23,232 --> 02:38:25,024
The idea of being able to process

2898
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:26,816
Through in like a week

2899
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:28,608
I think that's very doable

2900
02:38:30,144 --> 02:38:31,168
Falls apart a little bit

2901
02:38:33,472 --> 02:38:34,752
Contest seems like a weird mood

2902
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:38,592
I probably told me something you would do if you didn't think this was a real

2903
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:41,408
Can't afford to make the

2904
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:46,016
I think they got this should cover

2905
02:38:46,784 --> 02:38:49,344
You don't need to crowdsourcing investigation with the actual

2906
02:38:49,856 --> 02:38:50,624
Gators are investigating

2907
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:54,720
If This Were Real I would really really think the FBI would say don't

2908
02:38:54,976 --> 02:38:56,768
Comment on an active investigation

2909
02:38:57,024 --> 02:38:58,304
Seems like it would get in the way

2910
02:38:58,816 --> 02:39:02,144
Whether or not this is real or not I think what he's doing is super your response

2911
02:39:02,912 --> 02:39:06,752
Presumably does really some of this metadata or whatever he has

2912
02:39:07,264 --> 02:39:11,616
If one of his listeners could figure out who's IP address it came from the FBI already knows who that is

2913
02:39:12,128 --> 02:39:14,688
Assuming any of the stuff Alex releases actually leave

2914
02:39:15,712 --> 02:39:16,736
Which it may or may not

2915
02:39:16,992 --> 02:39:19,808
All he's doing is increasing the possibility that that person

2916
02:39:20,064 --> 02:39:20,832
Is hurt

2917
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:22,880
And this matter is not dealt with lawfully

2918
02:39:23,648 --> 02:39:26,464
There's legitimately no reason to do what he's doing right now

2919
02:39:30,304 --> 02:39:30,816
I don't think

2920
02:39:31,072 --> 02:39:31,840
That's a fair assumption

2921
02:39:32,864 --> 02:39:34,144
I don't think he's trying to cover up any

2922
02:39:34,656 --> 02:39:36,192
I think it feels more attention-hungry

2923
02:39:36,704 --> 02:39:37,472
Then anything else

2924
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:40,032
So I don't know what the reality of this

2925
02:39:40,288 --> 02:39:40,800
Situation

2926
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:43,616
The fact that he's making a contest

2927
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:47,456
Strikes me as he's not too worried about whatever it is

2928
02:39:48,224 --> 02:39:48,736
It doesn't

2929
02:39:48,992 --> 02:39:50,016
All of that

2930
02:39:50,528 --> 02:39:51,296
Worried about

2931
02:39:51,808 --> 02:39:53,344
The consequences of him doing some

2932
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:58,720
I'm through talks about how people who have threatened him in the past

2933
02:39:59,232 --> 02:40:00,000
Have gone to prison

2934
02:40:00,768 --> 02:40:02,560
And then things really spiral completely out of

2935
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:04,096
By the way

2936
02:40:04,864 --> 02:40:06,912
More than 20 people that have threatened us

2937
02:40:07,424 --> 02:40:08,192
At my crib

2938
02:40:08,448 --> 02:40:08,960
Prison

2939
02:40:09,472 --> 02:40:11,264
People threaten to kill George Bush

2940
02:40:13,568 --> 02:40:14,080
What's prison

2941
02:40:14,592 --> 02:40:16,128
Those are people who are threatening

2942
02:40:16,384 --> 02:40:17,408
Those are your fans

2943
02:40:17,664 --> 02:40:20,736
Who are threatening Obama in the comments section of your website

2944
02:40:21,248 --> 02:40:22,528
Put on you for

2945
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:24,832
Heading over the IP addresses I guess

2946
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:28,160
I think that's probably you can't

2947
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:33,280
I know where the lines better than this but those are people who threatened

2948
02:40:33,536 --> 02:40:34,304
You right

2949
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:35,072
Flights

2950
02:40:39,936 --> 02:40:41,728
You're not offensively

2951
02:40:44,032 --> 02:40:47,104
$100,000 reward

2952
02:40:47,872 --> 02:40:48,384
Monday

2953
02:40:51,456 --> 02:40:52,736
Never arrested

2954
02:40:54,272 --> 02:40:55,296
You get $10,000

2955
02:40:56,576 --> 02:40:57,344
What are convicted

2956
02:40:58,624 --> 02:40:59,392
Thousand

2957
02:40:59,648 --> 02:41:00,160
Dollars

2958
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:01,952
Now

2959
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:04,512
I wonder who during discovery

2960
02:41:07,584 --> 02:41:08,352
Out of Millions

2961
02:41:10,144 --> 02:41:10,912
I don't know

2962
02:41:11,424 --> 02:41:13,472
I just think people are smart enough

2963
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:15,008
Nowhere

2964
02:41:15,264 --> 02:41:16,288
I asked

2965
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:17,568
1

2966
02:41:17,824 --> 02:41:18,336
100

2967
02:41:18,592 --> 02:41:19,360
Thousand

2968
02:41:19,616 --> 02:41:20,384
Dollars

2969
02:41:26,528 --> 02:41:27,040
200

2970
02:41:27,296 --> 02:41:28,064
Don't know why

2971
02:41:30,112 --> 02:41:30,880
$1000000

2972
02:41:32,928 --> 02:41:33,696
1 million

2973
02:41:36,768 --> 02:41:38,560
I'll sell my house

2974
02:41:39,072 --> 02:41:39,584
1

2975
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:42,144
Million dollars on conviction

2976
02:41:45,728 --> 02:41:46,752
$1000000

2977
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,544
This doesn't help any

2978
02:41:49,312 --> 02:41:53,152
Like offering a million dollars to people who can search

2979
02:41:53,408 --> 02:41:56,224
Stop the databases or the dark whatever

2980
02:41:56,736 --> 02:41:58,272
It doesn't help in any investigative

2981
02:41:58,528 --> 02:41:59,808
Official

2982
02:42:00,064 --> 02:42:02,368
FBI could do

2983
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:05,952
Any person getting hurt

2984
02:42:06,208 --> 02:42:06,976
Is not a cheap

2985
02:42:07,232 --> 02:42:08,256
Buy whatever you're doing

2986
02:42:09,024 --> 02:42:09,536
It's

2987
02:42:10,048 --> 02:42:10,816
Very f*****-up

2988
02:42:11,072 --> 02:42:12,352
Especially when you're

2989
02:42:13,376 --> 02:42:14,400
Insinuating

2990
02:42:17,472 --> 02:42:18,496
Law Firm

2991
02:42:18,752 --> 02:42:23,104
People got you

2992
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:28,480
Megafactories

2993
02:42:28,992 --> 02:42:31,808
Because you can see the beginning of the insinuation there

2994
02:42:32,064 --> 02:42:38,208
Who Woulda known in the middle of your hook for sure

2995
02:42:38,464 --> 02:42:41,024
For sure

2996
02:42:45,376 --> 02:42:48,448
Cuz every video I know he's going to go off on the

2997
02:42:48,704 --> 02:42:49,472
Wild

2998
02:42:55,872 --> 02:42:56,640
This this

2999
02:42:57,408 --> 02:42:57,920
These clips

3000
02:42:58,432 --> 02:42:59,200
That going on back

3001
02:42:59,456 --> 02:43:00,992
And the preemptive sales pitch

3002
02:43:02,272 --> 02:43:07,136
I don't want to rely on my feelings or like my ability to

3003
02:43:07,392 --> 02:43:08,672
Into it whatever it is out

3004
02:43:08,928 --> 02:43:09,440
What's Theodore didn't

3005
02:43:10,464 --> 02:43:10,976
But

3006
02:43:11,488 --> 02:43:15,584
I've heard him lie 10 billion times

3007
02:43:16,096 --> 02:43:18,144
And it doesn't sound like

3008
02:43:19,936 --> 02:43:20,704
God this is

3009
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:21,728
This is such a bummer

3010
02:43:21,984 --> 02:43:22,496
Cuz this is

3011
02:43:22,752 --> 02:43:24,032
I wouldn't be surprised

3012
02:43:24,288 --> 02:43:25,568
If he was overjoyed

3013
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:26,848
When the FBI file

3014
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:28,640
Cuz he was like I can

3015
02:43:29,152 --> 02:43:29,920
Ride this

3016
02:43:30,176 --> 02:43:31,712
Look I'm probably

3017
02:43:32,224 --> 02:43:36,576
Intersection of

3018
02:43:36,832 --> 02:43:37,856
Joy and anger

3019
02:43:38,112 --> 02:43:39,392
Quotes for him

3020
02:43:40,416 --> 02:43:41,440
Intertwine so

3021
02:43:41,696 --> 02:43:47,072
But he has it's the same thing we talked about back in the 2013 stop when Buzz bissinger

3022
02:43:47,328 --> 02:43:48,096
Legitimately

3023
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:49,120
Threatened to shoot him

3024
02:43:52,192 --> 02:43:53,472
Hope was Alex when that

3025
02:43:57,312 --> 02:43:58,336
Justifiable position

3026
02:43:58,592 --> 02:44:00,896
You be like

3027
02:44:02,688 --> 02:44:03,200
From everything

3028
02:44:06,016 --> 02:44:07,040
Bad actor

3029
02:44:07,296 --> 02:44:08,832
Tried to

3030
02:44:09,088 --> 02:44:09,856
Yep

3031
02:44:10,112 --> 02:44:10,880
Is

3032
02:44:11,648 --> 02:44:12,160
Every way

3033
02:44:13,184 --> 02:44:15,232
Everywhere

3034
02:44:17,024 --> 02:44:21,120
The Gambit doesn't work if someone on his side is guilty of

3035
02:44:21,376 --> 02:44:22,144
Yeah like

3036
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:23,424
It doesn't work this

3037
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:24,960
This propaganda doesn't work

3038
02:44:25,216 --> 02:44:25,984
If the heat

3039
02:44:26,752 --> 02:44:27,264
Anyway

3040
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:28,032
Even if

3041
02:44:28,544 --> 02:44:29,056
Second

3042
02:44:29,568 --> 02:44:32,384
Bit someone within Infowars or himself was

3043
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:33,152
Responsible for

3044
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:35,200
He would never bring it up on the show

3045
02:44:35,456 --> 02:44:40,576
He would never talk about it until the FBI brought it up never make it public

3046
02:44:40,832 --> 02:44:41,600
Display out of it

3047
02:44:41,856 --> 02:44:43,392
Even in terms of getting ahead of the

3048
02:44:43,648 --> 02:44:47,744
The story wouldn't be worthwhile because the facts of the case came out

3049
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:51,072
He will be like also apologize

3050
02:44:52,096 --> 02:44:58,240
No because

3051
02:44:58,496 --> 02:44:59,776
Who knows

3052
02:45:00,032 --> 02:45:03,104
Joint Base on my sense of him for a

3053
02:45:04,384 --> 02:45:05,152
Studying his behave

3054
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:07,200
I would bet 95%

3055
02:45:07,712 --> 02:45:08,992
Everything I own

3056
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:11,808
And that other 5% would just be

3057
02:45:12,832 --> 02:45:13,600
I'll write that off

3058
02:45:13,856 --> 02:45:14,368
Yeah

3059
02:45:14,624 --> 02:45:15,392
Iiii

3060
02:45:17,952 --> 02:45:18,976
It does seem

3061
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:20,256
Tumi

3062
02:45:20,512 --> 02:45:21,024
Like

3063
02:45:21,536 --> 02:45:22,304
Opportunist

3064
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:23,328
Yeah

3065
02:45:25,888 --> 02:45:26,912
Like person doing it is

3066
02:45:28,448 --> 02:45:29,472
Stray bat

3067
02:45:31,008 --> 02:45:31,520
Somebody

3068
02:45:31,776 --> 02:45:33,824
Really ill well or someone

3069
02:45:35,616 --> 02:45:37,152
Somebody really f***** up

3070
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:38,944
What do you mean I mean

3071
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:39,968
Really fat

3072
02:45:46,368 --> 02:45:49,696
I don't think there's any possibility anybody involved

3073
02:45:54,304 --> 02:45:56,864
Like you said there is a little bit of a freak out

3074
02:45:59,168 --> 02:45:59,936
1

3075
02:46:00,448 --> 02:46:01,216
Million

3076
02:46:01,728 --> 02:46:03,008
Dollars

3077
02:46:03,519 --> 02:46:05,823
When you call up or we'll protect you

3078
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:08,383
We found the c*********

3079
02:46:09,151 --> 02:46:11,199
I like women with big giant

3080
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:12,479
That's a big ass

3081
02:46:13,247 --> 02:46:15,551
I don't like kids like you goddamn rapist

3082
02:46:17,855 --> 02:46:21,183
You father going to get it you f****** child molester

3083
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:27,327
I don't want you to leave it radio

3084
02:46:28,607 --> 02:46:31,935
I don't care you're trying to set me up a child born I'm going to get your ass

3085
02:46:32,447 --> 02:46:36,799
$1000000 $1000000 you little gang member

3086
02:46:37,823 --> 02:46:39,359
$1000000

3087
02:46:39,615 --> 02:46:40,895
Temperature at on a pike

3088
02:46:41,919 --> 02:46:43,455
$1000000 b****

3089
02:46:44,735 --> 02:46:45,247
I'm going to

3090
02:46:49,087 --> 02:46:52,159
You're not going to ever defeat Texas usaccess yet

3091
02:46:52,927 --> 02:46:54,207
So you get ready for that

3092
02:46:54,719 --> 02:46:57,023
I'm pissed right now

3093
02:47:02,911 --> 02:47:03,935
And this is

3094
02:47:04,191 --> 02:47:05,215
Because when Norm

3095
02:47:06,239 --> 02:47:08,031
Finally is allowed to talk about

3096
02:47:08,287 --> 02:47:10,335
Screaming you makes a really good point

3097
02:47:10,591 --> 02:47:12,127
Really text right now

3098
02:47:13,663 --> 02:47:14,943
This goddamn ocean anymore

3099
02:47:15,199 --> 02:47:17,247
You should have talked to me about the

3100
02:47:17,759 --> 02:47:21,343
Reward structured

3101
02:47:21,599 --> 02:47:27,743
But this is me, lawyer any food behoove you to listen from time to time

3102
02:47:27,999 --> 02:47:29,023
Potential Witness

3103
02:47:34,143 --> 02:47:35,935
Thousand Dollar General

3104
02:47:36,447 --> 02:47:37,471
1

3105
02:47:41,055 --> 02:47:43,103
So let's talk about what happened here

3106
02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:44,639
I was

3107
02:47:45,151 --> 02:47:49,759
I didn't say that I just don't want you to create an interest in the outcome of a person who testified

3108
02:47:50,015 --> 02:47:54,367
Because they now have it Thursday contingent interest until

3109
02:47:54,623 --> 02:47:58,463
Difference in having a contingent officially test

3110
02:47:58,719 --> 02:48:01,279
You trying to explain

3111
02:48:01,535 --> 02:48:03,071
If you give out money for

3112
02:48:03,327 --> 02:48:09,471
You can't have them testify whatever information they find it probably

3113
02:48:16,127 --> 02:48:18,431
His lawyers very clearly pointing out even

3114
02:48:18,687 --> 02:48:19,199
Dick best

3115
02:48:20,479 --> 02:48:23,295
To the bottom of it through this route you probably ruined your face against

3116
02:48:24,063 --> 02:48:26,367
Let the professionals deal with this

3117
02:48:27,391 --> 02:48:29,183
Norma's is really trying

3118
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:30,463
To set out

3119
02:48:30,719 --> 02:48:31,743
Text rape

3120
02:48:31,999 --> 02:48:32,511
And angry

3121
02:48:34,303 --> 02:48:35,327
Just won't listen to me

3122
02:48:35,583 --> 02:48:36,607
Brought

3123
02:48:36,863 --> 02:48:39,679
I'm specifically for this and you won't let him talk

3124
02:48:39,935 --> 02:48:45,055
Child pronography into your email account

3125
02:48:45,311 --> 02:48:46,335
Hoping that you would open it

3126
02:48:46,591 --> 02:48:48,639
So that when you opened it there would be direct

3127
02:48:48,895 --> 02:48:54,015
Evidence that you would viewed knowingly and tile board

3128
02:48:54,271 --> 02:48:56,319
Out of hundreds of thousands of emails they got

3129
02:48:56,575 --> 02:49:00,415
What a nice present

3130
02:49:00,671 --> 02:49:01,183
House of

3131
02:49:01,439 --> 02:49:02,207
Rising

3132
02:49:02,463 --> 02:49:05,535
What nice people kissing Maddie

3133
02:49:05,791 --> 02:49:07,071
Chris Maddie

3134
02:49:07,327 --> 02:49:08,607
Let's zoom in on

3135
02:49:16,031 --> 02:49:22,175
So what you did there is he had the the document cam zoom in on a picture on a printed out of paper

3136
02:49:22,431 --> 02:49:25,247
This guy Chris

3137
02:49:25,503 --> 02:49:26,015
His face

3138
02:49:26,271 --> 02:49:27,551
He's making a Target out of

3139
02:49:30,111 --> 02:49:30,623
He did

3140
02:49:30,879 --> 02:49:31,647
He really did do that

3141
02:49:32,927 --> 02:49:33,439
That's

3142
02:49:34,719 --> 02:49:36,255
Incitement

3143
02:49:36,767 --> 02:49:40,095
I mean his lawyer's right there

3144
02:49:42,143 --> 02:49:44,703
Barnes is the one that had infection

3145
02:49:47,007 --> 02:49:49,055
Put on me

3146
02:49:55,199 --> 02:49:58,783
I'm not in the kid watch your democratic

3147
02:49:59,039 --> 02:49:59,807
So get ready

3148
02:50:02,367 --> 02:50:06,975
Moorman

3149
02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:09,535
Cuz I'm not an idiot

3150
02:50:09,791 --> 02:50:10,303
So like

3151
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:13,631
Norm is clearly like no

3152
02:50:13,887 --> 02:50:15,423
Like where is Barnes kind of

3153
02:50:16,959 --> 02:50:17,471
Insight

3154
02:50:17,727 --> 02:50:22,591
A little bit

3155
02:50:22,847 --> 02:50:23,615
Norman

3156
02:50:24,895 --> 02:50:25,663
Norman's liquor

3157
02:50:26,175 --> 02:50:26,687
Guys I'm

3158
02:50:34,367 --> 02:50:36,927
You can tell

3159
02:50:37,183 --> 02:50:40,255
He is exasperated he's trying to explain to Alex

3160
02:50:40,511 --> 02:50:41,279
The correct way to

3161
02:50:41,535 --> 02:50:42,559
To deal with something like this

3162
02:50:43,071 --> 02:50:45,119
And Alex will not hear it because

3163
02:50:45,375 --> 02:50:45,887
He is

3164
02:50:46,143 --> 02:50:47,679
So full of Rage

3165
02:50:48,703 --> 02:50:50,751
Alex

3166
02:50:51,775 --> 02:50:52,287
Praying

3167
02:50:52,543 --> 02:50:53,567
About how he would like this

3168
02:50:53,823 --> 02:50:56,639
Turn out and I think because of past context clues

3169
02:50:56,895 --> 02:50:58,943
This sounds a lot more f***** up to me that it might

3170
02:50:59,199 --> 02:50:59,711
To someone else

3171
02:51:00,223 --> 02:51:04,319
Fu man asked you to have God

3172
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:10,719
Got anybody God

3173
02:51:10,975 --> 02:51:17,119
Never

3174
02:51:17,375 --> 02:51:23,519
I do not

3175
02:51:27,103 --> 02:51:28,639
So the

3176
02:51:28,895 --> 02:51:29,663
You know all that stuff is

3177
02:51:30,175 --> 02:51:31,199
It's gross but

3178
02:51:32,223 --> 02:51:32,991
Him saying

3179
02:51:33,247 --> 02:51:34,783
Not anybody else God's vengeance

3180
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:37,343
Preclude from

3181
02:51:37,599 --> 02:51:41,439
All the times lately especially we've heard him talking about how

3182
02:51:41,695 --> 02:51:44,255
Yes

3183
02:51:45,791 --> 02:51:46,303
Gen X

3184
02:51:46,559 --> 02:51:47,583
He says that a lot

3185
02:51:47,839 --> 02:51:51,935
So even him saying nobody else is God's vengeance

3186
02:51:52,447 --> 02:51:52,959
That doesn't

3187
02:51:53,215 --> 02:51:55,519
Mean that he's not hoping but someone hurt

3188
02:51:56,287 --> 02:51:58,335
Well I mean he's giving a million-dollar bounty

3189
02:52:01,663 --> 02:52:02,687
That right there is not enough

3190
02:52:02,943 --> 02:52:03,455
Sara Lee

3191
02:52:05,759 --> 02:52:06,527
Stirring a diaper

3192
02:52:09,087 --> 02:52:09,855
Doing things on your own

3193
02:52:12,927 --> 02:52:13,951
He's pushing really hard

3194
02:52:14,207 --> 02:52:14,975
How about the idea

3195
02:52:15,231 --> 02:52:17,279
These people who are working against him

3196
02:52:17,535 --> 02:52:18,303
Sandy Hook

3197
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:19,071
Are the ones

3198
02:52:20,351 --> 02:52:26,495
Norma has been delayed most of it out but I've been fire-breathing today because I pop.

3199
02:52:27,775 --> 02:52:32,895
6 million emails you got hundreds of thousands of the Court

3200
02:52:33,151 --> 02:52:35,967
These are hidden links that they knew were right what to go to

3201
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:40,575
And Obama is just like God

3202
02:52:41,343 --> 02:52:43,647
So shake up their self

3203
02:52:44,159 --> 02:52:46,207
Turn off

3204
02:52:46,463 --> 02:52:48,511
Satistics that I covered it like

3205
02:52:48,767 --> 02:52:49,535
0 point

3206
02:52:49,791 --> 02:52:52,095
2%

3207
02:52:52,863 --> 02:52:54,655
Who I am

3208
02:52:57,983 --> 02:53:01,311
Tyrone

3209
02:53:01,567 --> 02:53:02,335
Filthy lie

3210
02:53:05,151 --> 02:53:05,919
They find

3211
02:53:06,431 --> 02:53:08,735
Grains of sand at the beach

3212
02:53:09,247 --> 02:53:11,551
Find a magic child pronography

3213
02:53:12,831 --> 02:53:14,367
Obvious

3214
02:53:14,879 --> 02:53:15,391
Is that

3215
02:53:15,903 --> 02:53:17,695
Problem in this country

3216
02:53:18,207 --> 02:53:18,975
Obvious

3217
02:53:19,231 --> 02:53:20,255
Your conclusion is

3218
02:53:21,535 --> 02:53:23,327
Like if the world machine to sort

3219
02:53:25,119 --> 02:53:27,167
Very effectively

3220
02:53:27,423 --> 02:53:28,959
Then maybe you could

3221
02:53:29,215 --> 02:53:32,031
Find a grain of sand on a beach

3222
02:53:32,287 --> 02:53:33,311
It's just a matter of computer

3223
02:53:33,567 --> 02:53:36,895
Our then your metaphors Fall Apart

3224
02:53:37,151 --> 02:53:43,039
How do you find a needle in a haystack I do run it through a processor

3225
02:53:43,807 --> 02:53:47,647
It's real nonsensical the idea that like all that magic

3226
02:53:48,415 --> 02:53:48,927
Do you know how this

3227
02:53:49,183 --> 02:53:49,951
You know how it works

3228
02:53:50,463 --> 02:53:51,231
Yeah I think it's fine

3229
02:53:56,095 --> 02:53:57,119
Annex

3230
02:53:57,887 --> 02:53:59,167
Because of the way he's behaving

3231
02:53:59,679 --> 02:54:00,703
I took Norm

3232
02:54:01,215 --> 02:54:04,031
Really tries to politely tell him you should not do this

3233
02:54:04,799 --> 02:54:05,823
And Alex does not under

3234
02:54:07,103 --> 02:54:10,431
I've spoken to Federal prosecutors they regard you as a victim

3235
02:54:17,087 --> 02:54:19,135
The news takeaway nearby

3236
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:22,207
You-know-who

3237
02:54:22,463 --> 02:54:28,607
You are not a suspect you are not a Target you are not a person of interest you are a victim and that's the story

3238
02:54:31,935 --> 02:54:37,567
Are you showing Chris Maddie's photograph Hunter

3239
02:54:38,079 --> 02:54:44,223
Is your adversary in this litigation

3240
02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:45,247
Possibility to take

3241
02:54:45,503 --> 02:54:46,015
Bear Casey

3242
02:54:46,271 --> 02:54:48,831
Heart if I can ask you

3243
02:54:49,087 --> 02:54:50,111
Thinks he owns America

3244
02:54:50,879 --> 02:54:57,023
A personal attack on Chris Mattie I want to find out who sent the email

3245
02:54:57,279 --> 02:55:01,375
That person then I will go to work which Alex Alex Alex

3246
02:55:02,143 --> 02:55:02,911
You understand

3247
02:55:03,167 --> 02:55:05,471
Lynx

3248
02:55:07,263 --> 02:55:09,311
Finding a needle in 5000hd

3249
02:55:13,151 --> 02:55:16,223
Contracted out

3250
02:55:16,479 --> 02:55:22,623
They contracted out to a sophisticated data mining firm and they spent probably $100,000 to go through your email

3251
02:55:23,135 --> 02:55:29,279
Looking for whatever they could find and they did find this you believe that that was placed there and they knew where to look and how to find

3252
02:55:30,047 --> 02:55:32,095
I don't have evidence of that yet

3253
02:55:32,351 --> 02:55:37,471
I represent listen to me young man listen to me

3254
02:55:37,727 --> 02:55:38,751
That sounds dumb right now

3255
02:55:42,847 --> 02:55:43,871
Hit the pause button

3256
02:55:44,127 --> 02:55:45,919
Whoa

3257
02:55:46,943 --> 02:55:48,479
You try it

3258
02:55:52,063 --> 02:55:53,087
Credibly frustrated

3259
02:55:53,599 --> 02:55:54,623
Because I think

3260
02:55:54,879 --> 02:55:55,391
You could have Skype

3261
02:55:56,159 --> 02:55:58,975
Escape Army

3262
02:55:59,231 --> 02:56:01,279
It's all you're going to do is yell over me

3263
02:56:01,535 --> 02:56:02,047
Call me

3264
02:56:02,303 --> 02:56:03,071
Well I think

3265
02:56:03,583 --> 02:56:04,095
From the

3266
02:56:05,119 --> 02:56:08,447
I think that Norm felt

3267
02:56:08,703 --> 02:56:09,215
He could win

3268
02:56:09,471 --> 02:56:10,239
The Sandy Hook lost

3269
02:56:10,495 --> 02:56:13,055
Yeah I think that he felt that he was able

3270
02:56:13,311 --> 02:56:15,359
Is going to be able to win that on a free-speech brown

3271
02:56:15,615 --> 02:56:16,895
Bright like

3272
02:56:19,455 --> 02:56:20,991
And Alex is jeopardizing

3273
02:56:21,247 --> 02:56:22,015
A lot of

3274
02:56:22,527 --> 02:56:23,295
Because if

3275
02:56:23,551 --> 02:56:27,135
I don't know. Sends people to attack the other brother

3276
02:56:27,391 --> 02:56:28,927
VI the other Council

3277
02:56:29,183 --> 02:56:29,695
In the case

3278
02:56:30,207 --> 02:56:33,023
Could be seen as somehow intimidation or

3279
02:56:33,279 --> 02:56:34,303
Or something

3280
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:36,607
You could really be hurting his case here

3281
02:56:37,631 --> 02:56:39,167
I'm sure that Norm didn't think

3282
02:56:39,423 --> 02:56:40,959
This was what he was showing up for

3283
02:56:41,215 --> 02:56:45,055
Of course I'm now he's on

3284
02:56:45,311 --> 02:56:46,847
But he's doing his best to try

3285
02:56:47,103 --> 02:56:47,871
Alex listen

3286
02:56:48,127 --> 02:56:52,735
We don't have evidence

3287
02:56:56,319 --> 02:56:58,367
Alex

3288
02:56:59,647 --> 02:57:00,415
Listening

3289
02:57:01,439 --> 02:57:03,231
I think he is a very different lawyer

3290
02:57:03,487 --> 02:57:05,535
Ben Barnes

3291
02:57:06,047 --> 02:57:08,607
Both both probably on the Steelers

3292
02:57:08,863 --> 02:57:09,631
Unscrupulous

3293
02:57:13,215 --> 02:57:14,495
But based on

3294
02:57:14,751 --> 02:57:18,079
Appearances on Alex's show I would hire.

3295
02:57:18,335 --> 02:57:22,687
One on one

3296
02:57:23,711 --> 02:57:24,991
Come on over here and Barnes

3297
02:57:27,039 --> 02:57:32,159
No no no we're not

3298
02:57:32,415 --> 02:57:35,743
Send the kemetic another party so he can defend him for that

3299
02:57:35,999 --> 02:57:37,279
$1000000

3300
02:57:37,535 --> 02:57:38,815
Great idea

3301
02:57:39,071 --> 02:57:41,887
Everyone in the Infowars universe

3302
02:57:50,079 --> 02:57:50,847
I just think

3303
02:57:51,359 --> 02:57:54,687
I take it there's a level of responsibility that Norm is showing

3304
02:57:54,943 --> 02:57:56,223
Appreciate that

3305
02:57:56,479 --> 02:57:57,247
In the most

3306
02:57:57,503 --> 02:57:58,271
Caustic of Moana

3307
02:57:58,527 --> 02:57:59,551
Here because I

3308
02:58:00,319 --> 02:58:02,879
Take everything away from it

3309
02:58:04,927 --> 02:58:06,975
Flipping out here

3310
02:58:07,231 --> 02:58:10,815
Left to his own devices could very easily get into territory that

3311
02:58:11,327 --> 02:58:13,375
On its own kind of Legally dicey

3312
02:58:13,631 --> 02:58:15,423
Right so I think

3313
02:58:15,679 --> 02:58:16,959
You know you have a guy who

3314
02:58:17,215 --> 02:58:18,751
It's supposed to do it at least

3315
02:58:19,007 --> 02:58:20,799
I'm sublevel be there to protect

3316
02:58:21,567 --> 02:58:24,127
Actually showing up and being a little bit

3317
02:58:24,383 --> 02:58:26,175
Protect ya neck appreciate that

3318
02:58:26,431 --> 02:58:31,807
Even if it's protecting someone who I think sucks the different lawsuits and how they

3319
02:58:32,063 --> 02:58:32,575
Taking out with differ

3320
02:58:32,831 --> 02:58:34,623
Lawyers I would say normal

3321
02:58:34,879 --> 02:58:35,391
Actually trying to win

3322
02:58:41,023 --> 02:58:42,559
To get publicity for wasp

3323
02:58:42,815 --> 02:58:45,375
The publicity of women

3324
02:58:45,631 --> 02:58:51,007
Barnes wants the publicity of just being a controversial

3325
02:58:51,263 --> 02:58:52,031
Whatever

3326
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:54,591
Norman

3327
02:58:54,847 --> 02:58:55,615
Explain to Alex

3328
02:58:55,871 --> 02:58:57,407
It's good to be mad

3329
02:58:57,663 --> 02:59:00,223
You have to be mad at the right person at the right time

3330
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:01,503
In the right degree

3331
02:59:02,015 --> 02:59:03,295
An hour

3332
02:59:04,063 --> 02:59:05,087
When I came down here

3333
02:59:05,343 --> 02:59:10,207
I didn't know who you were that I knew who you were I could place you in the political landscape I hadn't watched your show

3334
02:59:10,463 --> 02:59:13,535
I've made a study of you in the last 3 or 4 months and you've won me over

3335
02:59:13,791 --> 02:59:14,815
Because I think you're an honest

3336
02:59:15,071 --> 02:59:15,839
And angry America

3337
02:59:16,351 --> 02:59:22,239
But sometimes you're not angry at the right things and sometimes

3338
02:59:22,495 --> 02:59:23,263
Chalkboard

3339
02:59:23,519 --> 02:59:24,031

3342
02:59:37,343 --> 02:59:38,623
Message

3343
02:59:38,879 --> 02:59:44,255
And you know you feds they're going to know you did it they're going to get your ass you little dirtbag

3344
02:59:44,511 --> 02:59:45,791
1 million bench

3345
02:59:46,047 --> 02:59:47,071
Rass

3346
02:59:47,839 --> 02:59:53,983
Well if your lawnmower

3347
02:59:54,495 --> 02:59:56,031
Okay iru you have

3348
02:59:56,287 --> 02:59:59,103
Every reason to be too

3349
02:59:59,359 --> 03:00:00,895
1 million is on the street

3350
03:00:01,407 --> 03:00:02,175
So I mean

3351
03:00:03,199 --> 03:00:05,759
This is a one-track mind

3352
03:00:06,015 --> 03:00:06,527
He's a child

3353
03:00:07,039 --> 03:00:08,063
Yeah but if it's

3354
03:00:08,319 --> 03:00:09,087
It's not like

3355
03:00:09,343 --> 03:00:11,391
Like normal trying to address the issue

3356
03:00:11,647 --> 03:00:13,951
The real situation but Alex

3357
03:00:14,463 --> 03:00:17,535
Which leads me to believe that it probably is a real thing

3358
03:00:17,791 --> 03:00:21,119
Yeah you're looking for was just Alex talking about it there would be any Thunder.

3359
03:00:23,423 --> 03:00:25,471
You don't know what the f*** the reality is

3360
03:00:25,727 --> 03:00:30,335
But the fact is talking about it's in touch with

3361
03:00:30,591 --> 03:00:32,895
It does lead me to believe that this would be a much

3362
03:00:33,151 --> 03:00:38,271
Larger and weirder publicity stunt

3363
03:00:38,527 --> 03:00:40,575
If it was boring

3364
03:00:41,855 --> 03:00:44,159
Still

3365
03:00:45,695 --> 03:00:48,767
I think it must be a real situation

3366
03:00:49,023 --> 03:00:50,815
So above it or whatever

3367
03:00:51,839 --> 03:00:53,119
All about this

3368
03:00:53,631 --> 03:00:54,143
This bounty

3369
03:00:56,191 --> 03:00:56,703
Turn this into

3370
03:00:56,959 --> 03:00:57,727
Victimhood.

3371
03:00:57,983 --> 03:00:59,007
Excitement of the hunt

3372
03:00:59,519 --> 03:01:01,311
If there's so many things you could use

3373
03:01:02,847 --> 03:01:06,943
Yeah but

3374
03:01:07,455 --> 03:01:08,223
Like the mix

3375
03:01:08,479 --> 03:01:12,319
Picture of do you not like I can understand

3376
03:01:13,087 --> 03:01:14,367
Like the mixture of

3377
03:01:14,623 --> 03:01:15,135
Terror and

3378
03:01:15,391 --> 03:01:15,903
Yuri

3379
03:01:16,159 --> 03:01:17,695
That could come along with

3380
03:01:17,951 --> 03:01:21,535
Obviously

3381
03:01:32,287 --> 03:01:32,799
Like this

3382
03:01:33,055 --> 03:01:34,847
Square your unfairly

3383
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:35,871
Attract

3384
03:01:37,407 --> 03:01:38,687
Disgusting

3385
03:01:38,943 --> 03:01:40,479
There is a visceral

3386
03:01:40,735 --> 03:01:42,015
Nature to it

3387
03:01:42,271 --> 03:01:44,063
Acting like this

3388
03:01:44,319 --> 03:01:49,695
Yeah 100 million dollars to find the guy

3389
03:01:49,951 --> 03:01:52,255
With your lawyer

3390
03:01:52,511 --> 03:01:53,279
Is not

3391
03:01:53,535 --> 03:01:55,071
Acceptable

3392
03:01:55,327 --> 03:01:56,863
It implies some sort of

3393
03:01:59,679 --> 03:02:00,191
Foreman

3394
03:02:00,959 --> 03:02:02,495
And that's what I sent more than any

3395
03:02:02,751 --> 03:02:06,591
Has nothing to do with

3396
03:02:07,103 --> 03:02:09,407
That he's covering up anything I think it's just

3397
03:02:10,175 --> 03:02:12,479
The way he works is so based on

3398
03:02:12,735 --> 03:02:13,247
Trying to catch

3399
03:02:13,759 --> 03:02:14,271
Retention

3400
03:02:14,527 --> 03:02:16,063
And this is a really good way to

3401
03:02:18,111 --> 03:02:19,391
He thinks that he can spin

3402
03:02:19,647 --> 03:02:20,671
Really well to do it

3403
03:02:20,927 --> 03:02:22,719
That's the entire vibe that I get

3404
03:02:22,975 --> 03:02:26,303
That's why I'm not interested in having dorm talk about the actual situation

3405
03:02:26,559 --> 03:02:29,887
Wants to derail

3406
03:02:31,167 --> 03:02:32,703
It does seem like normal so does

3407
03:02:32,959 --> 03:02:33,471
Doesn't know that I like

3408
03:02:35,007 --> 03:02:36,031
What

3409
03:02:36,287 --> 03:02:40,895
No this is what it was getting

3410
03:02:41,151 --> 03:02:43,199
And he hasn't figured it out

3411
03:02:43,455 --> 03:02:44,735
Provide

3412
03:02:44,991 --> 03:02:45,503
Good

3413
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:49,855
Yeah he doesn't realize that he's a prophet

3414
03:02:50,623 --> 03:02:51,391
Anybody else

3415
03:02:52,415 --> 03:02:53,183
The dawn on him

3416
03:02:59,071 --> 03:02:59,583
Keeps going

3417
03:02:59,839 --> 03:03:01,631
Temperature for sleep

3418
03:03:02,143 --> 03:03:02,655
Jerk

3419
03:03:03,167 --> 03:03:06,495
Cuz your own buddies are going to turn you in and you're going to go to prison

3420
03:03:10,079 --> 03:03:11,103
Stop

3421
03:03:13,151 --> 03:03:15,967
I can't handle this one

3422
03:03:24,927 --> 03:03:27,487
Will be the real American and the real American

3423
03:03:27,743 --> 03:03:33,887
Attacks the right target

3424
03:03:48,223 --> 03:03:50,527
Billion

3425
03:03:51,039 --> 03:03:53,855
Against you

3426
03:03:56,415 --> 03:03:57,439
Time b****

3427
03:03:58,207 --> 03:04:04,351
Visual

3428
03:04:04,863 --> 03:04:08,703
The shake music

3429
03:04:09,727 --> 03:04:10,495
It's crazy

3430
03:04:10,751 --> 03:04:14,847
He's sitting there in his is space force t-shirt

3431
03:04:16,127 --> 03:04:17,407
Like eyes

3432
03:04:17,663 --> 03:04:21,503
Giada around me

3433
03:04:21,759 --> 03:04:22,271
Yeah

3434
03:04:22,527 --> 03:04:23,551
It's a it's a

3435
03:04:25,343 --> 03:04:26,111
Making light

3436
03:04:26,367 --> 03:04:28,159
Kind of a very serious thing

3437
03:04:28,415 --> 03:04:34,303
The trafficking of illegal pornography

3438
03:04:34,559 --> 03:04:35,839
If it wasn't using that

3439
03:04:36,095 --> 03:04:37,631
Is kind of a prop for his own

3440
03:04:37,887 --> 03:04:40,447
Publicity is life

3441
03:04:41,983 --> 03:04:43,775
The person who sent it is obviously

3442
03:04:44,031 --> 03:04:44,799
The biggest

3443
03:04:45,311 --> 03:04:45,823
Problem

3444
03:04:46,079 --> 03:04:46,847
When this whole thing

3445
03:04:49,151 --> 03:04:51,199
It is absolutely exploitative still up

3446
03:04:51,455 --> 03:04:51,967
The situation

3447
03:04:52,479 --> 03:04:53,503
And it's just

3448
03:04:54,015 --> 03:04:55,551
It would be incredibly,

3449
03:04:56,063 --> 03:04:57,599
Absent

3450
03:04:59,135 --> 03:04:59,647
Him

3451
03:04:59,903 --> 03:05:00,927
Just going

3452
03:05:01,439 --> 03:05:03,743
Just go into town while his lawyer is annoyed

3453
03:05:05,023 --> 03:05:05,791
Is a comical picture

3454
03:05:06,047 --> 03:05:07,839
There's no way you could have done

3455
03:05:08,095 --> 03:05:08,607
The first

3456
03:05:09,887 --> 03:05:10,911
Are the first however

3457
03:05:11,167 --> 03:05:11,679
How many hours of

3458
03:05:11,935 --> 03:05:12,447
This show

3459
03:05:13,983 --> 03:05:15,519
Pulled it off so

3460
03:05:16,031 --> 03:05:17,823
Like it was just a regular episode of a

3461
03:05:18,335 --> 03:05:20,127
And then got junk

3462
03:05:21,919 --> 03:05:22,431
Floated

3463
03:05:22,687 --> 03:05:23,711
If This Were something that

3464
03:05:24,735 --> 03:05:26,271
Spell tour or secretly thought

3465
03:05:26,527 --> 03:05:27,039
Somebody a nympho

3466
03:05:28,063 --> 03:05:30,111
I don't think so at all

3467
03:05:30,623 --> 03:05:32,927
It would be something where you take the day

3468
03:05:33,183 --> 03:05:34,207
Take the day and beat with

3469
03:05:34,463 --> 03:05:35,743
Norwalk Fair

3470
03:05:35,999 --> 03:05:40,607
I considered the possibility to

3471
03:05:40,863 --> 03:05:41,375
He can't

3472
03:05:41,631 --> 03:05:44,191
Like he needs the money flow come again

3473
03:05:44,447 --> 03:05:46,495
You take the day off and has like

3474
03:05:47,007 --> 03:05:48,543
That slows things down

3475
03:05:48,799 --> 03:05:50,079
For sure

3476
03:05:50,335 --> 03:05:50,847
As for the

3477
03:05:51,103 --> 03:05:51,615
Desales

3478
03:05:52,127 --> 03:05:55,199
They've been pretty clear about the idea

3479
03:05:56,223 --> 03:05:57,759
Breakfast

3480
03:05:58,015 --> 03:05:58,783
Pushes.

3481
03:05:59,039 --> 03:05:59,551
So

3482
03:05:59,807 --> 03:06:01,343
I do think there's a possibility that

3483
03:06:01,599 --> 03:06:03,135
Afford to take a day off

3484
03:06:05,439 --> 03:06:05,951
Come into

3485
03:06:06,207 --> 03:06:08,255
2 hours early and meet with Norm

3486
03:06:08,511 --> 03:06:10,047
Get squared up

3487
03:06:10,303 --> 03:06:14,911
And then do your show and don't do that I need to get any kind of guilty conscience

3488
03:06:16,191 --> 03:06:19,519
Monster

3489
03:06:20,543 --> 03:06:21,055
Maybe

3490
03:06:21,311 --> 03:06:24,127
You need the business to keep going but

3491
03:06:24,383 --> 03:06:25,407
I would say

3492
03:06:25,663 --> 03:06:27,455
Staying out of jail for

3493
03:06:27,711 --> 03:06:28,223
That

3494
03:06:28,735 --> 03:06:30,015
Glee was worth

3495
03:06:30,271 --> 03:06:31,807
Far more than anything your business

3496
03:06:35,903 --> 03:06:38,463
If it's one of his employees that destroys a business

3497
03:06:39,231 --> 03:06:40,767
Like that

3498
03:06:41,023 --> 03:06:42,815
Very hard for him

3499
03:06:43,327 --> 03:06:44,607
Recover from that

3500
03:06:45,119 --> 03:06:47,423
And that's a good why you wouldn't preemptively do so

3501
03:06:47,679 --> 03:06:48,447
Something like that

3502
03:06:48,703 --> 03:06:51,775
You don't that this isn't damage control is anyone's guilty

3503
03:06:52,031 --> 03:06:54,079
Yeah

3504
03:06:54,335 --> 03:06:55,615
It doesn't fly that way

3505
03:06:55,871 --> 03:06:59,967
Yourself

3506
03:07:00,479 --> 03:07:04,575
Which makes me think it's exactly what he would say

3507
03:07:05,087 --> 03:07:05,599
Yep

3508
03:07:05,855 --> 03:07:07,647
Yeah the the consequence

3509
03:07:07,903 --> 03:07:11,743
Will be unintended and probably

3510
03:07:11,999 --> 03:07:13,791
Nothing nothing is good

3511
03:07:16,607 --> 03:07:17,119
To take it personal

3512
03:07:17,631 --> 03:07:18,143
Alex

3513
03:07:18,399 --> 03:07:19,679
Is feeling to act like

3514
03:07:19,935 --> 03:07:20,959
He's not extreme enough

3515
03:07:22,239 --> 03:07:23,007
Analysis

3516
03:07:24,031 --> 03:07:25,823
You will win the lawsuit in Sandy Hook

3517
03:07:26,079 --> 03:07:30,431
Is a matter of law it was protected speech and not tip amatory in it

3518
03:07:36,319 --> 03:07:42,463
The plan that some as-yet identified person engaged in we have to identify that person

3519
03:07:42,719 --> 03:07:43,487
Haitian hard to prove it

3520
03:07:46,559 --> 03:07:48,351
U.s. attorney's appointment

3521
03:07:50,399 --> 03:07:51,423
Up

3522
03:07:59,615 --> 03:08:00,127
I'm sure

3523
03:08:00,383 --> 03:08:04,735
This is a conversation on one end

3524
03:08:05,247 --> 03:08:07,039
Just a drunk idiot on the other

3525
03:08:07,551 --> 03:08:09,599
So when we wrap this up Alex

3526
03:08:12,415 --> 03:08:12,927
F****** Norm

3527
03:08:16,511 --> 03:08:17,023
Make sure that

3528
03:08:17,279 --> 03:08:18,047
He declares war

3529
03:08:18,303 --> 03:08:21,119
Do you have to call his banners

3530
03:08:22,143 --> 03:08:28,287
Oh it's called feudal Lords underneath

3531
03:08:28,543 --> 03:08:30,335
A good crew

3532
03:08:36,735 --> 03:08:38,015
If You Want Blood

3533
03:08:38,783 --> 03:08:40,063
Blood on the streets man

3534
03:08:40,831 --> 03:08:43,391
I am not going to sit here in my life

3535
03:08:43,903 --> 03:08:46,975
And have these dirtbags

3536
03:08:47,231 --> 03:08:49,279
And he had nowhere to go

3537
03:08:52,607 --> 03:08:54,655
It's ridiculous out obviously

3538
03:09:03,103 --> 03:09:03,871
So get ready

3539
03:09:04,639 --> 03:09:07,199
And I'm just asking the Pentagon in the Patriots that are left

3540
03:09:17,951 --> 03:09:21,279
Summon the meme War I summon

3541
03:09:21,535 --> 03:09:25,119
I will never sell out to these people

3542
03:09:26,911 --> 03:09:29,215
Mom

3543
03:09:29,471 --> 03:09:34,591
Norvasc realized why am I here

3544
03:09:37,663 --> 03:09:39,199
So

3545
03:09:39,967 --> 03:09:42,015
I understand the

3546
03:09:42,271 --> 03:09:44,063
The sort of investigative power

3547
03:09:44,319 --> 03:09:45,087
I guess

3548
03:09:45,599 --> 03:09:49,439
People in like 14 and 18

3549
03:09:49,951 --> 03:09:50,975
On the

3550
03:09:51,231 --> 03:09:53,535
Legally dicey sorry for you or I to do it

3551
03:09:53,791 --> 03:09:55,071
Cuz we don't

3552
03:09:55,583 --> 03:09:56,863
Those sorts

3553
03:09:57,119 --> 03:09:59,935
The world

3554
03:10:00,447 --> 03:10:01,471
I don't even have a

3555
03:10:01,727 --> 03:10:02,239
A VP

3556
03:10:04,543 --> 03:10:05,055
Could handle that

3557
03:10:05,567 --> 03:10:06,079
Like

3558
03:10:06,591 --> 03:10:08,895
The group of

3559
03:10:09,151 --> 03:10:10,175
People

3560
03:10:10,431 --> 03:10:11,711
Calling

3561
03:10:12,223 --> 03:10:14,783
Investigation

3562
03:10:15,295 --> 03:10:16,063
Wouldn't cover

3563
03:10:16,575 --> 03:10:18,367
But you know what those people do do

3564
03:10:18,623 --> 03:10:19,391
Detox people

3565
03:10:21,183 --> 03:10:21,695
People

3566
03:10:21,951 --> 03:10:25,023
Engaged towards attack

3567
03:10:25,535 --> 03:10:28,607
I mean I'm going to leave the Patriots in the Pentagon

3568
03:10:28,863 --> 03:10:29,375
Acai

3569
03:10:33,471 --> 03:10:36,031
The dod head is like we got to get this done

3570
03:10:37,055 --> 03:10:40,127
I think what he's doing is only introducing his

3571
03:10:41,919 --> 03:10:43,199
Blood on the streets

3572
03:10:43,455 --> 03:10:44,479
Desires

3573
03:10:44,991 --> 03:10:45,503
Into a world

3574
03:10:45,759 --> 03:10:47,039
Full of people that have

3575
03:10:50,879 --> 03:10:52,671
Causing innocent blood

3576
03:10:54,463 --> 03:10:55,487
Metaphoric

3577
03:10:55,743 --> 03:10:59,071
And it's pretty hard to imagine Metallica's

3578
03:10:59,583 --> 03:11:01,375
So I'm torn between

3579
03:11:01,631 --> 03:11:02,399
I'm torn between

3580
03:11:04,447 --> 03:11:05,983
The idea of

3581
03:11:07,007 --> 03:11:07,519
The X

3582
03:11:09,055 --> 03:11:09,567
Attention

3583
03:11:09,823 --> 03:11:10,591
PR stuff

3584
03:11:11,359 --> 03:11:14,943
Because I definitely

3585
03:11:15,967 --> 03:11:18,271
And then the other side of me is turned towards

3586
03:11:18,783 --> 03:11:19,295
Alex's

3587
03:11:19,551 --> 03:11:21,087
Lately been really

3588
03:11:24,671 --> 03:11:26,975
He has been using a lot of rhetoric that

3589
03:11:27,231 --> 03:11:28,511
It gets very close

3590
03:11:28,767 --> 03:11:29,535
To what

3591
03:11:29,791 --> 03:11:33,375
You might call like a targeted these people should be f******

3592
03:11:33,631 --> 03:11:34,143
Taken care of

3593
03:11:34,655 --> 03:11:40,799
And so when I hear stuff like this and he's banging on a picture of Chris Maddie and not listening to his lawyer tell him

3594
03:11:41,055 --> 03:11:43,359
We don't know that this is the person

3595
03:11:48,223 --> 03:11:52,575
Million dollars Blood on the streets tonight

3596
03:11:52,831 --> 03:11:53,343
Yeah

3597
03:11:54,111 --> 03:11:54,879
I don't

3598
03:11:55,647 --> 03:11:58,207
I find it hard not to hear that and think

3599
03:11:58,719 --> 03:11:59,999
Well someone word

3600
03:12:00,255 --> 03:12:02,559
Galaxy

3601
03:12:03,071 --> 03:12:04,351
It's hard not to hear that

3602
03:12:04,607 --> 03:12:05,119
I don't

3603
03:12:05,375 --> 03:12:08,191
I don't know what his primary motivation is and I'm not sure he does

3604
03:12:08,703 --> 03:12:10,751
Even I don't know if he knows what he's doing any

3605
03:12:12,287 --> 03:12:13,311
Just straight

3606
03:12:13,567 --> 03:12:14,079
Yeah

3607
03:12:14,591 --> 03:12:15,871
Attention desires

3608
03:12:16,127 --> 03:12:16,639
And booze

3609
03:12:17,151 --> 03:12:19,199
Yeah

3610
03:12:19,455 --> 03:12:19,967
The stuff

3611
03:12:20,223 --> 03:12:21,247
Cuz I was sent

3612
03:12:24,063 --> 03:12:25,343
Really seems like

3613
03:12:25,855 --> 03:12:27,135
People not us

3614
03:12:31,231 --> 03:12:34,047
Is everybody should just stop and call us before you

3615
03:12:35,327 --> 03:12:40,959
Something about

3616
03:12:41,215 --> 03:12:47,103
Can chicks with big tits

3617
03:12:47,615 --> 03:12:48,127
Of this

3618
03:12:48,383 --> 03:12:50,175
Freak out

3619
03:12:50,431 --> 03:12:50,943
Play

3620
03:12:51,199 --> 03:12:54,527
It is very crucial to the end

3621
03:12:56,575 --> 03:12:58,879
My position is that I don't believe Alex is guilty

3622
03:12:59,135 --> 03:13:00,159
And I think that

3623
03:13:00,415 --> 03:13:01,439
Were he to be

3624
03:13:01,695 --> 03:13:02,463
This would be

3625
03:13:02,719 --> 03:13:03,743
The ballsiest thing

3626
03:13:06,559 --> 03:13:07,839
His pattern

3627
03:13:08,351 --> 03:13:11,935
Yeah

3628
03:13:13,215 --> 03:13:17,055
At the same time information come out the contradicts what I

3629
03:13:17,311 --> 03:13:19,615
Suggestion I believe right now

3630
03:13:19,871 --> 03:13:24,479
I'm willing to believe it's possible

3631
03:13:24,735 --> 03:13:26,527
The situation is contingent on the information

3632
03:13:26,783 --> 03:13:27,807
And it's available right now

3633
03:13:28,063 --> 03:13:28,831
That could all change

3634
03:13:29,343 --> 03:13:31,903
I don't believe I do not appreciate people say

3635
03:13:32,159 --> 03:13:32,927
Suggesting

3636
03:13:33,439 --> 03:13:33,951
Face off against

3637
03:13:34,207 --> 03:13:35,743
Information that is available now

3638
03:13:35,999 --> 03:13:38,303
You have your own opinion

3639
03:13:38,815 --> 03:13:39,583
I think it's dumb

3640
03:13:39,839 --> 03:13:40,863
I think it plays into

3641
03:13:41,119 --> 03:13:42,655
Is victimhood narrative

3642
03:13:42,911 --> 03:13:44,447
And his ability to

3643
03:13:44,703 --> 03:13:45,471
Make

3644
03:13:45,983 --> 03:13:46,495
Money also

3645
03:13:47,007 --> 03:13:48,287
So I just think it's on

3646
03:13:49,567 --> 03:13:51,103
It's Manny

3647
03:13:52,127 --> 03:13:52,639
Jumping up

3648
03:13:53,919 --> 03:13:54,943
Bright

3649
03:13:55,199 --> 03:13:55,711
Which of the

3650
03:13:55,967 --> 03:13:57,759
Pleasure

3651
03:13:58,271 --> 03:14:01,087
It's kind of like

3652
03:14:01,343 --> 03:14:02,623
I think he knows what he's doing

3653
03:14:02,879 --> 03:14:03,391
He's trying to go

3654
03:14:03,647 --> 03:14:04,159
Get this guy killed

3655
03:14:04,671 --> 03:14:06,975
Because he

3656
03:14:07,487 --> 03:14:08,255
Yeah yeah

3657
03:14:16,447 --> 03:14:16,959
Take your brothers go to

3658
03:14:18,239 --> 03:14:19,007
I'm not totally sure

3659
03:14:19,775 --> 03:14:21,311
I've been wrong in the past

3660
03:14:21,823 --> 03:14:27,199
I hope we don't I hope we don't see how

3661
03:14:30,271 --> 03:14:31,039
Doing all this s***

3662
03:14:31,551 --> 03:14:33,855
It's easy to be like he's just screaming is

3663
03:14:34,111 --> 03:14:37,183
Just blustery.

3664
03:14:37,439 --> 03:14:39,487
He's putting this guy whose picture he's shown on

3665
03:14:45,375 --> 03:14:47,167
And obviously he's setting me up

3666
03:14:47,423 --> 03:14:48,703
Because they got to take me down

3667
03:14:49,983 --> 03:14:51,263
You know you could put

3668
03:14:53,567 --> 03:14:55,871
This last clip the last 15

3669
03:14:56,127 --> 03:14:56,895
You suckin so who's episode

3670
03:14:57,407 --> 03:14:59,199
As the outro music is playing

3671
03:14:59,455 --> 03:15:00,991
Alex addresses the idea

3672
03:15:01,247 --> 03:15:02,271
The people would think

3673
03:15:02,527 --> 03:15:03,551
Keep sending people after

3674
03:15:06,111 --> 03:15:12,255
Everyone

3675
03:15:12,511 --> 03:15:18,655
Will Texas be defeated he will now the shopping

3676
03:15:20,959 --> 03:15:22,751
Full-time Norm is just sitting there like

3677
03:15:25,823 --> 03:15:26,591
You wouldn't

3678
03:15:27,103 --> 03:15:31,199
Say I want legal and lawful action you said I said people

3679
03:15:31,711 --> 03:15:35,295
Everybody

3680
03:15:35,551 --> 03:15:39,647
What you were asking

3681
03:15:39,903 --> 03:15:41,695
For what

3682
03:15:41,951 --> 03:15:43,487
Position

3683
03:15:43,743 --> 03:15:45,535
Because you know

3684
03:15:45,791 --> 03:15:49,375
A bounty that only get paid when they're arrested

3685
03:15:49,631 --> 03:15:50,911
Someone killed

3686
03:15:54,239 --> 03:15:59,103
I said I wanted them arrested clear about that until after

3687
03:15:59,359 --> 03:16:00,895
Convicted as well

3688
03:16:01,151 --> 03:16:02,431
He or she

3689
03:16:02,943 --> 03:16:03,455
But

3690
03:16:06,271 --> 03:16:06,783
That's

3691
03:16:07,295 --> 03:16:12,671
Even when he says Ali I want legal and lawful action I'm not sending anybody after a guy want legal and lawful a

3692
03:16:13,183 --> 03:16:15,487
Are you giving out a million-dollar pound

3693
03:16:19,071 --> 03:16:20,863
Stop this is a serious crime

3694
03:16:21,119 --> 03:16:27,263
You getting Central pornography is not something

3695
03:16:27,519 --> 03:16:32,639
Just because everyone hates me

3696
03:16:36,223 --> 03:16:40,319
T-Rex sound

3697
03:16:40,575 --> 03:16:42,879
And the FBI isn't a very capable position

3698
03:16:43,135 --> 03:16:45,183
To figure out what is going on there

3699
03:16:45,439 --> 03:16:46,207
Take care of it

3700
03:16:46,463 --> 03:16:48,511
Find the evidence preserve the evidence

3701
03:16:50,303 --> 03:16:51,327
Who did this to you

3702
03:16:51,583 --> 03:16:52,607
The only thing

3703
03:16:52,863 --> 03:16:53,887
Very sensible

3704
03:16:54,399 --> 03:16:55,167
To do in this situation

3705
03:16:55,679 --> 03:16:56,191
Is

3706
03:16:56,447 --> 03:16:57,471
Allow the process

3707
03:16:57,983 --> 03:16:59,263
Hugo

3708
03:17:03,871 --> 03:17:08,479
And if they discover that it was Hillary Clinton and Alex gets to become king of America that's the law

3709
03:17:10,783 --> 03:17:12,063
Absolutely

3710
03:17:13,087 --> 03:17:16,671
And I understand I do understand how someone

3711
03:17:16,927 --> 03:17:17,439
Hood

3712
03:17:17,695 --> 03:17:19,999
Take that exact same Colonel of what I

3713
03:17:20,255 --> 03:17:21,023
I just said the idea that

3714
03:17:21,535 --> 03:17:22,815
It why would you do that

3715
03:17:23,583 --> 03:17:27,167
They're going to investigate whatever you hoped

3716
03:17:27,423 --> 03:17:28,447
Whatever information

3717
03:17:28,703 --> 03:17:29,215
You hope to find

3718
03:17:29,727 --> 03:17:34,591
He's going to be found by the investigation if it is

3719
03:17:35,103 --> 03:17:37,919
Turtle & Hughes

3720
03:17:38,175 --> 03:17:39,711
Defy he knows he's guilty

3721
03:17:40,223 --> 03:17:45,087
No cuz why else would you interfere with an investigation

3722
03:17:46,879 --> 03:17:50,207
Now that's because the pr angle

3723
03:17:50,463 --> 03:17:52,511
You trying to Target this guy and go

3724
03:17:54,815 --> 03:17:56,351
As compelling as anything else

3725
03:17:56,607 --> 03:18:00,959
As an explanation for why you wouldn't just let the FBI do their job

3726
03:18:01,983 --> 03:18:03,007
This is not seem like he's

3727
03:18:03,519 --> 03:18:04,031
Doing anything

3728
03:18:04,287 --> 03:18:04,799
That will

3729
03:18:05,567 --> 03:18:07,871
Positively benefit him

3730
03:18:08,127 --> 03:18:11,199
It makes me think of the title of the Flash Forward

3731
03:18:12,479 --> 03:18:14,783
First episode was called No More good days

3732
03:18:15,807 --> 03:18:17,343
CIA main characters daughter

3733
03:18:17,599 --> 03:18:18,623
Has everyone Flash

3734
03:18:18,879 --> 03:18:19,647
Fast forward 26 months

3735
03:18:20,159 --> 03:18:20,671
Future

3736
03:18:21,183 --> 03:18:21,951
Sees what's going on

3737
03:18:23,487 --> 03:18:26,559
Future

3738
03:18:28,863 --> 03:18:31,679
And she describes it as we have no more good days

3739
03:18:31,935 --> 03:18:33,983
Yeah that's how I feel.

3740
03:18:35,007 --> 03:18:36,031
I see you no more good day

3741
03:18:36,799 --> 03:18:37,823
And I see no more good days

3742
03:18:38,079 --> 03:18:39,871
For us

3743
03:18:40,383 --> 03:18:42,431
Like a present

3744
03:18:42,687 --> 03:18:43,199
Into the future

3745
03:18:44,479 --> 03:18:44,991
Tell you how much

3746
03:18:45,247 --> 03:18:46,271
This feels like a quickening

3747
03:18:48,319 --> 03:18:52,671
Severe and I understand that this is a situation that is put in Alex's laptop

3748
03:18:52,927 --> 03:18:57,279
I know that it's artificial on some level to what he would like to

3749
03:18:57,791 --> 03:18:59,071
But the way he's covering

3750
03:18:59,327 --> 03:19:00,095
It is so

3751
03:19:01,119 --> 03:19:03,423
Irresponsible so f***** up

3752
03:19:05,471 --> 03:19:06,751
I do I agree with you I think it

3753
03:19:07,007 --> 03:19:07,775
Get to sign a very bad

3754
03:19:08,287 --> 03:19:10,079
Very bad behavior

3755
03:19:10,847 --> 03:19:13,407
You see what's going on with either around

3756
03:19:15,455 --> 03:19:17,759
Lost his ability

3757
03:19:18,015 --> 03:19:18,783
Even be the

3758
03:19:19,039 --> 03:19:21,599
Confident

3759
03:19:21,855 --> 03:19:23,391
Confident other position guy

3760
03:19:23,903 --> 03:19:26,207
He's that he's waffling all over the place

3761
03:19:26,463 --> 03:19:27,487
His longtime

3762
03:19:27,743 --> 03:19:30,047
Sources of information or split

3763
03:19:30,559 --> 03:19:31,327
All that you know

3764
03:19:31,583 --> 03:19:37,727
He's gone so far into the Trump World that Joel skousen doesn't even agree with his bulshit anymore cuz.

3765
03:19:37,983 --> 03:19:38,751
The purist

3766
03:19:39,007 --> 03:19:40,799
And Alex has gone in pure

3767
03:19:41,055 --> 03:19:43,103
He's not he's a man without a base

3768
03:19:43,615 --> 03:19:44,127
Anymore

3769
03:19:44,383 --> 03:19:45,407
He doesn't have the

3770
03:19:45,663 --> 03:19:47,711
Like whatever he enjoyed in the

3771
03:19:48,735 --> 03:19:49,247
Late

3772
03:19:49,759 --> 03:19:50,271
2000

3773
03:19:51,039 --> 03:19:52,319
Hey baby early 2010

3774
03:19:53,087 --> 03:19:54,879
Whatever he enjoyed back then

3775
03:19:55,391 --> 03:19:56,671
Of having a home

3776
03:19:57,183 --> 03:19:57,951
He doesn't have a home anymore

3777
03:19:58,463 --> 03:20:00,255
He gave up his home to wander in

3778
03:20:01,535 --> 03:20:03,071
I don't know. Ed had

3779
03:20:03,327 --> 03:20:04,863
For Trump

3780
03:20:05,119 --> 03:20:06,911
And he's just lost he's lost

3781
03:20:07,167 --> 03:20:08,191
Now he's running out of gas

3782
03:20:08,703 --> 03:20:09,983
He's getting mad

3783
03:20:10,751 --> 03:20:11,775
That's what's going on

3784
03:20:12,031 --> 03:20:12,799
And

3785
03:20:13,055 --> 03:20:14,591
I've lost track of this metaphor

3786
03:20:14,847 --> 03:20:17,663
I think you need me to let you go with that alright listen up

3787
03:20:17,919 --> 03:20:22,271
Needs to find his way home or else he was

3788
03:20:22,527 --> 03:20:23,295
Going to starve

3789
03:20:24,063 --> 03:20:24,575
Heat gun

3790
03:20:25,087 --> 03:20:26,367
There's always

3791
03:20:26,623 --> 03:20:28,671
Did you see that you need help you need help

3792
03:20:28,927 --> 03:20:30,975
Pizza Inn

3793
03:20:33,535 --> 03:20:34,303
Could be a problem

3794
03:20:40,447 --> 03:20:40,959
It gets better

3795
03:20:41,215 --> 03:20:44,799
His lawyer is like

3796
03:20:45,567 --> 03:20:48,895
So close to Illegal close

3797
03:20:50,943 --> 03:20:51,967
You can't have those

3798
03:20:52,223 --> 03:20:53,759
Ingredients

3799
03:20:54,015 --> 03:20:55,295
Together for very long

3800
03:20:55,551 --> 03:20:56,575
The crossing the line

3801
03:20:57,343 --> 03:20:58,623
Just a matter of time

3802
03:20:58,879 --> 03:20:59,903
That's why we have to keep

3803
03:21:00,415 --> 03:21:00,927
Well looking at

3804
03:21:01,183 --> 03:21:01,951
Present even though it's

3805
03:21:04,255 --> 03:21:04,767
It sucks

3806
03:21:06,815 --> 03:21:07,839
Disgusting but like

3807
03:21:08,607 --> 03:21:09,631
I think there's a d

3808
03:21:09,887 --> 03:21:11,167
We are witnessing

3809
03:21:11,423 --> 03:21:12,191
The end of times

3810
03:21:12,703 --> 03:21:13,983
At least the show

3811
03:21:15,263 --> 03:21:17,823
I absolutely if I was anywhere near

3812
03:21:19,103 --> 03:21:19,871
Alex be like

3813
03:21:20,127 --> 03:21:20,895
We need to stage

3814
03:21:21,151 --> 03:21:22,175
The f****** intervention

3815
03:21:22,431 --> 03:21:23,711
You drinking himself to jail

3816
03:21:23,967 --> 03:21:29,855
Where is a good operation here where we

3817
03:21:30,111 --> 03:21:33,183
F****** Silvia's Camp pills we could stay at

3818
03:21:33,439 --> 03:21:35,999
Stasis level

3819
03:21:36,255 --> 03:21:37,535
But because of his own

3820
03:21:38,047 --> 03:21:38,559
Personal

3821
03:21:38,815 --> 03:21:39,583
Ego

3822
03:21:39,839 --> 03:21:40,863
Defensiveness

3823
03:21:41,119 --> 03:21:41,887
Anger issues

3824
03:21:42,143 --> 03:21:42,655
Booze

3825
03:21:43,167 --> 03:21:44,703
We're going to end up

3826
03:21:45,215 --> 03:21:45,983
Broke

3827
03:21:46,495 --> 03:21:47,519
And we're going to be

3828
03:21:48,031 --> 03:21:48,799
Unemployable

3829
03:21:49,567 --> 03:21:54,175
Like no one's going to be able to know it's going to f****** get it

3830
03:21:54,431 --> 03:21:59,807
Took a sabbatical

3831
03:22:00,063 --> 03:22:04,415
So he's not on camera Irish it might be able to transition but

3832
03:22:04,671 --> 03:22:05,439
The cameraman

3833
03:22:12,863 --> 03:22:13,375
Maybe trouble

3834
03:22:13,631 --> 03:22:14,911
Whatever

3835
03:22:15,167 --> 03:22:17,727
It's clear that for some reason people are

3836
03:22:18,751 --> 03:22:19,519
Motivated to do that

3837
03:22:19,775 --> 03:22:21,823
I don't know why because Alex is such a

3838
03:22:22,847 --> 03:22:23,359
They're scared

3839
03:22:23,871 --> 03:22:25,151
Or possibly because

3840
03:22:25,407 --> 03:22:28,991
It's still much at baby it's way more lucrative than we even under

3841
03:22:29,247 --> 03:22:30,015
Understand

3842
03:22:30,271 --> 03:22:31,807
That could be it maybe they think

3843
03:22:33,087 --> 03:22:34,623
The Jeopardy to weather with this

3844
03:22:34,879 --> 03:22:35,647
Situation

3845
03:22:36,159 --> 03:22:36,671
I don't know

3846
03:22:36,927 --> 03:22:37,951
On a human level

3847
03:22:38,207 --> 03:22:38,719
He needs help

3848
03:22:40,255 --> 03:22:41,023
No one is

3849
03:22:41,535 --> 03:22:43,071
Maybe once

3850
03:22:44,351 --> 03:22:45,119
It falls apart

3851
03:22:48,191 --> 03:22:49,471
Thomas Jefferson

Thomas Jefferson

Donated the domain knowledge

3855
03:23:05,343 --> 03:23:08,415
Comcast correct he's on Twitter

3856
03:23:19,423 --> 03:23:21,471

Oh boy

3861
03:23:33,503 --> 03:23:34,015
We got a

3862
03:23:34,271 --> 03:23:36,063
We got a Cavalcade of

3863

Douchebags

We got a bus.

Is Meowth

3868
03:23:47,583 --> 03:23:51,679
Spore Joel skousen are both good candidates for non murderers

3869
03:23:52,191 --> 03:23:57,055
It doesn't sound like normally I would rather honor him with eonon murderer title for his attempt

3870
03:23:57,567 --> 03:24:00,127
Having Alex understand the situation

3871
03:24:00,383 --> 03:24:01,407
Just for saying young man

3872
