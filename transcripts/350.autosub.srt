What are we doing alright

9
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
But

00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
Have you ever been

No. No no

15
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,192
Shows up in your mother's would never take me to one of those things

16
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,800
After I was of the age where I might go by myself

17
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Don't think I would have chose

18
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,224
Christian extremist haunted houses

19
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,064

23
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,072
You just like to go to places where is easier to draw

24
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,472
Right up there in the middle of Mexico Missouri

25
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
Actually it was one of the craziest

26
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
Group of friends

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,152

00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
And I used to go to a karaoke bar

32
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,888

00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
Peppers

34
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,032
There was a guy who would go there named La mate

35
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:30,176
I was also quite country songs

00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,016

Which I never knew how to take the monster truck rally with somebody's

43
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,336
Hey now we're just out there drinking and I run into who's out there for the monster truck rally

44
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,920
You know that

45
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
Later

46
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
There's like a weird Revenge of the Nerds situation where you got your friends

47
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
Romeo and Juliet

48
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,167
But there was no tension or anything like that

49
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,495
How many people do you know it was amazing

50
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
It's all really good Anna monster truck rally was

51
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
It was alright

52
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:36,479
After a while

53
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:41,087
Cars running into each other until they all stop

54
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
Will be really interesting

55
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,535
It's not on TV

56
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,095

57
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887

00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Count

60
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495

00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,991
Alright I'm not a bad guy but if you're there for the whole time

64
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,831
There's some question I can kind of understand especially like

65
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
Understand the entertainment value of the cars are really functional

66
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,119
Other

67
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167

68
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,983
Stick with it

69
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,895
I don't know but I respect everybody in their entertainment Dorothy

70
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
The car is near

71
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,647

Tweet about Civil War baby a little too on brand for Alex

Surprise

114
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,895
Try out that

115
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
It works out

116
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
I make no promises

117
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:57,087

Right

121
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
So it's already on the 29th

122
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,703
Episode

123
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
I thought was

124
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
Going to be a bat

125
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567

126
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Begins

127
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
With a little bit of motivation

128
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
I didn't know how it was going to manifest

129
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
I wanted first heard it I thought busy

130
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,727
Populist

131
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,127
Collision Course

132
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
Be in the streets

133
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,263
How do I go to bed

134
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
Alexa

135
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
It's a rare day that Alex has a plan

136
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:50,239
Yeah that made me worried first of all

137
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,311
Only okay when it's coming from the Doobie Brothers

138
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,895
And then third of all

139
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Straight sides

140
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
And then they aggressive

141
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,295
We got to get a grill

142
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
What I heard

143
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
Is Alex going to f****** jump

144
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Is he making

145
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,975
Is he making that rhetorical

146
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
Is this the day that week

147
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,303
Claire War

148
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
I wasn't sure it's

149
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
See where the

150
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Repercussions

151
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
He's also teasing

152
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,775
Tower on the program

153
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543

Is in the early stages

156
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Really Ali

157
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:40,159
The I've got solution

158
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
Bad news

159
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Jesus out to keep eyes

160
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Program

161
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
About how much you love

162
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
But there's things that he wishes Trump would do better on

163
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
We've got to get

164
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,951
Tipping the Lyft app

165
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
Be like his chief complaint is like Trump hasn't got me back on Twitter yet

166
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
It seems to be that's what's up

167
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:02,079
His cross

168
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,383
Deplatforming

169
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
Stuff they use Experian

170
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,039
Has led to A disruption of the inflow of people

171
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:17,439
It's critically hurt his ability to make money on his Apple

172
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:23,839
About Alex

173
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,679
New people

174
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
Stefan molyneux really like

175
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:34,591
Lay that out if you like this is why I don't have new people coming in

176
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
People are leaving

177
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
I do

178
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Not have done that

179
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:45,599
Entire episode about that video

180
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
Pointless

181
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Voicemail

182
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,791
Makes me want

183
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Support and allow these people to

184
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,191
To game their algorithms in order to get more attention on their b*******

185
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
This is this is pretty

186
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,287
I mean you see a pretty good case

187
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
That this does work

188
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
It works well

189
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,199
Milo particularly like they have

190
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,527
You know they've been very public about how much

191
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Kidworks interns

192
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343

212
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,607
Weirdo

213
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,263
For landing any roles at all

214
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,383
Justin kicking down on MTV play classroom

00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:50,783
But an actor was Dead on Arrival

216
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:57,439
Is over the course of twelve years you aren't really able to get any juice any momentum going

217
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Cut out to act

218
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:03,327
Steven probably realized that was the case because in 2000

219
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
Water being a low-level funk

220
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:13,055
He was an MC if the 2011 presumably because use one of the only people they could fight

221
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Idol performing

222
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
To give you a reminder

223
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
Part of the problem

224
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
Here's a list of some of the speakers at CPAC

225
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551

It's way in 2011

235
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Silly

236
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
Videos on Fox News

237
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,479
Particularly distasteful report that he filed

238
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,831
In December 2012 Michigan right-to-work rally

239
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,671
Where he was mixing it up with a bunch of Union protest

240
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,535
A lot of the window dressing for his reports and all this stuff is really unimportant

241
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
The Chase

242
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,863
Steven ended up getting punched by one of the Union

243
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,263
At least started parade video around right-wing media making appearances on

244
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,567
Fox News

245
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,663
This clearly demonstrated protesters are violent

246
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Completely negative light

247
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,759
An ineffective demonize the cause that they were out there protesting

248
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Pick 4

249
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,367
Credit-challenged

250
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391

00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
Even showing which showed him being sucker-punched manipulative lie edited

253
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:20,031
Diversion

254
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,271
The guy has been attacked because the camera is focused on the right spot

255
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
This wasn't an unprovoked attack

256
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
I guess Crowder hits

257
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,159
Along with all the right-wing

258
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,511
Erection in the Cure

259
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,655

00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:56,383
After this Steak Rolls like classroom Bowie anymore

262
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:02,783
He started it louder with Crowder in 2015

263
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
Quite successfully

264
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:08,159
By making you contact incredibly stupid but also stopped

265
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,999
Trojan Horse conservative

266
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,535
The concept of super attractive

267
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,375
Which is really the place that he lives in in the park

268
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
The only reason he's a worthwhile commodity to the right and why is part of Glenn Beck's Network The Blaze now

269
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
He makes

270

It is YouTube videos sometimes Benjamin will take a break from blaming Jews for everything that happens in the world to accuse Crowder of being

278
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:07,039
Being gay possibly with his assistant.

279
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,391

Paul Joseph Watson

290
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:45,695

00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:12,575
This is a show that's Taylor towards the youth

301
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,391
Who's a crime

302
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,208
You're enabling a psychopath to pray on your audio

303
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:23,840
It's not like Stephon was on just once

304
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,400

Rand Paul

312
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:48,672
There's a reason that this brand-new politician would still go on a program

313
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,952
Is littered with extreme

314
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,000

Seemed to imply that his channel is being shadowbanned

333
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Some dumb s***

334
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,472
He posted that if you search for him or someone else

335

347
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,560
It's such a Content constant

348
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Fraudulent refrain

349
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
For these right-wing Cottman

350

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,848
So what episode

384
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,688
Continues through

385
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,016
Is that easy

386
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,368
You might have noticed about out of context drop by Piedmont Satan

387
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
Alex

388
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
Deeply

389
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,512
Into accusing his enemies

390
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,376
Consciously in League with the Devil

391
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:45,984
He gets into that talks about how we're both offered

392
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,800
Huge careers if they pray to the devil

393
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
It's hot

394
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
It's not just him

395
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:00,064
Years ago

396
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,232
Crossroads

397
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
See you at the crossroads

398
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,160
Still out here doing this song so you know you're still on tour

399
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,232
I do but I don't take it for granted

400
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,632
Wow it goes back to the Destiny saying how many

401
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
Target

402
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,216
Long time gone

403
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,032
Holding up my hand

404
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,568
Jabari

405
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
Thicket where

406
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
I am now

407
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
Should I ask who you made the bargain with

408
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Commander

409
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
The chief commander

410
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,216
The chief commander

411
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
Commander

412
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,944
Okay Alex compound

413
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,344
Alex plays about God

414
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
He doesn't have to be the devil

415
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,744
Of course he's talking about

416
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,216
When it comes to Alex and his interpretation another Dylan quote comes to me

417
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,544
Sometimes it's not enough to know what's

418
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
Don't mean

419
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:08,064
Literal deal with a literal devil to get where he got invite

420
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,904
There's a common metaphor to describe having to make sacrifices

421
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,976
Give up things in life and pursuit of your overriding

422
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:19,840
The deal with the devil Dylan got to become one of the most important songwriters

423
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
Possibly in American history

424
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,936
She could never live a normal life

425
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,008
For an artist wife is never really normal

426
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,824
On the path to success

427
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,664
Their focus has to be so squarely on their crap that they don't

428
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,456
Parts of life that everyone else does

429
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,528
Beacon live in poverty so they can dedicate

430
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,832
Tons of times what they're called to do

431
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,904
They keep completely different hours than people with normal jobs

432
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,464
Essentially around everyone but apart

433
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,256
And then if they're lucky enough to sit

434
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,560
Become a famous musician

435
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,608
Their life will never be normal after that

436
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:59,008
From then on never really be sure of anyone in their life values them for themselves or for who they are

437
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
In the world

438
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
Social interactions becomes

439
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,224
Distorted and whatever alienation they felt before is an impoverished nocturnal performer is only elevated

440
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,504
The gold

441
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Shooting for

442
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
I don't know

443
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:16,672
Doesn't stop performing or making music because

444
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
He's keeping up with his end of the bargain

445
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,792
Expressing that he made a deal with his own town

446
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:28,448
He committed to be the music this musician to the exclusion of other human comfort that he swore he would never

447
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
Stop creating and he's not going to stop now

448
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,800
Just because he's old rich and famous

449
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,152
This is embarrassing satanic Panic level s*** that Alex is doing

450
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:42,528
He's basically pretty much every famous person every celebrity

451
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,600
Appear to be doing good social work now that ship matter

452
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,208
By definition

453
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,512
He's just everything that is

454
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
Involved his version of right-wing extremism

455
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,608
Even think that

456
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,424
Is intrinsically evil and a threat to his body

457
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,264
It's sad on one level

458
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
Anywhere to go in the future other than viola

459
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:11,456
Everyone who doesn't agree with you don't b******* is being literal Satan worshipers want to take

460
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
Kids and kill them

461
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,016
I put you in a slave camp

462
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,624
Is there a is there some point

463
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,648
With that sort of group

464
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
Seems like it has to lead towards escalation

465
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,744
You know I think Alex

466
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
Probably have to be aware of that

467
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,584
What people are willing

468
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,656
Satan worshiping the child killers

469
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,728
Like we were you going to negotiate with them

470
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
Ghetto after

471
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Opening

472
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,408
I don't know

473
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,992
Making a deal with the Devil is

474
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
It is

475
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Born almost

476
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,136
Entirely out of

477
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:57,792
I was just talking about like Robert

478
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:04,192
Conversation absolutely Dylan's comment

479
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:12,640
Or I guess a literal devil is for making music

480
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:19,040
Because I was a condition of a deal they made to get The Times They Are A-Changin on the radio

481
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
But

482
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:31,072
You know you got to make a literal deal with a literal devil

483
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:37,728
Newton Federal

484
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,544
Didn't sign up with the Devil the bill was paid

485
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,616
He was I women

486
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
I don't know

487
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:50,784
This is all bunch of bulshit

488
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
Gives a s***

489
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,368
It's because this is a clear editorial.

490
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,000
It's all it's so much State there's a lot of things

491
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Yes

492
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,096
Like I know Alex talked about Satan and all this stuff a bit

493
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,400
8/8 over the top

494
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
And very consistent throughout the 29th

495
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
And 30th

496
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,800
This is just rambling b******* about God

497
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,360
That's what this is all about

498
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,896
But if you really love God

499
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,808
Little fake priest

500
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
Powerful

501
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,856
You know

502
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
Understand

503
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,472
Brakes

504
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
Okay

505
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,104
M8 exhaust

506
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,456
Like weird weird over the top

507
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
Religious

508
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:28,320
Naked making this political struggle in the middle of

509
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,856
Somehow have breakfast

510
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,672
Spiritual apocalyptic Armageddon

511
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,608
If you only do if your gear in people opted for an expectation of violence

512
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,424
Just I really can't look at it any other way

513
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,496
I can only

514
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
What is it

515
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
Technology

516
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,040
People don't

517
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,880
Devilry

518
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,928
That person is doing

519
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,232
I don't know why I'm going to go with

520
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,024
And that's just the way that they are you f******

521
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,816
Can shut down any any

522
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Kind of openness

523
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Is that

524
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,288
It's also something that does not have

525
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,360
Like possible Avenue

526
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,968
When

527
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:35,392
Georgia killing dogs

528
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,208
Being recruited by Satanist

529
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,792
We don't know that he hasn't

530
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,376
Situation

531
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
Who's the bad guy

532
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,728
To think that a good guy

533
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
We are actually good

534
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
Because Alex himself

535
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:03,040
Is the Satanist

536
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:09,440
Occam's razor

537
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,488
Extremely engaged

538
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,448
And

539
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Because

540
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,056
Make sure that it's

541
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
Record

542
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
The

543
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Everything

544
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,944
And releases it as a special report

545
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,480
He can't even be bothered

546
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:36,064
You cut something like during or after the show

547
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
TVs look to record it

548
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:42,208
I need to focus real hard so we can make use of it

549
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,816
Let me get to the positive note

550
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
To the big news here

551
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,168
Massachusetts

552
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:51,936
You are

553
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,568
No

554
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,384
If you as an audience

555
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,464
That's right Alex stretch

556
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,512
Actually got 3 hours to fill stretch

557
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,584
Tell me what it is

558
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
Go for it

559
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
I need to be laser-focused

560
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:36,224
Cuz I know that all these rabbits

561
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Like the devil

562
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
So at this point it's all vague and all just so we got to be

563
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
Aggressive

564
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,840
There's no sense of what he's talking about it could be like

565
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
It could be protesting

566
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,728
Or it could be go firebomb globalist Church

567
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,336
Between Maybe

568
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,128
It's obviously not the ladder

569
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:09,760
But you don't know like I don't know what his

570
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,856
It may be very uncomfortable

571
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Could be

572
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,768
Not telling us what it is other than we got to take to the streets

573
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
Nea he's like

574
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,960
I don't get butterflies

575
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
Tried to pick up a hot chick

576
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
But why

577
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,960
About 5 minutes ago

578
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,264
Watching television

579
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,592
Powerful

580
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,992
Drum roll

581
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:22,976
Ice cream ice cream

582
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:35,776
Stopped traffic because I returned with by sensationalism

583
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:39,872
Who is in the second segment of the next

584
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,712
Telling you all about how important today

585
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:48,832
Made me really unnerved that he's talking about how he has butterflies and

586
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:54,464
About reporting this

587
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
For suggesting this

588
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,328
It made me worried that like it is going to be something

589
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,864
Like Beyond

590
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,912
Acceptable

591
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:09,312
I don't think I don't want to be like this

592
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
Reveal of what his suggestion is

593
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,480
As if to imply that is like

594
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,040
You got to understand why if you're listening to this

595
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,088
You're like a little bit like

596
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,904
This could be anything he's going to add the engine

597
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
His listeners do

598
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,512
And then what he says something like this it makes it even more like

599
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Are you going

600
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,776
What is that then

601
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
That's what he said right

602
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,408
Stop

603
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,624
Listen here and my response

604
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,928
Condescendingly isao

605
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,864
Jesus Christ

606
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,144
The model of those man

607
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:08,096
So his solution is yellow conspiracy. Okay

608
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
Sensei

609
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,104
And her and have a list

610
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:26,272
And there's a list that Alex is going to put out of all his points so you can just overwhelmed people with a flood

611
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,344
Is verbal diarrhea today

612
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:36,000
Great you guys you guys want this is amazing

613
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,072
It legitimately just go Yelp

614
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
Wow

615
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Wow

616
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
Inner

617
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,640
Participate

618
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
This is such stupid

619
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,575
Zoe I also go to

620
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,111
He has further suggest

621
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,471
Reaction

622
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,767
Contest

623
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:44,095
To go yell at Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton

624
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,399
The problem here

625
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:53,311
He doesn't realize that

626
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,847
Thousands of dollars

627
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,151
To get people to go troll those rallies

628
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
So I don't know

629
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
If it's going to work out

630
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
Whatever

631
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
Besides

632
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,303
And then also be like that

633
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,887
Realized

634
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
Great America

635
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:30,687
So I think Alex just learned about

636
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:35,039
ProTech

637
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:41,439
Not realize that was an option

638
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
Go outside

639
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,663
It's weird

640
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:05,247
Alex is still Alice

641
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,039
So he has to make like

642
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Caveat

643
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
That are like

644
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,415
I think they're important

645
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,095
But for now he has to make like a real disclaimer

646
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
I think it's a

647
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,727
Facebook

648
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,759
Couple hundred bucks on

649
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,855
Find airplane to get your infowars.com

650
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:48,255
Daenerys

651
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,559
Legal and lawful

652
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,375
The trend

653
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,911
Don't commit crimes

654
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,959
Because I know my audience

655
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:01,823
That's an assumption that I do you guys want

656
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:08,479
Very hyper-specific about

657
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:14,111
What you suggested his audience might want to do back in 20

658
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:17,439
13

659
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,255
You're not watching mad out at the end

660
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:26,655
She's like by the way all of the stuff I told you please respond to that note legal in Bothell

661
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,447
Going to think

662
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,239
I should go commit a crime

663
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:39,967
You're basically career talking about doing

664
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,039
Alex like I said earlier

665
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,159
It existed because there was

666
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,231
He was paying people to get on the news in

667
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,767
Bill Clinton's a rapist

668
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,327
And even he recognizes that like

669
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
Kodi problems

670
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,383
5000

671
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,151
Repeat

672
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,463
You need to work faster

673
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,559
We got Trump elected

674
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
A good way to finish

675
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,751
Thousand dollars for the

676
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,311
You got last time

677
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
People were motivated by that

678
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:43,455
Also I don't like that you had $300,000 for that the first

679
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,271
He was way more flush

680
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,415
Just done like a regular old

681
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
Campaign

682
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,767
What 20 G

683
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:03,167
Not as effective is Buzz Marketing cuz those people who are at those rallies most people don't know that Infowars is

684
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:06,495
Paying them to do that appears to be organic

685
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,055
Grassroots people who are yelling at Bill Clinton

686
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,871
In reality it's people who are AstroTurf being

687
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,895
Pay by Alex

688
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,199
So it's it's a really

689
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,527
It's manipulative it's very

690
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:22,367
Insidious the way that that's able to penetrate local news and news source

691
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,183
Who aren't aware of what's actually going on

692
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,743
I think it Alex values that much

693
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,023
More than like say

694
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,815
This is paid for by

695
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:34,143
Towards

696
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,167
The message

697
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,775
Shows just Special Report

698
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,407
90 minutes.

699
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
The streets to fight back

700
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:54,367
I literally have no doubt that he left his show and got his ass out there it's a meaningful direct action

701
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,695
Either that or he met with suppliers about the billions lawsuit

702
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,511
He's mixed up in currently

703
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:04,095
Either way it's a real sad State of Affairs over Infowars

704
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:09,727
You have a guy who's yelling all day about how does the pivotal point in America in human history

705
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,031
I am right now

706
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:16,895
It's good versus evil on the future existence of mankind is on the line

707
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,175
To finish his own show

708
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,527
It's little things like that that really provide a true Glimpse at the house and see all of his ranting

709
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:26,111
If you really believed a word of what he saying he would finish his show

710
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,951
He doesn't need to finish the show though because he said all he needs to say

711
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,023
He did some extremist ranting he did some ad reads

712
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,607
Plus he's finally discovered protest

713
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:40,703
Exist so that's a big

714
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
Anybody who is he

715
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,847
Sincerely in the position

716
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639
Wood wild horses couldn't drag

717
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,431
Their post

718
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,503
Just like anybody who actually likes me

719
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
You betcha

720
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,183
So we get to the 30th

721
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
Monday

722
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,047
And Alex doesn't want to read the news

723
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,863
It's kind of weird that space

724
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,911
There's a lot of stuff going on

725
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
And warning

726
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,751
This clip includes

727
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:21,151
Probably the longest pause Alex's ever made your iPod or phone is not glitching

728
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,943
Very long

729
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,367
Just becomes part of the

730
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
Brown noise

731
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,559
The paws

732
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
President-trump

733
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,191
Couple days ago on Saturday that

734
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,199
Alex is very excited about that

735
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,783
Those pauses are outrageous

736
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,879
So he is now found Trump is talking civil war

737
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:10,047
Also other people are talking civil war like Rush Limbaugh was talking about at the cold Civil War

738
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
I give Alex

739
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:22,335
The utmost credit and by that I mean discredit people are sounding like

740
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,431
It's a Hallmark of

741
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,199
His

742
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,479
Rhetoric

743
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,783
2015 that like

744
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,831
We are in a state of Civil War

745
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,367
It's all under the service

746
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,511
Is very much penetrating

747
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,815
People who are supposedly

748
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:47,423
F****** president

749
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,495
Realized

750
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,567
They can't realize that there's nowhere to escalate from

751
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
Right

752
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,895
What you can't go higher

753
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:00,735
Civil War problem

754
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,015
Death-squad

755
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:06,111
That's the problem we're going to have to wrestle with

756
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:06,879
September 30th

757
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
Because

758
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,279
Expression are when the going gets weird

759
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:16,095
The Going's getting weird Rush Limbaugh's turning pro

760
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,655
In terms of getting on board with this

761
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,215
Escalation is rhetoric that Alex Jones

762
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Employed

763
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,775
At the same time

764
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,335
Alex now has to figure out what

765
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,359
He does with that

766
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:31,455
When the rest of the world is doing your extreme is b*******

767
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
What do you do

768
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,039
Episode

769
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,855
I'm going to try

770
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,135
That would be great

771
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:42,207
I think you I think that actually would be wonderful

772
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:47,583
I don't go overboard and I don't want to get too out of control and say

773
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,375
Calling for any

774
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,495
Was actually calling for a civil war

775
00:51:55,775 --> 00:52:00,895
President a little bit about what Alex is actually saying

776
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,223
Alex

777
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,759
In order to build up to make

778
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,879
Sort of Art

779
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:11,903
This Force

780
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:15,487
All eras of the show they're demonized

781
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,839
Flix movie

782
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,447
Call Jay

783
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,543
Stories right here

784
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,991
No

785
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,119
Funded

786
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,031
Have you heard of this

787
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,127
First first things first

788
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:09,247
Michael C Hall is legitimately the only person in that I've ever heard

789
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,063
Also this movie

790
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,855
Wait Michael C Hall Dexter

791
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,135
Okay alright

792
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,463
B a b movie

793
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:23,839
According to the director I couldn't find funding

794
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:29,215
Set the movie studios in too weird for a big-budget outfit

795
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,751
Also the movie

796
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,823
Quite being adored in the way that Alex seems to be pretending it is

797
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:39,455
The a.v. club headline for the review the movie

798
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,015
Rodger Ebert's website

799
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:46,879
Most reviews I've read said the plot is a little convoluted time travel

800
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:52,255
Okay

801
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:57,631
It's not about squirrels trying to kill Patriots

802
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,703
I know that's probably what it feels like the movie is about

803
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,727
Not

804
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,519
It's one time traveler

805
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,567
As opposed to multiple

806
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,335
Suggest

807
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,639
And she's not traveling back in time to kill Patriot

808
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,199
Killing people who are specifically part of vinegar

809
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,991
Extremist white nationalist militia

810
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,063
You're using words

811
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:21,951
Exactly

812
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:27,839
She's killing that because they're instrumental in carrying out a job

813
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:31,167
Also that bomb doesn't happen in 2020 to 2024

814
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:35,519
But who cares about is just trying to make it look like this is about

815
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,055
Whatever

816
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:40,895
On the surface it would appear that has no idea

817
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,711
But if you know how I operate

818
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
What's up

819
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:49,855
Alex is so averse to white people ever being portrayed as being incapable of terror attack

820
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:53,695
The winner fictionalized white nationalist group does a bombing in a movie

821
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,231
He has to whitewash

822
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,767
Just good upstanding Patriots

823
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:05,471
The reality behind this is Alex deep down and probably not so deep

824
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,263
Was that the Rocky Mountain rendezvous

825
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,799
Along with Aryan Nation

826
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,335
Planet tons of extremist

827
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,103
Militia figure

828
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,271
He knows that most of his anti-communist Heroes came out of the failed presidential campaign is segregationist George Wallace

829
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,575
Which also spawned William Luther Pierce

830
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,599
The Turner Diaries

831
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,879
And the National Alliance

832
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,695
He knows his heroes in the John Birch Society where stash

833
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:30,559
He knows that his primary source on Bilderberg work for a publication that denied the Holocaust

834
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,863
Which is Ron B Neo-Nazi Willis carto

835
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
Alex knows exactly

836
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,959
And you know damn well

837
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,495
He's going to stop making money

838
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:43,615
If he gets on here it says he's mad that flick movie

839
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,407
That's what he wants

840
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,455
To say because he doesn't think they're bad

841
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
But he can't

842
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,783
So he calls the Patriots fighting globalism

843
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:53,343
I resist calling is a Rosetta Stone

844
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,879
It does that all the time

845
00:55:55,135 --> 00:56:01,023
But I do think that if you understand what's going on question the broader application of is used

846
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,839
I'll go ahead and leave

847
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,911
As soon as they just Russian question

848
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:07,935
For the class

849
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
And how he hides it

850
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:13,823
Behind

851
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,591
Facade

852
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,783
I'm positive that you have a lot of movie reviews

853
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,551
Ethan Hawke

854
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,343
Before Sunrise

855
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,231
She's like a woman

856
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,815
And then became a Time Loop

857
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,351
Kills himself

858
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,631
Weird

859
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,959
Or it's not I don't remember

860
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:47,359
Kutcher movie where you at

861
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:55,295
Movie that is about someone traveling back in time in order to avert a terrorist

862
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:04,511
To provoke a civil war movie about someone coming back

863
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,327
To kill conservatives and Patriots

864
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,607
In order to stop them

865
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,631
From fighting global

866
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,191
It's very very clear what he's doing

867
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,495
Yeah I know so

868
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,519
I'm imagining

869
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,103
If they bomb a movie

870
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,639
Weather

871
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,663
Actually doing

872
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
Fighting

873
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,503
Because they are on

874
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:29,087
I mean if the only reason they would

875
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,391
If the globalist had already busy

876
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:35,231
What you would say but it doesn't matter

877
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:39,839
Yeah I don't think it matters in terms of rhetorical

878
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:45,471
So anyway

879
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,247
Make that up

880
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,695
The shadow of the Moon

881
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,743
PetSmart

882
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:13,631
I was just making this up I could tell you that without looking into it

883
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,447
In reality the movie was produced

884
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,727
The partnership between

885
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,775
42 automatic

886
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,543
Nightshade

887
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,639
The privately-held company meeting the Chinese government does not own it

888
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,943
Yeah it's based in London

889
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:32,319
Press release in deadline

890
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,111
All the partners in the company or list

891
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,159
They are Ben Pugh

892
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,231
Catholic

893
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,535
Hey Josh Varney

894
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:47,423
Obviously fake the well-known industry

895
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,215
Absolutely

896
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:52,031
And that's just probably

897
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:58,175
You think his death affect his death to turn the public against big tobacco

898
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:05,343
Automatic is run by three guys who used to work at creative artists agency

899
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,391
Can see who decided to do their own

900
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:11,231
There's literally no indication that they're even part-owned by the Chinese government

901
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,255
Seems like just a

902
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,303
Production outfit

903
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,119
Nightshade Studios of closes Alex is going to get

904
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,143
We still way off

905
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:24,543
Mission statement introduced independent movies including

906
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,311
Asia

907
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,895
But there's literally no indication they're even partially owned by the Chinese government

908
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,687
None of this matters

909
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:35,551
Alec has zero idea who even produces movie he doesn't know about 42 automatic or nightshade

910
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,367
It doesn't matter because the reality is not important

911
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,159
He's built up a narrative

912
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:44,767
The Chinese government owns Noble Patriots of America

913
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,815
And that narrative has to move forward

914
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:52,447
It's so crucial to protect a narrative that Alex is willing to take a movie about stopping white nationalist terrorist group

915
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,751
And make it into a book

916
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,079
About the

917
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:04,479
Make it look like the Chinese government

918
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,503
That are about killing

919
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,807
Do I had to leave

920
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,367
Exhaust

921
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,671
It would be

922
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:15,999
I know this goes bad

923
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:16,767
Respect for his lip

924
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:21,631
He doesn't hate hesitate for a second and saying this movie was produced by the Chinese government

925
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,911
Knowing it doesn't matter

926
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,727
Whoever is listening still at this point is going to believe him

927
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:30,591
It's a real bummer to stop back and think about the poor people that are cotton

928
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,639
So let's not

929
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,575
Text movie talks about some other movies

930
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,903
Police movies only shows

931
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,071
Weather

932
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:55,167
The Purge is a long series of movies that are just about

933
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,191
Laws being

934
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,983
I don't know if I want to

935
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,799
Engage with that but let's talk about that

936
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,639
Inequality

937
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,175
Let's talk about the hunt though

938
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,967
Does most ridiculous thing for Alex

939
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,039
Never got released

940
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,087
Because of right-wing backlash

941
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,159
Trump decrying the movie which I should point out he had not seen

942
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:20,767
That's really f***** up on his entirely accurate

943
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:25,375
Some reports I've seen claim that

944
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,751
Attempts to get conflated with the right-wing backlight really easily

945
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,799
For sure what caused it

946
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,103
It's not come out but either way the right-wingers

947
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,639
Definitely try

948
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,663
To get it not really

949
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,943
Annette pathetic

950
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:43,295
Because the movie is really just a retelling of the story The Most Dangerous Game

951
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,575
I remember

952
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,047
I'm fine with this movie

953
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
Whatever

954
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,631
It's

955
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,679
Just a rich evil people hunt humans

956
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:02,751
Supersport

957
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,287
The John Leguizamo movie

958
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,943
Movies

959
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,759
Most notably surviving

960
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,807
Richard Belzer associate

961
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:22,719
Associate

962
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:29,375
Americans called deplorables by their captors in the movie The Hunt

963
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:32,191
Are kidnapped

964
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:38,591
Heroes of the movie people who you see the movie through you experience their story

965
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,127
The audience apathy

966
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,943
It's literally their Story of Survival

967
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,967
Follow

968
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,015
The film was produced by blumhouse

969
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:49,855
Studio company that made Jordan peele's movie get out

970
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:53,183
Hughes said

971
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,231
Confront white liberals with their own country

972
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,535
He told variety quotes

973
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,815
You find a DMC

974
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:01,119
Hideous qualities that white liberals have

975
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:05,215
The gut-punch of the movie is ultimately meant to say that racism is a human problem

976
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,031
Call themselves

977
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,079
It's a pretty fair assumption

978
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:13,919
To think that might be

979
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
In the film like the hunt

980
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,735
Where the audience is faced with

981
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:20,831
Dehumanizing attitudes many liberals May hold towards rural

982
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:21,855
Conservative

983
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,951
Younger days

984
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,535
From literally everything I can tell that's what this movie was about

985
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
But because

986
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,583
Right-wing media

987
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,631
Completely out of control stupid insensitive

988
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:40,031
They were to receive engage with satire that's meant to bring people together and encourages liberals to explore their unexamined bias

989
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,127
Think it's crazy to me complete disconnect with

990
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:49,247
Reactionary and stupid

991
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,575
No other way to put it on the billionaires

992
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,599
1

993
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,879
Come to the conservative

994
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
Billionaires

995
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
Completely

996
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,207
Destroyed any

997
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:58,975
10th Ave

998
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,511
Reality they have

999
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,559
The billionaires

1000
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,583
And one

1001
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,887
Percent of America

1002
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,983
That's pretty

1003
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,007
Pretty amazing

1004
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,055
Defeated reality

1005
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:16,127
In some corners

1006
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,919
But I don't think it's all 47

1007
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,015
Wizard

1008
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:22,783
And I think

1009
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,063
Vape transcended

1010
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,087
Yeah

1011
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,135
Okay

1012
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:33,279
Alex also one of his go away after a day

1013
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,327
What is his name

1014
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,863
Preemptive damage control

1015
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,911
Cuz he needs to

1016
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,215
Did anything happen

1017
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
Is a setup

1018
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:45,055
Lower the comes out and says something

1019
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:45,823
Obviously

1020
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,871
That's a plan

1021
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,687
Trump sexual assault

1022
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,223
Inoculate them

1023
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,759
Come to the idea that they're going to be

1024
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,527
I'm f***** up things

1025
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,031
What's going to happen

1026
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,919
Million

1027
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,063
I want to shoot more stars

1028
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,367
Closet

1029
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:36,255
Diversion

1030
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,559
Congress

1031
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,143
He's essentially saying that he

1032
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:45,983
And a lot of his weirdo militia friends

1033
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,615
Things Fall Apart

1034
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:56,479
There's no doubt by his right-wing Buddies

1035
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,271
I mean

1036
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,295
Great

1037
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:05,951
I mean whatever it turns completely f***** up on a radio show

1038
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:13,375
Because it kind of encourages his audience

1039
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:16,703
Globalist

1040
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,727
School teacher who

1041
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:24,127
Teaches you are 9 year old and they're pushing

1042
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:31,295
They're pushing UNESCO education in order to children

1043
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,855
Probably fluoride

1044
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,647
Lexington phlorizin the food

1045
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,719
It's it's Triple A

1046
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,999
Can't be saved

1047
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:44,095
Even even if you're creating the pretense of like

1048
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:49,471
Preparing people to act

1049
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
In such a way

1050
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,543
It goes against whatever

1051
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,079
Disclaimer

1052
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,151
Saying

1053
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,687
That the president sang

1054
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:04,063
If this happens there will be

1055
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,111
Or intimidation

1056
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
Purely neutral as

1057
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:14,559
Stating a fact Peters do

1058
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:19,167
Faribault Civil War

1059
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:25,311
Yeah I think Alex is a mob.

1060
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,359
Coming back

1061
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,919
A sharp Focus

1062
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:35,295
This is where I think

1063
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
We get

1064
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:36,831
2

1065
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:41,951
Be a pretty clear picture of why even if Alex Jones hides behind all this like

1066
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:45,279
I don't want violence all this stuff all of his words

1067
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,583
Like it does not matter because

1068
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,631
The larger worldview that he is

1069
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,399
Perpetuating

1070
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
Necessitate

1071
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,239
And you'll see that in this clip

1072
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,423
Tech

1073
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:31,871
Call Civil War

1074
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,895
Top it off

1075
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,039
Memes are wishes for that

1076
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,647
Stop all this

1077
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,671
But

1078
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,695
Hold on

1079
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,231
He said butt

1080
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:01,311
Understand the clock is running out on them

1081
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,431
To be defeated

1082
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,783
Squid

1083
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,487
That's unacceptable

1084
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,791
I really think that everybody needs

1085
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,815
To carefully

1086
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,839
Considerate

1087
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
Exactly what he's

1088
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:30,495
Whatever the f***

1089
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:34,335
Is a civil war scale is a ludicrous trivialization

1090
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,871
Serious topics

1091
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,919
But I'm going to leave that aside for a sec

1092
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,223
What's important is that

1093
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,015
Escalated very severely

1094
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,807
One more notch

1095
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,343
That's the shooting War starting

1096
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,367
Bubbling over

1097
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,671
Heroes of water shooting War he says

1098
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:52,255
He wants the Salt Plate what a relief

1099
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,559
Alex wants to resolving peacefully

1100
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,095
And then he says but

1101
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,655
That but is his whole career

1102
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,983
That but is the map that uses to cover up his extreme

1103
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:02,751
Gleanings

1104
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,567
He pretends to advocate for non-violent Solutions

1105
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,591
But

1106
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:10,431
After that but he clearly explains that there's no chance

1107
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,711
Of non-violent solution

1108
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:15,807
Because the globalist to take the Patriots

1109
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,855
Heather not go down without a fight

1110
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:22,207
Around these parts were giving Alex Jones benefit of the doubt

1111
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:28,863
When everyone was complaining about his battle rifles, I was clear that I thought he was stupid you wasn't at

1112
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,631
Dating Violence

1113
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,655
Necessarily

1114
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:34,495
Who's more f***** up to kill people in self-defense

1115
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,775
Super common for him

1116
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,591
High Point these things out but I generally don't they

1117
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,895
These crossed some sort of larger line

1118
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,967
I think that last clip is crossing a line

1119
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,503
He's telling izadi

1120
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:51,135
Civil War and there's literally no hope of any kind of peaceful solution

1121
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,695
If you're listening to s*** like this and you believed him

1122
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,535
Why you going to wait for the globalist squid to take your children to the bottom of the ocean

1123
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,327
If you believe Alex business

1124
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,423
The declaration of war is inevitable

1125
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:10,079
No matter how many times he pretends he doesn't want violent when you portray the supposed enemy of being a rampaging squid

1126
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,359
Unless you kill it

1127
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,919
You're advocating violence against that squid

1128
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:20,831
Alex is probably totally find legally at least according to rulings like Brandenburg versus Ohio

1129
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:23,647
Punish people for abstract calls for illegal act

1130
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,207
But I'm less concerned with the legal side of it

1131
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,279
I'm bored still moral and ethical

1132
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,863
What Alex is doing is turning the temperature up on his rhetoric

1133
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:33,887
Troubling

1134
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:37,215
When Trump is referring to a possible Civil War

1135
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:41,311
People like Rush Limbaugh or following that

1136
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:46,175
Supposedly mainstream right-wing media has nowhere to go

1137
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,967
He has no reason to exist

1138
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,527
Past the horizon

1139
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,063
I want the horizon

1140
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:55,391
Discussing a cold Civil War that means Alex needs to talk about

1141
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,159
Hot one

1142
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:02,047
This rhetoric is particularly unnerving on the heels of Sunday's episode where u r a l

1143
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:08,191
That wasn't the solution to all Global's meddling on Sunday with gogal conspiracy theories at them

1144
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:12,543
And here on Monday he's talking about civil war with Millions dead being inevitable

1145
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,591
This kind of disjointed message

1146
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
Escalation

1147
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:21,503
Although it doesn't make it more likely that someone listening will be convinced that the war is coming to why the f*** should I wait

1148
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:24,063
That does not happen

1149
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,087
But if it does

1150
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,111
Be very

1151
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,135
Very aware

1152
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:30,975
Did Alex did everything in his power to make that outcome more likely

1153
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,767
That is all he's doing

1154
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,351
And like I said I don't know I don't think it's illegal and I don't think

1155
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,191
Think he has any punishment that's coming

1156
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:43,007
For it but don't

1157
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:43,775
He knows

1158
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,311
But he's playing with fire

1159
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,847
He's playing with

1160
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,895
A gullible audience

1161
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:53,759
That's willing to believe clear misrepresentation said he make about literally

1162
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,039
Just about everything

1163
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:56,831
He's

1164
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,647
The inevitability

1165
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,695
Is so

1166
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:03,231
Like you talked about that all the

1167
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,559
Feature

1168
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,583
Of his rhetoric

1169
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,911
The idea that whatever

1170
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,447
All that stuff's all good and well

1171
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,519
We now have the president tweeting about Civil War

1172
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:18,591
The climate in the world

1173
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,359
Is

1174
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,151
So insanely

1175
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:21,919
Touchy

1176
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:32,159
For Alex to ramble his b******* and say like

1177
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:35,999
We got to take out the globalists there's no way they're going down without a fight

1178
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:36,767
In

1179
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,327
Times when like William B.

1180
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,119
Be

1181
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,911
When he's out of Step

1182
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:43,935
With larger Force

1183
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,471
When he's

1184
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,239
Just being

1185
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,775
Crazy and extreme

1186
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,335
It doesn't strike me as merely a danger

1187
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,151
Climate

1188
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,687
Political climate where

1189
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,783
These things are being bandied about by

1190
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,855
People who

1191
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,671
You enter a tear

1192
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:07,487
You enter a territory where you have

1193
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,511
A real serious

1194
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,583
Isaac Issac ate it feels very different to me

1195
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,655
I think

1196
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,359
8in this in endometrium

1197
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,127
Explain my thoughts

1198
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,223
None of his listeners

1199
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,015
Fargo

1200
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
Just started

1201
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,319
Probably not

1202
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,087
There.

1203
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,903
Probably out

1204
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:41,279
Very outside of big big population areas

1205
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,303
50 +

1206
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:46,399
Disengage

1207
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,495
Makeup

1208
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,519
Mastiff

1209
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:54,591
Even ask

1210
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,359
Terrorism

1211
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:57,407
Face around the idea that there

1212
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,431
There's going to be a

1213
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,503
The thing about

1214
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
He is going

1215
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:04,831
Kill people

1216
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,599
He's going to get

1217
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,487
Especially because now there's so much Civil War

1218
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,023
Right

1219
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,375
Or could

1220
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:21,983
I would say

1221
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,519
More fair to say

1222
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,311
Not that Alex is going to get

1223
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,383
Increase the likelihood of that

1224
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:31,455
Because I don't I don't want to draw a direct

1225
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,759
Causal relationship

1226
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:37,087
This escalation is

1227
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,927
People sucking killed

1228
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:46,303
They all are

1229
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:50,143
I don't know what more I don't know what more to say

1230
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:57,055
To frame it that way more precise to say

1231
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,615
That the way their characterizing thing

1232
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,639
And the way this

1233
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,663
Is being discussed

1234
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,455
Especially Alex Jones

1235
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,991
Like what it does

1236
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,271
Is raise the Tanner

1237
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,831
It increases the temperature and makes those shorts

1238
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
More like

1239
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:13,439
And if you express it as

1240
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,999
They're killing people

1241
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,023
I just

1242
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,071
I disagree with the framing

1243
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,863
Only from a purely

1244
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:25,215
Sandpoint

1245
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,567
I don't know I just think you can't bathe

1246
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,615
Exit it

1247
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,407
Corrosive

1248
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,479
It doesn't lead to anything other than

1249
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,759
Whether it's

1250
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:41,599
Increasing the likelihood of something terrible now or later

1251
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,623
That's all it does

1252
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,159
Like what you going to do in

1253
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,975
Six months be like wow we've reached an agreement with the globalist

1254
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,511
There's no way back

1255
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,791
Kick it home from

1256
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,095
This is the place where you're gone

1257
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,631
And it's not like that's going

1258
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,399
To attract

1259
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,167
Nuvue

1260
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:56,447
It's not like

1261
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:01,823
It's not like you're Jumping Frog drop

1262
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,431
You're probably already with me

1263
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:13,855
Radicalized

1264
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,743
There's no point of this that leads to

1265
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:26,911
Takes you anywhere other than

1266
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:32,799
Whether it's the destruction of your everybody

1267
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:35,103
Davis

1268
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,175
Mihail Evel stores

1269
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:45,343
One of my favorite classic blunders

1270
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
Come on

1271
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,815
The Limited

1272
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:01,215
Because there's

1273
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,751
Hello

1274
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:09,407
I love Construction

1275
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:17,087
Frederick Douglass

1276
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,111
Slavery

1277
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,927
Institution

1278
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,951
Fought the last

1279
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,743
Civil War to uphold

1280
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,023
So cool

1281
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:28,863
God

1282
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,887
That those very

1283
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,935
People who enslaved

1284
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,823
Attributed to

1285
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:44,479
What's the temperature in L closer and closer to another civil war

1286
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
CNN

1287
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:49,343
Did women start the end of the Civil War

1288
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:50,879
So

1289
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:54,719
Again to reiterate Alex is expressing that there is no hope

1290
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,999
Of this being resolved

1291
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,695
They want to fight

1292
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:34,399
How to be successful

1293
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,031
I think you're smart to play that

1294
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:40,799
Music

1295
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:47,455
Lake Blackshear water

1296
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,527
A very clear articulation that I won't stop until

1297
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,599
You're advocating

1298
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:59,999
I don't I don't understand like pure

1299
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:02,559
Reasoning standpoint

1300
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,607
If for them

1301
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:10,239
Their only motivation and all of our Patriot heads on the wall

1302
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:13,567
The obvious conclusion that you're driving people towards

1303
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,336
Is

1304
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,616
They must be crushed

1305
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,896
They wanna be crushed

1306
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,688
And you must do it before they

1307
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,480
Exactly

1308
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
So

1309
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:23,808
Because

1310
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,832
The answer to that

1311
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:25,856
Yes

1312
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:26,880
You can make

1313
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,440
I mean obviously

1314
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,208
Play Alex

1315
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:36,352
You can't win

1316
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:41,984
How is it look like

1317
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,312
You can make a deal with the worst human beings on the f******

1318
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:47,104
Planet

1319
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,712
Live

1320
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:54,272
Not sure sure

1321
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:05,792
It's right you know. That's also kind of problem

1322
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:12,192
Because what happened

1323
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,728
Over the course of history

1324
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,776
Is the evil grows

1325
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,056
Another Wars

1326
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:20,640
After Wars people get back to goodness and God

1327
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:27,296
In order to normalize the idea of we're going to have to go through this then on the other side it's going to be Gray

1328
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,648
Tragedy

1329
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:34,464
Horror that would come from people fighting

1330
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,560
Bra

1331
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,000
Change the world

1332
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:11,072
So

1333
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,352
He's a student of History

1334
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,656
He says what the f*** was he talking about

1335
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:20,800
These in the middle of facilitate a second after the last one

1336
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:24,384
The devastating Reconstruction Era

1337
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:31,040
Normal everything was fine

1338
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:34,368
Equal rights

1339
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:42,560
With the gift of hindsight that's not a. I would call coming back to God and trying to make the world a better place

1340
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:48,448
Americans really suffered a lot at the former Confederates were treated with policy of

1341
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:50,240
Look at that differently than I do

1342
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,824
What's considered

1343
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:03,552
After World War 1 was the creation of the League of Nations and ever World War

1344
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,624
Those organizations at least attempt

1345
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,904
Make the world better

1346
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,696
Human annihilation

1347
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:12,512
Alex however sees them as globalist plots

1348
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,536
2 take away is gone

1349
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,584
This doesn't quite work for what he say

1350
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:19,424
Looking over the history of Wars I don't think that his argument makes sense

1351
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:21,472
But it kind of feels right

1352
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:24,544
But like everything that comes out of a turbo

1353
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,616
Nations in the UN words

1354
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,152
Come closer to God

1355
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:35,552
Yeah I'm not sure exactly entire world

1356
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:41,952
Biggest Wars in history have not lied to coming back to God

1357
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,536
To destroy the world

1358
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,840
Yeah I don't f****** know what he's talking about

1359
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:50,656
I think he's talking s*** people

1360
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,704
Towards a f****** Civil War

1361
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:53,984
That's bad

1362
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,056
Really about

1363
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:58,848
How a

1364
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,176
To be real tough

1365
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:04,224
If it like one side would

1366
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:04,992
Probably

1367
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,552
And then everybody else

1368
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,648
I don't know

1369
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,000
That radicalizing people to the point where they would

1370
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:16,768
Commit

1371
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:21,376
Is is

1372
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,936
Possible

1373
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:27,264
Getting appearance is what's going to happen

1374
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,544
But

1375
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,336
The construction of

1376
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:33,408
What you would call a civil war

1377
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,176
Is

1378
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:40,064
More likely than the South and the North

1379
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,088
Terrorist

1380
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,648
Insurgency of like a million people

1381
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:46,208
I get the rest of America

1382
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:50,304
In order for it to fly

1383
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,584
The paint all of his enemies

1384
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,144
Which he's been working on

1385
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:56,960
Previous day

1386
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,752
It's a very major piece

1387
01:24:59,264 --> 01:24:59,776
This move

1388
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,312
He needs to make sure

1389
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,336
That you understand

1390
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:03,872
Everyone

1391
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:04,896
Who you hate

1392
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:09,760
They're all willing participants with

1393
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,320
And so you take a shot of Jack Dorsey

1394
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,672
Who sold their soul

1395
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:27,168
This tweet from 2006

1396
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,520
From Twitter

1397
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:39,712
Good pasta

1398
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,576
No way beautiful

1399
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,600
He's not talking

1400
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,672
No

1401
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,720
You dumb f***

1402
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,608
Shoulder soul

1403
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:04,800
So you already understand what's going on here

1404
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,592
The Satanic Verses

1405
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:10,688
The 1988 novel by Salman Rushdie

1406
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:17,600
Title of that book is an allusion to a group of divinely-inspired

1407
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:20,416
I said to Muhammad by Pagan goddess

1408
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:27,328
But the word

1409
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:30,144
Particularly interesting

1410
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,472
Circle

1411
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:38,336
And that's because it was already subject to intense scrutiny

1412
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,640
Since Jack's the good pasta

1413
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,944
And of course that's code for killing children

1414
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:48,320
Bulshit on this going back to November 26th

1415
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:52,672
But I think it's funny is that Alex is trying to reintroduce this

1416
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:55,488
And use it to call Jackie child killings

1417
01:26:55,744 --> 01:27:00,864
But also protect

1418
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:07,264
Because of course in the present-day Alex is trying to pretend

1419
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:12,128
This is the kind of skills Alex's bring to the table

1420
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:18,016
Pretending that a very famous novel that got a fatwa declared on Salman Rushdie

1421
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:25,440
Even if you haven't read it videos not rushed

1422
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:33,888
You can't be

1423
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:41,056
These feelings of real concern about the escalation

1424
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,872
Violence

1425
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,408
Incompetence as a propaganda

1426
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:51,040
Is anyone listening to the show Google The Satanic Verses immediately see that I was either lying

1427
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:57,184
Or he has no idea what he's talking about yet he's making it a big part of the information needs

1428
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,952
Disseminating

1429
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,768
Alex is doing

1430
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:03,840
But I also see how easy it would be to get out of his trap

1431
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,656
You know if you were trapped

1432
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,680
Because of skill

1433
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:09,216
So completely deteriorated

1434
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:13,056
And I really sincerely hope that people are able to see their way back to reality

1435
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
Because

1436
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,872
This is this is

1437
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,408
Taking the form of

1438
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,200
Like a really destructive

1439
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:24,320
These are ramping up of the

1440
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:27,904
It's not good

1441
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,928
I don't

1442
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,232
Man if that if you

1443
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,768
Start a civil war

1444
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,304
And your guy is

1445
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,072
Is the guy who is

1446
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:35,840
Telling you that

1447
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,144
You actually

1448
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,728
Morlock

1449
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:44,800
Semblance of

1450
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,592
Of intellect whatsoever

1451
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
It's Jess

1452
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,432
Intellect

1453
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,456
Destructive

1454
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:57,856
Into like there but there's also like people who have had emotional

1455
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,648
Now you places

1456
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:03,744
I think people could Escape those bonds a little bit

1457
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,072
Appear so stupid gullibility

1458
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,864
Some people have or vulnerability

1459
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,400
To this sort of attack

1460
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,168
But Alex's

1461
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,704
Is carrying out on me

1462
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:21,408
Which plane is more the intellect is overwritten

1463
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:24,224
Yeah and I'll brief you on that

1464
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,016
Are you

1465
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,112
We're just normal

1466
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,720
Humans we are mere mortals flash bags

1467
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,048
Obviously we did make a deal with the Devil

1468
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:41,120
We don't have the gift

1469
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:43,424
It's someone like an hour

1470
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,984
Learned that he's psychic

1471
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,544
Yes and you talked a little bit more about

1472
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,152
Empathic

1473
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:53,920
Person

1474
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:57,248
Motionless energy

1475
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,040
That makes this worse

1476
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:03,392
As

1477
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,416
Everyone has

1478
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,976
Particular Touch Too Much

1479
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,256
The Shining

1480
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,376
Energy level on the planet right now

1481
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,400
Explosive

1482
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,248
This is a hundred percent real

1483
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:35,136
They're going to try to assassinate the president

1484
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,560
Years ago he and Rodger

1485
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,840
Stone said the Trump

1486
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,400
Diet Coke

1487
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:48,704
Sedative addictive or something

1488
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:52,544
You and so they could be right.

1489
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:59,200
Is the same stuff he's been saying for 3 years now

1490
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,808
Knew about this

1491
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,368
I guess

1492
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:09,696
Maybe is more my point with how irresponsible this stuff is

1493
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,024
When the world is in

1494
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:16,352
State of Affairs

1495
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,888
Not a hot Civil War

1496
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:20,448
Lehigh

1497
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:24,288
The same sort of things that Alex does all the time take on

1498
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,824
Completely different look

1499
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,128
They become so irresponsible

1500
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,432
In other times like a gopher

1501
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:34,016
But Wednesday

1502
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,856
I don't know it just

1503
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,392
You can't

1504
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,928
Take this out of the context of the

1505
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,584
It makes what would normally just be like ignorable in like a Goku

1506
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,120
Keep I keep rambling Alex

1507
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,400
Intuit

1508
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:53,984
You could get someone to do something bad is this kind of talk

1509
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,056
Yeah that is the guitar strings are very very very tight

1510
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:05,760
Yeah I guess that's a good way to put it I mean like it's destroying the super tight normal strumming could break it where as normal strumming is

1511
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,832
You can put up with that in normal time

1512
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,112
Unless it's at a house party

1513
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,560
Whatever

1514
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,096
But

1515
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,632
Realize about

1516
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:22,656
The ADL

1517
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,704
He says that they really love

1518
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,728
FIFA

1519
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:52,096
There's a page on the adl.org entitled

1520
01:32:54,400 --> 01:33:00,544
It's kind of a description

1521
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:06,176
Used to describe a collection of individual groups

1522
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:08,224
What's also not all positive

1523
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,832
Their presence of the protesters and

1524
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,112
Dissuade race

1525
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:20,768
But the use of violent measures by against their adversaries create a vicious self-defeating

1526
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:21,536
Jackson blame

1527
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:27,168
This is why most established

1528
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:32,032
The argument the article goes on quote all forms of violence are problematic

1529
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:35,616
Additionally

1530
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,384
Just another Raven

1531
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,432
Extremist and can't be used for recruiting

1532
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:41,760
This is what you might call a middle-of-the-road

1533
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:46,880
Anyone who opposes for automatically

1534
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:47,904
Or what have you

1535
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:51,232
What else

1536
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:54,048
The urge to make moral equivalence

1537
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:58,144
Even if you think their violence is not great

1538
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,168
Quote

1539
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,960
That's said it's important to reject

1540
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,240
Attempts to climb equivalent

1541
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:08,640
Right-wing extremists have been one of the largest and most consistent source of

1542
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:11,200
Domestic Terror incidents in the United States

1543
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:14,528
They've murdered hundreds of people in this country over the last 10 years alone

1544
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,392
Related murder

1545
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,744
This is not a document that celebrating antifa as much as it is recognized

1546
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,304
The jewels are responding to a real problem

1547
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,352
But the ATL doesn't like some of the meat

1548
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,376
Good witch they're doing

1549
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:35,264
Alex's make grape is at ATL added some new entries to their database of hate

1550
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:38,848
Reflecting that certain things had been adopted by far-right extremists

1551
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,128
To the way to signal to each other

1552
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,408
The bowl cut

1553
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:44,224
An okay sign list as was the use of

1554
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:45,760
Images

1555
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,040
The bowl cut

1556
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,576
Yeah cuz it was dylann roof

1557
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,672
They're getting bowl cut

1558
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:54,976
Apparently

1559
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:02,144
If I had to guess the reason that they added this images to their list

1560
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:11,360
To circulate images about them are far-right extremists

1561
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:17,760
Video argues that these images generally the antifa logo of two flags

1562
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:23,904
It's just an updating of the white supremacist iconography that was used against sharps

1563
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,696
The group of anti-racist

1564
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:30,816
Nothing about that says but if you don't like answering so you're a Nazi or anything like that

1565
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:32,352
All they're saying is that right

1566
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,120
Extremists and whites

1567
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:36,960
Message

1568
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:38,752
I don't think that's a debatable point

1569
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,032
They're definitely doing that

1570
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:46,176
Using one of them

1571
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:46,944
Start

1572
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,248
For example they list a hundred percent

1573
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,528
As being a symbol of extremist

1574
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,344
Because it is, shorthand for 100%

1575
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,904
And was used as common slang white supremacy

1576
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:59,232
That in no way means that the ATL thinks anyone who says like

1577
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,256
Keep it 100

1578
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:02,048
Is signaling that races shouldn't mix

1579
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:05,120
This is an intentional misrepresentation by Alex

1580
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,400
In order to

1581
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,960
Demonize the ATL

1582
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,240
Indicative

1583
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,664
10 years old

1584
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,712
As a way of

1585
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,992
Confirming themselves

1586
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:29,440
Four-wheeler videos list of symbols includes a whole lot of things are just

1587
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:33,024
The number 12 is included because why

1588
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,096
You make the letters Aryan Brotherhood

1589
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:38,400
12

1590
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:40,192
But used by those

1591
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:46,336
It's not to say that the number 12 is

1592
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,968
Baker's dozen

1593
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:56,064
13th and Broadway

1594
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:02,976
To know like

1595
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,256
Is there another

1596
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:08,608
It's a very minor thing

1597
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:10,400
Because they opposed

1598
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,680
People who are like

1599
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,216
Pretty much

1600
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:21,152
I don't know who this is

1601
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,248
Like stupid

1602
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:32,160
I think we should get back together once again you know they come dressed in uniforms they have weapons

1603
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:36,256
I think we need

1604
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,048
In terms of our law enforcement approach

1605
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,072
So

1606
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:41,376
We need to classify

1607
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:45,472
Because they showed two demonstrations in the uniform carry weapons that are almost in Malaysia

1608
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,640
Who shows up

1609
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:56,736
Actually

1610
01:37:56,992 --> 01:38:03,136
You broke the rules I probably also already

1611
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:06,976
You can say that

1612
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,120
Are you saying to me

1613
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,656
Fit somebody Ford

1614
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:19,264
Two edges on it's impossible

1615
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,896
And that's why this type of thinking is so f****** stupid

1616
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:31,296
They are still coming up with a metric to justify class

1617
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:37,696
Also inspire all of your dumb Friends

1618
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:46,144
I assume the metric number of videos I've seen where people are yelling

1619
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,312
Either because that what you want to start

1620
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,104
You got all

1621
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,944
Yeah it's kind of a mess

1622
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:04,320
A little bit

1623
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:08,416
Cobra control of the entire government

1624
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:14,304
Empower otherwise my Alex

1625
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,840
Alex is 100%

1626
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:20,192
He's absolutely trying

1627
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,008
Advocate for

1628
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,288
Make excuses

1629
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,312
Incase

1630
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,336
Trump

1631
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:28,896
Consolidates Power Authority real passion

1632
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,736
Pilates

1633
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,672
Christian music

1634
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,960
Then they can be compromised

1635
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,576
Because they still

1636
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:10,880
So he's got to take over the

1637
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:12,416
The judicial

1638
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:13,440
Wing

1639
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:16,000
I don't like this

1640
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:17,536
I don't like this

1641
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:21,120
And we've described

1642
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,168
This is such a lie

1643
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,704
Alex

1644
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,472
Has

1645
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,008
Novak

1646
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,800
Nothing

1647
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,336
This man is a

1648
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,616
Pathetic

1649
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:32,896
Week

1650

Backbone list

1651
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,456
F****** jelly

1652
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,760
All of his posturing

1653
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,808
So pathetic

1654
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,112
Really

1655
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:47,744
Call Perfect Right There

1656
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,048

Does higher and has employed a lot of

1659
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,520
Primary complaints as we

1660
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:02,336
Learn from listening to the time when Obama was elected

1661
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:05,664
One of its first place with

1662
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,712
That was his critique

1663
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:10,528
Of Obama

1664
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,112
She has to try and

1665
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,256
Administration

1666
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,328
Yeah I remember being very unhappy

1667
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:27,424
2008

1668
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,960
And then 22

1669
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:29,728

Restrain

According to opensecrets Trump Administration Employees 177 people do old positions

1672

How many people do the 100 that's just their both lobbyist

1679

I'm not sure past presidents

Don't might be less than other Administration

1681
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,792
I don't think I really even matters

1682

Lobbyist

Just say that he's corrupt

1689
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,136
Didn't you like it

1690
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,512
F****** the president of

1691
01:42:57,024 --> 01:43:01,888
Is a corrupt

1692
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:07,520
Making him a s*** ton of money off his f****** corrupt God

1693
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:13,664
Now

1694
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,688
Making it

1695
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:15,968
So he's predicted

1696
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,784
Movie premieres

1697
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:22,624
Steve are going to shoot up a bunch of people and they're going to blame

1698
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:34,912
Just washed up comedian

1699
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,960
Mitch Match

1700
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:38,496
Shootings and bombings

1701
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:44,640
Taylor Swift

1702
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:47,712
Adele

1703
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:53,344
That there are groups planning organized mass shootings dresses Jokers

1704
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,392
Real quick that's not what

1705
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:58,976
Set it all complete misrepresentation

1706
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,840
False flag

1707
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,264
Was Trump in Alex Jones support

1708
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:16,128
And they're going to March into those movie theaters and they're going to Gunn people now on

1709
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,176
Blame you

1710
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:23,808
All I hear there is Alex

1711
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:30,464
Terrified someone is going to shoot people at a

1712
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:38,144
F****** terrified of that to Deeks he's creating narrative

1713
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:44,544
Right now as they're faking their social media profiles to make it look like their fans about

1714
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,408
As long as they are at been on social media

1715
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:55,808
Years old

1716
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:59,392
Right right right

1717
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,768
Beautiful

1718
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:06,816
It was all a plant

1719
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:08,608
Right

1720
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,376
Something

1721
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:16,544
Preemptive damage control

1722
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:21,664
Who are more likely to commit are also more likely

1723
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,432
2

1724
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,968
Being aligned with him

1725
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,528
Good luck

1726
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,088
Cope

1727
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,112
That no one

1728
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,136
There isn't any

1729
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:35,488
Is probably overblown there probably won't be

1730
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,280
Problems

1731
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:38,048
Premier

1732
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:44,192
Alex

1733
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:47,264
TVs are elaborate

1734
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:50,592
You've got here even know how to set up this cliff

1735
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:56,736
Exactly what they're doing

1736
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:08,256
Devil worshippers

1737
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,280
Texas

1738
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,376
Ohio

1739
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,712
Incel

1740
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,792
Don't kill people

1741
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:52,288
Ashaway weather today

1742
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:08,416
Good news about ever

1743
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,208
Singer doing falling on their face

1744
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:14,304
402

1745
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,072
Sunburn

1746
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,864
Animal take your phone calls

1747
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:19,424
This is the big Push by the globalist

1748
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:32,992
If you follow that the Siri is

1749
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,832
TVs are High TV shows are high

1750
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:39,904
Caserta thing in order to precipitate

1751
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:46,304
Shootings that are actually false Flags in order to take away Alex's guns which will track Civil War so that

1752
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,584
The Chinese can take over

1753
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:50,656
The globalist

1754
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:53,984
Because we're on how many

1755
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:58,080
This is like a game of mousetrap Alex's mom

1756
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,104
This is absurd

1757
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:01,664
Rube Goldberg ass brain

1758
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,944
Get out of here

1759
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:10,112
Close to funny as we're going to get

1760
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:13,184
Go to the coffee room

1761
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,464
During the break

1762
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,488
And he has a real has a

1763
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:18,816
Break room

1764
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,376
Coffee

1765
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,480
Psychoanalyze myself

1766
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,320
Oh my God

1767
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,512
What

1768
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,328
I really sat back and so do you.

1769
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:54,144
We need people

1770
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:57,472
Plan

1771
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,264
Go to the street

1772
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,056
Willie do it

1773
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:04,640
Just scanned

1774
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:07,712
To find out when Democrats are common

1775
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:12,320
Or San Antonio or Dallas

1776
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,632
Yeah I know s***

1777
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:27,168
Doing that already

1778
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,192
Lakewood

1779
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:30,752
Hilarious

1780
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:36,384
Realizes I am not

1781
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:42,784
No idea

1782
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:47,904
Cheap publicity by going on

1783
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,464
Why the f*** if I'm not done that all this is

1784
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:54,304
Realizing

1785
01:49:55,584 --> 01:50:01,728
Back when I was a young man

1786
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:03,264
Reaper publicity and attention

1787
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:09,664
Ezi

1788
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:15,296
But now I do Alex

1789
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:17,088
You are not doing a good enough job

1790
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:19,136
You have to Google

1791
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:21,184
You have to get Battle

1792
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,232
You have to do the very basic

1793
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,768
Minimum of knowing

1794
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:29,120
When your enemies are going to be in your state

1795
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:30,400
People

1796
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:33,472
Drilling you up with like

1797
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:37,056
Stop this problem

1798
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:39,360
And then when you get down to the solution

1799
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:41,408
We good Google

1800
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:49,344
I don't have any solutions

1801
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:53,952
Butterfly fish

1802
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:54,720
Great

1803
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:58,816
So Alex

1804
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:03,936
This episode on the audience thinks we should do

1805
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:05,472
Is usually a bad sign

1806
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:23,904
What should we do today

1807
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,184
Because

1808
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,512
History Staffing

1809
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,216
Take some over

1810
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:39,264
Messages

1811
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,288
Great idea

1812
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:54,112
Civil War

1813
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:08,448
Here's the problem.

1814
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:09,216
Any of them

1815
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,776
The problem with

1816
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:18,944
Call about things like flying planes and stuff

1817
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:22,784
How do we stop this before it becomes a physical Civil War

1818
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:26,880
When earlier this episode he already clearly articulated

1819
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:28,672
So why are you

1820
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:29,440
Call

1821
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:31,232
On what we can do

1822
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,512
To stop

1823
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:36,864
What I've already determined isn't necessary outcome because you got it

1824
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:39,168
80

1825
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:40,192
Given America

1826
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:43,776
You got to try

1827
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:47,104
It's like the opening of its like the opening of The Wire

1828
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:49,152
Why do you let him play

1829
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,432
This is America

1830
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:51,968
You got it right

1831
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,528
Night I don't I don't I think that

1832
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,344
I think this is nonsense

1833
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,904
Everett

1834
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,696
Is leading you to the ultimate

1835
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:02,464
Conclusion

1836
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:06,304
There's going to be Millions dead in a shooting War here in America

1837
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:11,680
So what do we do to stop it I don't know let's go

1838
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:14,240
Get me more press

1839
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:19,360
It's right there and I'm sure Alex wants that message to be

1840
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,688
Distributed

1841
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:24,736
But all of that is

1842
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:27,552
Like its rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic

1843
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:28,832
Like he

1844
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:31,136
Has said the ship is going down

1845
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,440
It's almost like

1846
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:37,280
To do before the Civil War

1847
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:46,752
The best-case scenario recruit more people on our side

1848
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:49,312
What kind of Aldi's

1849
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:50,336
He's doing

1850
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:54,944
Legal over the entire democratic

1851
01:53:55,200 --> 01:54:01,088
Hey if Bernie is giving a speech in your makeover

1852
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:06,720
I guess what he's just saying is like detract attention

1853
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:09,536
Whatever

1854
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:12,608
Public debt

1855
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:13,376
More life

1856
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:16,960
Repeating it

1857
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:21,568
What do you think we should do

1858
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:24,640
How to legally lawful

1859
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:27,712
Play Sublime

1860
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,600
Excuse

1861
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:38,976
Outcome of the rhetoric

1862
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:41,280
They're planning to do that

1863
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:43,840
You can't blame me for that cuz I can

1864
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:49,216
Reason to believe that my audiences

1865
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:53,056
Incline towards non-legal.

1866
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:54,848
That's all that's going on here

1867
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:58,944
Keenly aware

1868
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:03,808
Wait what no this is Vee I'm going to murder you politically

1869
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,880
No I mean like the legally lawfully

1870
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:07,904
Bet you half

1871
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:08,928
To say legally

1872
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:10,720
It's a way you wouldn't be like

1873
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:13,536
Why did you need to say you weren't going to rewrite

1874
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:17,632
Exactly

1875
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:19,168
Has a bunch of f****** weird

1876
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:26,336
Predicated on the idea that the globalist

1877
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,872
Kill Everybody

1878
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:29,664
And the reason that the

1879
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:32,224
Alex has a theory about that

1880
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:34,528
It's not a good one

1881
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:44,768
Rose Garden

1882
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:54,752
Bars at Trader

1883
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:30,592
This is far too complicated to get all the way into and it's a lotus

1884
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:36,480
But basically Alex's belief is that there are a ton of indictments on all these

1885
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,576
You back

1886
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:43,904
Alex's stuff

1887
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,208
It is yeah

1888
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:54,656
If I already hate

1889
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:58,496
You're like I don't think he's going to be like takeover

1890
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,384
Losing

1891
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,152
Without

1892
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:06,432
They're guys

1893
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:09,248
Give directions right

1894
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,272
Kind of

1895
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:11,808
A lot of the followers are kind of

1896
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:16,416
Already

1897
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:17,952
I don't

1898
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:18,720
Work

1899
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:22,304
That is funny how is how so many people who would

1900
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,072
Describe themselves

1901
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:24,864
Individual

1902
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:25,632
Starset

1903
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:26,912
Lost for what

1904
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:27,680
To do the MoMA

1905
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:29,984
Fictional being no longer

1906
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,264
Forgive them

1907
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,288
I don't have

1908
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:35,360
Post on a message board to tell me what to Google anymore

1909
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,384
Oh no

1910
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:38,432
Alex

1911
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:40,736
I think the most important pieces but Alex is

1912
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,528
Just like Auntie level

1913
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:48,672
They're all these indictments

1914
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:53,792
Give more public

1915
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:57,120
You actually think that

1916
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:59,680
Everybody around Trump is doing everything

1917
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:01,472
Possible to keep him away from TV

1918
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:05,056
Siri like the end of f****** Ironman

1919
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:10,176
I think I think a lot of Trumps enemies would like

1920
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:15,296
Kim to do more

1921
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:22,208
He wants to find out some solutions

1922
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:29,888
The products but I honestly think the best thing that anyone can do right now

1923
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:32,192
Can you sort of hysterical situation

1924
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:34,496
Is get a trump t-shirt get a high

1925
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:39,872
Go out there and represent no matter where you're going

1926
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,712
Alex's Eden

1927
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:49,344
You can hear he has a mouthful of something flies are going

1928
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:52,160
Solution is

1929
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:53,184
Where Trump merch

1930
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,512
To both plug Alex

1931
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:59,072
Texas products but also wants to let everybody know.

1932
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,096
To buy Trump

1933
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:05,216
I mean I'll write absolutely not a corrupt God that we are

1934
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:07,776
A tall is our best way to support him

1935
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:09,056
To purchase things

1936
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:10,336
Lionel Richie

1937
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:12,896
That is not corrupt whatsoever Our God that

1938
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,456
A leaving that aside for a second

1939
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,224
Like

1940
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:18,016
That's your suggestion

1941
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:19,552
Close

1942
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:24,160
You are not doing it man

1943
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:27,744
The Civil War

1944
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,512
Hats

1945
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:31,584
Okay

1946
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:37,728
Screaming conspiracy theories

1947
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,032
Awesome the right

1948
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:41,568
Not just getting good at comedy

1949
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:42,592
They're good at

1950
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:43,360
Organize

1951
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:50,016
The Hat thing is kind of like I guess you could be overly generous to that

1952
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:53,344
Suggested to be like Congress

1953
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:57,696
Support for Trump because of all the hats

1954
01:59:58,208 --> 02:00:00,000
Because Alex

1955
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:03,584
He believes that would solve an essential problem

1956
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:05,632
And that is the Congress is to

1957
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:07,680
Congress

1958
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:12,032
You are amazing

1959
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,664
Democrats

1960
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:21,760
Baseball game

1961
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:23,552
Really

1962
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,088
Really

1963
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:29,696
Security officer

1964
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,024
Who shot

1965
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,048
The shooter

1966
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,584
One second

1967
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:37,632
The guy opened

1968
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:45,056
1

1969
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:45,824
Second

1970
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:50,176
That wouldn't have happened could have killed a lot of those members

1971
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:05,024
Stop

1972
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:11,168
So small baseball practice

1973
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:15,520
There was approximately 10 minutes shootout with him before he was taken down

1974
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:16,800
Completely making that up

1975
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:21,920
I'm in the process of that shootout he also shot a police officer Congressional

1976
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:24,224
Who buy Alex's definition problem

1977
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,760
Congressional baseball Bragg

1978
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:26,528
Oh well

1979
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,576
None of the people that Alex names

1980
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:29,600
We're at their practice

1981
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:30,624
Jim Jordan

1982
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,352
Jeff Locke was also there but

1983
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:44,960
What is true that the perpetrator of that crime

1984
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:48,544
It's kind of Illuminating though to see the different

1985
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,312
Responses

1986
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:56,736
Of particular note was how Bernie Sanders responded to news that the

1987
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:59,808
He said that there were bad people on boats

1988
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:06,464
That's what he said

1989
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:14,656
I've just been informed that the Republican baseball practice

1990
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:17,728
I'm sickened by the stuff that despicable

1991
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:19,520
Let me be as clear as I can be

1992
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:24,128
Unacceptable

1993
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:27,200
Real change can only come through nonviolent action

1994
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:28,480
And everything else runs

1995
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:30,528
Powder to our most deeply held American value

1996
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:36,672
There's no didn't work on his campaign there's no attempt to make him look bad

1997
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:43,072
I find it hard to believe that Alex would respond similarly if I don't know

1998
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:44,352
Las Vegas

1999
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:45,888
Nope

2000
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:47,424
Alex. That was a false flag

2001
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:54,080
Yeah also Alex at the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords

2002
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:57,152
So I don't think he has any f****** ground to stand on

2003
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,944
After that trains

2004
02:02:59,200 --> 02:02:59,712
Situation

2005
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:00,736
How does a real

2006
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:05,088
What happened there was that on January 31st 2018

2007
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:09,184
Bunch of Republican Congress members in West Virginia

2008
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,464
When it collided with a

2009
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:11,232
Trash truck

2010
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,352
No one on the train was seriously injured but

2011
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:18,144
Was killed

2012
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:25,312
Seems to forget about a lot of them all the other people who were shot at the baseball field

2013
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:26,592
This guy who died in the truck

2014
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:31,456
The national Transportation safety board conducted a full investigation of that into

2015
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:34,528
I decided to what it happened was that

2016
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:35,808
Trucks

2017
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:38,624
Tried to go around the lowered safety gates

2018
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:41,184
To cross the railroad thinking there wasn't rain coming

2019
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:45,024
Are they believed based on a minute-by-minute breakdown of the event

2020
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:47,840
The driver wasn't

2021
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:50,144
This is a tragic accident

2022
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:50,912
Which

2023
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:56,032
Is imperative really quickly

2024
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:58,592
There was ultimately no truth to that

2025
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,360
At all

2026
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:04,480
Alex's narrative is particularly stupid because there's tons of pictures of the aftermath of the accident

2027
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:05,504
Republic

2028
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:08,576
You can see that after the Collision

2029
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:11,136
They're so easy to produce evidence

2030
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:12,416
Tracks it blown up

2031
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,952
And there's no evidence of that

2032
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:14,720
At all

2033
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:18,304
There's plenty of evidence that defends the version of the story that I have just told you

2034
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,864
The only thing backing up Alex's version is

2035
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:22,144
Alex said it

2036
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:24,448
There's nothing True to this at all

2037
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:25,984
Well you may have screenshots

2038
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:27,520
From video game

2039
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:33,408
Snidely Whiplash

2040
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,296
Skip back to his big plan to go yell at them

2041
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:40,320
Democrats

2042
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:47,488
Close like you can

2043
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:55,680
Every live show

2044
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:58,496
Getting there

2045
02:04:59,264 --> 02:04:59,776
What

2046
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:05,664
Has to keep saying legal and lawful in order to

2047
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:11,040
But when you're saying it like this I'm going to go out and you can get closer to them

2048
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:13,344
F***** up

2049
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:17,184
Whitaker

2050
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:22,048
Why is proximity important

2051
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:27,424
With their with their corruption why is it why is proximity important it's not important at all

2052
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:28,704
Whip Whitaker

2053
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:31,776
Dodgeball

2054
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:34,336
Jordan

2055
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:35,104
Bulshit

2056
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:38,176
Bananas

2057
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:38,944
The twin

2058
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:43,296
Turbines of

2059
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:45,088
They're going to

2060
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:46,624
Duo

2061
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,648
Massive Attack

2062
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:48,416
Blame it on us

2063
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:51,744
You need to protest legal Aloft

2064
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:52,512
Tubac

2065
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,656
Do this legally

2066
02:05:59,168 --> 02:05:59,936
It's such a

2067
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:00,960
Consistently

2068
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:02,240
I am doing

2069
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:04,032
Everything in my

2070
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:04,800
Ipower

2071
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:05,568
To have

2072
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:07,104
Documented evidence

2073
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:10,176
Tried

2074
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:11,200
This s***

2075
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:12,224
Absolutely

2076
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,504
It's

2077
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:19,904
You're watching WWE

2078
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:25,792
But you can tell from the way they're shooting it but it's clear that this match

2079
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:29,120
The Optics are meant to be played in a

2080
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:33,728
Sizzle reel

2081
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:37,056
Iconic with the actual match

2082
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:38,080
Isabel

2083
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:43,712
That's what I hear hear what you keep saying over and over and over again

2084
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:48,320
To defend Infowars someone

2085
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:52,672
Gets up close at one of these rallies that does something

2086
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:54,208
Write it.

2087
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:56,768
It's it does feel that way

2088
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:02,144
It's particularly important that I keep driving home this point at Alex's Express

2089
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:05,472
A civil war is inevitable

2090
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:09,056
This is not business as usual this is not status quo

2091
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:15,712
A hundred percent chance

2092
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:17,760
What

2093
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:22,112
100% false flag

2094
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:26,208
Senior

2095
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:43,616
Doing what

2096
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:44,640
God

2097
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:48,480
Like

2098
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:50,528
Like this is too much

2099
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:51,808
To the point

2100
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:53,856
Like does he know something

2101
02:07:54,880 --> 02:08:00,512
Like how f****** I know I know know know

2102
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:01,792
Hear him say that

2103
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:09,984
Secaucus impossible to get away from irrational

2104
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:18,944
It's so suspicious

2105
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:25,344
It doesn't indicate anything

2106
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,112
How

2107
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:28,416
Consistent this is how weird

2108
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:29,184
Like 88

2109
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:31,232
No I think

2110
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:35,328
I don't think he knows something but I think

2111
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:36,352
What if he does

2112
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:42,496
Your irrational thoughts

2113
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:46,336
Probably a hundred percent Nitro

2114
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:47,872
What actually I think

2115
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:48,640
Illustrates

2116
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:49,408
Demonstrate

2117
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:50,688
Is that Alex

2118
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:52,736
Is smart enough to understand

2119
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:55,040
The prince

2120
02:08:55,808 --> 02:08:59,648
In the actual world are lining up and down tangling with his rhetoric

2121
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:04,768
But it's very likely that someone is going to do something f***** up

2122
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:06,560
And so this is

2123
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:09,120
Preemptive damage control

2124
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:11,936
Hopefully no one does

2125
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:16,288
Infowars as a business

2126
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,080
That's what he's doing here

2127
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:19,872
Wow at the same time

2128
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:20,896
Can you bring all in the same

2129
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:21,664
Make

2130
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:22,688
Please sort of thing

2131
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:24,224
These tragedies more like

2132
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:27,040
It's completely irresponsible

2133
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:28,320
It's absolutely

2134
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:29,600
Disgusting

2135
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:33,696
But I don't know if it's illegal it should be probably

2136
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:37,024
More than happy for

2137
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,048
Push-backs

2138
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:40,352
And don't think that I think this

2139
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:42,144
Truth it

2140
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:43,680
But

2141
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:46,240
There is a part of me that hears

2142
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:47,776
Go on.

2143
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:49,824
Like when he's

2144
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,360
You think

2145
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:00,320
Feels like you

2146
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:03,648
No because if they

2147
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,416
I do

2148
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:06,464
He's going to get a lot of

2149
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:09,792
A picture and

2150
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:11,840
Don't want to believe

2151
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:13,888
He's that much of

2152
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:16,704
I don't think that you would do that

2153
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,752
But it really does

2154
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:20,800
If somebody did

2155
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:21,568
F******

2156
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:22,336
Do something

2157
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:25,408
Then Infowars

2158
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:27,200
Going to be all over the news

2159
02:10:27,456 --> 02:10:30,016
And he already has the legal and lawful defense

2160
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:31,808
Prepared right

2161
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:36,672
I don't think there's any way

2162
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:37,696
Trying to do

2163
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:44,096
Episode when we are talking about the day we heard him be like

2164
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:47,936
So I don't know

2165
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:49,216
I want to believe

2166
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,520
I don't want to believe that you would

2167
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:55,872
And I don't want to believe that you would ever do it

2168
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:58,944
I don't believe it

2169
02:10:59,456 --> 02:10:59,968
There we go

2170
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:04,320
One of the issues that comes up I think

2171
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:05,088
Is

2172
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:06,880
He's framing things

2173
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:07,904
So I can

2174
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:08,672
Consistently

2175
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:12,256
The Jocelyn back and forth

2176
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:13,024
Between

2177
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:14,816
They're going to fall asleep

2178
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:48,864
Nosey people from Power

2179
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:54,752
Don't know how you can

2180
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:00,128
It's spiritually right

2181
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:01,920
To start committing violence

2182
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:03,968
Against these people because they're so terrible

2183
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:09,344
Because they brainwashed if you do that it's going to be bad strategy

2184
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:13,696
Are completely irresponsible unacceptable

2185
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:14,976
4

2186
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:20,864
So

2187
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:22,400
That's f***** up on its face

2188
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:24,704
She goes to calls again

2189
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,520
And you get the caller who brings up the remnant

2190
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:33,152
For the people who will be less

2191
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:35,200
After there's like a big calling

2192
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:35,968
On the Earth

2193
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:37,760
Not the

2194
02:12:38,272 --> 02:12:40,576
No DiCaprio

2195
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:42,880
Avatar

2196
02:12:43,648 --> 02:12:46,720
The second season of bundyville

2197
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:53,120
Explainer on the Revenant ideas

2198
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:56,960
Yeah so this caller brings that up

2199
02:12:57,216 --> 02:13:00,800
If you understand that you can hear the code

2200
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:02,080
And the discussion

2201
02:13:02,336 --> 02:13:03,616
What's going on on

2202
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:05,664
And she has a solution for

2203
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:06,688
What's

2204
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:07,712
People should do

2205
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:08,736
Stupid

2206
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:10,528
Also know that

2207
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:13,344
Christ said God said that

2208
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:14,880
A remnant

2209
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:16,928
It would be sold out to him

2210
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:20,512
Okay because he only needs a remnant

2211
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:22,048
That will stand up

2212
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:24,352
To this evil this evil has been

2213
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:27,936
Has been going on since the beginning

2214
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:33,056
Starting with Kane will continue until Jesus comes back again

2215
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:36,384
My suggestion

2216
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:41,248
Okay now we can really make it this different than fighting this war

2217
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:43,040
If every

2218
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:44,064
Mingle

2219
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:45,088
Princeton

2220
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:49,184
That is a regular listening listener to your show

2221
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,232
Would commit to give just

2222
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:53,024
$5 a month

2223
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,816
Faithfully every month

2224
02:13:55,328 --> 02:14:00,704
Until this thing is over and again it's not going to be over until Jesus comes again

2225
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:05,824
Let's say there's 2 million

2226
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:09,152
Faithful listeners out there

2227
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:12,224
If you multiply $5 * 2

2228
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:13,504
Million

2229
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:14,784
That would be

2230
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:17,344
10 million dollars a month

2231
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:19,648
Alex would be getting in

2232
02:14:19,904 --> 02:14:25,536
That he could kill.

2233
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,584
Absolutely

2234
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:38,080
You know what somebody that works there

2235
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:44,736
Like to jump around on it but I honestly feel the same way

2236
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:50,624
Cuz later in the episode another call from another religious weirdo who has another suggestion

2237
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,928
How to deal with the coming crisis

2238
02:14:55,232 --> 02:15:01,376
You're a modern-day Apostle Paul you're fighting the same side he thought you understand is he

2239
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,424
Our Real Enemy

2240
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:06,240
You all was every show

2241
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:09,824
You mention Our God and Savior Jesus Christ

2242
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:11,872
Is our only solution

2243
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:13,408
You

2244
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,736
You're obligated Outlet

2245
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:20,064
To ask for contributions

2246
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:25,184
That would be graciously given if you would set up an organized way

2247
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,232
So that we your Lester's

2248
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:30,304
Millions of Christians around the world

2249
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:39,520
So there seems to be a real Trend in these collars that are calling in

2250
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:42,336
Religiously Basinger

2251
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:43,360
Tons of money

2252
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:49,760
Yeah that's strange to me he's getting

2253
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:53,856
There are many calls cuz he never does

2254
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:56,672
Religious extremist

2255
02:15:56,928 --> 02:15:58,976
Who were calling in and

2256
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:04,608
Millions of Christians should give you money and the other one is a more concrete

2257
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:08,704
All of your listeners should give you $5 a month to give 10 billion dollars a month

2258
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:10,496
Like it really seems

2259
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:14,592
I'm not saying that they're playing

2260
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:19,456
Prove it I can't prove it but it's

2261
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:20,480
Weird

2262
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:21,504
Cannot prove

2263
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:22,784
It's weird

2264
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:29,440
Come on

2265
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:32,512
It's train televangelist has their own

2266
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:35,840
End

2267
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:37,632
Well actually

2268
02:16:41,472 --> 02:16:42,496
Call Hugo's on

2269
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:43,520
To say some others

2270
02:16:47,104 --> 02:16:47,616
It's interesting

2271
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:54,528
Victoria and that's why you need us behind you we need

2272
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:56,832
Need to be giving to your

2273
02:16:58,112 --> 02:17:02,208
On a monthly basis but commitment

2274
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:03,232
To your ministry

2275
02:17:03,488 --> 02:17:07,584
Is that your

2276
02:17:08,352 --> 02:17:14,496
These are nice we got the bigger Army we got the bigger stick his name is Jesus Christ then I might throw

2277
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:16,800
Donald Trump in there along with him

2278
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:22,176
So turn down the level of somehow

2279
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:28,576
Which is sacrilegious I really I really don't think

2280
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:30,368
Clearly

2281
02:17:30,624 --> 02:17:33,440
In their religion would say something like that

2282
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:35,232
And then

2283
02:17:35,488 --> 02:17:39,328
The monthly thing coming back up in that second caller

2284
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:42,144
It seems like Alex might be trying to Launch

2285
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:45,472
Like a patreon clone or something like that

2286
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:50,592
Subscribestar

2287
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:56,992
Already about it yeah

2288
02:17:57,248 --> 02:18:01,088
Pictures in the world wanted to go and give $5 a month to Alex's subscribestar

2289
02:18:01,344 --> 02:18:02,112
They could do it

2290
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:04,416
Now and they're not doing it

2291
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:07,744
Because milk millions of Christians aren't listening to

2292
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,304
Because he is outrageously

2293
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:12,864
Sacrilegious

2294
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:15,168
It would offend anyone who takes their face

2295
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:17,984
Televangelist

2296
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:18,752
Do what they do

2297
02:18:20,032 --> 02:18:20,544
Mcmillions

2298
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:23,104
Sarah little smoother

2299
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:29,248
I would argue Jim Bakker

2300
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:31,040
Included

2301
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:34,368
Now that is somehow transcended his

2302
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:37,184
He did Raisa

2303
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:48,960
I don't know I don't know

2304
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:52,032
I hate to extend into things that I

2305
02:18:52,288 --> 02:18:53,312
Can't really

2306
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:57,664
Even looking to even if I wanted to but I do have a strong suspicion that

2307
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:59,712
Both of those collars are not real college

2308
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:02,528
I think it when Alex is getting on air

2309
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:07,136
Eddie's talking about Solutions and how do we avert the Civil War

2310
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:13,536
Two people would be overt religious weirdos and they would both come up with the idea of a monthly donations for Alex

2311
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:15,072
Which already exist

2312
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:16,352
It seems

2313
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,120
Estranged

2314
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:21,472
Find it has to consider

2315
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:23,520
Real

2316
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:29,408
Who is the guy who made Gap

2317
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:31,712
Is great

2318
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:39,136
Hey wipe the two of them have a little bit of a bull session about how to launch its own Google

2319
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:40,928
They're all 9

2320
02:19:41,184 --> 02:19:43,488
The right

2321
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:44,512
Who cares

2322
02:19:45,024 --> 02:19:50,144
A little conversation and I don't really care that I think it's worth

2323
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:04,224
If you call someone

2324
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:20,096
YouTube

2325
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:23,424
Sprite

2326
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:30,080
Classic play by fire and fascist

2327
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:37,504
Situations vulnerable communities are provided protection

2328
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:39,296
A private

2329
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:43,392
Citizen if you dare breach their guidelines about political correctness

2330
02:20:48,256 --> 02:20:51,840
This is aggressively in terms of motions ever made

2331
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:56,960
Projectile lgbtq Folk

2332
02:20:57,216 --> 02:21:00,544
Air Canada Bill C 16 of 2007

2333
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:07,712
They're constantly decried by right-wing scam artist as being about a ploy to lock you up if you dare use the wrong gender pronoun

2334
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:14,368
Non-binary people would immediately become overpowered

2335
02:21:15,392 --> 02:21:17,952
In reality the cantabile is about housing and employment

2336
02:21:18,208 --> 02:21:18,720
Discrimination

2337
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:24,096
Expression into the category of things you're not allowed to discriminate on

2338
02:21:24,352 --> 02:21:25,376
In terms of public

2339
02:21:27,936 --> 02:21:34,080
This is the same thing your guidelines they were about workplace discrimination and protecting lgbtq individuals

2340
02:21:34,336 --> 02:21:36,128
For being the target of unsafe

2341
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:43,808
Now here we have Alex promoter of the owner of

2342
02:21:44,064 --> 02:21:45,600
The place where bigots and Nazis going

2343
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:50,464
$50,000 fine

2344
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:52,512
If you call someone an illegal alien

2345
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:57,376
What do you think the story is really about Jordan

2346
02:21:57,632 --> 02:21:59,168
If you

2347
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:01,216
Kick them out of their place because they did

2348
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:01,984
Didn't pay rent

2349
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:06,080
If you

2350
02:22:08,128 --> 02:22:08,640
Illegal immigrant

2351
02:22:09,408 --> 02:22:09,920
I'm out of their place

2352
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,480
If your

2353
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:16,064
Inflammatory like that anymore

2354
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:18,880
You can't literally hand her over.

2355
02:22:19,136 --> 02:22:21,696
It's about workplace housing in public accommodations

2356
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:29,120
The new guidelines laid out by the New York Commission on human rights do it how if you're in a position like you're an employer

2357
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:32,704
You can't treat someone differently because you assume they might be in Hamburg

2358
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:33,984
Princeton

2359
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:37,312
Get there a legal resident because they have an accent

2360
02:22:37,824 --> 02:22:38,592
Unless you ask

2361
02:22:38,848 --> 02:22:39,616
Everyone

2362
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:40,640
Who doesn't have an ass

2363
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:41,664
Quest

2364
02:22:42,432 --> 02:22:45,760
The same goes for discrimination based on English proficiency

2365
02:22:46,016 --> 02:22:50,112
So you're anything any kind of stereotyping you might have

2366
02:22:55,744 --> 02:22:58,048
That's probably fine if you're a private citizen

2367
02:22:59,072 --> 02:23:02,656
I mean it's already against the law if you're an employer to do that

2368
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:07,520
You would ask them

2369
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:08,544
They be like I don't like

2370
02:23:10,592 --> 02:23:12,896
The document also clarifies that quote

2371
02:23:13,152 --> 02:23:19,296
The use of the terms illegal alien and illegal humiliate or offend a person or persons

2372
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:21,856
The workplace amounts to unlawful discrimination

2373
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:23,648
Of course it does

2374
02:23:24,416 --> 02:23:25,696
In terms of the housing Porsche

2375
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:27,744
That all

2376
02:23:28,256 --> 02:23:30,816
These guidelines and anyway you can't evict

2377
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:33,376
Undocumented immigrant even if they don't pay rent

2378
02:23:33,632 --> 02:23:38,496
Bulshit literally everything I've

2379
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:40,288
I've ever known about any

2380
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:46,944
Right Alex is trying to create a perception that people like undocumented immigrants are above the normal rules

2381
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:49,760
Even Noble Lightfoot friends are subjected to

2382
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:55,392
Because it helps to feed his victimhood complex without wouldn't have ever made a dime on this show

2383
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:58,208
The guidelines clearly layout Waze

2384
02:23:58,464 --> 02:23:59,744
Document

2385
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,280
Status or nation of origin

2386
02:24:01,536 --> 02:24:02,304
Can be evicted

2387
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:04,352
If your landlord you just can't

2388
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:08,704
For instance by threatening to call Ice

2389
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:09,728
This extends

2390
02:24:09,984 --> 02:24:10,752
Ignoring tenant

2391
02:24:11,008 --> 02:24:12,800
Complaints or attempt

2392
02:24:13,056 --> 02:24:15,104
Not complaining about property issues

2393
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:17,664
By implying or threatening to call Ice

2394
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:20,480
Here's how I know that Alex

2395
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:21,760
Torba are gigantic

2396
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:23,552
If they weren't

2397
02:24:23,808 --> 02:24:25,344
They would be discussing these guidelines

2398
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:26,880
As they actually exist

2399
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:29,440
Instead of trying to create strong men to attack

2400
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:37,888
Because to oppose these guidelines is to Advocate that employers and employees

2401
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:41,472
Abusive working environments just because they think they're undocumented

2402
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:46,592
They would have to advocate for live like a legitimate systemic racism and xenophobia

2403
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:48,896
Wear it if you want a white person you just had

2404
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:51,968
Just suck it up and live with whatever ship people in positions of authority

2405
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:53,760
And here's the fix

2406
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:55,040
B21 advert

2407
02:24:56,064 --> 02:25:02,208
It's the situation they want to have in the world but they're smart enough to know that if they came out and made those arguments sincerely

2408
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:03,232
Run the risk of being

2409
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:06,816
This whole facade of free speech disappears

2410
02:25:07,072 --> 02:25:08,352
The donations from non-racing

2411
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:09,632
Completely dry up

2412
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:12,192
I can stay if we want to take a the lawsuit

2413
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:12,960
That Alex

2414
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:17,568
His treatment of them is

2415
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:21,920
Yeah he just want to be able to threaten whatever bulshit he wants

2416
02:25:22,176 --> 02:25:27,296
Create unsafe working environments for minority with

2417
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:33,696
Guidelines without making it look like they're really just want naan

2418
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:34,976
White people to have no protect

2419
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:36,000
Society

2420
02:25:36,512 --> 02:25:42,656
They create the strong

2421
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:49,056
You'll be assigned a quarter billion dollars and just like that they can turn their

2422
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:54,688
These human rights protection without having to say why they really take issue with

2423
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:58,272
His 13 Elementary tricks Alex does all the time

2424
02:25:58,528 --> 02:25:59,808
It's awesome

2425
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:04,672
The statute

2426
02:26:05,696 --> 02:26:06,464
This pattern is to cancel

2427
02:26:07,232 --> 02:26:09,792
He knows what he's doing

2428
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:14,400
Attempts to attack societal protection against

2429
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:15,680
And

2430
02:26:16,192 --> 02:26:16,704
We can go f*** himself

2431
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:19,264
This is all just

2432
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:20,544
Coated White

2433
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:21,312
Missy videos

2434
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:24,128
Black

2435
02:26:24,896 --> 02:26:25,664
It is my squad

2436
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:28,736
We get back to the violence non-violence

2437
02:26:30,272 --> 02:26:31,296
Alex is putting forth on

2438
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,216
Help my brain

2439
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:51,264
Not going into combat mode

2440
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:57,408
Restarting combat Bowser losing

2441
02:26:59,456 --> 02:27:00,992
25 years

2442
02:27:01,248 --> 02:27:05,600
25 of the years

2443
02:27:08,928 --> 02:27:13,792
Clippers 35 seconds

2444
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:15,584
That's not a good sign

2445
02:27:16,864 --> 02:27:18,144
That means there's a problem

2446
02:27:20,704 --> 02:27:22,240
Like I completed mission

2447
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:24,288
That your show has a problem

2448
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:30,688
You don't say twice in 35 seconds

2449
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:39,136
Even by Alex's own behavior that

2450
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:41,184
Implies an awareness that the shows

2451
02:27:42,464 --> 02:27:44,256
So Andrew

2452
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:48,352
They

2453
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:50,144
Are actually

2454
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:57,824
People that project

2455
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:07,040
I was in Savage

2456
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:31,872
It's fair that maybe some people are definitely far to stereotyping

2457
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:33,408
Southern people in also

2458
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:37,248
Far to stereotyping the other direction of people at North

2459
02:28:40,064 --> 02:28:42,368
Although I cannot believe for a f****** second

2460
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:43,136
The story that Alex

2461
02:28:43,392 --> 02:28:43,904
Stalin

2462
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:50,560
Until I went off to college

2463
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:56,960
Oh my word

2464
02:29:13,856 --> 02:29:16,416
I can't do a show without somebody coming up to

2465
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:17,184
To me afterwards

2466
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:18,976
Looking both directions

2467
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:19,744
Being like

2468
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:24,096
How do you feel about jokes like and then insert minority

2469
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:29,728
Is trying to malign anybody who

2470
02:29:31,776 --> 02:29:36,896
So congratulations you know let's say aggressively

2471
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:43,040
You might be Pro fascism

2472
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:48,928
Is your sport of demonizing people who are anti racist

2473
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:51,744
It implies that maybe you have a kinship with rape

2474
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:53,792
It doesn't prove

2475
02:29:54,048 --> 02:29:55,072
But it implies it

2476
02:29:55,328 --> 02:29:57,120
This is this is not a good

2477
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:02,240
And his next life doesn't help any of the feelings that I'm having about these

2478
02:30:12,736 --> 02:30:16,832
And we are the great

2479
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:29,376
So

2480
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:33,472
That's pretty good

2481
02:30:33,728 --> 02:30:34,752
Coach Taylor

2482
02:30:35,008 --> 02:30:35,520
Clear Eyes

2483
02:30:36,544 --> 02:30:37,056
Fohawk

2484
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:39,616
Clear-eyed races start

2485
02:30:42,944 --> 02:30:48,064
Christian straight

2486
02:30:50,624 --> 02:30:52,160
Speaking truth and where

2487
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:53,440
Cool

2488
02:30:53,952 --> 02:30:54,464
Good conception

2489
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:55,488
What works

2490
02:30:55,744 --> 02:30:56,256
Actually mad about

2491
02:30:59,584 --> 02:31:01,632
To deal with

2492
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:04,192
Worshipped

2493
02:31:04,448 --> 02:31:04,960
Single day

2494
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:05,984
And it's like

2495
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:10,080
And I have to

2496
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:14,688
And all this time coming up with ways to argue against

2497
02:31:14,944 --> 02:31:18,784
Human rights protections for people make it look like it's actually about a press

2498
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:23,136
I think I think if you had like Wheels.

2499
02:31:23,392 --> 02:31:24,928
TWA of racism

2500
02:31:25,184 --> 02:31:30,048
Labor

2501
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:36,448
If you have real complaints you wouldn't have to go out of your way to misread

2502
02:31:38,752 --> 02:31:40,800
Folks in New York

2503
02:31:41,056 --> 02:31:44,896
You just wouldn't do stuff like that you would spend your time on Valley criticism

2504
02:31:45,408 --> 02:31:47,712
You wouldn't misrepresented Netflix movie

2505
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:48,480
You wouldn't

2506
02:31:48,736 --> 02:31:52,832
One of your shows talk about Bob Dylan

2507
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:59,488
If you misrepresented Jack Dorsey tweet from

2508
02:31:59,744 --> 02:32:02,304
You wouldn't do any of this stuff if you had real complaint

2509
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:04,864
This is all misrepresentation in service

2510
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:06,144
Justifying

2511
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:09,984
The victimhood status that you have which only serves

2512
02:32:10,496 --> 02:32:11,776
To justify why

2513
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:14,848
Inevitable civil war is coming in your right for it

2514
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:16,384
It's all that's going on

2515
02:32:17,152 --> 02:32:19,456
These last two clips that I have

2516
02:32:19,712 --> 02:32:21,504
I think that these are bad

2517
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:23,296
Back to this

2518
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:25,088
Violence non-violence

2519
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:26,880
Back and forth

2520
02:32:28,672 --> 02:32:30,208
Is trying to convince people

2521
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:33,024
Whether he's making the argument clearly or not

2522
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:35,328
Let's

2523
02:32:36,352 --> 02:32:39,168
I'm just allowed up right now I know you are as well this is

2524
02:33:02,208 --> 02:33:03,744
Politically

2525
02:33:08,608 --> 02:33:10,400
If you hide out there going to get you

2526
02:33:10,912 --> 02:33:11,680
You can't hide

2527
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:14,240
You Can't Hide there is no opting out

2528
02:33:20,128 --> 02:33:20,640
Earlier

2529
02:33:20,896 --> 02:33:23,968
Michelle

2530
02:33:24,224 --> 02:33:26,528
And listen to some of this language here in this life

2531
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:39,584
The holdup

2532
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,704
Again it's just

2533
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:45,472
Con man

2534
02:33:45,984 --> 02:33:46,496
It just

2535
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:48,800
The medes

2536
02:33:56,224 --> 02:34:02,368
About how there's a literal devil

2537
02:34:02,624 --> 02:34:05,952
Asian against be great Noble white Christian Patriots of this country

2538
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:07,488
If left to their own devices

2539
02:34:10,304 --> 02:34:14,656
Everything I'm saying entire worldview everything I'm screaming about

2540
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:19,008
Leeds YouTube must be destroyed

2541
02:34:19,776 --> 02:34:20,800
Politically

2542
02:34:21,056 --> 02:34:23,104
Literary

2543
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:24,896
Where it's like

2544
02:34:25,152 --> 02:34:25,664
Your

2545
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:28,480
By turning legal in La Follette

2546
02:34:28,736 --> 02:34:29,248
Into a refrain

2547
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:30,272
Your turn again

2548
02:34:30,528 --> 02:34:31,296
Into a winking aside

2549
02:34:32,064 --> 02:34:32,576
You don't want lie

2550
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:44,608
Prejudice I think of that I think it's an interpretation

2551
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:50,496
That's certainly not

2552
02:34:50,752 --> 02:34:54,592
I think I think that I think there's all sorts of interpretations you could make of this

2553
02:34:54,848 --> 02:34:55,872
Not a very good

2554
02:34:56,384 --> 02:34:56,896
B

2555
02:34:57,152 --> 02:35:00,480
I mean if the bottom line is I don't think it's illegal but like

2556
02:35:02,528 --> 02:35:03,808
I feel so

2557
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:07,392
I don't think that this is a good episode of our show Eva

2558
02:35:07,904 --> 02:35:09,952
Because I so much like

2559
02:35:10,208 --> 02:35:14,048
On Alex's part

2560
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:16,864
Construct outside

2561
02:35:17,376 --> 02:35:19,424
Raditz

2562
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:21,216
Because what he's saying

2563
02:35:22,752 --> 02:35:23,264
Is

2564
02:35:23,776 --> 02:35:24,800
Leading towards

2565
02:35:25,824 --> 02:35:26,336
Negative outcome

2566
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:28,640
Yeah so I hope nothing happens

2567
02:35:28,896 --> 02:35:30,688
I sincerely hope nothing happens

2568
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:32,736
Is National Treasure

2569
02:35:34,016 --> 02:35:34,528
Should

2570
02:35:37,088 --> 02:35:37,600
Alex

2571
02:35:37,856 --> 02:35:40,416
His entire career at this point in 2019

2572
02:35:41,184 --> 02:35:41,696
Exist

2573
02:35:42,464 --> 02:35:43,744
To normalize

2574
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:45,280
To make that more likely

2575
02:35:50,144 --> 02:35:51,424
It doesn't amount to a hill of beans

2576
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:53,216
Because the overriding

2577
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:55,008
Overriding

2578
02:35:56,544 --> 02:35:57,824
The rhetoric everything else

2579
02:35:58,848 --> 02:35:59,360
Is

2580
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:00,128
Contradict

2581
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:07,296
He can say that to keep himself in legal safe territory

2582
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:08,576
But it doesn't matter

2583
02:36:09,344 --> 02:36:10,880
That is not what his show is about

2584
02:36:11,136 --> 02:36:12,416
Legal and lawful

2585
02:36:13,184 --> 02:36:14,976
Conspiracy theories

2586
02:36:15,232 --> 02:36:16,000
At politician

2587
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:17,536
That's not what this is

2588
02:36:18,816 --> 02:36:19,584
Now the only reason

2589
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:20,352
This is legalism

2590
02:36:23,424 --> 02:36:25,216
Brandenburg versus Ohio

2591
02:36:28,288 --> 02:36:32,896
Abstract calls for crimes are not illegal

2592
02:36:33,152 --> 02:36:33,664
This is just

2593
02:36:43,136 --> 02:36:44,928
Stay away from

2594
02:36:45,184 --> 02:36:48,768
The pointless argument

2595
02:36:49,024 --> 02:36:50,560
I agree with you there

2596
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:56,448
But if it's

2597
02:36:57,728 --> 02:36:58,240
Specific

2598
02:36:59,008 --> 02:37:00,288
Let's start with

2599
02:37:01,056 --> 02:37:03,104
I think it's no it's a ninja

2600
02:37:03,616 --> 02:37:04,128
Discussion

2601
02:37:04,384 --> 02:37:05,152
And maybe the courts

2602
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:08,480
But at the same time it's a secondary organ

2603
02:37:08,736 --> 02:37:09,248
Who is this

2604
02:37:10,016 --> 02:37:12,320
Absolutely unethical

2605
02:37:12,576 --> 02:37:14,112
And the only outcome of this

2606
02:37:15,392 --> 02:37:17,184
Making it more likely the terrible thing

2607
02:37:18,208 --> 02:37:20,000
So

2608
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:21,536
I don't know

2609
02:37:24,352 --> 02:37:24,864
Very much

2610
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:27,168
Anyway I wanted to do

2611
02:37:29,472 --> 02:37:35,616
I didn't I want to do what you want to talk about space weirdos and had some

2612
02:37:35,872 --> 02:37:37,408
A little bit lighter and a break

2613
02:37:37,664 --> 02:37:38,176
From this s***

2614
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:39,968
Cuz I think we definitely do need it

2615
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:43,296
But it's such a bad timing of a

2616
02:37:43,552 --> 02:37:44,320
Coincidence

2617
02:37:44,576 --> 02:37:47,392

2618
02:37:47,648 --> 02:37:51,744

02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:06,336
Returning back to territory where in you are a witch

2625
02:38:07,104 --> 02:38:08,128
And that

2626
02:38:08,384 --> 02:38:09,152
In the present day

2627
02:38:09,664 --> 02:38:10,176

2628
02:38:10,432 --> 02:38:10,944

2636
02:38:35,776 --> 02:38:37,568
