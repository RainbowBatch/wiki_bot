For some reason

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,336
The Palisades

00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:51,968

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984

00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
Will Smith fine

33
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,208

Year on Twitch

35
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
I like

36
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,304
To have a theme playlist

37
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
And today's was

38
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,448
Songs with cities or Bentley

39
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:22,080
Counting in the title as I realize like

00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Miami

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
Will Smith that's one of them

42
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
As I went back and listen to it

43
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
And I realize Will Smith's got a lot of album

44
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
I am so I was like

45
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Why does he have a lot of album

46
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
That's that's embarrassing

47
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
I didn't work out for it hey man

48
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,720
If you are a polymath is a polymath no matter how you

49
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,256
Big Willie Style was a hit

50
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,816
And then willenium what was his second album

51
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,656
And I went I was like I was looking through

52
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
Workout

So I was I was scrolling through it and I saw that Wild Wild West

56
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
Repeat song from wild wild what was on there

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
While I want to f****** listen to Wild Wild West

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Because it's important

59
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,256
I want you to listen to this

60
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,656
Nobody has ever said that was an absolute support

61
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
It's not the same as the beginning

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,800
In the movie Wild Wild West

63
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
Godzilla versus Mothra

64
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
Velocity

65
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,736
Like listen to this it'll become clear why I'm putting them on blast

66
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:42,976
Took the headphone jack out there could have been so smooth

67
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:48,608
The terrible two the bus

68
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
He's blaming his son

69
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,815
For putting Wild Wild West

70
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:24,447
The olive album came out on the Wild Wild West soundtrack

71
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,079
What I do it again album

72
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127

74
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,759
Adorable

75
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,319
Put the song on there

76
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:46,463

78
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,447
Ever since the beginning I can never get enough of that song Those actually Jaden might have been right but be that as it may Will Smith

79
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,543
Still going on blast for blaming his kid for putting his eyes

80
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
Another person's got to go on blast

81
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
I don't know.

82
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,479
Smith for putting wild wild west on that album I don't know the name of this person

83
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
But a person's going on blast hard and it is the person

00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111

00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:20,511

Boy games

101
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031

00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
The video game

103
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567

193
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,871
Bsh you-know-what

194
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:01,759
This is going to come back to over and over again

195
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:10,975
Over and over and over again and it turns out that may or may not be suing Alex

196
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,791
From all the context clues that I have

197
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,607
I don't know if it's a butt

198
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Someone is f******

199
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
Can sue and Alex Alex

200
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Scared

201
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
He is shook

202
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,799
Cazares we know he is a halfway crook

203
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,615
Scared to look

204
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
He is an easy

205
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,223
Trouble something big is happening behind the scenes

206
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,295
And I think it might have something to do with this next clip

207
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,647
I think they can smash us all that'll do is invigorate us

208
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
Even more

209
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
Churchill said

210
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
Never Surrender

211
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,495
He said we should go on today and whatever the price Maybe

212
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,615
Is Churchill is getting better

213
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:16,767
What we've got

214
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:22,655
Really freaked out already

215
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
Billy Baxter

216
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
So

217
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
They figured out where stock

218
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
I don't trust Alex Jones to hire a competent private investigator based on everything

219
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,599
Everyone else has ever hired

220
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
Pictures of Al Gore's windows

221
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,719
Owen Shroyer putting on a

222
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Manhattan glass

223
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,839
It might as well be

224
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,935
Sherlock Holmes it's absolute Insanity all likelihood

225
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
Do like he has been

226
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Stocking

227
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
Certain people may be one of the podesta's

228
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,151
That seems to be implied a little bit later in the episode The

229
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,943
That was one of people who put the P eyes on

230
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,783
But one of the fun things about this episode is you'll notice

231
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
He just keeps saying like

232
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
I can't wait

233
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
I can't talk about

234
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Lookout

235
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,815
Talking about how we can't talk about how Outdoors

236
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,911
One of these lawyers so bad his lawyer is f***

237
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,263
Rich because of a lot of billable hours

238
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,359
All the Guardians of Ga'Hoole

239
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,663
I mean naturally Alex Jones

240
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
Thanks Hogwarts is Brielle so they would have the best Thursday

241
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
They can call people

242
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,319
Yesterday.

243
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,391
I was yesterday

244
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,695
A little propaganda game that I would

245
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
He played it with a guest

246
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
Two goes by the name of Zach

247
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Alex

248
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,655
Without investigating this guy at all pretends that he has high level

249
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
Intelligence information

250
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
And

251
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,007
I don't I don't I don't know

252
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
No but

253
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
You did that would be great

254
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Pollard's

255
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:13,503
Did agree with Alex Jones as guess who said that they were helicopters

256
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
Involved in the Las Vegas shooting

257
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,599
Where people were shooting at the crowd from hell

258
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
So

259
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
Credible

260
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
Real credible

261
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Helicopter

262
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
People shooting

263
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
From the crowd no shooting at the crowd

264
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:33,471
Alex has the caller Zach in the game that he played I apologize to everyone who listen to yesterday

265
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
Episode 4 the game was

266
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
He says

267
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
He knows all of the in

268
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Information

269
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,383
About what happened but he can't talk about it

270
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
The Gasbuddy has Shepard ambellas

271
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
And just call her say a bunch

272
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
After the call Alex is like

273
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,599
Can you believe it that's all the secret information I

274
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
He plays that game a lot it's comfy

275
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
F****** it's complete nonsense

276
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:58,047
He said yesterday I want to get this

277
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Conclusion of that

278
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,703
Two other agencies promoted

279
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
You said

280
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,415
Saudi Arabia

281
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
Attacks

282
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Coming

283
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,303
Weave into the Manhattan

284
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
Truck attack

285
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
I could have him yesterday

286
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
I'm sorry we heard you were on

287
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Infowars

288
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Right

289
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
We just can't have

290
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
The friar anymore

291
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,943
We. Can't do it do not representing McDonald's very well

292
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,343
The order piling up this is your third one

293
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,207
More likely he got called into a meeting with his

294
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
His mom

295
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,815
Victor's no f****** way

296
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
That there was like

297
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
But you got called into the

298
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,727
The FBI director's office

299
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
Any raid was about to

300
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,567
Entirely possible

301
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,663
Me too came out people like that a lot I'm going to guess that the guy was either like I don't want to do this

302
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,223
B B B has gone far enough

303
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,831
Did Alex presented is like he's called in 4 years

304
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:30,719
Reckon tell you that I've been studying Alex for the last 11 months I've listened to the entirety of 2015

305
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
And a whole bunch episodes

306
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
Other than that

307
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,607
Not yet he doesn't call in

308
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
That's like Robert

309
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
DeLand

310
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
Are you saying

311
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,431
Zach a guy is a Reddit celebrity

312
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
Is that is that the case

313
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
I think we might be getting

314
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,575
Some Intel from the from the chat room

315
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
Pretend this person's an

316
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
Garbage day

317
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,047
Call Greg

318
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,351
Deep Space Nine in real life would be is just like

319
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
Are you there

320
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
Can you have a garbage

321
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,775
Garbage is not based Stickman

322
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
Man was also on display

323
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,551
Maybe this accuracy is a faker

324
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
He might be ready

325
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
It's Library

326
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Stickman is like

327
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,231
I keep getting YouTube mixed up or no

328
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
It's either

329
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,351
Slenderman is the reason

330
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
Ideas

331
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Slenderman

332
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,215
Slenderman I'm also scared of the Bab

333
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
Alright

My dude over here like the five best weed ever at first

336
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Going on

Right

338
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,791

339
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
In Manhattan

340
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
That's not good

341
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
He pretends

342
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Keep some pizza

343
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727

346
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,223
So Alex

00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,527
I don't know how else to set this up

348
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
Launches into it incredibly

349
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,159
Bigoted

350
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,231
Some of the stuff that

351
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023

352
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,095
One of the discussion about that

Isis

356
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,407
Look at that.

357
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
This stuff was not

358
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
In the immediate matters report

359
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,271
Look at that

360
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,367
Truly in red

361

Apologies

362

363
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,359
Love this

364
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,527
Fellatio

Believe their God

367

Seriously

368
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,407
Armies of inbred psycho killers

369
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
Call

Missouri

373
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:16,511
You don't mess with those people there.

374
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
Appalachians in the world

375
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
Brad psychotic

376
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,031

I just got this

378
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687

Thanks thanks for that

380
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:42,111
If you wanted to do tell people like it is you should actually get into the reality of inbreeding

381
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
Especially when it's like second cousin

382
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
Stuff like that

383
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,463
I'm really not bad bad

384
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
The only

385
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:53,887
We talked about this in great detail

386
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
You know we've talked about inbreeding

387
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,335
In the context of

388
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
It doesn't necessarily

389
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
Create

390
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
Diseases

391
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,735
It just gives you a higher likelihood if they're already there

392
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,551
Gene traits are going to explode your higher there's a higher chance of

393
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
Mutation

394
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
It's not like a guaranteed

395
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,072
Everybody is going to come out looking like The Hills Have Eyes because guess what a lot of times it just gives you a giant foot

396
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
Elephantitis

397
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,168
Or some sort of physical ailment

398
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,984
Doesn't make you crazy

399
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
Brighten Super Mario 3

400
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
Just drove around

401
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
Exactly kickball

402
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,480
Yep all the kids want to hang out with me

403
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:47,136
Here is this is more of what

404
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,000
Hellboy more of what Media Matters actually cover

405
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
Piece of garbage

406
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,712
You're you're drooling idiot

407
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,760
Watch this but with your hand

408
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
Come On song

409
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,264
All the slave trading all of it comes from me

410
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
What we're supposed to

411
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,200
Be culturally rich

412
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Great

413
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
You have more in common with them

414
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Yeah

415
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,728
Doesn't he have a lot more in common with them

416
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,056
Describe first

417
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,920
Himself he makes

418
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Excuses for C

419
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Seems to really be in

420
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,368
The other thing I don't want

421
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
In the past

422
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,440
Discuss what I want to talk about is very

423
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,744
Like the big thing the headline

424
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,840
Let me get mad or sad is he's talking about how linda sarsour looks like

425
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,888
The Sibling of the attacker

426
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,544
That was that was that was there with Joan says Linda sarsour look

427
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,408
Looks like I think he called the guy a retarded animal breeding forever

428
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
Yeah that's that's what they did

429
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
Dig Inn at all into other things

430
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
But he says

431
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
That are much

432
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
More troubling

433
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,880
The thing that I want to get to the

434
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,672
My finger on

435
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,720
Here is what he is saying

436
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Vistaprint

437
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,792
Everything you saying

438
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,096
Is all Muslims are unipolar

439
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
There are only one sort of Muslim

440
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
And this is

441
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,264
Perspectives that we've encountered over and over again

442
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,824
Another thing I want to bring into Focus as

443
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,616
Is today while I was on the bus

444
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,664
Going to and from therapy

445
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
Rhinitis

446
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,576
I noticed on Twitter a lot of people complaining about Laura Loomer

447
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,136
Laura Loomer

448
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
And she said

449
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,304
Can someone start an Uber or Lyft doesn't use Muslim drivers I don't want to

450
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
I don't want to

451
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,864
Give money to a Muslim immigrant

452
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
Something along those lines

453
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
And everyone got surprised

454
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
I'm like guys

455
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,496
Yeah

456
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
We've we've been over this

457
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,640
Everyone's getting hundreds of retweets or being like Laura Loomer sucks like

458
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,432
We could have told you that 6-month

459
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:56,832
Citgo there are no rabbit there are no irrational Muslims

460
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
Is no moderate Muslims

461
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,976
What you want on the show and said that everyone's in denial about the idea that we're at war with that religion

462
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:06,048
We already f****** knew that she's come out inside way worse

463
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Surprise

464
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
F****** garbage

465
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,424
Keep the up-to-speed you a******

466
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,984
Naughty people listening you're great but the rest of the world

467
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
To get up to speed this is

468
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
Problem

469
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,848
Scary Twitter Forever by

470
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:24,224
Discover

471
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:29,088
It's not wonderful

472
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,392
Apparently

473
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,696
Exploding with happiness

474
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
Also apparently has a little bit of a Twitter war

475
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,536
Between Loomer and Laura Southern

476
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,072
Lauren Southern

477
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Is exciting

478
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,656
Why is it why disease

479
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,192
Exist now damn

480
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Damn

481
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,056
Do ourselves because no one took care of Alex Jones 5 years

482
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Because his mom died

483
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,224
Anyway

484
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,528
Pretty decent Authority that that doesn't sound anything

485
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Sing like Alex's

486
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,088
From someone who has

487
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Pizza

488
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:08,512
Hollywood a little bit

489
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,792
In a fairly Gross Way

490
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,632
56

491
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,008
He's talking about charges against one

492
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:27,200
Harvey Weinstein

493
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
Your world

494
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,904
Play black women young girls

495
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,464
Daystar

496
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,296
I think you just jiz

497
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
No

498
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,744
No no I mean

499
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:16,864
I'd like to strike that clip from the record and then his

500
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,520
Throat I don't know what to tell you about how f****** horrific that I don't know the Weinstein is involved

501
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
Call just bringing the Muslim terrorist

502
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:31,200
Send to the country or United Muslim

503
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,808
Steven all of it but also let's not forget that this is

504
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,392
Is exactly what got Alex food buy Chobani

505
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,048
Good Jerry

506
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
For that loss

507
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
Company good

508
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,168
That's possible

509
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:57,568
The person who's suing Alex currently doesn't learn from his past mistakes

510
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,104
Yeah that's that's obvious

511
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
What

512
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,664
What do you mean he doesn't learn from

513
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,968
He learned from his past

514
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:10,368
Put out a video and then your lifters are like

515
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:16,768
And your listeners are just like oh course he did that he doesn't want to deal with the hassle

516
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,352
He doesn't want to deal with

517
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,168
You've got a family

518
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:28,032
Are far ahead really suck

519
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Tosses balls over the coals

520
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,408
We will have a very different Alex

521
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
Soon enough

522
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
Standing

523
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
Cynthia

524
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,440
We could we could get that Larry klayman

525
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,048
Which shout out to listen to giulio sent me a link to

526
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:56,448
Larry klayman is petitioning to be the lawyer investigating or trying Hillary

527
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
Grimes

528
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,800
Which would be an amazing Friday

529
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,592
You are exactly

530
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,896
Kangaroo court lawyer I want

531
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:12,064
Told to not appear as not allowed to appear in multiple People's Court today

532
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:20,256
So Alex talked about earlier you said the Jake Tapper is saying that like that terrorism is wonderful and all that

533
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
Because

534
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,584
He said that

535
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
The clip that Alex plays

536
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
I'm saying that

537
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,680
The driver said Allah Akbar

538
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,544
Usually that is a

539
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:37,152
Common usually a wonderful celebratory of

540
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,432
Positive contact

541
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
Sting

542
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
And so this is

543
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
Does it say about that

544
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
If you do what he does

545
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,464
As you said All Odds are she's with so beautiful

546
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
Beautiful

547
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
That's really sick

548
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,376
Virtue signaling

549
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Bet

550
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
We got your back

551
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,824
Keep doing what you doing

552
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
Shot Powersports Felician others

553
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,736
Wolf Blitzer

554
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,000
Dim the screen in the background

555
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
So here's the fun thing

556
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,352
The guy who came on Wolf Blitzer show didn't

557
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,912
Scalise was a hero he said that he was it was a friend of

558
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,752
Instead it is a normal guy you just seems like he was burnt out on politics

559
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
It's fed up with a political state

560
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,128
Yeah I mean that's what you hear from serial killers friend

561
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,992
Neighbors are like you know Ted Bundy's neighbors that he was a normal guy

562
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:49,600
One of you so lying about what the guy said on Wolf Blitzer show

563
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
But either

564
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
Exposed himself

565
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
He's saying

566
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,768
Endorses terrorism much like

567
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,840
When is Steve scalise shooting

568
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,120
Wolf Blitzer didn't

569
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,656
Say anything to Rebecca

570
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
Alex

571
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,008
You had Mars base people on your show

572
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
You didn't robot them

573
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
You had David icon

574
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,896
On multiple times and you didn't push back about lizards yet

575
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:20,832
He'll two similar standards at all no but it's fun

576
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,648
Whenever I was

577
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Listen to that

578
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
Are the Pats

579
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
Three Clips in

580
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Secession

581
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
Alex

582
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,792
What is bigotry

583
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Is

584
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
Barry

585
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:37,728
Very like

586
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,032
Whenever we whatever you played the BBC

587
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,848
C-clip and the guy

588
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,688
He was

589
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,344
Ingrained in that it's so horrific

590
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,648
It's not just that you do you say

591
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
He's turning muzzle

592
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Into unipolar

593
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Which

594
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,792
Is more to identifying

595
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:02,816
A race

596
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
It's not like

597
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
The faith or any

598
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
He's looking at a man's face

599
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
And saying

600
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,032
Almost phrenology Style

601
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,592
These are the parts of the face that may

602
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
Make a bad person

603
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,920
All of the stuff that

604
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
People from the Middle East

605
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,504
Look like horrible

606
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,528
Bigoted races

607
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:28,928
And if your issue if you know what you know what something about what

608
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
Somebody else walking look

609
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,048
Close to getting

610
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,120
Expressing what the issue is so people could take it seriously

611
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
At least this piece of

612
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,984
Millencolin

613
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
No cigar

614
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,080
I like doing that but

615
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,664
See that your heart agree I agree with you wholeheartedly and I

616
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,712
Tom Brokaw

617
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
Demon unalloyed racist

618
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
And Alex

619
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
The guy use a five-dollar words

620
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,856
And accurately representative

621
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
We got lots of

622
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
But

623
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
Back to your point

624
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
About the physical traits

625
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
But he's going off of it

626
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Are bad

627
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,608
He's about to get into one

628
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,144
Did I take particular issue

629
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,216
Would you show me an image of the famous

630
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,496
Berg

631
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,360
Islamic friends have it as well

632
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:29,088
Another

633
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
The British aristocracy

634
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:39,328
Folks in a crocodile

635
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,608
F*** off Alex

636
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,888
What is that

637
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,192
Isaac has a cross-eyed gentleman

638
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Go fuc yourself

639
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,496
Alex

640
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Even

641
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,312
Get his idea of his

642
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,384
Street

643
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
England

644
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
And Alex has gone to Aristocrat Authority

645
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
Now there is a real version

646
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
At the cross I being assigned

647
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
Nobility

648
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
England is one of them

649
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,648
Like being overweight

650
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672
In a lot of population

651
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:10,048
Like in Hawaii that was always a functional reason for that

652
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:15,680
The blood disease most of European nobility aristocracy had for a long time

653
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
Time because they were all inbred NASA

654
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:22,336
Like what they all believe what's the one where you believe really

655
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,480
Even beyond that what I'm saying is like

656
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,016
Resource

657
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,552
Poor areas

658
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,392
People who are overweight as are seen as higher class

659
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,928
Because they are able to

660
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,720
Sustain a higher caloric intake

661
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,072
You look at pictures of like old Rich Hawaiian

662
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
They're f******

663
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,400
Superhero

664
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,496
That's the reason that I heard

665
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,032
Speculated that like

666
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,824
Generally the builds are bigger

667
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,616
Hawaii because there was

668
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Is overtime

669
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,176
And isolated population

670
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
And people

671
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,736
Selected towards that

672
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,576
So I'll be there stuff like that cross I you cannot explain that way

673
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:11,232
Just bring random cross-eyed people into your aristocratic Circle

674
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
Who doesn't do that

675
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,840
I do

676
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,920
Alex Jones fights himself

677
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,200
To assert

678
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,504
Isis is super into pedophilia

679
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,040
And then you'll see what he does for me

680
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,880
Encourages pedophilia

681
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
In the absence of women

682
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,424
Enjoy young boys

683
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:56,032
Forcing them into harem

684
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,568
Also I mean he's reciting

685
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Infowars

686
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,152
What do you mean

687
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
We report we wrote this

688
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:12,928
Where are the bad ones evil people of

689
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,208
It's

690
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,120
I want to plow into all of this

691
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,168
Domino's spend a few minutes

692
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
CareFirst

693
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,752
Just encouraging lister's understand that

694
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,360
When you buy T-shirts

695
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,712
Other materials from Infowars store

696
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,504
That's not possible

697
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
It is

698
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
You are funding

699
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
Looks dirty pretty clear about it

700
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
The revolution that has one

701
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,840
Or is Winnick

702
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,120
We might be under attack

703
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,424
Turn turn turn

704
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,984
So you're saying that I wanted

705
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,520
Bring out at 1

706
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:03,360
Interesting kind of add pivot that Alex

707
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,384
Is doing on this show

708
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,480
On this November 1st

709
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,504
Tell you what

710
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,112
Missouri coming out

711
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,952
Did the kind of pivot he's doing are these really slow intense

712
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,280
Channel 18 there's a feeling of desperation in

713
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Andis pivot

714
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,120
Before

715
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,168
This money generally be like

716
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,152
He is deported

717
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,200
I think he's getting sued based on

718
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,992
The nature of the pivot

719
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,064
Text Clues

720
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,088
So in this next

721
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:51,488
Clip alx50 in your Dino I know you were trying to start another clip

722
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:52,768
Respond

723
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,560
Refill Mike wine

724
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
No is it

725
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,496
Really is always

726
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
Something that hits

727
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,336
The idea of

728
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
How

729
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
We can just blow by the fact that

730
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
He called everybody a patty

731
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
Violin

732
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,528
Everything he doesn't like with

733
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
F****** chilled

734
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
We just go buy it because you don't have it

735
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,696
Commonplace to us now like

736
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:25,280
It's like if you if you

737
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,608
Genuinely believe that every Republican

738
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,888
Who said that

739
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,192
Being gay is equivalent to being a pedophile

740
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
Should be f******

741
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
Murder

742
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
But this is

743
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Everything

744
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,664
If you're gay you're a pedophile

745
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,528
Porcupine

746
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
Nevermind

747
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,832
Or if you're not white

748
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:55,232
On yesterday's show you legitimately said that Auntie for the foundation of it all is f****** kid

749
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,024
Not everybody does

750
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,560
But that's what it's about

751
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,912
Ridiculous

752
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
The 27th

753
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,264
Post social media post

754
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,568
Availability of

755
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:15,968
People like I mean even we can just broadcast on the internet Alex Jones is able to broadcast up without censorship without

756
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
I could get sued and stuff like that

757
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,576
It's just the equivalent of

758
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,880
Highly ramped-up accelerated seitan

759
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:29,280
It's the same stuff that we saw with like the McMartin School cases

760
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,816
Or just seeing it again but it's

761
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,352
Much worse and it's much

762
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
Alex has no one toosii

763
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,472
Right except how do you like I could have

764
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,264
Someone

765
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
Goddamn

766
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,848
I think someone will

767
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
We're still big fan

768
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:51,040
So we talked about on our last episode we were on together how Alex is suspiciously not talking about George

769
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Papadopoulos

770
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
His guilty plea

771
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,856
Ready-made

772
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,416
The Alex

773
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,696
About it and guess what

774
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,792
Is a complete setup

775
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
So that's about all yes

776
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
But

777
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,424
Out of the

778
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
The Trump

779
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,312
Papadopoulos when he was just a low-level

780
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
Coffee Warriors

781
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
Something like that

782
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,688
Doesn't matter

783
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
Is he

784
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
If he's

785
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
Not what if he did

786
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:29,440
He could just be a guy off the street it doesn't matter how far

787
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:36,096
TV violated eloped

788
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,912
That he talked with campaign officials about doing it

789
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,216
They lied about it

790
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:47,872
Then we have the proof is their problem isn't like

791
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,896
Alex

792
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,480
I don't give a s*** about that we don't have time to talk

793
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
Set up

794
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,808
I don't I don't

795
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
Connecticut little dirty

796
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,112
But at the same time

797
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
I don't give a s*** about

798
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,208
Doesn't talk about it much

799
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,256
Right for what he gets into

800
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
Because it jogs

801
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
His mind

802
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,096
Is a piece of his biography

803
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,144
Another Pizza

804
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,216
This one is f***** up

805
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,776
Shut up

806
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,824
Swamp operate

807
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,504
I was in 8th grade I was not a drug user but I smoked marijuana before

808
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,344
And

809
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,672
And in the Fieldhouse

810
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,232
Buy a joint for me in the morning

811
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
The joint

812
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
For me in the morning

813
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,936
Will the next follows me in the bathroom first.

814
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
Is it here please buy it

815
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,104
They still told me the office

816
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,407
Marijuana cigarette

817
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:57,247
You shut him up

818
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,831
Are you at the organized criminal your

819
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:19,263
Deinonychus black people that's what's going on

820
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
Is that they just wanted

821
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,079
Teach me a lesson

822
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
Hellboy

823
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,711
So interesting

824
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,039
Interesting piece of Alex Jones's false

825
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,343
I self told a biography

826
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,879
Okay

827
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,159
Bright

828
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
1

829
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,207
Do you know what's great about being

830
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Being a drug dealer

831
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,511
You don't have to

832
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
Run people down to sell dry

833
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,959
Define

834
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,007
Drugs and people buy them

835
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,847
Totally don't people deliver when you get to be an adult

836
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
Fantastic

837
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,919
So what happened was

838
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,967
He was

839
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
He didn't have any money

840
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,551
He said he would have money in the morning to buy a joy

841
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,855
Probably in the bathroom

842
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
Gets caught

843
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,951
Vent cover story

844
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,231
Holding up

845
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,303
Now course the teachers are are the principal is like

846
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,375
What how did you learn to lie like this

847
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
F*****'-a

848
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,423
Insane person

849
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,495
That was our first time that Alex Jones

850
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
Is the psychopath

851
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,567
Will eighth grade

852
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
Avakin life like that 8th grade is 14

853
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:37,599
Look like what was there couple hundred girls before he was 16 so

854
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,367
Is big as your head

855
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:47,327
He's already sexually active at this point as a fourteen-year-old

856
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:51,167
I think you probably about a joint

857
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,703
Absolutely by remember

858
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
Myschools

859
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,287
You know the kids who were into drugs

860
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,823
Usually we're the ones were fighting

861
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,407
All kinds of troublemaking goes

862
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
Together

863
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,503
Kind of you know if there's a there's a umbrella thing

864
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,295
Especially at least before Alexa

865
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,087
I think if you're doing drugs

866
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,623
Protecting your great

867
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,439
Yeah but it 14 that's a little early

868
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,975
If you're 16

869
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Like

870
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
Slow down

871
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,583
No we don't make it like a party route

872
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
Team

873
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,143
Enjoyed

874
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,447
That way you really enjoyed

875
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,519
As opposed to just make it another Choice like I got to buy milk

876
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:32,895
Got to buy the story Alex Jones is told in

877
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:38,783
Involved him

878
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
You had a

879
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,367
Conspiracy that the

880
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,159
Schools or the police

881
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,231
We're actually selling drugs through the kid

882
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,815
He doesn't bring up that stuff cure this

883
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
Completely

884
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
Different

885
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
Childhood getting

886
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
Jammed up for drugs

887
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,263
Story

888
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,543
Very easily be

889
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,079
Oh you got caught with drugs

890
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,359
Absolutely

891
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
You're just making up reasons

892
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,223
To pretend you weren't the bad guy everything he does

893
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
King of reasons

894
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,831
It look I'm not I don't like black people

895
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
They started the fight

896
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Like

897
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,415
Do you absolutely certain

898
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
Look up somebody

899
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,999
Punches you after you call them

900
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
Edward

901
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:25,119
They started it

902
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
You started

903
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:31,263
That actually triggered something in my mind I want to say first.

904
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,591
Exit to focus when you receive the narratives that he pushes in modern-day of

905
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,871
The 40 something year old man

906
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,151
And you just relate them

907
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
Child brain

908
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,199
Process

909
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
It makes so much

910
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,503
Like all of it starts

911
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,271
To come into Folk

912
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,831
I wanted to talk about was

913
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
The release

914
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
All the names

915
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,951
We're not all of them but the first

916
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Twitter

00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,743
Screen names

918
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,303

00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
Russian Bots

00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839

921
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,375

Edit fuc

923
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
Crazy

924
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,727
It's so clear what they were up to

925
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
Okay

926
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,055
There's so many screen names that are like

927
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,615

For Trump was one of them

938
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,655
Like they're very clean.

939
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
I would say

940
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,727
Most of the ones are on the way

941
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,287
Are facsimile is a real people today

942
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
And then there's a bunch of

943
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
And the ones that aren't

944
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,407
Fall very easily into

945
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,687
Oggi's

946

00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,063
Trump positive

949
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,111

So clear

951
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:59,839
Well and we already have only one batch

952
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863

I underscore a underscore a underscore

954
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,799

That's fine I'm fine

956
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:13,407
I don't like the idea of Scatman being a Russian bot

957
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,991
If that was all the Russian Bots did is just

958
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:20,063
A long list of different scatman's

959
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,879
Perfect

960
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
Paris gay but

961
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Gay headlights

962
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,975
5/8

963
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,767
Forgot to write you guys

964
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:32,095
Is that is that a wrong it's clear that they have a

965
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:38,495
Exactly hundred percent better understanding of social media

966
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,287
Screen names, somewhere like

967
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
Someone

968
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,127
Would make as a joke

969
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,783
Look up one suckers book the intelligence

970
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,855
How to take down America years ago

971
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,671
Let's remember that was this

972
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,231
One of the Russian

973
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:04,863
What did Alexander Alexander Dugan had the one about creating racial division

974
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,215
Military school

975
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,519
And all of this stuff is

976
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,823
Very similar right in line with that

977
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,687
Has been a multiple-time Gaston Alex Jones Show and Alex

978
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,503
Has been on his show in Russia

979
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,271
Twitter

980
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,879
Perry underscore a Scatman

981
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,071
Twitter handles had a funny

982
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,655
Tweets Twitter handle that involve the n-word

983
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
Band

984
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,471
Can say it just because it's

985
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,239
The Twitter handle

986
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,775
I don't I don't know what's appropriate

987
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
That funny

988
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Look like

989
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,175
Alright

990
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,967
Cummins been sitting on that

991
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,807
That's pretty that's wild

992
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
Russian Bots

993
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,415
Infiltrator black Twitter

994
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
Very strange

995
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,767
I don't know if they did or not but

996
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:10,143
But make it appear pretty pretty well report

997
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
Stories about how

998
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
Russian ads

999
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,495
Funded a lot of

1000
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,031
Different black lives matter

1001
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,055
Meetup Center

1002
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:21,407
Yeah exactly

00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,711
Keating Facebook events

1004
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Yeah

1005
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:30,623
Groups of people were just showing up to fight each other we're all bugs

1006
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:35,999
Sincerely think I'm not going to because I don't really care about social media and it doesn't really affect

1007
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
Like me all that much in

1008
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,071
Lord knows that I've even like listeners

1009
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:43,679
If we didn't but I sincerely think that the crisis of our time

1010
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,495
Beyond even a lot of this propaganda and

1011
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,823
Is we all have to

1012
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,103
Walk away from social media

1013
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,175
There's a lot of fun

1014
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
Fun things you can do with it

1015
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
And what have you

1016
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,527
But AAA I think it is

1017
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,367
Something that is just ultimately not worth it

1018
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:06,463
Call one

1019
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,767
Once once I read up on

1020
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,047
Analytica that was

1021
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,071
The moment where I was like

1022
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,095
Oh maybe

1023
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,119
Maybe all of the

1024
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
What's going to kill

1025
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,471
Yeah yeah it'll get us to kill each other

1026
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:22,591
Predictive programming

1027
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,639
Rodger Stone comes on the show today

1028
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,991
Beg for mercy

1029
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,855
Willard's Crossing Orwell

1030
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
Miller's Crossing

1031
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,439
He comes on and Alex and

1032
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,743
Them say it

1033
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,767
Look into it

1034
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:44,351
Even town in Austin to strategize

1035
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
Is what Alex says

1036
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,471
We'll get to that in the next but first how far away is

1037
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:53,055
Exactly getting real close to the Border

1038
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,103
So here is that what Rodger Stone has

1039
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:55,871
To say

1040
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,663
What do you make of this timing

1041
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:03,807
The NFL Hollywood literally collapse

1042
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
There's not

1043
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:08,159
People are pulling the plug on cable in general and that's

1044
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,695
Really hurting NFL rating

1045
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:14,303
Conversation about this I didn't even realize

1046
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,655
That they made a new rule in the NFL that every touchdown

1047
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
Have to be reviewed

1048
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,775
Yeah I didn't realize that and that completely destroys the game

1049
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:30,175
Makes it almost on watchable I would have no enjoyment you can't celebrate with your team and what have you

1050
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,223
It's their own fault they did this

1051
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:38,111
Not standing for the national anthem

1052
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,671
Value go to Hollywood

1053
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:45,023
Has been an issue that's been broiling under the surface and people have been talking about for a while and

1054
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,095
And it's coming forward to some people are brave enough to make it happen

1055
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,119
Death

1056
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,143
That's not

1057
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,959
It's not a coincidence

1058
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
Alex Banks

1059
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,335
God

1060
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:04,479
I just think America

1061
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:10,879
Very interesting Lee that I came on and I laid out a scenario

1062
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:14,207
So I want to auto parts right there before you get to the scenario cuz

1063
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:18,815
Interesting thing that I've started to pick up on on Infowars that I don't think we do a good

1064
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
Enough.

1065
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,655
And that is Whenever two people or talk to each other

1066
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,935
They're not having a conversation

1067
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:28,799
One person says something and then the other person is like

1068
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,359
Interesting thing you said I'm not going to talk about it

1069
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,687
It's it's

1070
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,991
Rotana

1071
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,551
Oh by which the president

1072
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:45,439
Demand that Jeff sessions appointed special counsel to look into uranium one

1073
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,999
This would have the effect

1074
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:53,887
I'll putting mister mister call me mr. McCabe the associate director of the FBI

1075
00:52:54,143 --> 00:53:00,287
And Rod Rosenstein the de facto Attorney General of the United States

1076
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:05,919
Play Yesterday headline

1077
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:12,319
A piece on rawstory the worst of the worst fake news

1078
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,343
Plane is falling apart

1079
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:18,975
You just told us what you fear you fear this move by Donald Trump

1080
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,255
Rodger

1081
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,535
Come on man

1082
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,327
You just told us what you fear

1083
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,655
No

1084
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:31,775
Scared about this Russian investigation

1085
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,591
Does he not realize that the things he's saying or like

1086
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:42,015
Imperative is the most desperate slapped together

1087
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:46,623
I'm clearly not worried about it

1088
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:53,023
Here's my 20-part plan

1089
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:02,495
Google

1090
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:07,103

Is get rid of them

1094
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
No no

1095
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,343
Amore Independence

1096
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,135
Of course

1097
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:22,975
Larry

1098
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,791
And the only reason I know this is going to happen

1099
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:26,815
Larry Nichols

1100
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
The Pinnacles

1101
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,399
Who's blackmailing the gbg

1102
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:39,871
Mueller has released some indictments and no one is gone down Larry Nichols hasn't shown up on Alex Jones Show

1103
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,943
By the way

1104
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,735
I don't know this is unconfirmed

1105
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,295
But if you Google Larry Nichols or if you

1106
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,343
I don't want to put his phone number out of

1107
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,135
Website that comes out

1108
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,695
Phone number out there but it turns out

1109
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,791
Google the phone number

1110
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,607
What comes up is a scam report

1111
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,167
There's a website that lists scams

1112
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:08,287
I've ever someone who is listed Larry Nichols scam report claiming that he doesn't have cancer

1113
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,615
And that he is defrauding people of money

1114
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,663
Yeah

1115
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:18,015
There is a day I don't know if it's true

1116
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,647
If it's the matter of people sending me tons of money

1117
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,207
That's possible

1118
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:32,607
I know I know a bunch of things that I don't know. No no no

1119
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,447
This is from this scam report

1120
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:40,799
Those ladies people have been getting scammed off

1121
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,103
And she called the number and talk to him

1122
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:46,175
He gave the name of the hospital that he was getting treatment

1123
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
She called the hospital

1124
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
And there's no

1125
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,271
Simpson goes there by the name of Larry

1126
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,319
Now I don't know

1127
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:56,159
I want to believe it

1128
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,999
Can you pretend to be like a family members

1129
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:00,767
I don't know

1130
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:05,375
Maybe Larry Nichols money is also clever enough to

1131
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:11,775
Scam Hospital into giving them private records Affair Place probably not real but I wanted to date

00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,911
Like Larry Nichols

1139
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,983
But the other thing is that like it's it's Larry Nichols character

1140
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,287
Your profile

1141
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,823
Maybe

1142
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,127
I don't suppose you were going started this

1143
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:48,895
I said it

1144
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:52,223
Maybe not real

1145
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,295
It maybe not real but I want to believe it at somewhere

1146
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,319
Yeah I know

1147
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,343
Well let's call it a dog

1148
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,439
Alex

1149
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:04,511
Does not want to talk about the algor lawsuit

1150
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:09,119
I'm not ready to tell folks about it

1151
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:15,775
Law firm of Obama

1152
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:19,615
I have

1153
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,967
I mean

1154
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,551
What about last night

1155
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:37,279
What's the allegations

1156
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:40,095
Before March

1157
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,375
The empire

1158
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:45,215
They thought

1159
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,239
Stop

1160
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,055
That also very clearly says

1161
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,591
That was Buckley

1162
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,407
Yeah that was Buckley turning it off I was like

1163
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,735
You are actually getting sued Alex this is not this

1164
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,015
This is very serious

1165
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:04,415
And I don't think it's that I don't think that Obama sticked his second law firm against

1166
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,183
Alex

1167
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,743
I don't think of Rodger Stone

1168
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:10,303
I don't think Al Gore is suing

1169
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
Alex

1170
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:15,679
Once you get the details out will be able to parse through and figure out what the reality of the situation

1171
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:18,239
Obviously slandered someone again

1172
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,079
I mean this is easily that

1173
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,871
Just about anybody who wants

1174
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:30,271
How to do everyone's at 7 months ago we went over the Chobani yogurt

1175
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,807
Who's very guilty there

1176
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,599
Yep I got out of the p

1177
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,391
Pizzagate thing just in time

1178
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:38,719
Although he still he talks about pizzagate on this episode

1179
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,255
He seems to think that like

1180
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,327
Those videos you deleted from the internet don't exist anymore

1181
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,375
There's no consequence

1182
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,703
I know we have all of his

1183
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,239
He's committed at least

1184
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:54,847
15 crimes in time that we've talked about what might be treason

1185
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:58,175
Straight-up be treason

1186
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,455
Or the very we

1187
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,015
Please conspiracy

1188
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
Stop

1189
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:09,183
Symbiosis symbiotics non-zero-sum game

1190
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:20,447
And so like somebody like

1191
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:29,151
We want Frosty

1192
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:35,551
That you got it energized

1193
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,087
Global

1194
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,647
Infowars

1195
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,439
I didn't I just brought it back

1196
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:47,327
Chick-fil-A

1197
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,375
That's not a good sign

1198
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,191
I don't know what this early

1199
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,007
The last clause

1200
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:58,079
Okay I don't I don't know if it's ready

1201
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:04,479
Urges a random mix of...

1202
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,295
By the way he perceives of his place in the world is

1203
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,855
He's leading the populace charge all around the world

1204
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,647
These are populist movements

1205
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,743
That's what you are the mouthpiece of

1206
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,511
Does

1207
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
It might

1208
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,583
You might be on the wrong side

1209
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:20,863
Might

1210
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,423
Might be furthermore might just be

1211
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,191
You can't

1212
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,983
Lead

1213
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,519
A nationalist movement

1214
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,543
Globally

1215
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,359
Well they make the argument that it's like

1216
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,639
No it is

1217
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,199
Everyone wants to have their own Nation

1218
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:38,527
Nationalism is super sexy

1219
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:41,855
The word Coalition of all these nations that just want our own nationalism

1220
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,927
Right I understand why that's

1221
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,951
The maddening butt

1222
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:52,607
The way they think is going to happen if they okay

1223
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:58,239
God dammit

1224
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,311
I know what you're going to say

1225
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:06,175
You're going to say that okay so you guys have a bunch of globally there's a bunch of

1226
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:10,783
Countries that are super nationalistic and after their own interests are going to end up fighting

1227
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,343
Because they are nationalistic

1228
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,647
Legal conclusion that most

1229
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,415
People come to

1230
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:20,255
Yeah but the reality is that that's probably not what

1231
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,303
It's going to be like

1232
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,839
Conglomerate

1233
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,863
Chin of these

1234
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
Nationalist

1235
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,911
Six states that

1236
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,471
That take resources

1237
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Ramen

1238
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,519
More license slave

1239
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,079
All the third world countries is probably all the brown place

1240
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
Yeah yeah

1241
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:41,503
I was going to say that okay I thought you were going to go dump version

1242
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:45,599
Really really f****** went to town

1243
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,927
Movies gone down the group

1244
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,975
Before I know but I was talking

1245
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,279
What I'm saying is what they

1246
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
Clearly

1247
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:59,167
Is that if they are Jordan I know I got you

1248
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,215
Now you know how f****** I feel

1249
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
Alright

1250
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:07,615
We just had a we just had a public order fight of sorry Dan we love each other

1251
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,271
Alex

1252
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,135
No it's it's so stupid to imagine that okay

1253
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:24,767
You're leading there's a centralized nationalist movement

1254
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,791
The tree surgeon

1255
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,327
And what is going to happen

1256
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,607
If they do win

1257
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,423
Those leaders are already leading to

1258
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,471
Together they're going to cooperate

1259
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:39,871
Yeah you're just creating a different United Nations nationalist Nations

1260
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,199
Actress of power

1261
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,295
Yep that is going to see I would happen

1262
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:58,815
S46

1263
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,655
What are Revolution November 4th

1264
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:06,495
Hilltop

1265
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,775
Talk show host

1266
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,543
Right

1267
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,823
Brother to priority

1268
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,103
Cops

1269
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,639
And talk show host

1270
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:18,783
Well we got to solve the real problem actually I would argue that's priority

1271
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:22,111
Rubio's

1272
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,927
I'm putting Alex up top

1273
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:29,279
Super clear about that last movie taken out of context

1274
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,863
Right

1275
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,703
Yeah we just want the Second Amendment people to political

1276
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:42,335
Right I don't I don't

1277
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,639
Anyway

1278
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,407
Rodger Stone

1279
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
He's not just there

1280
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,343
They also have some gossip

1281
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,135
But he wants to report at news

1282
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:59,231
And Alex has one of the stupidest things overheard at the end of this clip

1283
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:05,631
But last night I was with a very high-level Republican lobbyist

1284
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:10,239
With very very close ties to the Bush family and to

1285
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:13,311
Specifically

1286
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:17,151
Had lunch with Jeb

1287
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,199
Trump will be gone by December

1288
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:26,111
Couple be gone by December what is that tell you the whole show of that

1289
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,927
Start over

1290
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,463
Start over

1291
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,119
Right

1292
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,935
Rodger

1293
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:44,031
I was hit with a polonium Dart

1294
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,079
Classic Bowl

1295
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,663
And even if he did Bluff

1296
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:54,783
He would be bluffing about this politically

1297
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,599
Absolutely

1298
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,623
F****** idiot

1299
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,439
This is what happens when you end up like

1300
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,255
Working and being partners with a manipulator

1301
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,815
Like you don't do it for that reason

1302
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,095
You think they'd like

1303
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,375
You can team up with

1304
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:13,727
Stop music

1305
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:17,823
Right over time the person who is more powerful in manipulation

1306
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,359
Going to be able to

1307
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,895
I just run the roost

1308
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,711
Rodger Stone

1309
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
More or less

1310
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:28,831
You can get out

1311
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:34,207
You are your particular look you never blocked

1312
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,839
Look is what happens with me and my cat get a better relationship

1313
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:45,983
PowerBlock nationalistic

1314
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,079
Hellboy

1315
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,103
It was surprising a

1316
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:52,895
This Mexico

1317
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:57,503
Yeah I'm going to call this out I'm just going to go ahead and tell you ahead of time

1318
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,831
I usually like you to be blindsided by the pivots to add

1319
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,647
Threats but I need to tell you ahead of time so you can

1320
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,183
Track how he does it

1321
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,231
This is clunky is s***

1322
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
Is this

1323
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,279
2 mi in

1324
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,071
Indicates massive desperation

1325
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:14,655
Destiny indicates like a severe situation that Alex's face

1326
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,191
This is not just

1327
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,727
I want another boat

1328
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,519
This is definitely like I'm a

1329
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,287
In trouble

1330
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:31,807
Christine

1331
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:43,839
Is Ali Akbar

1332
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,287
Islamic

1333
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:58,687
Terrorism at its worst

1334
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,967
Dippin Dots

1335
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:05,343
Very very true

1336
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,415
So we're going to listen to the rest of it

1337
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,439
I bet he does cuz it's

1338
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
F***** up

1339
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:16,607
Another driver and then apropos of nothing

1340
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,887
He just goes into

1341
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,935
This like

1342
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:24,543
Through it all

1343
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,919
You buy products in for store.com

1344
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:33,503
Resistance to the Mosasaurus

1345
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,295
And for his billions

1346
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:40,159
Millions can counter that but we need Millions

1347
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,183
That

1348
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:47,583
Either

1349
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,607
People who are in marketing

1350
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,751
Sometimes things are best-sellers events or not

1351
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,799
Infowarsstore.com

1352
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:03,199
And get one of those 60 70 t-shirts

1353

01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,111
Restore.com

1355
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:16,511
Are AAA 2533 139

1356
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:26,495
Warfare

1357
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,247
Wolf

1358
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:38,783
Wow

1359
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
Yeah

1360
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,623
Florida's with money now

1361
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,719
I mean as a sales pitch

1362
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,559
It's blunt

1363
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:58,751
People dancing around it this is the Bernie Sanders

1364
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,287
Not really

1365
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,079
Give me all your money

1366
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,639
I will fight my fake enemies to the death

1367
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,735
I mean look

1368
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,039
The way this all shakes out I think

1369
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,063
The most likely

1370
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,855
Scenario is

1371
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,879
A couple more indict

1372
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:15,903
Come down and Trump

1373
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,463
I think that's probably what's going to happen

1374
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,487
You're going to realize

1375
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,511
If I don't

1376
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,303
The entire family businesses fuc

1377
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,583
I probably

1378
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:27,167
Penske probably pardon me and my family you know.

1379
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,983
Work out some kind of backroom deal that's going to happen

1380
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,287
The other problem with

1381
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,359
Propaganda still Infowars is still going to be a problem

1382
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,151
All that stuff because they're not going

1383
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:37,919
Going to be like

1384
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:43,295
Do you say will be a completely like he was forced by the globalist

1385
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,343
Go back to the John Kelly at poison

1386
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,391
Narrative probably at that point

1387
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,439
There'll be some sort of thing but like

1388
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,839
I don't know I don't know how I got off on that but I mean it's just this

1389
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:57,887
Peak bulshit

1390
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
It's amazing

1391
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,215
You know what's really amazing

1392
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,775
Rodger Stone describing it as

1393
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,055
Islamic terrorism at at

1394
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,847
It's worse right which is like

1395
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
No

1396
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,199
And two if it were

1397
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,295
We just had white terrorism at its worst

1398
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:22,719
Holy s*** there's about fifty times as many people

1399
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:25,023
They're better at murdering random people

1400
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,839
Because he believed it was a psyop with helicopters

1401
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,423
The fun thing for me

1402
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,727
Is obviously Rodger Stone knows that it

1403
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,263
Course

1404
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,031
It's

1405
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,311
Like for real

1406
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:40,639
Maybe the only real white supremacy is that white p

1407
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,663
People are

1408
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:48,063
Complete sociopaths willing to murder everybody and that's how we got where we are today

1409
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,367
Willing to lie for each other

1410
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:55,231
Willing to lie desperately for each other to protect white supremacy

1411
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,255
Like consider

1412
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,559
Most serial killers are white

1413
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:04,191
True alright also most people who hurt children

1414
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:09,055
Is it possible that that's a mutation of the regular white jean which is just

1415
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,615
Taking over the world with cross eyes out of this

1416
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:18,271
I am actually advocating for the move from a soft yes

1417
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:24,415
Jesus that's not good I mean there's nowhere else to escalate this podcast is over

1418
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,231
There's only one solution to our problems and that's

1419
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:32,607
Backwards ethnic cleansing Jordan I've appreciated our time together

1420
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:38,495
Did this is really just about to be radicalized

1421
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,407
I think of you listen

1422
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,943
If you showed enough

1423
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,503
People enough Infowars eventually we'd all be like

1424
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,551
It's not a bad I

1425
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,623
Do you listen to our podcast and the dollop

1426
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:59,231
It's game over for you there's no hope for lights out

1427
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,255
I mean

1428
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:03,583
Justin Bieber's super super clear get just because I'm so self-conscious

1429
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,375
Just about like Alex listening

1430
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,423
Take it out of context

1431
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,215
We don't think white people are evil

1432
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,519
The tradition has been

1433
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,799
Really terrible

1434
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,591
Write the history is really awful

1435
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,895
There's nothing intrinsically evil about whites

1436
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,663
Skin

1437
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,687
You dumb f*** Alex

1438
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,735
Hypothetically

1439
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,831
Its skin color how do you not get that

1440
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,111
Not you

1441
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,391
Alex

1442
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,927
We're still doing this

1443
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:35,327
Apparently yeah anyway

1444
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,375
Call Jones's karaoke moment of the day

1445
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:44,031
Burning inside with a fire

1446
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,311
Hazel Miller

1447
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:51,711
Alex Jones

1448
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:58,111
Ride Along

1449
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:01,951
Along with that

1450
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:06,047
He's right here and it's about him

1451
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:06,815
Trump Twitter

1452
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,911
Needs to be regulated like a utility

1453
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:15,263
Companies a private company but they can't deny you a telephone

1454
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,823
This is a First Amendment issue

1455
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,359
So they could have

1456
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:23,455
First Rogerstown is advocating for a regulation on a private business

1457
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
Which is

1458
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
Fun

1459
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,783
Also it's not like a phone

1460
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,111
At all because there are many platforms you can

1461
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:32,159
Communicate with online

1462
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:35,743
You can choose not to it's not it's not as essential to your life

1463
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,047
Instaconnect

1464
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,327
Yeah

1465
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,607
Now isn't it

1466
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:45,727
Strange that the guy that you want in there is

1467
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,007
Rodger Stone

1468
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,799
Have you ever heard of hip-hop

1469
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,615
Paseo yes you have your a f****** classic bullshiter

1470
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,431
Rates

1471
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,735
He should be saying this about internet

1472
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:02,367
As opposed to saying it about a private business internet didn't hurt him

1473
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:05,695
Twitter

1474
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,719
Absolutely

1475
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,023
That's what all of these

1476
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:13,375
These people like stone is smart enough to know that what you saying is dumb

1477
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:16,703
And it's only going to hurt people other than him

1478
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,031
The issue all of these people

1479
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:24,639
Regulation in finally

1480
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,943
When it finally touches them they're like

1481
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,319
Regulation is always bad but not in this

1482
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:37,183
Free Speech issue neo-Nazi

1483
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,511
Befriend you old glamourpuss

1484
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,791
I like calling him

1485
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,327
Glamourpuss

1486
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:47,167
Earlier I said that I took some issues with Media Matters

1487
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:50,239
Issues was when we talked about that the

1488
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:53,567
The beginning that they didn't really give the full context

1489
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,615
The complaints

1490
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:58,431
Complaints is very generous

1491
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:01,247
2 saying about this guy attack

1492
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,527
Manhattan

1493
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
But

1494
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,599
The thing that I think

1495
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,135
Irresponsible

1496
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,671
Derelict in their Duty

1497
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,463
As media watchdog

1498
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,279
Is it they didn't listen to the rest of the episode

1499
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:16,351
Because the rest of the episode at the end

1500
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:19,423
Alex Jones has an interview with a guy named Matt Bracken

1501
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:22,751
Who is a guy who is very much

1502
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,311
In favor of militaristic act

1503
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,591
Action

1504
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,871
Against

1505
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:32,735
He's allegedly has a military background

1506
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,039
Not entirely sure he probably does I don't know

1507
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,343
Allegedly because I

1508
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,391
No I don't I haven't done looking at

1509
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,463
Broadcast

1510
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,511
On Skype from his den

1511
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,303
Pretty cool

1512
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,607
I like his dad all of his pictures are hung up

1513
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,399
I'll tell you that much about that

1514
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
I'm out

1515
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,215
But I also get garbage dicks

1516
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,263
The throwing this out that's that I appreciate you reminding

1517
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,567
He is a novelist

1518
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,103
And he's written a bunch

1519
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,895
Novels that purportedly

1520
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,431
God revealed truths

1521
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:07,039
About the world but it's all fiction

1522
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,575
Islamophobic

1523
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:14,463
Who would have garbage dick has labeled him as a right-wing wank fiction author and I think that's fair

1524
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,255
Solid solid

1525
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,023
F****** crazy

1526
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,839
A lot of times and pictures book

1527
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,655
Like a plug his books and what have you

1528
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,959
The reason I bring up Matt Bracken

1529
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,007
Read a book called

1530
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:27,775
How to hide your

1531
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:31,103
How to hack roblox.com

1532
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:37,759
Where to find books

1533
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,807
Yes

1534
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,831
Everywhere else

1535
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
No

1536
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,159
Never gun safe

1537
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,791
Media Matters if you talk

1538
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,559
About Matt Bragg

1539
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,863
Because he is the more important

1540
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,471
Miss you and I know that it's not a sexy cuz most people don't know that who he is

1541
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:04,127
Even done a better job talking about the all the stuff

1542
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,175
That was around that clip

1543
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,991
What they talked about about Linda sarsour

1544
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:11,039
Being compared to a

1545
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,063
Is that b

1546
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,623
Linda sarsour looks like this guy's brother witch

1547
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,391
Another

1548
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:18,719
Freudian slip

1549
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,047
I think he was legitimately

1550
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,071
Can you call her

1551
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:27,423
I was being more generous than I probably should have been

1552
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,823
Clicks based on your dumb headlights but let us know

1553
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,615
Then let us write the article

1554
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:39,455
You fuking idiot

1555
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,479
Pokemon go

1556
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:46,111
There's never will in trouble

1557
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,159
Look you can really monetized

1558
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:54,559
Corporate left there not going to be October

1559
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:59,167
Seems like also antifa socialist

1560
01:17:59,423 --> 01:17:59,935
So

1561
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,727
Maybe a couple

1562
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,775
Maybe a couple folks

1563
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,799
Miss out

1564
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,079
That it's real shame

1565
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:09,919
Did aunt

1566
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:17,087
Contact you or like how you tone down the white gentleman but don't be so obvious

1567
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,623
November 4th

1568
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,927
You know what to do indoors

1569
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:25,279
Matt Bracken is what out they should be focusing on

1570
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,071
Because he says a lot of stuff that is

1571
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:27,839
Is much worse

1572
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:30,399
Right

1573
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:33,983
We were the people who people could rely on

1574
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,007
To cover Alex Jones

1575
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,311
We have an article about him

1576
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:42,175
Maybe we will incorporate in the future onto knowledge site.com but

1577
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,991
Your ears

1578
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,783
Welcoming map bracket on the show

1579
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,063
And Jackie

1580
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:50,879
He's talking about Islam being bad

1581
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,279
Actual translation of

1582
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,863
Is great that's a big mistake

1583
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,703
When they say Allah hoo and they put the

1584
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,239
Greater

1585
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:10,847
Is greater than your God Allah hoo Akbar is

1586
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:17,247
Concord

1587
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,527
Cancel

1588
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,831
I know and also it's not true

1589
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:25,951
It much like you says Raza Barraza means the race that means people

1590
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,975
Best translating

1591
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:31,583
Bracken is kind of right on some level but he is wrong in his

1592
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:36,959
Interpretation according to Mainline Islamic scholars

1593
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,239
I mean God is greater

1594
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:41,567
But the understanding generally is a God is greater than you

1595
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,335
Plumb-rite

1596
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:48,479
God is greater than the things that are your it your issue

1597
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,015
To put you in your place

1598
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:56,159
In terms of the hierarchy of God and man Allah and man

1599
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:01,023
Or even a God will never give you more than you can handle

1600
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,071
God God is omnipotent

1601
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,375
That that sort of there's like connotation

1602
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,703
The other thing is the other translation of Allahu Akbar

1603
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:11,007
If God is omnipotent

1604
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,311
He is by definition greater than your guy

1605
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:16,640
That's true

1606
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,920
Neither God is omnipotent

1607
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:22,528
One of them is in the other one isn't

1608
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,552
Would have to be real

1609
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,088
And then we'd really get the

1610
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,160
Could one of the guys become big enough

1611
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,184
Not that the other couldn't let you

1612
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,000
Could become a big enough Mountain that the other

1613
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:32,768
Could lift

1614
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,048
Crazy

1615
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,864
I'm also the other translation

1616
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,472
Very common for amputation of Allahu Akbar is God is greatest

1617
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,544
And that is not God is the greatest god

1618
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,312
Because

1619
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,128
All these religions are monotheistic

1620
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:50,432
Islam

1621
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:03,232
Christian right about the money buckets on the Family

1622
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:09,376
Carbonized

1623
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:14,240
Look this what happens when you're raised in the f****** sure it's up communion there we go

1624
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,176
That didn't go over well with the chat room

1625
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,528
I'm also garbage dick dropped in some of the

1626
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,296
Matt Bracken

1627
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,576
Book titles

1628
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,392
Here we have

1629
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,184
Enemies foreign and domestic

1630
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,000
Domestic enemies

1631
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:41,120
Foreign enemies and traitors

1632
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,216
I also

1633
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,240
He is a mess

1634
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,264
Here is his next

1635
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:54,688
His name is literally a sword of Allah

1636
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:59,040
Nobody a very extreme wedding picked up on the fact that

1637
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,832
His parents named

1638
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:05,696
Anyone that he won the Isis Lottery

1639
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,976
To come to America

1640
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:11,328
And bring 28 more I just heard today bring 28 of this closest

1641
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,864
Inbred family here

1642
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,912
Which I'm sure on welfare

1643
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:20,288
They're plotting more Jihad attacks

1644
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,592
Because we're creative

1645
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,360
Yikes

1646
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,432
Because the least

1647
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,480
Creative most inbred tax

1648
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:35,392
Who did do the truck attack his name is very similar to would-be translator

1649
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,160
Rated as

1650
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,440
The sword of Allah

1651
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,720
But that doesn't mean anything

1652
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,000
You know what Ariel mean

1653
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,024
Play Muriel

1654
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,584
Lion of God

1655
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,120
Largest animal

1656
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:45,888
Okay

1657
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:52,288
They are vicious killers in the name of God

1658
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,336
Brandon memes

1659
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,616
Mermaids

1660
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,384
Sword

1661
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,408
In Celtic

1662
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,944
Okay

1663
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:00,992
I don't know

1664
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,808
Prepare everything

1665
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:11,232
There's another I can't remember what it is but there is a very common Anglo.

1666
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,280
I mean sort of God

1667
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:17,632
Like it is a common name I don't remember what it is I thought it was David but that's gift of

1668
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,168
Got

1669
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,960
That are from Andy

1670
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:21,984
Find Manti Te'o

1671
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:27,360
Tradition of violence within name

1672
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,200
You know what Daisy Mae

1673
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,480
Cock-block

1674
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,808
Crazy Little Flower cock-block

1675
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:40,160
The other thing I mean

1676
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,696
I'm getting more into the inbreeding

1677
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:45,280
I guess I made this guy had been here since 2000

1678
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:50,656
It is entirely possible that

1679
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,472
This was around

1680
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,640
Against

1681
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,408
But anyway

1682
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,944
Welfare being given

1683
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,992
Within five years

1684
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,528
Of becoming a

1685
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,808
The citizen

1686
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:11,904
I am so it is 7 years after possible that they were on assistance

1687
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:19,072
So Bracken is just throwing around a lot of

1688
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,864
Idea that the argument is

1689
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,680
Tax dollars are going to pay for people

1690
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,664
It's the Welfare Queen

1691
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,944
It's a modern welfare

1692
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,880
Great episode Coronavirus

1693
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:46,464
But also the

1694
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,512
Bracken

1695
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,328
No

1696
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,864
Did that little scat there

1697
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,912
Guess what I was trying to

1698
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,752
What I was trying to come out with was

1699
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,312
The idea that

1700
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:06,432
Matt Bracken is reinforcing also this idea that there is only one sort of

1701
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,992
Air and it's

1702
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,016
Predetermine today

1703
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:17,440
Tommy Robinson has a great book

1704
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:21,792
Muslims kill 44

1705
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:22,816
You can't

1706
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,704
It is The Ten Commandments are all kill kill kill

1707
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:33,056
There's no way to take it out

1708
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:37,152
Beautiful

1709
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:40,736
Spring

1710
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:44,320
We support you brother good job

1711
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:46,880
Just make sure it's a church next time

1712
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:50,720
I mean it's beyond

1713
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:51,488
But

1714
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:53,024
What's fascinating is

1715
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,304
What happened

1716
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,608
Dan if you break one of the ten

1717
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,144
You go to hell

1718
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,192
No you shall be put to death

1719
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:00,960
Oh really

1720
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,496
So you'd wait

1721
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,264
Yeah

1722
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,032
Is that right

1723
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:07,360
Also I don't think there is as well as all the Lost

1724
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:10,688
From Deuteronomy late night show has some

1725
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,224
Conversion of the top 10 list

1726
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:17,856
Because David Letterman did it ready so successful but I don't

1727
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:20,672
Just because the Bible was so successful with it

1728
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,976
Doesn't mean that that's in every religion there's no

1729
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,768
You don't say

1730
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:32,192
He's understanding of s*** is very is very wack and the idea that all the Commandments are to kill

1731
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:37,056
And Islam we got over this over and over again the the analyses that have been done about violence

1732
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,848
In the Bible and

1733
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:40,640
The crime show that Bible is

1734
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,480
Not a ton but little bit more violent

1735
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,504
So

1736
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:48,576
I don't know it's just a dumb conversation

1737
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:54,720
Also if alter I can't like her to kill why don't you

1738
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:57,024
Ableton Commandments where to kill you

1739
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,792
You could have gotten

1740
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,328
Point off with four

1741
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,632
Commandment number one

1742
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:02,912
Kill

1743
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,448
Commandment number 2

1744
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,496
Commandment number 3

1745
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,288
Kill like you got it

1746
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,640
5

1747
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:15,968
Brevity is the soul of wit

1748
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,016
But it is not the soul of religion

1749
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:22,880
Bright also Tommy Robinson is a disastrous bigot

1750
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:25,440
He is a British version of Alex Jones

1751
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:28,512
To some degree

1752
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
Think of Tommy Davis

1753
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:34,912
A domes in England Davidson

1754
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,960
Movies playing

1755
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:42,336
Living Color right

1756
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,104
Pizones

1757
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,128
He did

1758
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:47,712
Pizza Hut spokesman whenever pizones came out

1759
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:48,992
Crazy

1760
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,040
Anyway that bracket

1761
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,832
Anyway

1762
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:56,416
Yesterday we went over we

1763
01:27:57,696 --> 01:28:00,256
We apparently

1764
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,792
We went over

1765
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,096
The biggest

1766
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
Big

1767
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,912
Big story

1768
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,448
Alright

1769
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:09,984
So Mike cernovich

1770
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,520
Was trying to give a speech

1771
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,056
In New York

1772
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,592
Columbia University

1773
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,128
Why

1774
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,920
Cuz he likes to rile people up

1775
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:19,712
Publicity stunt

1776
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:23,296
In order to keep himself relevant otherwise

1777
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,136
You know you can exploit it pretty far

1778
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,720
Mike cernovich is giving a speech there

1779
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,024
Protest

1780
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,304
And they had a sign

1781
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,096
It said no

1782
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:36,864
Soupremacy

1783
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,400
No pedo bashing

1784
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,424
No Mike Serna

1785
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:41,216
I wonder which

1786
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,008
Bay Focus

1787
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:47,104
That was one sign for that that when you hear me tell you that

1788
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,920
What what's your first thought about

1789
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:52,224
You see a picture of that

1790
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,992
What do you think

1791
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,016
Plant

1792
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:56,832
You

1793
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:57,856
Archicad

1794
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:05,024
Alright dumb libtard

1795
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,560
Talk about it for about

1796
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:11,936
Third of the show yesterday about how expensive are coming out of the woodwork

1797
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:16,544
Of course there was a reporter from Gotham S2 was on site and he took a bunch of

1798
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,616
Two pictures that show that that is just somebody came up

1799
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,384
In a mass

1800
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,968
Unfurled the protesters

1801
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:28,064
And immediately when they saw what it was

1802
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,600
Destroyed design

1803
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:35,488
It was clearly an outright plant the guy in The Mask

1804
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:42,400
They got a good picture though I mean not good picture but you got to make sure that's good enough and you know what would Owen Shroyer said the

1805
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,448
The other day not the other Dave a couple weeks back

1806
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,216
Optics

1807
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,240
Become the story

1808
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,568
Then that is exactly what's happened here

1809
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:54,688
So today

1810
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,480
Mr Porter

1811
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,760
Feel really bad that I can

1812
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:58,528
Can't remember his name

1813
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,088
But he was reporting that

1814
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:03,392
Of course the song got destroyed immediately

1815
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,464
Antifa

1816
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,000
People who were there were like

1817
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,536
They didn't even

1818
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,072
Print out art logo

1819
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:20,544
The flag that was the wrong color in the logo like there's no way that we

1820
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:26,944
Someone who's not involved with

1821
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,040
And we went over there yesterday but just so you know

1822
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,880
Advice didn investigation into NAMBLA

1823
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,160
Sometimes they have November

1824
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:42,048
Yeah it well used to existence

1825
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,424
Something for these folks

1826
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,448
To throw

1827
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,216
As a boogie

1828
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:51,520
Right so it was a complete

1829
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:54,080
It was a complete nonsense publicity

1830
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:59,456
Would not be surprised if Mike cernovich was keenly aware of it at least someone involved

1831
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:02,272
Maybe Jack Boscobel

1832
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:05,856
Check

1833
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,952
Mike cernovich comes on the show today

1834
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,744
November 1st

1835
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:12,768
And here is

1836
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,536
Them talking about it

1837
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,072
Mike cernovich

1838
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,864
What is the point of them

1839
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:28,896
There's a full-page ad in New York about hey we're going to start a civil war

1840
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,920
It's about

1841
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,200
Protests about rallies

1842
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,992
Yeah

1843
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,528
As far as I know part of it

1844
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,808
Amendments

1845
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:40,160
Never heard

1846
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:45,536
You're on Shaky Ground bring the Ten Commandments with you wherever you go

1847
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:47,840
Does my butt did you notice

1848
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,704
This is exactly like that.

1849
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,728
Where Alex

1850
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,264
Just one question I'd like son of a

1851
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,288
It's just answers another

1852
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,152
Who why do they say nothing's going to happen on the 4th and then this ad

1853
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,712
What is going on

1854
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:08,832
So weird and unhinged earn from

1855
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:15,232
Wenatchee foot was tearing a pedophile sign and then they just handed it to us

1856
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,888
You just going to carry around what everybody hands you

1857
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:25,472
So that

1858
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,752
That indicates two

1859
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:27,776
To me that

1860
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:29,312
This was sort of like

1861
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,360
Polite

1862
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,896
Right Mike cernovich

1863
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:38,016
Expect out of people in order to like

1864
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:38,784
Exploit

1865
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,064
Do you know that

1866
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,624
Can you hold this for me for a second

1867
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,160
Like it if I

1868
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,208
You probably wouldn't do that at

1869
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:49,792
Airport Logan use examples like someone asked me to hold their bags

1870
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:54,144
Could you hold this, clay cartoon

1871
01:32:54,400 --> 01:33:00,288
Big circle

1872
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,824
Let's just be fun.

1873
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:08,224
Well let's say I mean someone gave you

1874
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:12,064
I don't even know how to make it an analogy because my my brain keeps going to like

1875
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,856
A goblet covered in ship

1876
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,880
Or something like that

1877
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:20,512
And you hold it for them hold it for them not knowing

1878
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:24,096
I was just being polite at all I don't understand

1879
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:29,984
Crank no it's not a human being and and him knowing

1880
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,520
The people would respond that way

1881
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,568
I kind of think that

1882
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,104
Vitamin B

1883
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:41,248
Because because he has this line ready to go it's possible that he just came up with it since then

1884
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,040
If possible to

1885
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:45,344
Linda

1886
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:48,416
The more suspicious that he

1887
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,184
You might have been

1888
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,608
No proof at all that like you said yesterday

1889
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,632
First of all

1890
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:59,936
No proof at all there were people on

1891
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:02,240
Saw the entire thing

1892
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:04,288
Pictures

1893
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:09,920
Pedophile

1894
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:10,688
Right

1895
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:14,272
Now they're having to admit false Flags could exist

1896
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:17,600
Because I need Alex's.

1897
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,648
Being here this is at this isn't for

1898
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,256
No proof at all that like you said yesterday

1899
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:27,328
Albert Avenue admit false Flags could exist

1900
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,144
Right which is a narrative

1901
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
Either way

1902
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:38,848
Whoops

1903
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,664
Got to give up the game there a little bit

1904
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:53,696
Alienvault

1905
01:34:53,952 --> 01:35:00,096
Reddit conspiracy propaganda world

1906
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:02,656
Happened like

01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:05,216
Helicopters shooting at people in Las Vegas

1908
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:11,360
Oh wait hold on someone give someone a sign and someone took a picture of it I guess I know that it was fake

1909
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:15,200
I guess Sandy Hook didn't happen all right

1910
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:16,992
Not lying

1911
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,272
I am lying to you

1912
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,296
But what if I'm not

1913
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,856
Even if I am

1914
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:26,208
You might as well just be making noises

1915
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,216
Clips up where they like

1916
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:37,984

1917
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,264

01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,288
Labrador

1919
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:44,640
A better show would be like

1920
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,688
Just Alex screaming at a monkey

1921
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,224

01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,312

Disney Pixar Coco coming out sometime

01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:26,368
I sure there was a me though

1932
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:31,232
That wasn't sign language to voice talk

1933
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,792
Let's move on

1934
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:37,376
I told you to hold on to your thoughts about that Lottery

1935
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,192
Through this

1936
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:46,592
That was dressed and I walked back into the break room to get a

1937
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:51,968
Coffee

1938
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:55,040
Blaming Trump for New York

1939
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:04,256
This is the guy that got the bill passed with Obama's

1940
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,048
He's the chief sponsor

1941
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:08,608
Diversity Lottery

1942
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:11,680

1944
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,752
No but you're lying

1945
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:21,408
Married to you here in 1987 the US government under President Ronald Reagan decided

1946
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,456
I found an official immigration Lottery

1947
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,248
Call the diversity Visa Lottery

1948
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,320
Through this program they wanted to make sure the diversity of Nations

1949
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:31,648
In the United States of America will be preserved in the future

1950
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:33,440
Because they regarded as a characteristic

1951
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,720
The creature of The American Nation

1952
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,256
The immigration

1953
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:42,144

01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:48,800
Alex

1957
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,592
You don't know anything

1958
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
You don't know anything

1959
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,736
Why is it why would

1960
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:57,760
Anyone listen to

1961
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,832
What is it what is going on cuz he

1962
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:09,024
I just heard that pretty confidently

1963
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,096
Alright that's

1964
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,120
That's why we're f*****

1965
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:15,168
Alright okay

1966
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,984
Make you this promise ring

1967
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,568
Greg

01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,664
Reagan got that diversity pass

1969
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:31,296
Yeah

1970
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,648
That's my favorite

1971
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:42,304
Infowars news we've ever covered in this next clip

1972
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,096
Don Jr outing

1973
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:44,864
That he did

1974
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,912
It is Trump's fault

1975
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,192
More less

1976
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:52,032
There's a lot of Dynamics involved

1977
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:58,432
Ultimately one of the just for safety's sake and accuracy

1978
01:38:59,456 --> 01:38:59,968
His hands or not

1979
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:01,504
Absolutely that's what I would say

1980
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,528
Terrorism

1981
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,112
Whenever there are so many people

1982
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,136
Who feel like there's

1983
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,160
Nowhere else

1984
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:09,696
When you're just

1985
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:10,976
The system doesn't work

1986
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:13,536
When you're poor when you have no money

1987
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:15,328
When nobody get there's no social safety

1988
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,352
Peanuts there's nothing

1989
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:20,704
To deal with Larry is corollary of rioting is the voice of the unheard

1990
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,728
Anne Winters

1991
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,520
And when you got nothing left to lose

1992
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:27,104
Yeah you can't be a suicide bomber

1993
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,408
I'm stupid not to understand that historical

1994
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:33,248
Oh you sure can we found that out

1995
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:39,136

He does realize that's life

1998
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:07,040
And I was making it up

1999
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,112

2000
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:11,904
Like in the real world

2001
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:14,976
That could get someone

2002
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:18,048
Killed that got reality winner f****** tossed in prison

2003
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:18,816

That behavior

2005
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,168
The outing of a stores

2006
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:27,008
That Alex did you fart

2007
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,056
That's life

2008
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:33,152

Who killed possibly for giving the information that they're not supposed to give

2016
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:51,840
That's your credibility out the window why would any Source ever talk to you again

2017
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:55,168
And you know he doesn't need them cuz he don't have sources are not real

Don't you remember that

2027
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,744
I would eat violate one of The Commandments

2028
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:22,304
So difficult about Charlottesville

2029
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,840
Text which is to kill Heat

2030
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:27,168
Here's the Scoop about Charlotte's Beltsville being fake

2031
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:33,056
We can have big Marques we can bring a lot of people out

2032
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,736
Anime use fat fat and bags with these alright morons in Charlottesville

2033
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:47,392
You know why Obama

2034
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,496
Texas I mean

2035
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:04,032
Hard enough

2036
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:04,800
The false flag

2037
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:05,824
Bright

2038
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,592
Okay

2039
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,944
Who committed the terrorist Act

2040
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,480
Hard right

2041
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:14,784
He was in all writer

2042
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,064
Music

2043
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:21,440
There's a there's a great comment in Manning is is an Oreo

2044
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:23,232
By his own word

2045
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,048
So was this f******

2046
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,608
Whatever who cares what it's for

2047
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:31,424
From where

2048
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,496
Gamergate started there was

2049
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:35,264
Some good analysis

2050
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,568
What happened to apply to crnkovich back then

2051
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,992
It's because they were convinced their opponents were using them again

2052
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,368
The truth is

2053
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:52,928
Who cares

2054
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:57,280
Mike cernovich and Alex Jones all these people are so caught up in their white

2055
01:42:57,536 --> 01:43:00,608
They can't possibly believe that anything a white person does

2056
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,632
Monstrous

2057
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:02,656
Is real

2058
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,960
So they create this whole narrative

2059
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:07,264
04 swaggerty and stuff like that

2060
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,080
Justifies it to them use it again

2061
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:10,848
Deliberate

2062
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,640
And it's

2063
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:14,432
This is everything they say

2064
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,456
Think we're doing

2065
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,480
Is what they're due

2066
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,272
It's more complicated than that

2067
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:20,832
It's more complicated and more provable than

2068
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,880
Like that's what he says

2069
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:25,184
I don't ever want to use the exact rhetoric

2070
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,768
Cowardly

2071
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,048
AIDS

2072
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,584
Utter ironic

2073
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:33,376
That's what is going on

2074
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:34,656
More life

2075
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:38,240
Cuz this is what we're this is this

2076
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:42,080
And I don't mean liberals I don't mean antifa faces what the world is

2077
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,896
Are critical to our survival

2078
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:48,480
I don't think we get Sunshine that everybody gets a

2079
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,760
The sandwich

2080
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,808
They stop this

2081
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,160
The time

2082
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:58,208
Dialing up millions of people to

2083
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:00,256
To be duped by them

2084
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,048
I mean what it serves

2085
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,328
To do is make sure that no one get

2086
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,632
Get the sandwich cuz we've got to babysit these f***

2087
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,400
All the time

2088
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,960
No one's paying attention

2089
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,520
Right we are essentially babysitting

2090
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,544
I'm cleaning up

2091
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,872
The mess that the Alex Jones makes everyday it's just

2092
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:21,760
I mean we should have thousands more listeners

2093
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:28,416
Relatively intelligent person has done with the rest of the shity human race Ferrari

2094
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:30,464
People doing a lot better job on other

2095
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:33,792
Global issues and I think a lot of people are doing a better job about Trump

2096
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:35,584
And what have you

2097
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,352
It's too much on him

2098
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:44,288
Very few people are doing good job about propaganda

2099
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:47,104
Except as it relates to Russian stuff

2100
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:47,872
Cuz that's

2101
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:51,968
Yeah that's me

2102
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:56,832
The right that's a hot check the hot talk

2103
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:58,624
It's just a

2104
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,672
Like please take care of that Folk

2105
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,696
Absolutely

2106
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:03,232
Please take care of that

2107
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:05,024
But realize once it's over

2108
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,304
We still got this mess

2109
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:12,704
Yeah man we're just getting a head start on cleaning it up

2110
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,008
Alex Jones is leading a real militia

2111
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:16,288
I will be like

2112
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:18,848
We've been saying this for five years

2113
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,640
No one is listening

2114
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:26,016
Bracken is leading the gorilla anti-muslim unit

2115
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:27,808
I'm telling Dad

2116
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,088
Posthumously

2117
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,368
We are going to be thought of

2118
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,744
Actually successful

2119
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:41,888
We're going to get the ship kicked out of us by proud boys

2120
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,680
Maybe being able to pay our rent

2121
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:45,984
And getting beat up by the owl tonight

2122
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,008
Great

2123
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,288
I'm not

2124
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:51,872
I refuse to

2125
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:56,736
Proud boys

2126
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,552
But also

2127
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:00,576
Chicago

2128
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,928
You're not too concerned about them but Alex is really concerned about being sued

2129
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,488
I know I've been making a point over and over

2130
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:13,376
I'm making that point over and over again cuz that is the story of this episode

2131
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:20,800
Let me ask you about November 4th when I kick this thing off I actually my lawyers want me to get into it but I mean literally

2132
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:21,824
Real Gore

2133
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:28,224
Got his whole deal

2134
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:32,576
March is on the Run

2135
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:36,416
Again they cut him off by ramping up there like soundrop

2136
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:43,072
Going to come out in the in the next few days probably

2137
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:48,448
But also the idea T saying that Al Gore is told him to lay down by November 4th

2138
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:49,728
F****** b*******

2139
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:53,056
Just trying to bolster his narrative he's probably getting sued by

2140
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:56,640
I wouldn't even be too surprised if it was hamdullah Kaya again

2141
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,528
And that he is giving you a

2142
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:03,296
You call to ask

2143
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:04,576
An index

2144
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,624
If you just said they're coming for me

2145
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:07,392
That works

2146
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,672
Like 22

2147
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:15,072
Just kind of a long time. Your marketing it's not good marketing unless you know

2148
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:16,352
Know when you need the money

2149
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,632
Specifically

2150
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:21,472
Is that might be the case

2151
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:26,848
Leah Morales

2152
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,128
Cut the world

2153
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:34,016
Timing doesn't make a mix

2154
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:40,416
I think I think it's a lot to run afoul of there

2155
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,184
Their agreement

2156
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,720
The Brittany

2157
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:47,840
The whatever agreement they made in force

2158
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,192
Observe

2159
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:01,664
I'm lucky they got out of that

2160
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:05,504
Also

2161
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,552
Here's my ears one Theory I have

2162
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,320
I don't think it's

2163
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,368
But it's entirely pop

2164
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:11,904
Because I don't

2165
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:17,792
For the longest time as been saying you know in terms of Sandy Hook

2166
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:19,584
We just had the bait

2167
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,864
We played both sides

2168
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:23,680
Will you play Devil's Advocate

2169
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:24,960
Still denying

2170
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:27,264
But a week ago

2171
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,288
He did

2172
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:31,616
Yeah he straight-up said it's fake as a $3 bill

2173
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,688
I think there might be a chance that maybe some of the families are

2174
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:39,040
I would be

2175
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,952
Please still get death threats from his listeners

2176
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:52,352
Reading the news now because it's just like everyday

2177
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:59,264
Family members

2178
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:04,896
Constantly feel like people like Jimmy Dore even making comments that are similar to Alice

2179
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:07,456
Like you're supposed to be you're supposed to be

2180
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:10,528
Progressive bro right don't fall for the same b*******

2181
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,832
But he fell for that he was at least

2182
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,416
Putting his dick in the water with the Seth rich

2183
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,208
A man he was

2184
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:21,536
Spouting a bunch of nonsense on

2185
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:23,840
Oh my God

2186
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:26,400
Larry Nichols his number

2187
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:29,472
The other day he tweeted something about

2188
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,240
Jimmy

2189
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,592
Dammit dammit

2190
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,896
I went when it all goes down

2191
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:37,920
Logos

2192
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,480
Radio show host

2193
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:44,576
Watch

2194
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,904
RadioShack

2195
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:51,744
Maybe you were trying to sell them

2196
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,768
Joint at school

2197
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,840
I don't know

2198
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:58,656
One more click here

2199
01:49:58,912 --> 01:49:59,936
This is very troubling

2200
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:00,960
Incredibly trouble

2201
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:04,288
Because we have been operating under an

2202
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,080
That I think is a fair assumption

2203
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:07,616
Reasonable

2204
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:08,896
Thing to believe

2205
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:11,456
In terms of

2206
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:13,248
Propaganda

2207
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:15,552
Look at it as

2208
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,600
They are talking to their audio

2209
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,160
Yeah I think we have been remiss

2210
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:22,208
I think we've been looking at it wrong

2211
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,512
Is there a habit

2212
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:27,328
In this next clip Mike cernovich really gives up

2213
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,608
The game about what they're at

2214
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,376
Actually doing

2215
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:32,704
I ever criticize Trump

2216
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,640
Consumers doing

2217
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:47,040
Send tracking Schumer's doing that

2218
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:52,928
From someone directly

2219
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,768
Orange over and hear a joke

2220
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:02,656
City of Bushnell

2221
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:15,968
Trump supporters

2222
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:18,016
A day or two later

2223
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:21,344
At that rally in Arizona Trump finally for the first

2224
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:33,632
No professionals do our jobs we know what we're doing

2225
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:34,656
Negotiation

2226
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:37,216
You just not going to steamroll last

2227
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:39,008
So

2228
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:45,664
The the thing that we should take away from that I believe is that they aren't really interested I mean

2229
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,944
Because he's got to sell his product

2230
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,272
Same way that Steve

2231
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,600
Russia

2232
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,368
Well yeah

2233
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:58,976
Yeah they're there a.m. and there is much as anybody else they only use public

2234
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:00,000
Opinion as opposed to

2235
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:04,352
The target of their their propaganda is Trump

2236
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,376
To a greater

2237
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:08,960
So f***** up

2238
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,264
So f***** up

2239
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:15,616
I don't even know why there's nothing else to say

2240
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:23,040
Aborting a filled with bigot realized is the direct line to the president

2241
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:27,136
Screaming in a video

2242
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:29,440
When we went on the same show

2243
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:30,464
Mike cernovich

2244
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:35,072
Literally said I don't care if it's real or not we win either way about a

2245
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:36,608
Propaganda photos

2246
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:38,912
Stunt that got done at one of his events

2247
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:40,448
That's not okay to me

2248
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:43,520
Would be okay with me

2249
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:44,544
Now that's f***** up

2250
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,312
The dishes

2251
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,592
The destruction

2252
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,384
Of the the

2253
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,944
Separation of Journalism

2254
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,968
Manpower

2255
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,528
This is the destruction of public discourses

2256
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:55,808
Destruction of everything

2257
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:59,648
It's coming from both sides and I don't mean

2258
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:00,672
Right and left

2259
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:01,696
I mean topping

2260
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:05,024
Like these for rich people in Minnesota

2261
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:09,376
Destroying it in their way which is to

2262
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,912
Mckfacts obsolete

2263
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:13,728
I'm in the top is destroying it in there

2264
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,544
Making only the facts that they want known

2265
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,848
Only the way they want those facts

2266
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,944
Do in all of this

2267
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,736
Everybody else gets f*****

2268
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:25,760
They're the ones

2269
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:28,320
Both sides make a s*** ton of money

2270
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:29,600
Yep that's good game

2271
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:30,624
Yep good

2272
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:32,928
Yep that's what it is

2273
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:36,256
If you look at the group

2274
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:37,024
As

2275
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:39,840
Which being represented by a person

2276
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,632
It's f***** up

2277
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:42,912
We're done man

2278
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:45,472
I do remember the ad that Hillary Clinton

2279
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:47,520
Who do you want

2280
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:49,312
Answering the phone at 4 in the morning

2281
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,360
I imagine

2282
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:53,408
That is very different.

2283
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:56,992
Do you want the president to get his news from Fox and Friends

2284
01:53:57,504 --> 01:54:02,112
Do you want him to still be up at 4 in the morning

2285
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:02,880
The present

2286
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,160
Skip this news

2287
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:05,440
From Fox and Friends

2288
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,720
The president

2289
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:09,536
Is scared of what Alex Jones thinks of him

2290
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,072
The president

2291
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:12,352
Is shook

2292
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,632
By Mike cernovich

2293
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:18,496
I'm not nowhere else

2294
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:20,288
Nothing

2295
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,312
More scary

2296
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,104
Make me quiver in my boots

2297
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:26,944
Influence

2298
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,224
Poop

2299
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,808
Goddamn and it's dark

2300
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,856
You look good you look a little dream

2301
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:39,488
Yeah I'm running around today and that right before the show I was real stressed out

2302
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,256
Going to get all the clips

2303
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,536
I feel like I didn't do a good

2304
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:42,560
Enough job of research

2305
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,328
A lot of stuff

2306
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:51,008
I don't know

2307
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,288
Uno

2308
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:57,152
I just there's Bears elements of Alex that are fun and there's a limit

2309
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,992
The rampant islamophobia isn't

2310
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:03,296
Fun and especially when we have an instant

2311
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:04,064
Of like

2312
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:04,832
Alyssa

2313
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:05,856
Listen to his show

2314
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,136
I know what

2315
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:07,904
He said

2316
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:09,952
IC Media Matters

2317
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:11,232
Who should be the one

2318
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:12,000
Helping with

2319
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:13,024
Us with this

2320
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:15,328
I'm in the world

2321
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:17,120
Right it is their charge

2322
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:18,400
Hey rightwingwatch

2323
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,424
Is there a charge

2324
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:20,448
2

2325
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,216
Watch the

2326
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:21,984
These people

2327
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:24,288
And be like hey this is what they're saying

2328
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:27,104
And haven't watched it I know that they didn't

2329
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,200
Yeah

2330
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:36,576
Burlington more thorough job

2331
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:37,344
What about like

2332
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,648
Here's why this is right

2333
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:46,048
It's just a transcript of the clip and the clip anger people you cannot reach people

2334
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:46,816
But you can't help

2335
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:48,352
And it's never going

2336
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,144
Pierce the people who do believe

2337
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,168
The propaganda

2338
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:52,704
If all you're doing is like

2339
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:54,496
Hey look at this isn't this f***** up

2340
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:55,776
That is a good

2341
01:55:56,288 --> 01:56:01,408
But then again

2342
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,712
It's complicated

2343
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:06,528
Was that pronunciation name

2344
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:09,344
You're not talking about Avril Lavigne on my list

2345
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,368
Complicated

2346
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:14,720
I also

2347
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:17,792
I was like a blister on the back of my foot

2348
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:21,632
Your to your

2349
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,400
You're too happy

2350
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:27,008
No I

2351
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,056
And since then I've had a blister on the back of my

2352
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:31,104
My foot and because it's on the back of the foot

2353
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:32,128
F****** get rid of

2354
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,152
You got to go to bed

2355
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:36,736
I've been using a Band-Aid liquid bandage

2356
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,016
Destroying

2357
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,040
Great radio

2358
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,320
Longest Ride

2359
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:41,856
I'm stopping it up

2360
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:43,904
Anyway I don't

2361
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:46,464
I don't disagree with you

2362
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,232
In that

2363
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,840
They are they are part of the outrage machine in there propagating that and

2364
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:52,864
In some ways

2365
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,144
They're utilizing

2366
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,424
The same tools that alley

2367
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:59,264
In the way of

2368
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,568
What's the best way to get people to engage

2369
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:03,616
It's not make me feel better

2370
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,896
It's not educate

2371
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:06,432
It's not his country.

2372
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:07,712
Absolute

2373
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:09,248
Space Mo

2374
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:14,112
Yeah so if you are still a business

2375
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:15,392
If you're not a non-profit

2376
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:19,232
And so I get it which

2377
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,024
Is part of the problem

2378
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,816
Repeat if you want to make

2379
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:23,840
People outraged

2380
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:25,632
About

2381
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:27,936
What happened on Alex Jones Show

2382
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:30,240
I don't think the way to do it now

2383
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:31,008
Necessarily

2384
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,032
Play

2385
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:34,592
Linda sarsour looks like

2386
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:35,872
This terrorist

2387
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,944
Thrust of your article

2388
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,224
I think it is much

2389
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,760
More infuriating

2390
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:43,552
Two people and much easier

2391
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:44,832
Intro into

2392
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:45,600
To like

2393
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:48,160
Well this is very easily disprovable

2394
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:49,696
Is the stuff with Matt Bracken

2395
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:50,720
Especially

2396
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:56,608
The clip where he's saying that all the tenants of Islam in the Quran or kill kill kill kill kill

2397
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:59,424
Write that sort of stuff is much easier

2398
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:02,752
And would make people much angrier I think you get more clips

2399
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:03,776
But

2400
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:06,080
What are every every

2401
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:08,640
Every editor app

2402
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:10,688
Every continent is going to be like

2403
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,480
Celebrity gossip boom

2404
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:16,832
Toss it up there as a celebrity

2405
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:17,600
Maybe

2406
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:19,904
World what else what else do you got

2407
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,696
Are you have a random

2408
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:24,512
Unabomber style author

2409
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:26,304
Who is

2410
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,096
Send Unabomber style authorship

2411
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,912
So what are you doing

2412
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,728
She probably was

2413
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:35,008
Temperature in Celsius

2414
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:39,360
No and even then I think we can move past

2415
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:40,384
Islamophobia

2416
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:41,664
Like that

2417
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,456
That is too much of a subset

2418
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:45,248
Now for Alex Jones wear

2419
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,528
It has to be

2420
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:47,296
White males who

2421
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:51,392
He is not an islamophobe

2422
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:53,952
Pictures not the program

2423
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:57,792
Christian

2424
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:58,560
Straight male to

2425
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,632
It's wasping

2426
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:03,424
As gospel

2427
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:06,496
Easier attack

2428
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,776
At 4

2429
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,848
You know Media Matters to make it might not outrage

2430
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,128
Many people but

2431
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:14,176
Posting something about Mike cernovich

2432
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:16,992
Days after the entire pedo sign is

2433
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:20,320
Been debunked help itching it

2434
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:27,744
Those admissions

2435
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:29,792
Ardmore damning to them

2436
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,072
I think

2437
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:32,352
Because

2438
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,936
Look what is those types of admissions they got rid of

2439
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:38,752
Dish it up just like that's

2440
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:44,128
The different era

2441
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:48,480
No longer exists you can just make it all out there I would argue that there's probably a good

2442
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:49,760
2%

2443
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,040
These ding-dongs base

2444
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:51,808
But isn't going to leave

2445
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,368
20%

2446
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,160
That you could get rid of

2447
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:57,440
From supporting them

2448
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,208
If you

2449
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:00,000
2

2450
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:04,608
Do you understand they are explaining on-air that they're calling you

2451
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:07,424
Do you understand that that is what's going on

2452
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,192
Or if

2453
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:11,776
You played some of his ridiculous throws to

2454
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:15,360
Explain this is a technique this is a rhetorical technique

2455
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:16,640
It is what

2456
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:18,944
It's how they train people at QVC

2457
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:20,736
That's how you sell things

2458
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:23,552
Yeah you try and create an emotional response

2459
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:25,600
10 people and then lay the sales pitch

2460
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:28,160
It's classic salesmanship

2461
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:30,464
So if you did something like that you could I

2462
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,488
I think makes

2463
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:32,256
Some dent

2464
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:35,840
In their their population nor their their fan bases

2465
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:43,776
Never going anywhere

2466
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:45,824
Yeah I would say that you can get

2467
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:46,848
The other third

2468
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:47,872
Split pretty well but

2469
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:48,640
Between

2470
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:49,920
Either not being

2471
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:51,200
Actively engaged

2472
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,016
Becoming

2473
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:55,296
Pure ladylike

2474
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:58,880
I don't believe them anymore and they're not going to come over to the

2475
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:09,120
Don't think you are I'm just expressing that I don't care I'm not

2476
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:09,888
Of the libs

2477
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:13,728
This is so fun this is such a this is such a weird reversal here

2478
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:15,264
Palisade wine

2479
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,312
Why is it that I'm the one

2480
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:18,080
BMX

2481
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:20,128
Hey Dan your anger is out of

2482
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:21,664
Arrow

2483
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:23,200
Therapy starting to work

2484
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:28,320
Finger touch with this goddamn

2485
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:29,344
Map

2486
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:32,672
The nail on the head there that's exactly

2487
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,280
No but like

2488
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:39,328
Look who came to the lot about

2489
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:44,960
I don't give a s***

2490
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:46,752
And you know that's what I'm saying

2491
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:48,544
About

2492
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:51,104
Swelling the ranks of antifa

2493
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,152
The ranks of the Democrats or the last diva

2494
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,456
I care about people not falling

2495
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,528
If you don't believe Alex Jones

2496
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:01,600
And know that he's a liar and recognize what he's doing

2497
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:03,136
And you still

2498
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:05,184
Believe in trickle-down economics

2499
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:08,256
If you still believe in states rights

2500
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:10,048
Cool

2501
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:12,352
We can have a conversation about that

2502
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:13,120
Right

2503
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:15,168
I just agreed but that's fine

2504
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:16,448
I don't think you can do that

2505
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:18,496
I don't think it was

2506
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:21,312
Alex

2507
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:24,640
Alex's tricks are just a more obvious version of everybody

2508
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:28,224
You said it right there

2509
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,248
They're more obvious

2510
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:33,088
Your teeth like he's a he's a practice level

2511
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:34,112
You know like you're cutting

2512
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:37,440
Teeth on this is a very obvious form of bigotry

2513
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,464
Andkon

2514
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:39,488
You know

2515
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:40,256
And then you

2516
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:42,304
Graduates of Fox News in your life

2517
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:44,352
Oh they're doing the same thing

2518
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:45,120
Flickr app

2519
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:47,680
About it but I still think you can graduate through a bunch

2520
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:48,960
Two levels and still have

2521
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:49,728
Conservative ID

2522
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:51,008
I don't think so

2523
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,544
Whatever

2524
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,080
Entirely

2525
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:56,128
I think it is Isaac supplied

2526
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:02,528
Most of my life the people who have been

2527
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:03,552
Conservative politicians

2528
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:06,112
Seem to be

2529
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:07,392
But I am not

2530
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:08,928
I look I don't know I don't

2531
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:12,512
You're the f****** call me a Centrist no give a s***

2532
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:18,400
Not

2533
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,424
Bothell

2534
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:23,776
I just don't care I don't I don't care about the the game but

2535
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:24,544
Between parties

2536
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,592
I don't care about the idea that like

2537
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:32,992
Hey I believe that the world works better in xy&z way and I believe it works better in a b and c way

2538
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:37,856
As long as you ditch the racist propaganda you aren't beholden to

2539
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:40,672
These ideas right and function

2540
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:47,584
Because we can have a polite disagreement about stuff and some places can Implement some plan some places

2541
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:49,632
And we can see what work

2542
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:51,424
That's the idea of

2543
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:53,472
Forget the government

2544
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:56,032
And stuff like that there is something to that

2545
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:59,872
Now if you want to dismantle the entire federal government in the name of states right

2546
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:02,176
You're stupid we can't do

2547
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:03,968
But the idea of

2548
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:07,040
Like the idea that people pitch in terms of states rights

2549
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:08,064
About like

2550
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:10,112
Let's see how things work

2551
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:12,928
In Colorado and then baby if it works there

2552
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:14,208
If we can expand it

2553
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:16,768
That is kind of what happened with

2554
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:18,304
Marijuana legalization

2555
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,840
They had her right

2556
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:21,888
To do that and we learned a f****** work

2557
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:22,912
Super well

2558
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:24,448
And two other states adopted

2559
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:27,776
Yeah the kind of thing that I understand

2560
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:28,800
Where that

2561
02:04:29,056 --> 02:04:30,336
Philosophy comes from

2562
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:31,872
And I don't hate it

2563
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:33,664
Now if you want to stay that all can

2564
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,432
Conservative

2565
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:37,504
Ideology is stupid and it's a con

2566
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:40,832
I disagree with you cuz I think that's as bad as Alex

2567
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:42,368
Calling all liberal stupid

2568
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,648
But I don't

2569
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,416
I don't

2570
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:48,000
I don't think that you're dumb and I don't think that like

2571
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:55,680
I don't think you have haven't thought out your opinion and I certainly think that most of the people we recognize as

2572
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:56,704
Conservative politicians

2573
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:58,240
Aren't necessarily

2574
02:04:58,496 --> 02:04:59,264
Just that

2575
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:00,032
Right

2576
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:01,056
B

2577
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:03,360
This point I want to get you is

2578
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:04,128
This is

2579
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:08,480
There are instances of political disagreements that are acceptable

2580
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:12,576
Fast forward that's more likely

2581
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:14,624
And because we only have

2582
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,440
Conservative and liberal as our sort of two Polar Opposites

2583
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:22,048
Yeah we get to talk about that's the reason I use that as the

2584
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,888
I I think that was just a misunderstanding

2585
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:29,216
Modern conservatism

2586
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:30,496
Is inference

2587
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:31,520
Physically tied up with

2588
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:34,336
Because that's the only way that you can

2589
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:35,104
Kansel

2590
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,896
F****** yourself over

2591
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:40,736
Right like that's like if you look at what Kansas what happened in

2592
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:43,040
The way that Sam Brownback

2593
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,856
Implemented all of the

2594
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:46,880
Conservative tenets

2595
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:49,952
Destroy Kansas's in entire

2596
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:51,744
Economy and infrastructure

2597
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,304
And if we don't have all the other stuff

2598
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,840
Piggybacking in the end

2599
02:05:56,096 --> 02:06:02,240
The Nan a giant backpack around it right and we would have seen

2600
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:03,776
That stuff didn't work

2601
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:10,176
And we would have been able to Discount those sorry already know that

2602
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:12,480
Because it's been applied

2603
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:13,248
So many

2604
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:14,272
Times in American

2605
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:15,040
History in the past

2606
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:16,320
And it never will

2607
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:17,600
Spray ever

2608
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:21,440
Look I I I respect your

2609
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:23,232
Like I totally get what you're saying

2610
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:24,256
Coming

2611
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:25,792
From the idea of

2612
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,608
Polite disagreement is a valuable thing

2613
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:32,448
I think the problem that we are having or at least in this

2614
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:33,216
Discussion

2615
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:35,008
Is a lot of

2616
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:35,776
The polite disc

2617
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:37,056
Disagreements that were talk

2618
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:37,824
Talking about

2619
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:38,848
Happened

2620
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:40,384
Hundreds of years ago and

2621
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,200
We're just still having those

2622
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:48,576
Disagree

2623
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:50,112
Cuz I don't agree with

2624
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:51,136
A lot of

2625
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:52,160
Different ways

2626
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:53,952
I absolutely think that

2627
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:56,256
11

2628
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,304
That can go

2629
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:00,608
We're not polygon

2630
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,656
There is a rational approach to

2631
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:04,704
But at the same time

2632
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:06,240
Trickle down economics

2633
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:07,008
Is Magic

2634
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,032
It doesn't exist

2635
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:10,080
Conservative

2636
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:10,848
Disagreement

2637
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:13,408
Is gone there is no further discussion

2638
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:14,944
Up tax breaks for the rich

2639
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:16,480
Leading to economic

2640
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:17,760
We're done there

2641
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:19,296
So that's not a

2642
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:20,064
Disagreement

2643
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,880
Well for you because you're making it rude

2644
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:25,184
You're making it a little rude

2645
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:28,768
Okay in this hypothetical conversation that you're having with a conservator

2646
02:07:29,536 --> 02:07:31,840
Pathetical conversation

2647
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:36,192
You're not conversation

2648
02:07:36,704 --> 02:07:40,800
What that's like that's like arguing about whether or not climate change is real

2649
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:42,592
Well that would be on my love

2650
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:44,896
Jill Brightwell

2651
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:46,432
That's not a polite disagreement

2652
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:49,760
Disagreement in the same way

2653
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:51,296
If there's an established

2654
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:53,344
Fact

2655
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,112
Dude

2656
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:55,136
Dude

2657
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,208
What you're not

2658
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:01,024
I believe that what you're not taking into account

2659
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:03,328
Okay is that let's take the

2660
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:04,096
The climate change

2661
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:05,888
As an example of what you're talk

2662
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:08,704
If you take away

2663
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:10,240
A lot of the

2664
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:13,056
Conspiracy propaganda beliefs about climate

2665
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:13,824
Change

2666
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:16,384
There would be much less disagreement about

2667
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:19,200
If people were relying on science

2668
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:20,224
About it

2669
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:22,528
They were relying on empirical evidence

2670
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,856
There wouldn't be nearly as many people who were saying there are two

2671
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:26,624
Two sides

2672
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:28,672
Cuz a lot of people who

2673
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:29,696
Whether they

2674
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,232
Really

2675
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:33,024
Consciously understand it or not

2676
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:34,560
A lot of people who are against

2677
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:35,584
Believe

2678
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:37,120
Letter r did they

2679
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:38,912
The UN is

2680
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:42,752
Inspire and they're faking all this the one that I get for my phone

2681
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:43,520
Family all the time

2682
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:44,544
At the scientist

2683
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:45,824
It look the scientist

2684
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:47,360
How to say this

2685
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:48,384
This in order to get Grandma

2686
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:50,944
Brave

2687
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,736
Disregarding the fact that they

2688
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,272
Maybe get hundreds of

2689
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:56,832
Listen to the dollars while the people who are causing climate

2690
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:57,856
Get billions

2691
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,648
But

2692
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:02,464
If you take away all of those right

2693
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:06,048
A lot of conversations that you're bringing up and I imagine

2694
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:09,120
Trickle-down economics might be one of them that also goes away

2695
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:11,680
Maybe was a bad thing for me to use it as an example

2696
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:13,472
I respect that

2697
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,008
I don't know where this

2698
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,032
Started

2699
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:17,568
I'm looking at the chat room

2700
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:19,872
I think we lost a lot of

2701
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:24,224
Garbage dick brought up a Libertarian philosophy

2702
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:28,832
Puppies that are burgeoning right now and I love you totally clear I got no time for Libertarians

2703
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:34,464
No matter how much I want to be inclusive of 0 time for Libertarians

2704
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:38,048
Nope

2705
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:44,704
I don't want him to have any more conversation

2706
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:47,776
Curling up in a ball over here

2707
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:54,688

Buena Park

Has been fun

2723
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:50,240
I know it's been

2724
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:52,032
Stressful and exciting

2725
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,176
Attacked my therapist and then

2726
02:10:59,200 --> 02:10:59,712
Anyway

2727
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:00,480
Alright

2728
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:02,784
Does a good man he's anything like

2729
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:04,576
This one dude

2730
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:06,368
Guy

2731
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:09,184
Doesn't

2732
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:12,768
Billy beer

2733
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,072
Does he hang up all his pictures

2734
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:18,656
Alex Jones talking about cross eyes being a sign of nobility

2735
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:21,728
And I am going to this guy they were talking about you'll be Noble

2736
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:23,008
And I

2737
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:23,776
England

2738
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,568
The guy has a cross eye

2739
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:26,336
Just like me

2740
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:31,712
Anything Goes

2741
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:36,064
Now you're the part where I would say May the wolf joke on its last but Jordan

2742
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,088
Pointed out to me

2743
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:41,696
And another that that's kind of a compliment

2744
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:44,768
And no longer say it

2745
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:48,608
That's why you

2746
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:54,240
