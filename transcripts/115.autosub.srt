1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,480
Think about how we started

3
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,504
Drinking

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
3 bottles of wine every night

5
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:35,072
Would survive longer know a lot about Alex

6
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,144
A year ago literally knew nothing

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,472
Yes does the show ray

8
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,264
Drinkopoly belgians are buttocks down

9
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,896
I was thinking about it and it is our anniversary

10
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,528
Maybe 52 episodes

11
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,672
I guess what I like 20 something or whatever we put out like 140

12
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,976
Episode

13
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:09,376
This is ridiculous I don't know what we're trying to prove here pretty big

14
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,264
And I realized

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,336
Notice

16
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,224
Albert I was thinking back about it I realized

17
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
To reflect on

18
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:30,112
Is it had that first episode on January 2nd

19
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,440
2017 what it was

20
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
I don't know if we would have continued

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,072
I'd like to take a moment to replay what I think is the clip

22
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632
That made us end up doing this show

23
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,680
We might have given up had it not been

24
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
For this clip

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
Talk about

26
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,576
If they weren't planning to

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
Good bad ugly

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,616
Red Alert this is getting crazy

29
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,760
This is so freaking out of control

30
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:38,208
Please help us

31
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:44,608
There's a decent chance that we would like just as just an angry insane person

32
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,448
Going down this road as we have I remember that now I lost my

33
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,240
Nothing better than

34
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
Long pause

35
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,992
Here in the 2018

36
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
Different

37
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
Show the show itself Implement that I think will help us moving forward

38
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,464
And one of them is I'm taking too much

39
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,304
Closer look at a lot of Alex Jones as primary sources and villain

40
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,960
For sure

41
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,544
Slate.com we have the first post up

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
It is an exploration of

43
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,640
The club of Rome

44
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,688
There's some sort of evil globalist

45
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,528
I want read a bunch of their document discuss why he's a liar about them

46
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,320
And it'll be way more of this

47
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
In this year I'm very excited

48
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,976
I hope people come along for the ride even more inadequate I post

49
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,280
Once a week and you're like okay

50
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
I'll put six

51
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,632
212 articles every single day

52
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
Do all the research myself as well it's not that Alex in present-day is boring

53
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:01,664
More fun for me to dive back into the primary sources I can try and actually find some little turtles

54
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,064
And figure out where he is why he is misrepresenting various things

55
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
Scream about nothing

56
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,416
Which

57
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
It is

58
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
A day's time

59
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
Also update

60
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
We started researching

61
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
For our first

62
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
Will be doing endgame

63
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,055
Okay cuz that's what he brings up the post

64
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
Let me tell you Jordan

65
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
I got 60 seconds into the documentary before I head to go read an entire book

66
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,135
Revolution driving into

67
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,951
Anyway

68
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
You got a lot of stuff coming down the pike

69
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Exciting

70
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Pike pike

71
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Pipe

72
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
Is that what you all have you always

73
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Coming down the pike

74
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,519
Now we don't know

75
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,639
We can be going over the January 2nd 20

76
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,479
18 episode today

77
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,271

Don't get mad and tell your brother thank you so much

82
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,151
Do you like foreign policy walking

83
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,599
We all get to hear about a bag full of poop

84
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
Today

85
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
January 2nd

86
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:55,839
We have not encountered the present for a little bit because

87
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
And

88
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Is Alex

89
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
Nope maybe maybe

90
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
2018

91
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
You decide what he

92
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
Really wanted to do

93
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Was

94
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
Relative

95
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,743
Zoe is not do that today is Arnold Palmer half and half zero

96
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
Calories

97
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
Stop grilling

98
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
That's about it

99
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,911
Anyway let's get to the show we got it

100
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Start things off

101
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
Which is actually out Jones dressing

102
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:41,151
Okay

103
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
Okay

104
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Alright

105
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
I mean

106
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
I guess

107
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:54,207
Is his position on it you could sum up as we've all known those UFOs exist

108
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
They just dropped

109
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,703
A hundred percent is going it's a gone

110
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Dates after they

111
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,031
All of their tax

112
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:13,919
Holographic

113
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Anyway

114
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Spyder leader

115
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
Throw that be great

116
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,999
This whole time save it spider leadership is not a big deal

117
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Is in a weird place

118
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
Little bit

119
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Little hungover

120
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,735
Worth a couple billion dollars of liquid cash

121
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,111
Buildings and infrastructure

122
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
But

123
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Billionaire

124
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
10 years ago

125
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
But if you look at the

126
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,431
He wants it America First policy

127
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,487
Thanks by the way

128
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
Does well off of Americans doing well

129
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
He does well

130
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
Bible prosperity

131
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,759
But the president

132
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:03,231
New York State returns or his New Jersey

133
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
Shape returns to show

134
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:21,919
Yeah that's not good

135
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
Turn off the year with like

136
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
You should release your tax return

137
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
Completely different level does on a

138
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,719
The exact opposite of what you're doing it wrong

139
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,023
Tax Returns come

140
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,071
If Alex Jones is correct

141
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
Who sang

142
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
In terms of like

143
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,423
Oh yeah

144
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,823
Losing so much money on this tax bill

145
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,711
Master the internet with Ozark

146
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
And the fact that that hasn't happened

147
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
None of it has happened

148
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,879
Rodger Stone

149
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Memes

150
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
Call not true

151
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,743
Absolutely not true

152
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
Spell really does hurt

153
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
Because he

154
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,375
Actually is almost worth as much as URI

155
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
And everything is dead

156
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
Tech tech

157
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,567
Brooks laich these hacks things don't affect me at all cuz I'm worth shitt

158
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
You can still do not pay taxes because

159
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,575
Exempt from less than 5,000

160
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:37,439
The only way it does affect us is insofar as we will not

161
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
Sure there will be infrastructure problems

162
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Alex brings up that in his

163
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
Calculus

164
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
What what makes

165
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
Can do well as well on a

166
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Propertybase

167
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
Service economy which

168
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
Sync means

169
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
He likes it when

170
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
People working his

171
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,783
I guess I would help us understand what he probably puts back

172
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,647
You know his businesses

173
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,463
Show that he's largely just shifting dad around

174
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,863
That's more what its business model is broke constantly rips off contractors constantly abused

175
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
The people who

176
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Fight back

177
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Much like Alex

178
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Stealing the Ellery

179
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,311
Prison bumper sticker from

180
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,871
Is that that you really start to get the send

181
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
But there's so much more of a spiritual connection

182
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
Between Trump and Alex Jones and terms

183
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
Kind of scam artists

184
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,599
But I don't necessarily tapped into early on

185
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
But I think there's a lot more of that then

186
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
Liquid cash

187
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
Alex or Trump trump

188
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,887
Like if you if you are welcome

189
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,471
If you ask Trump to buy you a cup of coffee would he be like

190
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,127
Let me check my let me check my credit card to see

191
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
How do you think about

192
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Folgers

193
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:09,599
And that the other thing in that Clipper

194
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
It is fast

195
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,951
I think is really fantastic

196
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Is this

197
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
Prospectus

198
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
No

199
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,679
Because then leave shows you rich

200
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
Rich enough

201
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,519
Compared to these globalist billionaires

202
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,127
Consider lower down on the list

203
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
I don't either but I think it's what Rodger told him

204
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
I think that that's a that's a reasonable

205
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Psychopathic

206
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
Explanation for it is like billionaires probably do know considering they probably own

207
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
Play that's the that's the thing that makes the most

208
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
Billionaires are looking at Trump ban

209
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
What an a******

210
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Billionaire

211
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
You say you're a billionaire

212
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
You aren't now

213
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Never going to have

214
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,991
Episode goes on and get back to it later

215
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Tiffany should release

216
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
The taxes

217
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
As time would you like

218
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
Everything that's not too

219
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,159
That's something you talked off

220
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,487
But I was like

221
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:25,887
Going back and forth through most of the episode while I was listening to it like going to cover this they're going to go back to

222
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
To the past where we going to do

223
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,751
And one of the things that really encourage me like now we got to go over the

224
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Is that

225
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Today

226
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Is a day

227
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
Full of Alex Jones

228
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Alright

229
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,503
A lot of people now I'm in like

230
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,855
Are you coming in hot. I don't know what happened over the holiday this is like

231
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,951
I got to get some boys I can work

232
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
I got to come back on in Fort Worth

233
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,679
I got to make Beauty and the Beast Gaston

234
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Bad guy

235
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
Cuz I'm not sure if you

236
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,591
It is next clip he lies a bit about China and tax

237
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Incentive

238
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,943
But they have I put into place which will discuss on the other end of the clip

239
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,783
But then he jumps into a prolonged

240
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
No thankfully

241
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
Just saying you know what

242
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:26,047
There's still a FANUC problems I assume that I just didn't want to hear anything that sounded very similar to

243
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,119
Ching chong bing bong it's going to have

244
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
One of these days

245
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,239
With

246
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
0 baby you come here

247
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
You come here

248
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:43,711
Your Apple and Facebook and Twitter

249
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
Champs Pro tax

250
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,631
Vernix

251
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
Guess what

252
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:09,055
It goes on another 40 seconds hold on

253
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Philly

254
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
What would you call

255
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:18,527
Like the the dumb guy and act like he's mentally challenged

256
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
Stand up

257
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Ecosoc

258
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:27,231
Swindle University have six houses in hundred thousand dollars

259
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:40,031
$300 per gallon

260
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,223
$300 wool jacket we looked up

261
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,879
So this goes on

262
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:01,279
But also but he slips in there accidentally I have looked up how much Bernie

263
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,327
Sanders clothes

264
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,367
Erase all this

265
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,719
What do you raise all that Alex I should be clear

266
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
He never answers his own question

267
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
He doesn't

268
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,887
Blind a lot about is this

269
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
The situation with China

270
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
I'll read here from The New York Times article

271
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,103
Temporarily exempt foreign companies

272
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
Paying tax on their earnings

273
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,223
Bibs keep American businesses from taking their profits out of China following washing

274
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
Overhaul of the United States text

275
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
There is however a catch

276
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:00,927
To be eligible for and companies must invest those earnings and sectors and Courage by China's government

277
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,743
Including technology in agriculture

278
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
According to a statement

279
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,559
From the finance

280
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Babes

281
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,471
One where companies from around the world to set up operation

282
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
The tap into a highly-skilled Workforce

283
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
And strong infrastructure

284
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
On top of the standard corporate tax rate of 25%

285
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
Companies are required to make social

286
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:28,319
Security contributions and other payment other country

287
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
So

288
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Text issues

289
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
You're not a good way to approach

290
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,975
Write the China business

291
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:44,447
They go to China because they get very skilled workers that they can pay very little

292
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
Is a wash

293
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,823
Chuy's not really necessarily one

294
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
One of the big guy

295
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
The businesses have

296
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,551
Bernie Sanders

297
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,879
Disco costumes

298
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,951
Could you read the whole article about boys

299
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
Cuz I'm about to read everything and I voice

300
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
Credible

301
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
What is that

302
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,983
Improv people to sketch actors to

303
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,847
Saturday Night Live Larry David

304
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,199
Peter John Burns there's no way

305
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:36,671
Regardless government's latest measures would

306
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:40,255
Be significant enough to keep many American company from repatriating Bravo

307
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,071
Sounds about right so it in the end

308
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
Experts

309
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
It's not really

310
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,215
Big deal

311
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,311
Because they're all there's other tax issues

312
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,639
Chinese bunch of new laws in the last year

313
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
Then if made

314
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Like

315
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
Getting money out of the country

316
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
Incredibly complicated

317
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
If you want to keep your business

318
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
So there's all kinds of other things

319
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Play Alex

320
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,463
Other interesting why would they

321
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
Why would they vent

322
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Make that

323
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
Knowing

324
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
At least

325
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
Having been told I would assume

326
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
That it won't make it

327
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,751
I don't know I think if they're hoping it will make some

328
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Different

329
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,335
What other plays Campbell

330
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
You know

331
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
Where's the

332
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:38,623
Vista this article also lays out like rules on how much money flows out of the country as a way of control

333
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
The value of its currency

334
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Signal Financial

335
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
System stable

336
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,743
Significant repatriation of foreign earned

337
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
Set off a broader Capital flight

338
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
And weaken the country's current

339
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
Following the current

340
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,679
Spark of vicious cycle with even more company

341
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,495
And possibly individuals looking to minimize losses

342
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
By moving their money out of

343
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
And then you get

344
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,639
Hyperinflation going on today we're in real trouble

345
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:06,527
I mean at the end of the day with their doing is just trying to mitigate whatever damage that's going to

346
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,623
Patriot

347
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Come back again

348
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:16,255
Anyway it how many of us is absurd it's all just going to go back to

349
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
Yo-yos

350
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
Maybe investment

351
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,399
Companies but not in the other

352
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,215
What they're doing with all of that money is

353
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,031
Then inflating the value of their own company

354
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,847
None of it is real it's all imaginary

355
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:35,199
Like everything's in there.

356
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Is Magic

357
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,271
Like there's no nothing

358
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,319
It's not like they're building a thing

359
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,647
If we move money over here money becomes

360
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
Here like it doesn't make any sense

361
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,255
So let's move along though cuz we

362
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:53,119
You can spend this entire episode talking about creation

363
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,447
There might be some more points you can bring out by whatever you like

364
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
On this episode

365
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,359
And that is that there's an article in the Metro

366
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
The UK publication

367
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
About how adult

368
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
Should buy their children

369
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:13,855
But that is just a launching point

370
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,903
For another impression

371
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
This one

372
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
This one is

373
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
Not as a defensive

374
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
From an audio standpoint

375
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,424
The word Starbucks

376
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Just fairness

377
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:47,904
No it's a real question what happened I apologize literally asking us to question

378
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,232
What happened I finally start the wrong click

379
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:56,352
Columnist says parents should buy their kids check toys

380
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,168
That is the big newspaper

381
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
London the Metro

382
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,176
Church

383
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,296
Watch kindergarten

384
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
Help

385
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:31,168
Jessie saint

386
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,504
Show me the Muslim

387
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
What was lovely

388
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,648
Play Notorious lovers of sex

389
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Pac-Man

390
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,864
So that was Bugsy Elders what was that

391
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,704
I don't know of the elders the pedophile

392
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
I mean great character

393
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:10,336
It goes back to Jasmine Alders just saying that maybe masturbation is up against

394
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:16,224
Should be taught it's even like after she got fired she got interviewed about it be clarified just like I wasn't

395
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,552
Like people are taking this way out of context I was just saying

396
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
People shouldn't

397
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,904
Teach kids that it's wrong

398
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,024
Maybe instead of a how to do it

399
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
Putting putting a lifetime of Shame onto your fourteen-year-old

400
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,912
Who really can't control himself

401
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,240
Or even 10

402
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
Through puberty

403
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:45,920
We're starting to have those feeling it was until it wasn't the backwash

404
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
4 years of

405
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Shame

406
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
Came out that I was like

407
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,832
Masturbating forever that's what I'm doing

408
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,136
But bedtime

409
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,464
Yeah lying about Jocelyn Elders he's like why we has that clip nut

410
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:07,680
Clip

411
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:13,312
Oh that's another great quote over Johnson Elders that I found when I was looking through all this

412
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:17,152
Noah Cordova like anybody who thinks children needs

413
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
Be taught how to masturbated never change

414
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,832
From what I understand I talked to parents before kids

415
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,112
Just play with themselves

416
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,160
You do it for me

417
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
Incredible young age

418
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,768
Yeah absolutely doesn't matter

419
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:36,352
Yeah so

420
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,632
I got to be honest

421
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
March

422
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:48,640
We had a we had a weird show as a pedophile

423
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
Underground

424
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,552
He and Alex

425
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,112
Stories about what we f*****

426
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:06,048
What what non-sentient things we Foxx on stage it was very strange that the three of you didn't start a podcast

427
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,984
So I don't know everything about it that's our off Street

428
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,360
This article from Metro

429
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:23,456
Here in a little bit cuz it gets much more in-depth at it and that's a more appropriate time

430
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,760
To dive into that but for now

431
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,296
He's lying about Jocelyn elders

432
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
He pretending there's a clip

433
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
You can play

434
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
Boy

435
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:41,376
I won't lie I think he does it again like

436
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Clip where Alex

437
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,216
Pretend that Donald Trump has raised taxes

438
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,264
2018 the year of the impress

439
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,920
Spanish

440
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
What happened

441
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,440
Bernie Sanders Usual Suspects

442
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,328
He's blowing Richmond

443
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:22,848
To ship our jobs to China

444
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,640
And you know that

445
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,224
And you're playing with dumb down

446
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
Pot kettle

447
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,632
It's not free

448
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:52,800
I want it I want to save it like I think the positions are a little more nuanced than that but I do

449
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Fair is fair

450
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Critiques to be made

451
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
Against him on a lot of that stuff

452
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,224
If you want to talk about pie-in-the-sky stuff

453
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,528
You're talking about Med beds

454
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,576
Except like that you're talking about

455
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:10,976
The secrets of the universe and curing all diseases that Trump has it all at his disposal this secret bases on Mars

456
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:17,376
Already exists and somehow are also already filled with pedophile Alex has not said that he's allowed ever

457
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,776
31

458
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,152
But that's the thing about that criticism that drives me in

459
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,944
Insane about the the Bernie sander

460
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,992
Oh you just saying we're going to give it

461
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
For everybody

462
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,808
Free

463
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,880
How that works

464
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,440
Know what it is is we do need to ask

465
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,232
That there have been

466
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,280
Plenty of debt forgiveness program

467
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,304
Over Donuts

468
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,912
Everything and every time one of those debt forgiveness

469
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
Is programs go on

470
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
What happened

471
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,752
To those people who get all that

472
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,080
Money back they reinvested in the actual

473
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
Economy they built

474
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,408
They do all of this stuff

475
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
My generation

476
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:10,368
Like they always talk about why don't Millennials buy houses and because I fucken college loans cost

477
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:16,768
What is March

478
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,120
I have imagined every morning $40,000

479
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,472
Because I was sold when I was 17 or whatever that

480
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
If I don't get that

481
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
If I don't get that

482
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,176
Well I would love to buy a house

483
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,224
If I had that $40,000 back

484
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
Is a down payment

485
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,832
You have all of these

486
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,624
These people buying houses

487
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
That creates

488
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,208
More jobs in for the economy

489
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,768
Willits Peaks

490
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,120
Why would I want I want you to make

491
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,704
I was just going to double down and reinforce that you're saying that like

492
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,776
When you're living under undue burden

493
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
Whether it be

494
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,848
From not being in

495
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,128
In control of your own

496
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Destiny because of

497
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,968
Like overwhelming debt

498
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,296
Control your own reproductive

499
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,112
Choices those who really live in Freedom

500
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
It's not we're not really free

501
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,304
Slavery everybody lives under that

502
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
To some degree

503
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
And

504
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
People could use help

505
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,728
Another

506
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,752
Dxp of the

507
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,824
Isaiah is so long called

508
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,872
Where

509
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
Could get out from under

510
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,016
Misapplied self

511
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,160
Yourself but you did it because you were mislead

512
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Those are

513
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,280
I wasn't entirely misled without that college degree I wouldn't have been able to get

514
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Get so many

515
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
Maybe

516
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,936
What type of jobs are also a lie exactly

517
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,008
Right

518
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,592
High school diploma

519
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,640
Degree in English to be able to do it

520
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
I have a lot of friends

521
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
No one's ever check

522
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Who cares

523
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,112
Crazy

524
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:24,000
Anyway that's what I encourage I think most of our lives are college-educated

525
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
Why

526
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:33,728
Morality is whatever you feel like

527
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
You were saying

528
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,824
Turns out it's a Democrat

529
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
Here Comes

530
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,064
But that is where I got a little backup message

531
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
Stuff like that

532
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
Is about $10,000

533
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,024
Play gentleman if you got a $500,000 house

534
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,656
Austin is the highest in Texas

535
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,264
School

536
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
Little Scamp

537
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,104
Iran

538
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
.

539
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,808
Values

540
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,280
Loving

541
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
System

542
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,480
Turn on rig

543
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
In terms of Alex

544
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
Is 100-percent synonymous with Robert Davi

545
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
So amusing that terminology

546
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
Is kind of like a little wing

547
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,720
The guy who did say that there are bars

548
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,560
Children sex slave

549
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,936
Guaranteed $100 in property taxes

550
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
And

551
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,848
Selectively release

552
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Just a shower body

553
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,944
New York New Jersey

554
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:26,368
Oh my God

555
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
Alright

556
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,072
As far as that stuff goes

557
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,192
Prediction Alex is making

558
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,216
Let's see

559
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,288
I don't believe that that is a

560
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
At all

561
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,104
What any Economist but I've read

562
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
Believe is going to happen

563
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
Do you have your position

564
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,016
We will see

565
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,064
The idea behind what he

566
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
He saying is

567
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
As far as proper

568
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,952
Prior to

569
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
Prior to this

570
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,792
Rewriting of the worst loss

571
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,864
You could deduct your

572
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
State and local

573
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Property tax

574
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,216
Right

575
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Do that

576
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
Now all the sudden

577
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
You can't afford

578
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
The cities are going to start

579
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,968
Like what it is what the text Bill really is

580
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,808
It's essentially like stealing money

581
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,088
From large cities

582
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
Putting it in

583
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
Rich people

584
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,976

585
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000

Robbing give Rick Palmer

587
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,144
I don't know if that

588
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,216
Was it real

589
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,288
You know what I want the apostles to release their tax

590
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,104
Yeah that's what I know I need to know

591
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,408
I know that one guy was attacked

592
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,432
Collector in any change

593
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
Solitaire

594
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,208
Salt Tarsus

595
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744

596
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:14,656
Back to the

597
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,008
Get back to something else we touch down already

598
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,336
And then I gets into

599
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,640
Ecova a liberal

600
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
Media figure

601
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
I don't know we'll see how much I agree with

602
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,416
Farm Company

603
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,632
Did a great job

604
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,520
There is however

605
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:57,152
Railways technology

00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,856
It's zero.

608

0

609
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,000

Subhuman

Unchivalrous piles of Filth

Alright lyrics

Claims

625
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,328
Might be partially

626
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:24,704
Heaven also they just had 20 million dollar Venture capitalism run

627
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,264
SO3 Venture capitalism for Avatar

628
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,800
Literally run out of

00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,336
Gulf States

630
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Pitched in

631
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
And they're going to

632
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
Play because of it

633
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
Inflow of

00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992

00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
Which

636
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,832
You guys look into it

637
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
Might be

638
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,768
We got we got programming baby

639
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:55,168
Just throw whatever it's a while see what sticks time I don't know if I necessarily want to be involved because with Alex Jones

640
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
Something not real

641
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:01,312
And I used to be a bit conservative

642
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,128
Back when he was younger in college

643
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,920
Was a conservative

644
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,504
Stuff that we're pretty bird

645
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,064
Article in the hill

646
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,856
The founder

647
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:20,256
The founder of the Progressive online Channel The Young Turks apologize on Thursday after making sex

648
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:26,656
Derogatory remarks on his blog

649
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,192
Texas opening up

650
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,032
Here's a quote from

651
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,944
Obviously the genes of women are flawed they're poorly designed creatures who don't want to have sex as often as needed for the human race to get along

652
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
Longford Leanne

653
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
Peacefully

654
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,784
In another post called the rules of dating

655
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
You can explain

656
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,880
What is the dating process

657
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,952
I don't want to hear that women

658
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:56,352
Ignore these rules about rule number

659
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:02,752
41 there must be some serious making out by the 3rd date if I if I haven't things are not about to laugh

660
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
Much longer

661
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,592
If you don't get back on track by the 4th date you're done

662
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:11,968
Number to Northstar must be orgasm by the 5th

663
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,016
Unspecified

664
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
Is he talking about a handy

665
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,928
15 is probably too late for Hindi

666
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,232
Opposed

667
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,816
Do this but then at the same time

668
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,632
I am opposed to all of it

669
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,424
At the same time

670
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,472
When addressing a

671
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,264
He apologized

672
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,592
The stuff I wrote back

673
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
Hugo said

674
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:45,248
If you read that today what I wrote 18 years ago you're offended by it you're a hundred percent right

675
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,064
And anyone who subjected to that material I apologized

676
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,136
I deeply regret having written that stuff when I was a

677
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
Free guy

678
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,464
If someone said that today I would heavily criticized them on the

679
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
Michelle

680
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
And I have

681
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,304
I've criticized myself over the years

682
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
Not yet matured

683
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,120
Still conservative

684
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,144
We thought that stuff was

685
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
Politically Incorrect

686
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,728
An edgy when you read it now it looks really

687
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
Honestly ugly

688
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,288
Very uncomfortable

689
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:15,456
So the reason that I am not giving him a pass for writing that stuff necessarily but I do give him a tip

690
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,736
The proverbial hat

691
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,784
In the sense that he owned up for it

692
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,600
And he took responsibility and apologize

693
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
Which is the

694
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
More

695
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,208
Adult thing to do in that situation

696
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
I would not like to be

697
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
Be taken to account for

698
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,560
For some of the jokes that I wrote when I was starting

699
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,328
Comedy

700
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,120
Their number things that I

701
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:33,888
Frey

702
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:40,288
Don't come to life it's not like I yelled the n-word like I'm Michael Richards or some s*** there a lot of unevolved position

703
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,080
Rules for dating

704
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,360
But I did it

705
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,384
You know I mean

706
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,968
I'll be honest I didn't realize

707
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
Rainey was a bad word

708
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016
D'usse

709
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,552
I didn't have Anti Trans

710
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
Material

711
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:56,672
But I didn't realize that that was a pejorative horrible words

712
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,208
There's a difference

713
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
Between

714
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
The reason

715
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
The word ignorant

716
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,560
Is important

717
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
You didn't

718
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,168
No no

719
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,448
You didn't have access

720
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,032
Like there's a lot of situation

721
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:17,408
I could have known better and that is on me for being

722
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
But at the same time

723
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
I didn't know any better

724
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,760
There's if there's

725
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:28,160
Like it's hard to hold yourself accountable for being able to know everything that might

726
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,744
The purpose of that is

727
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,024
To just be like oh

728
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,304
This was a phantom

729
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
Okay cool I'm not

730
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
Going to say it anymore

731
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:42,752
The guys were like

732
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,824
Let's just talk

733
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,360
Is gone wild it's like no just

734
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,176
Political correctness is just like

735
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
Don't be a dick

736
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
Like it doesn't hurt you

737
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,064
To say it and it hurts them when you say it so why are you saying

738
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:02,464
Generally speaking I don't I'm not a uber thing I don't watch The Young Turks or anything like

739
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,488
Like that

740
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:09,632
Is a whole situation yes the stuff you wrote is terrible apologize

741
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,704
Go ahead and accept his apology

742
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,008
Is 18 years ago and there's nothing

743
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
Current weather

744
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,336
Stuff like that

745
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,128
I'm inclined to believe

746
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
He has

747
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,432
Learned

748
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,016
Seems like

749
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
You doing ever

750
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,112
I don't know I don't know

751
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:34,208
Exactly platform

752
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:38,816
God damned if he isn't against that type of I don't know the man so I don't have any idea

753
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,144
Uno

754
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,240
But I do know that

755
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:55,199
The thing is too though like he grew up and I in a Muslim household but he came to America when

756
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,735
You lived here

757
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
Right and he is an eighth

758
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,807
He's a devout 80

759
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
He's made it very

760
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
Very clear

761
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
That is

762
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
Where his

763
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,023
His heart lies

764
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,351
He thinks that women are subhuman and of course he does cuz he's an islamist

765
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,399
Is Ally on like three point

766
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,775
I don't need to I don't want to take this much time to f****** defend Genki Kerr

767
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
Deconstructing the

768
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,359
Little pieces of Alex Jones

769
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,407
How much he can lie in one sentence

770
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,943
Really spectacular

771
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
It's fascinating

772
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,271
It seems like every noun

773
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
And it's

774
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,343
Descriptor adjectives

775
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
Lice

776
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
Every single one

777
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,183
I don't think his article

778
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,719
Kohl's relies like re-up

779
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,255
I don't think that's a lie

780
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
But everything else pretty

781
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,327
The indefinite articles

782
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,887
Library there's no

783
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
Welearn

784
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,495
But not just Janke

785
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,383
Evil people

786
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,807
Vicious

787
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,719
They're just solace

788
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,023
Greedy trash

789
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,775
Smartro timer

790
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,351
Vicious

791
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,935
Vicious vicious Criminal

792
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,079
Will be back

793
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:06,527
I kept Charlotte

794
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:13,183
Guitarist

795
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:17,023
I hate your family entertainment

796
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:22,655
That's as Jerry gets the block.

797
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:26,751
So I don't know man I think when you speak in terms

798
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,055
I know the last time you did was like

799
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,359
2 seconds

800
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,687
I would say only when I'm

801
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,223
Antagonizing my cat

802
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,783
Right or my radiator

803
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,367
They hit a little bit and sometimes I will scream at them in the middle of the night

804
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,439
Xavier like

805
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,463
It's time to speak to

806
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,767
Perhaps you can understand

807
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:53,375
Kept up all night by radiators

808
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,447
Just below bed bugs

809
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,239
In terms of like losing your mind

810
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
Damn radiator

811
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,567
Will not shut up

812
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,175
I don't hear from the general

813
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
Every time

814
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,735
He's telling a story about meeting

815
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
Somebody else

816
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
It feels like

817
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,343
He's just running up to them holding loose leaf paper

818
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,231
Surprised when people push him out of the way like

819
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
Alex

820
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
No thank you

821
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,095
It's because you're afraid of the truth

822
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,143
Your large

823
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,959
And that's loose leaf paper that you hand wrote in Crash

824
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
Yeah

825
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,335
The other thing I always think about when I hear him say those things

826
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
Those sorts of

827
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
You got to be a little more specific

828
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,735
When you're talking about

829
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,039
It was like what I made with democratic

830
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,063
Controllers

831
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,463
The f*** are you talking about credit controllers

832
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,255
Second of all

833
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,911
Like it's the same things like global

834
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,983
Senior Alex

835
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,775
You're coming out of there going like

836
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:08,895
Number one

837
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,711
It was the movie clue I was actually just watching the movie

838
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:18,111
Horse bucking sneaking of wire we're wired one of these things

839
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,695
This b******* you claim this

840
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,999
The problem with that is that it would just be too much

841
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,327
You couldn't beat you couldn't be able you couldn't understand where is there

842
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,863
Fastest route

843
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,399
Tactic

844
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,215
KC Hawaii

845
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,007
Understand is that all democratic

846
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
Controllers are

847
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:41,919
Create background noise

848
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,807
You know what this is one of those things that I think it's really going to talk to me

849
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
My point is

850
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,183
Add Arizona there's a lot of

851
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:57,791
Prince's wear

852
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
Number these other things

853
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
We talkin about

854
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,423
Actual things that we can make

855
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,751
Alex is lying about ex-wife

856
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,311
But in the same when he does stuff like this

857
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,359
Important to really

858
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,639
Discuss this first second

859
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:16,479
Right where do you say these things like all Liberals are evil when you talked

860
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,247
Democratic

861
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,295
Controllers are all hissing and Evil

862
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
We don't even have to

863
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:31,839
No it's just go to a lot more parties intellectual discipline that we

864
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:35,167
You require in order to push back against that is just say

865
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,959
No they don't

866
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:43,359
And we have succeeded

867
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,663
NFL

868
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,711
It's the show

869
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:56,671
Dufferin

870
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:00,255
Send a text to Alex Jones

871
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
Peohe's

872
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,143
Position at current is that the Russia investigation is

873
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,959
Completely Fallen apart and everything is off the rails

874
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,775
Everyone is already admitted that it's not real

875
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
And all this

876
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,639
Get back to bash

877
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,687
His favorite boys

878
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,735
The man

879
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Mueller

880
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,063
Do them get to hit the little buckshot

881
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
Here in this Mexico

882
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,671
Social media

883
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,095
Infowars.com

884
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,143
Newswars.com

885
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,727
Ethical leadership

886
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,407
Governor Clinton

887
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,559
Charlie McCarthy

888
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,375
We went over a lot

889
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,423
Sleeping over a lot of that stuff so we don't need

890
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,471
Do I really go over why he's lying

891
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,775
You know I'm not going

892
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,103
Sitting here and go to bed for literally everything, did

893
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,943
There's some bothersome answers

894
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
But at the same time

895
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
Not

896
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
I'm sort of

897
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:30,111
Evil bagman or Russia or whatever his uranium narrative

898
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,439
Amazing how that narrative

899
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
Have that story

900
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,487
Just like

901
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,535
Everybody knows that

902
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
That isn't true

903
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,607
Except for people who only listen

904
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,631
Conservative news

905
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:46,751
Right and we can adjust repeat it loudly with no evidence whatsoever

906
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,519
And then it's like

907
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
A month later

908
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,847
And you hear that story again you're like well

909
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,431
They're still talking about it I assume they gave evidence

910
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,711
The first time that they

911
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,015
They never did

912
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,807
Magic of the way Alex Jones

913
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,463
Declare something and then use later that's kind of operations

914
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,255
Hannity's list

915
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,583
We don't need to address any of those things

916
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,215
James Comey

917
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,239
Ventriloquist dummy

918
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:22,847
And then personal

919
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,871
Just got to wash over me

920
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,407
Well of course

921
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
Call Eddie at home

922
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
Ventriloquist doll

923
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,015
But we need to get back to uranium one is

924
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,087
The personal insults

925
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:42,047
Just looks like a pervert I'm sorry looking

926
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,863
Slime bags

927
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,911
Supposed to be Sharp

928
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:51,263
Look just perfect

929
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:57,663
Danger Will Robinson

930
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:04,831
Are horrible jokes

931
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,783
The restaurant

932
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:45,279
I think that is probably how I was doing watching the restroom

933
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,071
Right

934
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,887
Issues

935
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
T20

936
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,959
Address as it relates to his narrative

937
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,727
Dealer

938
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:57,567
Miller does have an Ethics waiver

939
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,127
Special counsel

940
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
Investigating

941
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,199
Trump's campaign

942
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:12,159
Well I'm reading this here from an article in Politico because

943
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
What

944
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:13,951
Ethics waiver really is

945
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,303
The boj wants

946
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,607
And the reason

947
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,399
Most people think it is

948
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:28,031
Is that the waiver is believed to relate to Mueller's work in recent years as a partner at Wilmer Hale Law Firm

949
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,359
Which also represented former Trump campaign chairman

950
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,151
Ed White House adviser Jared Kushner

951
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,943
Who is also Donald Trump

952
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,479
Essentially it's a

953
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
Pinterest

954
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:42,367
Absolutely not have that ethics waiver

955
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,903
And he proceeded to court

956
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:50,047
Like God Kushner or all they would have to do is get a wilmerhale attorney

957
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,839
Represent them in the case

958
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,911
Ambulance would have to be out and so

959
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,239
That's in the same way that so many of them have ethics

960
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,311
Neighbors that we don't hear about like Kushner has an Ethics waiver

961
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:04,383
Like all of these guys that work for Trump

962
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,431
Wind up having those same waiver

963
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:11,295
Because the only way to get around that is by saying

964
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,855
You're good and there is

965
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,135
Bear is a

966
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,439
No just did a colonel to this that is

967
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,743
That's the right

968
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,535
That's the right thing to do to cover your bases

969
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:27,935
If they if they were acting like God they just would have

970
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,311
Like all those like the Amicus brief was filed

971
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,103
Like that was clear like

972
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,151
Committed the crime

973
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,431
But we were just like well we

974
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,967
Just arrested

975
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:46,367
There's an interesting quote in this article in Politico from Richard painter

976
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,671
I think it's sloppy

977
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,975
The conspiratorial side of me thinks

978
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,535
Somebody jumped

979
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,839
For the waiver because they want to create the impression

980
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,375
Robert Mueller has a problem

981
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,911
When Robert Mueller does not have

982
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,679
Have a problem

983
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:05,567
This is going to lead to Fox News conspiracy talk

984
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,615
Specifically gave him that waiver

985
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
As a way to

986
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,175
To undermine his credibility

987
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:15,039
The refusal to explain why

988
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:22,719
Admit abilities because

989
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,255
Mueller worked at wilmerhale

990
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
Manafort

991
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
Kushner

992
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,887
ORD sessions

993
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,679
CNN report

994
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,495
Wilmerhale Mueller works very briefly

995
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,543
For a company involved in a nuclear energy project

996
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,823
Champion by Michael Flynn

997
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,359
The retired defense

998
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,127
Intelligence

999
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:45,759
I want to serve for as trumps National Security advisor

1000
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,319
It's unclear whether the 17

1001
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,343
Waiver

1002
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,391
From schools covers

1003
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,183
Terrible sentence

1004
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:58,047
What was reported to be less than an hour's work Mueller Bill to The Firm

1005
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,863
Towers work

1006
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,423
There's a company that was involved with Michael Flynn

1007
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,727
Could present a conflict of interest

1008
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,263
Under the wrong Circle

1009
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,055
So

1010
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:14,431
I don't know I'm more inclined to believe it's something like that then something along the lines of

1011
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,223
He was in bed with Russia ever gave him

1012
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,271
That

1013
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,551
That's it

1014
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:24,415
Ethics waiver to be throwing around so much of the Republican argument

1015
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,183
About

1016
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,743
FBI investigation

1017
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,023
Boils down to

1018
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,815
I know you are but what am I

1019
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,887
Right like there's just repeating that over and over and over again

1020
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
Yeah yeah yeah

1021
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
SMS

1022
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,263
Well I think there's a lot of fun

1023
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,567
You can have with uncertainties

1024
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,335
I'd life

1025
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,615
You know I

1026
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:46,431
Because no one knows

1027
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,479
What the waiver is for

1028
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,551
Alex has been free to say whatever

1029
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,111
I'm also there's an article

1030
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,647
Some articles that came out

1031
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,207
Newsweek

1032
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,511
That was last month

1033
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:01,791
Trying to pull up

1034
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,583
This report I don't know I don't know

1035
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
Nevermind

1036
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,751
I don't want a response

1037
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:15,615
Probably throw something out there let's move along

1038
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,663
Alex Jones

1039
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
Eid idea

1040
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,343
I know you are but what am I getting paid

1041
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
Here we go

1042
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,255
Supporters donated 700,000

1043
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,191
Over a year ago don't we broke again 2 weeks ago

1044
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,519
Can come out all these women had been paid off

1045
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:56,831
Infowars.com

1046
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,879
Infowars.com

1047
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,535
Everywhere else it's only you

1048
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,095
Only you can stop

1049
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,863
Forest fire

1050
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:14,495
Another

1051
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,799
Those links

1052
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
Haven't been a very

1053
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,431
I think it's possible that Alex Jones

1054
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,711
Can't pay for

1055
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Advertise

1056
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:32,415
Did you guys this

1057
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,071
Valley City weather

1058
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:44,703
Hillary and New York Times

1059
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,751
Roberts to knots

1060
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,775
Pacifica

1061
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:51,615
About women making accusations

1062
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,151
Like I'm definitely sure

1063
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,943
Down to this hill article

1064
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,015
He says the Clinton supporters gave $700,000

1065
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:02,367
And when you really get down to it what it is

1066
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,647
Who gave a bunch of money

1067
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,671
There's David Brock

1068
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:07,231
Gave $200,000

1069
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,303
Then fashion entrepreneur

1070
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
Buell

1071
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,863
500 South

1072
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,935
Now Alex Jones is not read this article

1073
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:18,239
Because immediately after this

1074
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,287
Immediately after this breakdown

1075
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,055
It says

1076
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:25,919
The effort did not result in any women coming forward according to the time

1077
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:31,039
Bloom at Lisa Bloom

1078
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,575
Is $2000000 for her story

1079
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,367
Assumption was unwilling to offer

1080
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:40,767
She wasn't trying to be this woman

1081
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:46,143
So Democratic donors familiar with blooms efforts a tableau for the 200,000

1082
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,423
From the American

1083
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,495
Refunded the $500,000 from Buhl

1084
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,799
Some 500,000

1085
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,823
Back

1086
00:58:54,591 --> 00:59:00,223
So any statement bloom tonight at the Hillary Clinton campaign had any knowledge of her efforts or that she collaborated with

1087
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,503
Devon energy

1088
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,831
She also denied the payments were needed before the women would come

1089
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
Come forward

1090
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:08,671
Quote it doesn't cost anything to publicly are allegations

1091
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,487
Security relocation are expensive

1092
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,535
We're sorely needed in the case of this magnitude

1093
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,839
In a country filled with so much anger hate

1094
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
Violence

1095
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,911
So yeah you know there's

1096
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,959
There is a lot to say about

1097
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:22,239
Trump supporters

1098
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Being told

1099
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,799
That these women are liars and they're getting

1100
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Pay it off

1101
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,383
And then they know where they are and they know their name

1102
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,943
Republican all the sudden you ever wrestle

1103
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
Deathreats

1104
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,015
Absolutely

1105
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,807
Ultimately

1106
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:39,135
Murder and rape threats

1107
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:43,231
Yeah online bill good

1108
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,255
4

1109
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,279
Writing about

1110
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,375
Ultimate irony

1111
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,679
Scroll down a little bit further in this article in the hill

1112
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,727
Right-wing activist Mike cernovich

1113
00:59:53,983 --> 01:00:00,127
The times noted

1114
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,807
Michigan

1115
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,111
He could have just

1116
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:17,535
Go to just done that new year

1117
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,631
So I mean if you want to go down that road

1118
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,911
You see it in in

1119
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,215
The details of that article is that

1120
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,775
First of all the $2000000 thing was

1121
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,055
Some person

1122
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,127
But that's their price

1123
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,663
500000

1124
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,455
Return

1125
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,479
Beer

1126
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,759
Money not

1127
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,319
Leading to anyone coming forward

1128
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,903
And even Lisa Bloom has gone on record to say we do

1129
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,207
Support

1130
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,511
The money isn't needed to bring about allegations

1131
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,279
Ford protect

1132
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,583
People who have made allegations

1133
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,911
Completely accurate and then Mike cernovich also

1134
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:55,935
Gives out money

1135
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,751
I know you are

1136
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
Something like that

1137
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,311
Something like that

1138
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,127
So this point we're going to get in

1139
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,663
2 we're not calling

1140
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:13,087
20 team can start with the resurrection of call Larry Nichols not happy about that

1141
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,671
To show what we end up getting into the

1142
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
8 minutes

1143
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,743
Vijaya just split up into

1144
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,511
Pieces

1145
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,815
It goes all over

1146
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,375
With

1147
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,655
We get some good impression

1148
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,471
Any impression that there are

1149
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Istanbul

1150
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
Okay

1151
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:35,615
Bandits first one Alex I believe it was like a month or so ago the show Alex is really

1152
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,943
Bought it about how people kept saying

1153
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,991
He was attacking the gay folks

1154
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,807
Because he says the people want to have sex with cars

1155
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:50,207
He's very mad about that

1156
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,791
I got to defend himself but that can't go well

1157
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
Accidentally

1158
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:58,655
Morkie weigh

1159
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,447
Might have accidentally done that

1160
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,695
No type

1161
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,399
Washington Street

1162
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
I saw the article

1163
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,151
This is social engineering

1164
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,455
And all this other stuff

1165
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:48,575
To the LGBT agenda whatever you want to say and it's agenda

1166
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:52,671
Problem the problem

1167
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:56,255
No I never said

1168
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,583
I just said that the lgbtq wants

1169
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,143
Will know cuz he

1170
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:07,263
He's being even dicier than that pick that piece apart

1171
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,311
Cuz what you saying is first of all

1172
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,335
There's a

1173
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,639
Secondarily

1174
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:16,991
Now I guess because of these Democratic controllers that he goes and hangs out with

1175
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,319
Co-opted

1176
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:26,719
The gay agenda to include f****** cars and that's

1177
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,255
Brendan so put in the process of

1178
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:32,095
Talking the ends up saying that no that is kind of what it is now

1179
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:35,167
What are you doing

1180
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,519
Alex tries to defend himself

1181
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:45,919
And in the process of talking does the opposite that's a blanket statement for just about anything Alex

1182
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,479
Headstone

1183
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,575
You going to accidentally The Condemned himself from the grave somehow I'm sure

1184
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,159
I'm so in this next clip we get to

1185
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:04,095
I'm not the one by Jocelyn Elders before

1186
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:11,775
Surgeon General operations

1187
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,455
Will

1188
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,223
They don't

1189
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,295
Helpful

1190
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,695
Controversy that you are entirely misrepresenting

1191
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:35,583
But here's today little transgender shop

1192
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,119
Generals for little girls

1193
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,167
Do you know why they do that

1194
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,263
Do you know why they offer fake genitals or transgender

1195
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
People

1196
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,335
I assume

1197
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,871
So I know I do

1198
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:51,455
I have a bunch of possibilities but I don't know the

1199
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,223
The actual

1200
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,271
Understanding

1201
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,295
The feeling of having

1202
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,111
The

1203
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:03,487
Believe so you feel like you're going to feel like you're more comfortable in your own body

1204
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,303
Exactly I don't think that's

1205
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,583
Necessarily

1206
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,863
Sexualization

1207
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
Don't think that's necessarily

1208
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,167
Some sort of perverse

1209
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,447
But Alex

1210
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,263
Pretty sure they're not giving you strap on

1211
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:22,687
I would guess they're giving you it's like a it's like a pregnancy

1212
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,479
Flashlight

1213
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,783
Back in the day

1214
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,903
Not worth it

1215
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:38,559
Westlake has a line of like a bunch of

1216
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
You know yet

1217
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,351
Vagina

1218
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,119
Mild

1219
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,167
And what have you

1220
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:47,519
Olympia or something like that

1221
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
Salad

1222
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,847
And from my understanding I didn't understand

1223
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:51,871
Explain it to me

1224
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,919
It's something to be worn sort of

1225
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,687
Externally

1226
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
That's how people

1227
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,991
Experience

1228
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,015
Physical sensation

1229
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,039
Wait

1230
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,319
Never there

1231
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,135
I don't understand it fully but that

1232
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:03,903
The explanation

1233
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,671
I've gotten four

1234
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,439
People

1235
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,743
Ask about it and that satisfies all

1236
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,279
Alex

1237
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,679
Anything with genitals bad

1238
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,751
Patient

1239
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,223
I got

1240
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,343
Do you have been turned into a

1241
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:11,999
I don't care about the story I don't particularly care about the story that seems like a

1242
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:18,399
There was one person in England who had male genitalia

1243
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,215
I think that's what he's saying

1244
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:21,983
I guess

1245
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,007
I don't

1246
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:29,407
I don't really I think that's a local issue

1247
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:32,223
London Hospital

1248
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,039
Right so anyway y'all politics

1249
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,159
More nonsense it doesn't matter

1250
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,951
The real question is

1251
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,231
Do you have a thorn in your

1252
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:51,935
And I do have a thorn in my phone

1253
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,127
Straight up

1254
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,223
A little bit of

1255
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
Conversation

1256
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,551
Can be had in terms of what you think it is

1257
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,599
Appropriate what age

1258
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,903
It is appropriate to

1259
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,207
Have conversation

1260
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:14,975
Children

1261
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:18,815
I don't know I don't have any kids I'm not

1262
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,351
I'm not super well-versed

1263
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:23,167
In that and I don't think that there's a hard-and-fast line

1264
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,727
So it is a little bit more of Murphy

1265
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,495
Do territory

1266
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,919
Institution

1267
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,263
California get arrested for

1268
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
So

1269
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,087
Again

1270
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,879
Crazy screaming man

1271
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,183
Pointing the finger

1272
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,487
I'm not particularly about being out of

1273
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,279
I'm not particularly interested in

1274
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,303
Rehashing

1275
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:26,911
Tavistock Institute versus Tavistock

1276
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,703
Confusion that we've gone over in the past

1277
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,311
You can't say brother

1278
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:37,151
In the world

1279
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,735
Once it once again we get back to

1280
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,807
You can look into this

1281
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:51,743
In the right-wing blogosphere

1282
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:55,071
Discrimination of lgbtq

1283
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,607
Seniors at California's long

1284
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,191
Is one step from becoming a pastor

1285
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,751
On Governor Jerry Brown

1286
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,311
The measure known as the lgbtq

1287
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,847
Senior Bill of Rights

1288
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:07,615
Senate bill

1289
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,407
Wood banister hoodies from

1290
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
Denying admission

1291
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,967
Transferring a resident

1292
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,759
On the basis of their sexual orientation

1293
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,807
Gender gender identity gender expression

1294
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
Or HIV

1295
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:17,855
That sounds

1296
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
Pretty great

1297
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,415
Yeah it's I think it's

1298
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,695
Probably important

1299
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,767
Those are those are good reasons

1300
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,839
Deny someone care or to arbitrarily

1301
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,607
You fix them

1302
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:32,191
So the issue is a lot of these right-wing groups

1303
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:34,495
Alex among them say that

1304
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,799
You if you just call someone by the wrong

1305
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,847
Then they're going to erect

1306
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:43,711
Cuz the bill at it does have I think $1,000 fine

1307
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
It's possible

1308
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,759
Or up to you

1309
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:46,783
County Jail

1310
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:49,855
What do you mean

1311
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,159
I mean for for calling somebody the wrong gender

1312
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,743
Courtney Joslin

1313
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,279
Heather said the bar for criminal proper

1314
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,071
Locution regarding this bill would be

1315
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
Extremely high

1316
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,911
Quote the bill is very very clear that

1317
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:05,215
If it is the willful engagement

1318
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,751
And repeated engagement

1319
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,031
Indiscriminate

1320
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:08,799
Contacts

1321
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
Against LG

1322
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:14,943
So if someone makes a mistake or doesn't know a person's gender identity is

1323
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,991
And use the incorrect pronoun that

1324
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,271
He's not a violation

1325
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,295
Statute

1326
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,111
Willful and repeated violations alone

1327
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,415
I wouldn't lead to criminal prosecution jobs

1328
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,719
They would likely be punished with a

1329
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,535
Criminal charges would only follow she said

1330
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,839
If a violation reached a level that was shown to

1331
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,863
Because the risk

1332
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,655
Death or serious physical harm

1333
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,423
In accordance

1334
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,215
Existing penalty structure

1335
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,263
Health and safety code violations

1336
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,031
Long-term

1337
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,895
The person who pushed through the Bell who is writing

1338
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:50,015
Hesed purposely using the wrong pronoun

1339
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
Smoking ban

1340
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,831
He'll be treated as a minor violation

1341
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,855
But no one is going

1342
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,415
So

1343
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,975
Hey

1344
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,511
Bright

1345
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:04,607
Supposed to somebody who'd be committing a crime like

1346
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,399
If you were to go up

1347
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
To somebody

1348
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:11,519
Cupcake cupcake for a long. Of time even after you

1349
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:15,359
Right right

1350
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,127
Is what it is

1351
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:22,783
Harassment or exclusion or differential care of things are really what the bill is

1352
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,343
What's 6

1353
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,647
To address

1354
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,487
We might have had the little

1355
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,767
Technical snafu

1356
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,047
Not entirely sure I hope this is

1357
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,327
Still going out there but

1358
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:40,191
8 Minute clip

1359
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,519
Alex ranting about a lot

1360
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:44,799
Sex

1361
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,615
Course I would say

1362
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,431
So we get to this next

1363
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,455
Clip

1364
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,479
Where Alex

1365
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,295
Like we said

1366
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,599
We've already dressed on a recent show

1367
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,415
Alex

1368
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,719
Understand that I believe was in the sixties

1369
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,743
Tavistock

1370
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,767
Students have stock

1371
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,583
Completely dissociated

1372
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,447
Just believe that they the same thing because he sees the name Tavistock

1373
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
And

1374
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,263
I was

1375
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:18,335
Really interested to hear this next but I cut out nothing

1376
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,919
This is all just straight talk

1377
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,711
Stickman team

1378
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,247
Next

1379
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,551
Surprising

1380
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,111
Explains where he's based

1381
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,903
A lot of these ideas

1382
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
Not good

1383
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,327
Psychologist or psychiatrist

1384
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:43,935
I had dinner with a former psychiatrist that work for the state department

1385
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:49,055
20 years ago Minnesota

1386
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,591
You want me to make the station on

1387
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,639
The guy

1388
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:56,991
Very intelligent very smart guy and I looked it up he was famous

1389
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,271
So

1390
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,551
Here's what we have

1391
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,831
We got Ted Anderson

1392
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:07,999
Old Time by Ron Paul libertarian

1393
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:14,911
Midas resources operative

1394
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,447
As it were

1395
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,519
Alex Jones

1396
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:25,919
Obscurity probably around this time

1397
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,943
He's going to Minnesota

1398
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,991
Might be one of the early meeting

1399
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,551
Anderson

1400
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,575
Still I the lights

1401
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:34,879
Justin Trudeau

1402
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,439
But

1403
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,463
This guy

1404
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,767
Psychiatrist

1405
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,047
Psychologist of some sort

1406
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,071
Without

1407
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,095
A radio station

1408
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,119
Mission of some sort

1409
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,655
And is also famous

1410
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:51,519
I think the details

1411
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,799
I don't think so cuz I

1412
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,383
I'm not sure the person's real I have no idea

1413
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:00,991
I've heard a lot of famous psychiatrist go into buying radio

1414
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,039
Celebrity

1415
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,343
That's but that's one of the lay of the land

1416
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:09,695
The context is important this is probably when Alex is nobody

1417
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,743
And

1418
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:19,679
He just said Alex just start research want to go to the kids because I can't tell you but he goes he started cussing

1419
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:25,311
In the families confuse everything good teaching

1420
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,503
Convenient

1421
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,623
It's a couple thing

1422
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
First

1423
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
Blah blah blah

1424
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,559
Hear that

1425
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,351
I already knew about

1426
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,911
You didn't and

1427
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:51,935
It about

1428
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,983
20 seconds in this clip he's going to say

1429
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:59,615
That was way too far out for me

1430
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:01,663
The other the other piece of this is like

1431
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,223
Why wouldn't you ever have him on your

1432
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,551
This is a guy who's telling you

1433
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,903
I don't understand why you wouldn't have never heard him mention

1434
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,231
I would say either he doesn't

1435
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,559
That's a strong possibility

1436
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,607
Patchwork of

1437
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,167
Angelica

1438
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,727
Or the other part of that was

1439
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:28,031
If he was just starting a show back then

1440
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,567
He wasn't talking about this

1441
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,151
Different

1442
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:33,919
Insane Bolt

1443
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:37,503
But also I could just be one of those persons drink

1444
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,159
Wants to talk to you

1445
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,303
Bachata station

1446
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:51,583
Is that

1447
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,471
I forget that.

1448
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,055
But he wasn't all that Shannon

1449
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,663
And this is a little extreme for me

1450
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,735
He's already

1451
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,791
So.

1452
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:24,351
Female nurse for cervical smear

1453
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:31,007
Children are preparing

1454
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,799
For sex changes

1455
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:43,295
What's this

1456
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:46,111
In the sixties.

1457
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,903
It also shows that audiences

1458
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,463
They can't tell the difference

1459
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:56,863
So I don't know what to wear to land on that but if its 19 years ago

1460
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,631
Sumo's about

1461
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,935
B99 ourselves somewhere in that

1462
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,751
Did fairly in the

1463
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,567
I don't know I need to work out a more

1464
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,591
Specific Alex Jones

1465
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,383
Timeline but I think that's probably

1466
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,663
Pretty clothes to wear

1467
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,431
Do you know this week

1468
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:13,247
Sweet spot is coming out of

1469
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,039
Set TV

1470
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,063
Getting fired

1471
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,087
From his radio gig

1472
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,903
But I don't know whether that's an interesting

1473
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,439
Something to play

1474
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,071
Oh no

1475
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:31,167
So what was going on

1476
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,471
Well I look

1477
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,031
Too much to my

1478
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
Other parcel

1479
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:42,943
So earlier the show we had that Alec bring up what was

1480
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,735
I told you was going to be a big narrative

1481
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,551
For the show that was the idea that

1482
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,343
That is nautical

1483
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,879
About parents buying

1484
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,951
Yes

1485
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:56,255
How in the middle of this

1486
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,071
Minute clip 8 Minute rant

1487
01:18:59,327 --> 01:18:59,839
Alex Jones

1488
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,143
Decides to put his own narrative

1489
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,423
And make it far worse

1490
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:13,919
Call someone

1491
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:20,575
Bamboo Beyond debates about sex education in public schools which is really about

1492
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:24,927
Cold reading a Daily Caller article

1493
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:25,695
Cupboard

1494
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:29,279
Great covering the article

1495
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,047
Metro

1496
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:42,847
Alan Scott

1497
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,559
That does not follow

1498
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,447
It shows images of children

1499
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:19,968
Show all of this

1500
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,272
At this point

1501
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:25,088
Alex Jones has the document camera

1502
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:27,136
And he's hoping the article

1503
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:33,536
Haha shots of all the pictures in this article that Alex's

1504
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,584
Pornographic

1505
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,448
We are going to show those on the document cam

1506
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:49,152
Contacts they're certainly not

1507
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,944
Little kids playing

1508
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:51,968
ShopRite

1509
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,808
This is sick

1510
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:58,624
It showed little girls panties

1511
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,416
What's a donor

1512
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,464
The Dead

1513
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,816
Sexualized

1514
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,400
This is 40

1515
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,960
Pedophilia p*** masturbating in public

1516
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:16,032
Publishers pedophilia

1517
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,200
They just pulled it

1518
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:26,016
Snopes

1519
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,808
Screenshots of it all

1520
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,088
Sorry

1521
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,160
So at that point I went to Infowars

1522
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:34,976
What about the rest of the day to find their right

1523
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:41,632
You got to have this up there they've got to make sure that

1524
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:45,728
Throw this in Snopes Facebook

1525
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:51,104
So I went and I I like I said I went and I got the screenshots of Alex's

1526
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:53,920
Paper

1527
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:54,944
But he has the Arctic

1528
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,832
He flips through it

1529
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,856
And

1530
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:05,696
Will show hear the the pictures I text them to you so you can

1531
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:10,304
You can see that this first one here is of underwear

1532
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,840
Yeah that is

1533
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:13,888
Whatever

1534
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,728
Johnny got me talk

1535
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,776
As far as what I can

1536
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,056
Can read on here

1537
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,616
Girls in particular are less likely

1538
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,384
Play them boys 2

1539
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,456
Pizza Ranch

1540
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,272
Where is Boise

1541
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,320
Chewy what I say

1542
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,368
Think we're seeing here is

1543
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:38,208
I would say probably women a woman

1544
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:38,976
Who is

1545
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,280
Uncertain and coming to

1546
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,560
To terms with her sexuality

1547
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:45,632
It's like your first. That kind of

1548
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,400
It's like

1549
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:49,472
This is gross I don't know what's going on here that Kai

1550
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:52,288
Right there might even be a taken it because

1551
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,568
You could die

1552
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,152
You could you could see that as being an

1553
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:57,920
Play on

1554
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:01,248
The next one here is just a bunch of dildos

1555
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:04,832
It's just an art display of a bunch of dildos and what have you there

1556
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:07,648
Nothing involving children

1557
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,928
There's nothing

1558
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:15,840
Inherently dildos

1559
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:19,936
Weird about it is all of the dildos look like

1560
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:24,288
This is Britain it looks like they're giving the twos up so it has

1561
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:27,872
It's like the Builder Israelites f*** you alright

1562
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,664
I'm liking this

1563
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,760
So the next one is the only one that I think that Alex Jones might have

1564
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,320
Little bit of a decent argument on

1565
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,344
In the sense that it is on

1566
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,112
Settling

1567
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,928
I'm so it means spoilers watching the videos

1568
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:41,952
Little bit

1569
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,232
Settling but at the same time

1570
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,536
What is depicting is

1571
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,560
Something the kids

1572
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:54,496
Playing around with each other I don't know the value of having it in a Metro article necessarily but it's not

1573
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,032
I don't think of this picture is

1574
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:56,800
Pornographic

1575
01:23:57,056 --> 01:24:02,176
No necessarily

1576
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:02,944
It is

1577
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:09,856
But at the same time mainly because of the Infowars logo at the bottom right

1578
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,904
Coors logo is weird

1579
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,928
Especially since

1580
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,768
They're the one showing it with the Infowars thing on the bottom right

1581
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
Check this

1582
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,328
Right

1583
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:25,728
Written in the article from what you can tell because by the time Alex was on air

1584
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,752
Retro

1585
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:32,384
So I wasn't able to find anybody who would reposted it

1586
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,688
But what you can tell from those green cap

1587
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,480
Is that the article is talking

1588
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,248
About

1589
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:39,296
Child

1590
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,576
Be helpful to them

1591
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,856
Especially for women

1592
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,392
It is much as

1593
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,928
It's a female author

1594
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:48,256
She's talking about herself and her friends would use like brushes

1595
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:50,560
Retrofit unsanitary

1596
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,608
Exploring their own sexuality

1597
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
And that is all

1598
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,680
Ultimately

1599
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,240
If you f****** pillowman

1600
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:01,312
Healthy option

1601
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:04,896
Spell I would say that picture that last one is bit unsettling

1602
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:07,200
They're like like I said

1603
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,784
It's in line with the artist

1604
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,320
Style of a lot of

1605
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:16,672
The doctor will have you played

1606
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:22,816
It is like one of those sex-ed books where it shows very

1607
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,840
The people like

1608
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,120
And it's just like

1609
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:29,472
Other articles in the Metro there is that same sort of Art

1610
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,520
Textile

1611
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:33,568
Cartoony version

1612
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:38,944
There's another article that I sounded like what things were found in vaginas in 2017

1613
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,224
And the picture of a woman

1614
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
Got with him

1615
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,784
Recovering

1616
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,320
So I would argue

1617
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,600
Possibly

1618
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:51,232
The article or the picture that they put on The Daily Caller article which all-flash up now is more upsetting

1619
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:54,304
I would say that they are upset

1620
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:59,168
Wow I don't know why but I am more unsettled by that

1621
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,264
Just a hair

1622
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:09,408
So I don't know what it is it goes from the audio listeners

1623
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:14,272
It goes from a very simple depiction of cartoony

1624
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:23,744
Permanent playing with each other's genitals or grabbing

1625
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:26,816
Clearly

1626
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:35,008
Bright The Daily Caller article has a three-year-old

1627
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:40,640
I don't know I want to say this way cuz I think

1628
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,664
I think this game

1629
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,688
You can be kind of fun

1630
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,736
I don't know

1631
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,272
Alex should have gone further

1632
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,296
Like

1633
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:49,600
I don't understand why he didn't go ahead and

1634
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,880
Just look into what else

1635
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,160
This lady has written

1636
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,488
Cuz I found Alan Scott entire biography on

1637
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:58,048
On their Metro here's another article

1638
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,400
Mom makes fun of her model brother by getting toddler to recreate his poses

1639
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,936
Do you scroll down here

1640
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,216
I've got a toddler

1641
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:06,752
Pretending to be a model

1642
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:09,568
How is this not sexualizing a child

1643
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:15,968
We could have made hay out of this Alex

1644
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,528
I don't know what I'm getting at is

1645
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,112
Could have tried harder to make his dump

1646
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,904
It took manufacturer

1647
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:28,000
I believe so I believe a little bit

1648
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:30,560
And the tragedy of it is that

1649
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,328
The

1650
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,632
Issue that the lady does bring up

1651
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,168
The article is real

1652
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,960
And you can tell from the text

1653
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:41,568
Survive screenshot

1654
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,616
Whether it be about the shame

1655
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:50,016
The children experience around their sexuality and have crippling that can be moving forward

1656
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,320
Going to stop your children from exploring

1657
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:56,160
By not having any conversations or

1658
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:59,232
That you can offer to them last

1659
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:05,632
You're making a dude and you're living in a certain denial of the idea that your children will ever have a sexual life existence

1660
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:12,032
But I was growing up my parents were like look at all this

1661
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:12,800
There is

1662
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:15,104
You're going to hell if you

1663
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,152
Absolutely like that's the biggest issue

1664
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:20,480
That's what they're that's what they're ruining sex with

1665
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,272
You're going to hell

1666
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,296
Break so

1667
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,832
Of course you're going to f***

1668
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,976
We get the end of the eight-minute ramp

1669
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:34,560
At this point you sort of

1670
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,584
B from

1671
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,376
An article

1672
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:39,680
But he disagrees with and wants to

1673
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:43,776
He wants to talk about but not really that bad into being a man

1674
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:50,688
We couldn't find our page but it's working on it

1675
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:54,272
He's talking about the 404 not found page there's a bear riding

1676
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,040
Skateboard on

1677
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:06,560
Candy

1678
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:21,920
Tomorrow

1679
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,992
The nightmare is upon us

1680
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,552
Call

1681
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:32,672
I promise I promise I promise I promise

1682
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:39,584
Covered covered all that all the time

1683
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,376
Has been pretending

1684
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,104
Ladies and gentlemen

1685
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:03,648
And they're just going to push it

1686
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,352
We need

1687
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:31,552
Vitamins and minerals and supplements and the real red pill

1688
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,648
It was all

1689
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:40,000
Aledo Tire 8 minutes

1690
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,304
Scaring people

1691
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:45,120
About how they're going to try and children

1692
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:45,888
All of the

1693
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,680
What's all of the transbay

1694
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:52,288
All of the idea that he's not gay people because he thinks that

1695
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:56,128
The gay agenda

1696
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,408
All of it

1697
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:00,224
All of it was to lead to I need your money

1698
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,016
F***** up

1699
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:08,160
Real f*****-up is the way that he sells super male Vitality as we remember is like

1700
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:11,488
Bright kids listen to his show

1701
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,280
Do we have heard at least like

1702
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:16,096
A fourteen-year-old call in a twelve-year-old call Ann

1703
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:19,168
I made it would it would be right in that that age

1704
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,960
Wheelhouse

1705
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,008
I would like to be older

1706
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:26,080
I'd like to be more manly that sort of adolescent

1707
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,360
Yeah

1708
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:32,480
Hello so and talk more about that Metro article I really want to talk

1709
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,248
Talk more about it

1710
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:35,296
Quite frankly

1711
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:42,208
I want to see the biggest

1712
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:42,976
Paper

1713
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,024
England

1714
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:48,096
The song even a little bit number to the Daily

1715
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:52,960
Metro's number 327

1716
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:56,032
At least that their readership is at least

1717
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,568
3000

1718
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:02,688
So the guardian probably be

1719
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,712
Higher two if they

1720
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:05,760
You know what I'm saying

1721
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:10,112
Is the guardian even a printed paper the

1722
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:10,880
The Guardians

1723
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:13,184
Distribution Mercer chelation

1724
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,976
Imprint is only 100

1725
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,256
56000

1726
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,536
2017

1727
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,304
Guardian

1728
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:21,376
So know nothing about those

1729
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,168
Right wing

1730
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:25,984
Things that always go viral

1731
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,008
Conservative blog

1732
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,288
Is it always just like

1733
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,056
One person

1734
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,360
Who's just was just talking

1735
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:34,176
Just balling ideas Indigo Wild

1736
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:37,248
Like and it's always just a random ass dumb thing

1737
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:38,784
Furiated

1738
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:45,184
Which is not to say that it doesn't happen on the left like the outdoors be outraged machine is terrifically stupid

1739
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,720
The bipartisan

1740
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:50,304
But I think you have a situation where

1741
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:55,680
Those people who are in the business

1742
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,448
To making those

1743
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,216
Claims

1744
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,264
And then they just sort of snowball.

1745
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:04,128
Downhill you'll have like a crnkovich come out with a narrative that my little roll downhill Alex

1746
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,664
Is usually the second

1747
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,712
She doesn't make a whole lot of his own

1748
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,016
Breitbart Drudge

1749
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:12,576
Incredibly

1750
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,672
A lab

1751
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,208
All that s***

1752
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:20,256
Alex

1753
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:22,048
Explains that

1754
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
He's always been

1755
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,400
Steelers news

1756
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,704
Alex

1757
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:47,136
It'll destroy the country but we're going to stop it

1758
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:49,184
And that

1759
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:58,656
Right

1760
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:03,776
No one even wants to come out because it wouldn't even deeper deeper

1761
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:07,104
Aberdeen

1762
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,152
If you know why I think you did

1763
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:11,712
Cuz I think there's a part of his brain glitching

1764
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,504
You realize that

1765
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:17,600
You know what anybody who's the thinking person would realize that the

1766
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:20,928
Exact same argument I'm making could be used on me

1767
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:24,768
Orrefors farias accusations of pedophilia ring

1768
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,560
Good so serious

1769
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,352
That you don't want to not take it

1770
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:29,888
Or something like that

1771
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,680
The exact same argument

1772
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,704
Works

1773
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:36,288
Cuz it's definitely one of those things where

1774
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:40,128
Also Alex Alex's clearly started to go to like Reddit

1775
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:46,016
Before the storm show moderators

1776
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:46,784
From

1777
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,320
Now that

1778
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:50,112
It's f****** the gold

1779
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,904
Call my friend

1780
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,720
It was less interesting than you think but it was like

1781
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:57,792
Rob do what are you

1782
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:58,560
You doing

1783
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,096
What do you rob doing

1784
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,632
It was a it was

1785
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:07,008
The reason that it

1786
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,032
Ception

1787
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:08,800
Ineffective

1788
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:11,616
The claims of a pedophile ring

1789
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:12,640
Is because

1790
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:14,688
Nobody wants to be the one who

1791
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:15,456
Was wrong

1792
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,224
One time

1793
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,504
You know like

1794
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,808
This is a boy who cried wolf situation

1795
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,856
But it's so serious

1796
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,904
Nobody wants to be the guy who's like

1797
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,440
Yes you were wrong

1798
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,976
300 million time

1799
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,512
The time you were right

1800
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,792
And I didn't act

1801
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:32,352
Part about that kind

1802
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,144
Is that it

1803
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,424
It's such b*******

1804
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,472
Except for the one time it's not and you're like

1805
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,496
Well

1806
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,032
We should have f****** done something

1807
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:42,592
We should have listened to you

1808
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:51,296
I think you said something about Barron Trump Maybe

1809
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:53,344
Is making up

1810
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,136
Should not have said on the radio

1811
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,328
What

1812
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:10,752
Cub

1813
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,688
So all right

1814
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,224
First of all

1815
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,992
Alex

1816
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:26,112
Putting business on the street and had autism but got over it

1817
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,256
Autism experts

1818
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:37,120
I don't want to talk about that because

1819
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:40,448
It gets into like area where we might be clowning on a kid

1820
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,984
Or something like that and I don't like

1821
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,520
I don't like that at all

1822
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:46,592
Alex is understanding of medicine and

1823
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:51,200
Is flawed but his understanding of trump is also flawed

1824
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:52,480
Cuz at the end

1825
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:54,784
The truck does not want to run Eugenics operate

1826
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,576

Of human development

1832

Superior people and that if you put together

1833
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:34,720
Superior woman and a superior man you get a superior Offspring you have to have the right there

1835
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:53,920
Like the fact is you have to be born and blessed with something up here

1836
01:37:54,176 --> 01:38:00,320
It's not myself

1837
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:06,720

Maybe

1840
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:25,920
Maybe it's just something you have you know you have the winning Gene Franklin be wonderful if you could develop it but

1841
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:32,064
I'm not so sure you can

1842
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:34,368
I'm glad to have that drink blood

Guess what

Demons are

Determinate

1848
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,704
In something

Entire life

1863

F****** stupid

1864
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,320
It's always those guys

1865

Who say like I have great genes

1866
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,648

I'm smart because of my jeans

1868
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,976
It's always like you look back

1869
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,536
You are born rich

1870
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:50,656
It does seem that there's a lot of overlap

1871
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:53,728
Justify being born rich as not having any

1872
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:58,336
It's not a toy

1873
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:02,688
Exactly. The last generation 2

1874
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:07,040
Why I was born ready

1875
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:08,576
So don't matter you're stupid

1876
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,952

01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,544
Allergy

1879
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:31,104
If it's next clip Alex

1880
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,896
The long-time stocks

1881
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:38,016
To do very convoluted plan

1882
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,064
And it gets more convoluted

1883
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,368
Describes

1884
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,648
What key

1885
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:44,672
Call

1886
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:54,656
Who's the triple cross

1887
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,664
Great plan triple cross

1888
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:11,040
Global of Solitaire competition

1889
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,832
Perspective

1890
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,624
IQ

1891
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,696
White

1892
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,304
Nurture not just the nature

1893
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,216
Because

1894
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:33,312
IQ tests are culturally biased on this for years

1895
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:47,136
Control

1896
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:54,048
Inelastic

1897
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:58,144
Even faster

1898
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:08,128
Machines

1899
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,880
Triple cross

1900
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:22,976
God

1901
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,584
Really appreciate you

1902
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,120
Subscribing

1903
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:33,216
The thing that he said they're ten seconds before the end of the clip

1904
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:35,520
Was I read the writing

1905
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:39,104
Thinly veiled and what that means is

1906
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:44,224
Believes that all these things that sting are actually saying something entirely different

1907
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,552
Which is why I can go read the primary sources

1908
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:50,880
And understand what they're saying within the context that they're saying them

1909
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:52,160
But he's going to say

1910
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:58,560
Do know what they're actually saying it something entirely different because of my weird paranoid worldview of this

1911
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,352
Lacrosse

1912
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:05,472
He thinks they're double-crossing you

1913
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:08,544
And you think they're triple Crossing him

1914
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:09,824
Bye

1915
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:10,848
Not

1916
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,128
Finley bailing there are

1917
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:18,784
I don't f****** know what this point that include the triple cross

1918
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,344
I don't even know where the

1919
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,160
It feels like what he just described though was like

1920
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:26,976
Bad planning

1921
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:30,048
Here's the cross

1922
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,608
Okay we're trying

1923
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:37,216
People were trying to dumb down know we can put fluoride that's foreplay

1924
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:45,408
I have to be part of the first cross does a double cross

1925
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,688
Telling

1926
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:53,088
White people in the west that were screwing over the third world

1927
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:59,488
Crossbow was they were trying to do that but they accidentally went to Joe

1928
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,256
Just the weather

1929
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:03,328
Cuz that was their enemy in the third world

1930
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,400
But what I mean an accident in the way that they

1931
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,424
Didn't realize that the

1932
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,448
The third world then

1933
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,216
Woodwright

1934
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:12,288
Triple cross everybody

1935
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,336
By lowering everybody equal

1936
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:15,360
Again

1937
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:17,664
Another that your bed planet

1938
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:23,808
Precipitously complicated in terms of like

1939
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,880
What Alex Jones six

1940
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:32,512
Skip this next wave cuz it's just a bunch of bulshit he said in the past about Islam spread

1941
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:37,632
And how I acted differently than other powers in the

1942
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,400
Wicked World

1943
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:50,176
The pope goes out until Christians if they accept Muslims

1944
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,456
Except Christians of their country

1945
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:55,040
Maybe because he's the head of the Catholic Church

1946
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:04,512
Is malice Trump baby

1947
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:09,632
Feels like we could just check that one off the list actually even then wouldn't you

1948
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:11,936
That's because that's a problem

1949
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,728
Like

1950
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:17,312
Nothing that's a big issue it right now is

1951
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,080
Weird

1952
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,384
Not letting them into our country

1953
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,176
Like I don't think I'd like

1954
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:24,992
I don't know what the immigration policy on Muslim country

1955
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:30,112
I think part of the immigration issue with Muslim countries is people

1956
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,416
I think it's almost

1957
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:34,976
Exclusively out

1958
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:38,560
I don't know I think I think you're going to see not a lot of

1959
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:40,096
People who are like

1960
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:44,960
Explore job opportunities in Nigeria right now

1961
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:47,520
I don't know they're not letting a lot of Christians in

1962
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:49,312
Christians are like

1963
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,104
I don't want to

1964
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,640
Live under a torturous

1965
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:55,712
Evil regime

1966
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:02,368
Don't think this is a good dude

1967
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,392
At the very least

1968
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,672
Badministrator

1969
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,464
Further point

1970
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,488
Is

1971
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,304
That the pope has a roll

1972
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:14,144
The rest of the world that isn't part of his

1973
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,168
Group

1974
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,192
What to do

1975
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:16,960
I think it's

1976
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:18,240
Outside of his purview

1977
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,776
Just a thought

1978
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,056
Just a thought

1979
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,848
Pisco perfect

1980
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,384
Absolutely

1981
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,664
So that bother me

1982
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:29,504
So a little bit later in the show Alex Jones

1983
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,808
On he brings in feet

1984
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:33,344
Traffic to talk about A-Rod

1985
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,392
And I believe that the situation that's

1986
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:37,440
Sunfolding it incredibly complicated

1987
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:39,744
Iran

1988
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:45,376
I don't have a full understanding of it I'll admit to that red a little bit on it but I don't really understand what's going on

1989
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,400
The way that Steve

1990
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:49,216
Check presented is that we got to support

1991
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:51,776
And Alex believe that

1992
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:56,896
And I don't understand

1993
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,176
Necessarily

1994
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,200
With the line is

1995
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,040
Steve and Alex both being against

1996
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:07,904
The Arab Spring and now be excessive being like this is good this one is good

1997
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:12,512
Well I don't know I don't understand it really ran as a

1998
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:16,864
Anime braniff you tied together Iran's government

1999
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,144
With the way that they

2000
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:22,752
Then you can go right back to Obama

2001
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:27,360
Like that's the ideas as far as what I understand what's going on my route

2002
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:29,152
Because of

2003
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,456
Really really bad mismanagement

2004
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:32,480
And Corruption

2005
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,528
Police brutality

2006
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,576
The people

2007
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,856
Start at a protest

2008
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:39,136
Hey this is

2009
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:39,904
Killing a song

2010
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:41,696
We need to not do this

2011
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,976
Not least of which because

2012
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:45,792
We're not getting paid very much cuz it's corruption

2013
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,072
Jet like that right

2014
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:50,656
And then as it grew it turned into more of like a

2015
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:56,800
Hey you know what really causes that corruption you know what's really going on there is the Islamic revolution of

2016
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:57,568
1970s

2017
01:47:57,824 --> 01:48:03,968
Maybe that didn't work out so well we got a lot of grievances with the Ayatollah himself and so it's kind of

2018
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:07,552
Expanded there a mass scale protest

2019
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:09,088
And of course

2020
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:11,648
When you have enough pillory tarian regime

2021
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:12,672
That is Steve

2022
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,696
Protest happen

2023
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:14,720
Did they listen

2024
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:15,488
To the protest

2025
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,024
I think it's a rare

2026
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,072
I'm not rare what they do

2027
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,096
Kill the Press

2028
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:24,704
Right

2029
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,240
Really understand it

2030
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,032
My inclination is

2031
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,056
David Steve

2032
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,336
Is kind of right

2033
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:31,360
But I don't know

2034
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:33,664
Cuz I don't know what the board like

2035
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:37,760
I don't know enough about even where he's coming from

2036
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:48,512
Exactly I don't know it's a super complicated Alex doesn't really get into it too much

2037
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:49,280
Because he doesn't

2038
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:54,144
Earlier about this

2039
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:56,192
Use of timeout

2040
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:56,960
Steve pieczenik

2041
01:48:57,216 --> 01:49:01,824
Sometime out because of the Vegas shooting

2042
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:04,128
At this point you needs to let that blow over

2043
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,432
And so it's not really a great interview

2044
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,224
I accept this little clip

2045
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,504
Where I at

2046
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,528
Steve pieczenik

2047
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:11,552
It's a little snippy

2048
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:13,088
Then that's something we always laugh

2049
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:20,256
Right now

2050
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,096
What

2051
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:26,656
North Korea

2052
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:29,728
What are you expecting to see where the things that are going on with Israel

2053
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:37,408
Reportedly

2054
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:57,888
Just got to love has got a lot of I don't give a fuk Steve Buck

2055
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:01,472
You think about McMath Alex's

2056
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:07,872
Argument there is the master who was poisoning Trump I believe the Diet Cokes

2057
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:10,432
Started allowing Infowars articles to get to

2058
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,968
The Trump so Alex is onboard

2059
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:15,040
Is now a globalist again

2060
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:15,808
Funding

2061
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:22,464
Isis in Syria because they still want to break up ice and Roberto she's going against the secret military

2062
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:26,816
Currently signed with Russia

2063
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:27,840
And

2064
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:30,400
Syria right Alex's believe

2065
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:36,800
I'm guessing is that his audience doesn't remember all the McMaster narratives that he's been slipping

2066
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:40,128
So he's now using him as a prop

2067
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:43,200
Remembers

2068
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:43,968
Bulshit

2069
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:47,552
That one didn't last very long

2070
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:49,088
What it is

2071
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:49,856
Is that

2072
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:50,880
Like

2073
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:53,952
He believes that Al-Qaeda just change their name

2074
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:54,976
Tyson

2075
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:02,400
Again McMasters riding it and that's the reconstituting Isis

2076
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:08,800
About Brandeis

2077
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:10,848
Baltimore names

2078
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:17,248
Set letter L

2079
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:19,296
Finger guns

2080
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:25,440
Along with a finger

2081
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:28,000
OB like Prince

2082
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:33,120
We got to run a PR firm

2083
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:38,496
So we got one we got one more clip here left a listen to it and it's when Alex gets around to take him

2084
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:42,080
And I get to call from a lady

2085
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,896
And I think

2086
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:47,456
Through the prism of this phone call

2087
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,736
We can get

2088
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:50,272
A pretty decent set

2089
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:55,648
Where a lot of people have

2090
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:58,464
From where a lot of the fears that Alex Jones

2091
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:02,816
What do you know it dates back

2092
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:03,584
2

2093
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,144
Eracism of all ages

2094
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:07,680
They're going to take our women

2095
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,776
And I also want to talk about

2096
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,824
Immigration

2097
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,104
We're having

2098
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,640
Immigrants from

2099
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:19,456
Come over to America and

2100
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:21,248
They are

2101
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,808
Getting our dumb girl

2102
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,416
Call Massena Mall

2103
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:32,512
Wonderful things and then taking them back to the Middle East where we all mailed it

2104
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:34,816
I'm wondering

2105
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,352
If we could

2106
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:37,888
Possibly

2107
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:42,496
Bactrim some moron immigration in and protecting our young women

2108
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,688
Problem

2109
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:52,224
I don't I don't

2110
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,528
Think it's necessarily appropriate

2111
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:55,552
Islam

2112
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:57,088
But there are definite problem

2113
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:00,160
Real organization

2114
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:01,952
Try to work on

2115
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:08,864
And you're absolutely right that's going on

2116
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,400
Sexy girls

2117
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:18,080
It absolutely makes me feel

2118
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:21,920
You should give your small children 6 toys

2119
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:27,808
Appear in Alaska about

2120
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:29,344

Individual event and I don't know if it's true or not I have no idea

2128
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:46,240
What Alex is doing

2129
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:51,872
Is just throwing back to the narratives that you've built throughout the show don't really place

2130
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:54,944
As building

2131
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,736
What were you scribbling down there

2132
01:53:59,040 --> 01:53:59,552
Maybe

2133
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:01,600
If you're still worried about

2134
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:03,648
Women being sold in

2135
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,928
Slavery in North app

2136
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,464

Fighting again

2138
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:10,816
Maybe

2139
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:14,656
Keep those people where they are

2140
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:22,080
Is Mommy doing

2141
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:24,896
North Africa

2142
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:32,320
Well there's also an issue to it like you know you can find it almost any rule Community I would

2143
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,112
Sort of

2144
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:41,024
People through dating marrying them real quick

2145
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,328
Examples of people who are

2146
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:44,864
Sort of abusive that

2147
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,400
Always

2148
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:47,936
Abusive relation

2149
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:48,960
Just trying to get some

2150
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:49,728
Want to relocate

01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:56,384
Cuts off ties to support network Muslim in the

2152
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,064
Maybe it's dude

2153
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:06,112
Maybe it's not a religion

2154
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:07,392
Maybe it's due

2155
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:08,160
Bright

2156
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:12,000
So at this turkey

2157
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:12,768
Situation

2158
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:13,792
I'm not I didn't

2159
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:15,072
Really look into it

2160
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:16,096
Rob because

2161
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:21,984
This apocryphal stories from Turkey legalized

2162
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:22,752
Good 9 year old

2163
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,592
I didn't really look into it but I just pulled up an article here that is

2164
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:28,640
From August of last year

2165
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:29,664
Turkish Constitution

2166
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:34,528
Mcwhorter's prompted anger a voting to scrap a law that automatically categorizes sexual acts with children

2167
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:36,576
The ages of 12 and 15 is sexual abuse

2168
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:38,112
Judges in the country

2169
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:39,136
High Court voted

2170
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:40,928
Another provision by a narrow margin

2171
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:42,464
Response to an application

2172
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,744
From a district court which

2173
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,792
Complained the law did not differentiate between

2174
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:46,560
Create group

2175
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:48,352
In cases of child sex

2176
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:51,168
Might be more

2177
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:54,240
Kind of

2178
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:56,032
Still inclined

2179
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:59,616
The complaint also said that the law failed to take into account

2180
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:00,896
Consent of victim

2181
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:02,432
Some cases with a child victim

2182
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:04,736
Between the ages of 12 and 15 enabled under

2183
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:05,760
The meaning of

2184
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:06,528
Sexual acts

2185
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:08,832
The laws removal

2186
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:09,600
Affected

2187
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:22,144
FairPoint Wilson's turkey is a terrible Place automatically

2188
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:25,472
Statutory rape

2189
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:28,544
And then they were like well what if they say yeah

2190
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:30,848
Right and then they decided that it's

2191
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,664
Provisionally I think Alex is on the right side of it

2192
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:35,456
I'm going to go ahead and say that without

2193
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:38,016
I'ma give him credit for that

2194
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:39,296
Hey

2195
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,576
You got one Alex

2196
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:45,696
From a young girl who said that her friend had met and I'm sure she met him online

2197
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:49,024
Party from the Middle East

2198
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:51,584
Married her within 3 months

2199
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:52,608
Never

2200
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:59,008
Never see her house they never did anything all of a sudden now he wants to take her down to Texas with his brother

2201
01:56:59,264 --> 01:56:59,776
And his

2202
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:02,592
First of all that's not bad

2203
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,384
Second

2204
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,016
The psychology of the

2205
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,320
If this is a real person

2206
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,088
She's talking about

2207
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:19,744
I know I'm not saying because I don't think she tells the story that there's even anything inherently

2208
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:21,536
Evidentiary

2209
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:24,864
Wrong a girl told me that her friend said

2210
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:28,448
Very specific about people's ages

2211
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:31,776
To choose to do this whether it's wise or not is a completely different

2212
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:34,080
Versation and whether or not

2213
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:39,968
You should know better than to move to a different conversation

2214
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:43,040
Alaska

2215
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:49,952
Totally possum Alaska probably sucks

2216
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:50,976
At least

2217
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:55,072
And we tried everything to keep her up here in Alaska so that

2218
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:13,248
Visa just a heads off

2219
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:22,720
I mine again I'm against then the Middle Eastern men

2220
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:32,960
Christian girls

2221
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:35,776
Shipton

2222
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:37,824
Well

2223
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:44,224
23rd liberalism right where they have it because you have to I don't want to come into the United States I want to protect our younger

2224
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:56,000
The Barbary

2225
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,720
Fake love

2226
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,256
Now that's just

2227
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:29,536
Isn't it

2228
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:31,840
Crazy that that is like the

2229
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:33,888
Perfect end to this episode

2230
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:39,008
He's braver Ramblin out to break with

2231
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:39,776
Enterprise

2232
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:42,336
When she started the show doing a ton

2233
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:46,432
Impression

2234
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:50,784
Calling back to a narrative that's bulshit video selling earlier

2235
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:51,808
MMA

2236
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:53,088
It's just

2237
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:54,624
It's just a load of bull

2238
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:56,416
The loaded Bowl

2239
01:59:56,928 --> 02:00:00,512
Because again that lady all she has to go on is someone mad

2240
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:02,304
Someone who

2241
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,376
Maybe Arabic or Muslim and they

2242
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,912
Might be moving to

2243
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:11,008
A joke

2244
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,032
I don't

2245
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,824
I don't really know

2246
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,872
I like that is that is rude

2247
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:18,688
To what Alex ends up describing of

2248
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:19,712
Sexual

2249
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:23,040
Slavery white slavery in a third world country

2250
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:26,112
It's just labor just make a really

2251
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:29,440
Define reference in terms of Kosovo

2252
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:31,744
The massive human trafficking problem

2253
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:41,216
Staring weird women in Alaska

2254
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:44,800
Did the thinking that somehow it liberalism

2255
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,712
Sexual bondage

2256
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:54,016
It's all such nonsense I mean

2257
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:54,784
Playing on this

2258
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:55,808
Spear of their take

2259
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:58,112
Taking our women is the game that's being

2260
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:58,880
Played with in that

2261
02:00:59,136 --> 02:00:59,648
Phone call

2262
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:03,488
And whether or not there are real issues that are touched on Twitch

2263
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:06,304
I think we agree there are

2264
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,328
Touchdog poorly

2265
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:12,448
It doesn't matter what does feeling you come away from it

2266
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:15,008
And the feeling that that caller is going to go away

2267
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:21,152
Is the cheese validated writer fear that brown people are trying to take our young white women

2268
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:23,968
That is a f*****-up narrative that has been with us

2269
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,760
And is reinforced

2270
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:27,552
So much racism

2271
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:29,856
So much segmenting of the population

2272
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:30,624
4

2273
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,648
As long as we've been

2274
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:35,232
We still make movies about

2275
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,512
Mixed race

2276
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,536
Like

2277
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:42,144
Holiday dinners ride like you coming home to dinner in but

2278
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:48,544
Look Who's Coming to Dinner remake within the last

2279
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:52,384
Yeah yes

2280
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,688
No kidding

2281
02:01:55,968 --> 02:02:02,112
With the Warriors

2282
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:08,000
Love Bernie Mac

2283
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:11,328
Pecan pie

2284
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:15,424
Bernie Mac

2285
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:21,568
Barry the funny dude

2286
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:22,848
Original

2287
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:31,040
So yeah I mean I think that's why I got really uncomfortable in the middle they're talking about that article because those pictures

2288
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:35,904
I Wrestled a little bit about whether or not to put those on

2289
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:36,672
Put those up

2290
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:39,744
Disgusting because I do feel a little weird

2291
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:42,048
It is a little bit unsettling

2292
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:44,608
Like there are artistic

2293
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:47,168
Choices that you make when you're laying out of paper that

2294
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:49,728
I think that's Up For Debate

2295
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:52,800
I think it is I thought. But I don't think it is

2296
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:54,848
I wholeheartedly believe

2297
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:57,920
That Alex is wrong

2298
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:58,688
Intentionally

2299
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:02,016
Gering to sexualize children

2300
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:07,392
But I do wonder I do wonder and I'm not interested in censorship I'm not saying they shouldn't have

2301
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:08,160
Supposed to be

2302
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:09,952
But I do I do

2303
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:12,000
I wonder what the value of it is

2304
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:14,048
Wonder you could get away with

2305
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:15,840
Less shocking art in Baker

2306
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:17,376
Point

2307
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:23,008
Think you could at the same time I think one of the central point of that

2308
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,032
Is that

2309
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:26,080
We feel so uncomfortable

2310
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:27,616
With the knowledge

2311
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:29,152
That kids be f******

2312
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:31,456
I'm not uncomfortable that knowledge

2313
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:39,392
What that's what's being played with exactly that's that's the feeling that you're getting right there is the question you're having

2314
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,416
Ask yourself is like

2315
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:41,952
Am I sexualizing

2316
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,256
As opposed to just admitting like

2317
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:45,280
Kids

2318
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:49,632
There is like Dana Point

2319
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:54,496
F*** it

2320
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:58,080
Right right right right

2321
02:03:58,336 --> 02:04:00,384
We need to actually deal with this issue

2322
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:01,408
And the reason we

2323
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:03,712
We can't is because of our visceral

2324
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:05,248
Like idea of like

2325
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:06,784
Kitchen be doing that

2326
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:10,368
You know even though even though all of us who like well I did

2327
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:11,392
Kitchen

2328
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:14,208
I guess

2329
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:20,096
Is it is the same thing that I mean I guess maybe are feeling about it or leasing feeling that I'd manifest

2330
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:20,864
Speak now

2331
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:22,144
Is possibly

2332
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:22,912
Result

2333
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:29,312
The shame that we grew up around sexuality

2334
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:31,872
I mean for however

2335
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:32,896
Many years

2336
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:37,760
It wasn't baby

2337
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:39,040
Lunesta

2338
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:40,320
A dirty

2339
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:41,856
That's around

2340
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:42,880
Need to be there

2341
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:46,464
I don't know I don't think anyone

2342
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:47,232
It probably makes it

2343
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:54,144
The boy has the exact right answer on what to do with

2344
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:57,472
You know what I mean like I don't think necessarily

2345
02:04:57,728 --> 02:05:00,032
I don't know I can speak for this

2346
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:00,800
This writer

2347
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:01,824
Wrote that article

2348
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:04,128
But I don't think that she necessarily

2349
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:06,688
Would say that she has all the ants

2350
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:12,064
Tongue-in-cheek aspect of UB

2351
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:14,368
Hey by your kids sex toys like that

2352
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:18,208
That's clearly overly shocking in order to maintain

2353
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:21,024
Because ultimately our point is like

2354
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:23,328
Stop shaming kids about sex

2355
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:24,864
Brave

2356
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:26,656
Video

2357
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:29,216

2364
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:43,552
Spot

2365
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:49,440
I don't get Bernie wrong everybody can do a burn

2366
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:50,720
I hope he continues

Throughout our existence already I feel very uncomfortable even sitting out a plan

2410
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:09,216
Set goals

2411
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:11,264
Broke

2412
