Fight.com

5
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:08,096
About the altar of Celine

6
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
Jordan

7
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
Question what's up

8
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704
Speaking of Celine

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,008
It's a Saleen oriented right spot

10
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,312
So one of the things that I

11
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
Enjoyed

12
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,872
Over the course of my time living

13
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,896
With this animal

14
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,736
Is that she finds new places that she likes to hang out

15
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:30,112
China periodically on the couch for a while that was like where I always find her

16
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,672
Basic

17
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,232
Of course totally basic normal

18
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,816
Lately he's found a new spot that you love so she's going next

19
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,400
Every single time I go to the bathroom she's laying in the tub

20
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,848
That's how you elevate the form of laying in a weird podcast now

21
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
Gratifying

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Is commonality that we have is gone

23
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,552
You're both people

24
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,344
His much water if adding

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,928
Drive stick not think nothing would be would be the best

26
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,256
It's like to share things with a cohabitant

27
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
Sure

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
What is the chance to break into Robert Evans

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,008
And steel is it raining strippers

30
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:24,896
Unreleased currently as a podcast or Oregon

31
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,456
Episodic thing and I got to read the whole thing and it

32
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
Very very good I mean I'm sure it'll probably be the final version that everybody else here is unless

33
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,136
She takes my advice in

34
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,464
Rewrite it to be about motto shark rampant

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864
Represent

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
I guess you're still writing but I don't know why all art must contain shark Rapids

37
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
No it's it's

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,872
Very very good and there are few things he does

39
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
2

40
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
You know

41
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,016
Not glorify the violence that is just so is so great

42
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
Call After the revolution in

43
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Is really really good

44
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
I recommend people read it

45
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:12,256
Coming out to like you said is like chapters in audio format and also in imprint

46
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Twitter

47
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:24,544
Today we have an episode to go over as promised and episode

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,640
Okay so I wanted to check out the day after the fauci emails got really

49
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Because to me this

50
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:35,296
Seems like the biggest bread making opportunity of Alex's recent Curry

51
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
Females you can say whatever the f*** you wanted something

52
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,744
So I checked in on June 2nd 2020

53
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
Now all I'm doing is just screaming Blackjack whatever I realize I'm not going to catch up

54
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,960
Vocalizations

55
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
The shot

56
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
Doesn't work that way

57
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Find

58
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
I kind of felt like one of the first was

59
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,992
When the initial release came out

60
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
Like the second

61
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,344
By then he's had the evening to come up with whatever bulshit he wants

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,672
To say I'm excited to see

63
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
How he responds

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,024
Does he fail even at this

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,631
We will see

66
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Thank you

67
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:36,735
There's a real name apparently and I feel for this person

68
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
I'm a policy wonk

69
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,415
Thank you very much sir

70
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,815
I'm opposed to the sequel to The King and I I'm writing in my brain

71
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,399
Post-tribulation Rapture thank you so much

72
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,311
I like that one too

73
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,527
First Erica Indian

74
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,879
A loyal servant of Queen saline May long she reign

75
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
Yub

76
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Freakishly large

77
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:38,431
Thank you so much

78
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,527
I like how people are going to boil servant of saline

79
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
I feel like we could

80
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
Spiral this out into a cult a lot

81
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Faster than I would have it

82
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,999
But like you know how the buttercream what the buttercream gang is do regular gangs

83
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
We would create two regular

84
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,423
Do you know what I'm saying this is already taking over my tub

85
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
Oh man I wonder what her first commandment

86
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,895
Stay out of my tub probably

87
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
Do Jordan now it is come time to check-in

88
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
Some birthday shout out

89
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
Bored

90
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,111
Is the condition that leads to death

91
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,951
Life is a disease that ends in death

92
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,535
If you're different

93
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,495
But Alex has been hitting lately

94
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:45,503
Happy birthday

95
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,319
Touching wanted us to give you a shout out

96
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
This is back in May I believe Steve

97
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Happy birthday

98
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
Belatedly

99
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,351
But again life is data

100
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
Born

101
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
Is the condition that leads to death

102
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,775
Life is a disease that ends in death

103
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
Happy birthday happy birthday

104
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Jordan

105
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
I told you

106
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,943
This is the day that I would be responding to the emails

107
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
And

108
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
Here's

109
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
Restart

110
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
This is after he played a little bit of like

111
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,671
Goofy meme video about like a Scooby-Doo

112
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,511
They take the bags off of the ghost Ted's Italian Bill Gates

113
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
A lot of fun he's promoting that

114
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
The wheels and completely come off

115
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,143
Covid-19

116
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,471
The globalist are in deep trouble

117
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
We put out

118
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
Dark comedy peace

119
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
You just saw

120
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,735
They're TV Oregon just heard of your realtor

121
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,807
Spoof on Scooby-Doo

122
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Where

123
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
Calcium

124
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
Operation

125
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Prison for

126
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
And we put that out of here yo

127
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
It was banned on Twitter and Facebook

128
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,447
Was obviously aperitif

129
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Based on

130
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Real things they die

131
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
Boy here later

132
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
Meaning

133
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
When we first

134
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Put it out

135
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,855
Scooby-Doo just saw the covid-19 mystery

136
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Got 200

137
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
1000 views video

138
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,023
I think it needs a lot more than that.

139
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
What's the featured video

140
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
Video

141
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
This is important stuff

142
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
I was I was a little

143
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,079
I am very saddened by the SI I was a little underwhelmed

144
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Not least of which

145
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,247
Because Scooby-Doo right there right there year old memes booth

146
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
Is it what we need to really push

147
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
Need to get that.

148
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
Assertive wrestled with

149
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,375
Exactly what it is about Alex's show that I think is

150
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
Is bad

151
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
And I mean obviously they're dancers

152
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
But a lot of them

153
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,335
But one of the things that he sort of central that makes it bad is actually what he articulates

154
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
It's in this next

155
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:26,271
Because it's radio / TV transmission is not just your regular entertainment it's not just your regular news program

156
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
Participation sport

157
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
I think that's censored report

158
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
Video needs to get share don't you

159
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
The Scooby-Doo

160
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,327
But this is a participation sport

161
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
That's

162
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,703
Kind of bad bad way of looking at this stuff when you

163
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
You know I mean

164
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,591
Underoath

165
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
I'm just talking about my feelings

166
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,735
Right I don't know about sources I don't know about

167
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,551
Have to act you have to listen to the whole thing

168
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
What he's free and he's on air

169
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,159
Please this is this is not news

170
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
This isn't entertainment this is a participation sport

171
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,047
I'm trying to incite you to do something

172
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
Nothing. Lisa Wolf

173
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,143
But that implies that information is

174
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
A win-or-lose situation not

175
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
Things are real or not

176
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,567
You can win with information that's not real

177
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
You know

178
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,383
It's a participation sport it's not about

179
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,967
Finding what's real or what's true or what exists

180
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
It's about winning

181
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
Don't challenge your notion

182
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,903
Come up with things that you can miss represent in the real world that real

183
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,695
Enforce your predetermined

184
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Conclusion

185
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,767
And play like hell out on the field

186
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,399
Take make sure everyone else is forced to accept those things too if you change your mind you're just giving up

187
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,727
You are you can't get you can't give up you can't be a quitter

188
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,311
The challenge t.j. Lavin doesn't like quitters

189
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Hate squid

190
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,431
Throw in the towel

191
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:03,551
So finally Alex does end up getting to the Apache emails and cover them that much

192
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
Gmail

193
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Ichiro

194
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,767
Not effective in keeping out virus

195
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,607
02

196
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,423
I need a publicly said it's about respect

197
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Living in fear

198
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,847
Openshot

199
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,687
Tool

200
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Boobs

201
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,111
In the emails he did say that there wasn't good reason for everyone to wear

202
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
Because at the

203
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
Unaware of a number of variable

204
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
But existed with covid

205
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
In an interview with CNN

206
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
David email got released fauci was asked

207
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,143
Quote a lot of transpired since then

208
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,495
If you had to go back and do it all over again would you tell her something different do you regret that

209
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
Here's his answer would I think it's gray

210
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
Quote

211
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
Let's get real here

212
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:06,527
If you look at scientific information as it accumulates what's going on in January and February what you know is a fact

213
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
Does data guides you

214
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
Hi guys what you tell people and your policy

215
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
If March April May occur

216
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:18,559
You accumulate a lot more information and you modify and adjust your opinion and your recommendation based on the current science

217
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Concurrent data

218
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Of course

219
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,703
If we knew back then that a substantial amount of transmission was asymptomatic people

220
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,335
If we knew that the data show that masked outside of a hospital setting actually do work when we didn't know it then

221
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
If we realize all those things back then

222
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Of course

223
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,503
You're asking a question would you do something different if you knew what you knew now

224
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
Course people would have done that

225
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
It's so obvious

226
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:46,719
God's great answer that is losing the participation sport

227
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:53,119
No wonder we never win because he is learning and growing and then regretting actions from before

228
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
What he should be saying is no

229
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:00,543
I'm so stoked all those people died because of stuff I didn't know that I told them

230
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
That's what I wanted

231
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,407
I just think there's something to delineate there though that it's not I don't think it's regret

232
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Necessarily

233
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:11,295
Maybe a hope that more awareness head or more information had been known at a certain time

234
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,855
But based on the information that was available that's

235
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
Solidus recommendation

236
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Mmsd

237
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,023
The thing about psychological

238
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
Hot stuff that Alex brings up short

239
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:28,959
Best I can tell like that was something that was going on early on I remember this this is what they were talking about like

240
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,079
When there wasn't an awareness of the asymptomatic spread

241
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
There was

242
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,223
Discussion of if you're sick you should wear a mask if you're not sick

243
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
You don't really need to

244
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
But

245
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
That puts

246
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,183
The stigma on anybody wearing a mask you got it because now if you wear a mask everyone's going to assume you're sick

247
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
Could lead to people

248
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,839
Being disincentivize to wear masks when they should wear my

249
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
No I mean leper colonies worked well everybody with Leprosy was like I'm definitely going to go right to this leper colony

250
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
I don't want to hide it and key

251
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,335
Keep people from knowing that I'm a leper because

252
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,383
You know I'm treated so well in leper colony

253
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:15,295
The psychological benefit of widespread mask uses that you kind of make it easier for people

254
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Hoodoo

255
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,367
Higher reason

256
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
According to the understanding

257
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,975
At that time right to follow Public Health

258
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
Advice

259
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Everyone

260
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
No it works out better for everyone

261
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
If you need stigmatize these things

262
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
I make it so everyone

263
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
I don't know

264
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,031
I have not read all of the voucher emails I've read all of the ones

265
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
That like

266
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
Get pointed out as like a haha

267
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
I-Ready

268
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
Bunch of the ones that no one pointing out

269
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
IC

270
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
A nothing

271
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
And I think Alex does to because here's what he does immediately instead of going more into these

272
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Easy maokai

273
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,559
By the way let me let me let me get back in always

00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
And then I'll go into each

277
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
Area

278
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383

286
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535

290

What he tells your story

291
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,079
It's accurate

292
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
And I know her daughter very well

293
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455

I can't adopt it I can't listen

299
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:12,287
I can't keep track of all the variables

300
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,639
This is not the Bible's I don't care who begat

301
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Well

302
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,759

Add

310
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,823
One of the daughters the granddaughter was arguing

311
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
We had

312
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
About

313
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Issues

314
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
But the mother said hey

315
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,831
Why don't you go to your school counselor and ask them

316
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
About some of your

317
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Boyfriend

318
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,207
I'm going to go pay for you to go to something else

319
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,399
High School freshman

320
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
But I went

00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Awesome

323
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
I was 16

324
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,871
Jessie goes into the school in Rockwall and it's a male

325
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Counselor

326
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
Conversation

Nice repeat it to her

328
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
Acceptable

329
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,767
Don't you think your problem is you're really

330
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Amman

331
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Oh boy

332

So that this is B

333
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
This is where the story

334
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
I would like more Preamble please he exactly would definitely like more preamp

335
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
It's clearly not to restore

336
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Think about

337
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
This is made of b*******

338
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
Beckett simonon

339
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,855
How is it that you can think it's a

340
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
The great idea

341
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,719
To give that much of a preamble to a story where all you want to be at

342
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:13,119
Transphobic in meme

343
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Demonized

344
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
Sir population

345
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
In order to do that

346
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
You got

347
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
Izzat

348
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:26,175
Third-hand story maybe maybe a fan of you have something on the family tree that's

349
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,991
Long Branch away from you that's for damn sure

350
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Yeah

351
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
I would

352
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,415
Believe that there's a possibility that somebody was in a school counseling position

353
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
Could

354
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
You know if someone weird

355
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
Come to them with

356
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,631
Gender issues or something could be

357
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,191
Emprise

358
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
But I don't believe

359
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
This

360
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,615
You're having problems with this boyfriend

361
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Are stool

362
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,711
Because you're really sexually confused

363
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
Are you joking or snow

364
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,951
We have put your child sleep outside

365
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
You really need this right now

366
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,399
Puma shirt for girl

367
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
This is a f******

368
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,823
This is that same meme we're like that

369
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:32,479
This is a joke meme where the soldiers in the other professors like Liberals are good in the soldiers like I killed everybody

370
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,551
America's the best thing ever in the liberal professor

371
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,903
Correct all the time this is a made-up nonsense story

372
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
Conservative tell themselves

373
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,231
This is a boogeyman story this is

374
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,767
I mean

375
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Frankly

376
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,887
If this happened to Alex's describing it she should own that

377
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:55,263
That's cool

378
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,847
Malfeasance

379
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
Go to school

380
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,455
Very easy to to get to the bottom of

381
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
What a Libras

382
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Oh God

383
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Imagine

384
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,111
Not trouble Charles boyfriend

385
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,207
When you're starting you don't so much talk to your mom

386
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,767
You know who's the right-wing you know Christian

387
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
But she's conservative

388
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,935
You don't even expect in Rockwall Texas a suburb of Dallas

389
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
Pushing on you

390
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
You are a man

391
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
You are a m

392
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
What are the odds

393
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,647
Men women are like

394
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
This outrageous

395
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,535
The only real question that I have is

396
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,863
How much is this is the story that someone told him at a cookout

397
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
And how much is

398
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
Alex Azar

399
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:00,799
I'm going to punch to the shopping list Gallagher on man

400
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:06,175
This isn't it's either that or like he's half remembering Austin Powers isn't it

401
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,783
You're a man baby that could be you might have taken some sizzurp

402
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,903
And I watch some movies

403
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Ever

404
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,208
Imagine his audience

405
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,560
It's over Taylor story

406
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:28,960
They had a big assembly the principal

407
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,664
Scream whatever the prince

408
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,712
Isabel tells into as we all know children do

409
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,528
Jesus

410
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Changed

411
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,392
Literally entirely since I was in school but I do remember the counselors

412
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
And every school that I went to

413
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,328
Being the sort of folks who just listen and roll their eyes

414
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:00,704
I don't kind of believe you honestly the counselors are not really actively engaged

415
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,056
They mean well for the most part and I like

416
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,640
Was positioned to be a school counselor

417
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,712
Yeah I don't remember them being all that much like

418
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,808
Working across purposes trying to make conclusions for you

419
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Find it weird

420
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,184
When I was in third grade and they school counselor put all of us under the Sorting Hat

421
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
And I

422
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,488
Determine whether we were man or woman

423
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
That was a that was an interesting day but

424
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
I guess that's part of the counselors job now

425
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
This story let me first of all

426
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,960
100% absolutely not true

427
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:39,360
But it leads me to believe that Alex doesn't really want to talk about

428
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
A little bit weak

429
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:47,296
Well he read some of that you meant well he didn't read him his actual grandfather's nephew he knew him

430
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:52,160
Come back when they go hunting know it's something to you don't even want to know about it

431
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,184
My son that guy got

432
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
With his

433
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:59,072
Diddler in the Sheep on the other side of that sad if

434
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,656
We don't need to talk about that this story is about my great grandfather's nephew

435
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
And how he had a son

436
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,496
And his son was married to this woman that was

437
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
His first marriage

438
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
Marriage that was a disaster but

439
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,432
What is first marriage they got married again it's like Grover Cleveland non-consecutive marriages

440
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,760
Just kind of thinking right

441
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:24,160
Really letting me you're leaving me out to dry I was kinda hoping you would get into how the second marriage

442
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,512
Importing exporting business

443
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,352
Antique and Relic

444
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,400
40 countries that were stolen

445
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,544
Errands I'll be in traffic

446
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,640
Cousin who was rewrite that to the Tri-Rail right

447
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,296
The story about again email great story

448
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,368
So also not to do in such as emails but Alex has a new shirt

449
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
That's really popular

450
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:01,024
I was going to plug this and I keep it like this shirt is popular with

451
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
A designer shirt

452
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,912
And I think it's one of my better design

453
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
Looks like

454
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
The concept team

455
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
Robert dollars over there

456
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
It's just incredible

457
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
Regular lights

458
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,880
We got a black shirt

459
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,768
The frogs infowars.com and on the front of the shirt

460
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
The same little symbol over

461
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Your car

462
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
And I'm telling you

463
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,680
For almost a month

464
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,336
As soon as I wore this out

465
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,176
John the boom operator

466
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
My son

467
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
Yesterday

468
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
He works up here

469
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
It's because I am 4 years

470
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,096
XXL

471
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,656
Not important storage

472
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:14,240
Hey you go to the warehouse down the road you get one

473
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
You don't steal my shirt

474
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,336
I'm telling you this shirt so popular

475
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:22,176
Why so popular with

476
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,016
My employee and my son

477
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,832
Is not a good Market sailboat

478
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:36,256
Got the brand new market research work for me like this shirt work for me or I Cry

479
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
Created

480
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,424
Listen we can't keep them in stock they're stealing them from us you guys done

481
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:54,176
Including the people who work for me only and I only the people who work for me just love these show

482
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
Amazing

483
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
It's God to frog

484
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
Dand

485
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,880
So I think that this was just also a nice way for Alex to weave into talking

486
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,416
Think about some more of this you know like

487
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,464
The frogs

488
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,864
Harvest Bread and Butter with everybody loves to

489
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
He's trying to do a little bit more

490
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:18,496
They were cloning animals and humans before I was born

491
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,272
What are the way twice as much that are similar part insect

492
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,320
Asparagus

493
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
Hello

494
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,672
Asparagus salmon

495
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,072
I try that so Alex is talking about a new genetically modified salmon that's being bred by a company called aquabounty

496
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,936
Actually not really new in 2015 they got approval to

497
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,496
Like create these genetically modified salmon

498
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,360
Came to Market but like almost nobody is buying

499
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Puffer upper

500
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
Pufferfish

501
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:12,000
Set

502
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:17,120
I'm not sure that I'm okay with what's going on here for ethical reasons but Alex is still way off on the

503
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,752
The fish don't grow to twice their normal weight they grow to their normal weight twice as fast

504
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,848
Who's the chief by splicing into Atlantic salmon tagine from Pacific

505
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,152
Chinook salmon that make it so the fish produced

506
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
Growth hormone all year and shutter part of

507
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
Sure

508
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,296
Gene from another fish the ocean

509
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,368
That essentially actor the stabilizing

510
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
Mistaken for the hormone

511
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,488
I've not been able to determine if a salmon is partes para guess but I do know that

512
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
But if you look into it

513
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,816
But you can find some interesting recipes where salmon is paired

514
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,144
Alright done that

515
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,448
Cook-Out is a good weekend

516
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
But butter and asparagus

517
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:58,336
Put some salt and pepper on their maybe maybe braizat even then

518
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,408
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this stuff

519
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,272
Entirely I'm not sure I'd have to think about it a little bit more maybe have a conversation with somebody about it

520
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,368
Apparently most food retailers in the United States agree and they aren't selling

521
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,184
This may be like one of those funny

522
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
Instances where I

523
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
Kind of agree with

524
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,560
The conclusion that Alex has it like maybe maybe this isn't cool

525
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:23,424
But I think that the way that he reaches his conclusion is childish stupid and a disservice to

526
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,240
Anyone taking these issues seriously

527
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,592
Ridiculous I mean like part of my immediate reaction to that is

528
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
As the sign

529
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,432
It's fiction fan I was when I was 8 years old was like

530
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Yeah fukin

531
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
Can splice everything together let's see what happen

532
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,832
And now that I'm an adult I can realize that maybe that

533
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
Kids shouldn't be in charge

534
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,904
Gene editing research

535
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,232
So maybe we have to hold off on it

536
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:52,864
Concerned about obviously and I don't I don't know whenever I try to look into this a little bit but I don't know if I could even find a

537
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
Clear answer

538
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
How much

539
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,216
Does that growing twice as fast

540
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
Like effect

541
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,544
The life experience of the second

542
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
You know cuz that seems like a

543
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
Could be hellish

544
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
Yeah and I-80

545
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
Think that I don't know what you're not

546
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:11,296
I don't know when you unpack that you open it up to the whole leg while you're going to eat them anyway

547
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:16,672
She and then you get into I don't want to wait into it with us

548
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Hardtack

549
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:23,072
So Alex talks about the salmon and then he jumps into another story about

550
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
In Japan

551
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,912
And I did not actually pulled

552
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
This clip I regret to

553
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,216
What am I

554
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
What am I bungle

555
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:34,336
But I want to talk about it a little bit because it is also fairly interests

556
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,872
Sing but again the thing that Alex is

557
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
Is talking about his nonsense

558
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,992
Is this like the Nigerian email scam he got catfished by somebody in Japan

559
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,928
No he's found an article in Japanese about a Japanese science

560
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
Research

561
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,768
Project to make

562
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Catfish

563
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
Female

564
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,864
Essentially using

565
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,912
Something that they derive from soil

566
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,704
Already

567
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,984
Amateur

568
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,592
Catfish are turned into females or in the embryo no matter what it will be

569
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
Female cat

570
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
It is

571
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
I don't know if it's fully adults

572
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
But but they are actual caption

573
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,344
So this is another story about people try to find ways to make fish bigger quicker

574
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,904
Female catfish grow at much faster rate

575
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,720
Rates then males and in farming situations often males are

576
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
Just thrown out

577
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,304
Raising them to the point where they could be used for marketable product

578
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,352
What cost more than would be brought in

579
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
Researchers in Japan recently found that if they

580
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,936
They kept the fish in a tank that way

581
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,960
Was full of water weigh

582
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,496
What's different things dissolved in it

583
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,312
Create a more female dense population

584
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,408
The use of actual female hormones is not allowed for animals being raised

585
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
Consumption

586
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
So the researchers at

587
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
Explored isoflavones

588
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,784
Badger the chemical that's found in

589
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
Beans

590
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,624
They isolated a compound called genistein

591
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,208
And that it is derived from from isoflow gonchar

592
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:58,304
And they found that if you had a tank of water with 400 micrograms

593
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
A leader

594
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,864
This resulted in a tank of

595
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
Catfish that were a

596
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,912
Hundred percent female

597
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
Wow

598
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,800
This is interesting and it's obviously of concern to people who raise fish for a living

599
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,896
Pretending there's a one-to-one parallel between humans and catfish is a little bit soft

600
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,176
Which is what Alex is due

601
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
Even if

602
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
Biologically similar to

603
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,808
To the point where at

604
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
Relevant

605
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:27,232
This would still seem to suggest that humans would need to swim around in and breathe water full of isoflavones

606
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
This kind of effect

607
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,096
This is all too often the case

608
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,120
It's just an attempt by Alex

609
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,680
Text to take a headline misrepresented and use it as a weapon

610
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,984
Against trans people are trying to make

611
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,008
The fact of

612
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
Trans people

613
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,336
Existence into some kind of a conspiracy

614
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
Because

615
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
This is what they're doing with

616
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,016
I don't know about that

617
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,088
That's why don't I don't want to

618
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,392
I want I want a big no on that one

619
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,208
Yeah and interesting research

620
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
From what I was able to find

621
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:02,816
Applies to

622
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,864
But I want to try to get a little bit

623
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
Closer

624
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,424
By taking another silly relate

625
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,216
Story

626
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
About monkeys

627
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,080
I also texted this on monkey three different species and found

628
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,640
But they make the same weird smiling face

629
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,944
They're aggressive and hateful loaners

630
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
Very unsuccessful

631
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Female

632
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,416
Long-term story consumption makes monkeys aggressive loners

633
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,696
Shocking study

634
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,744
Responsible human applications

635
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
Lar

636
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:38,912
Not surprisingly Alex a zombie tails on the study wrong it was also the studies from 2004

637
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
The headline he's reading Israel website called

638
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:46,592
Herculean strength.com okay well I'm already out

639
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,384
Siri where he's pulling this from

640
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,784
I'm sorry of men's rights activists name is it is kicking me out it's their tagline is become a demigod

641
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,368
Diesel bodybuilding site

642
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:03,232
The variant to testosterone

643
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:07,584
Interesting Lee they also part of posted an article about that catfish studies

644
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,376
Just hangs out on bodybuilding sites

645
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,936
Texas Health news actually does make sense

646
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,472
But this is actually an interesting

647
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
Comparative

648
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,288
Study but here's some of the things Alex

649
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,104
One there wasn't three species of monkeys

650
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,712
There were three groups to experimental and one control group but they were all male macaque

651
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
Marketsharp

652
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,552
To all the stuff about the weird faces is made up

653
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,112
I think Alex has you're taking it from pictures of the macaques

654
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,416
But they were on the build-up bodybuilding website

655
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:37,792
Put random pictures about pictures from

656
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,328
Of course

657
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,888
I was probably just thinks that monkeys look like demons

658
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
Getty Images yet

659
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:49,056
I have no idea how Alex is gauging whether or not these monkeys were successful regardless of

660
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,896
I don't know what the standard for that is

661
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,944
For I don't see anything in there about killing

662
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Females

663
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:01,856
The study itself did find that there appeared to be behavioral changes in macaques based on the amount of Swords tarot reading

664
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
In the diet

665
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,928
I don't suppose focusing on the aggressive tendon

666
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
These but the study actually found that

667
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,000
The opposite was more often

668
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
McKay's

669
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
There's a 67%

670
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,608
Increase in aggressive behaviors but a 200

671
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,144
3% increase in something

672
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:18,496
This is an element of the study that Alex is choosing to ignore because he's just going to

673
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
Different directions

674
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,360
Increase solitary Behavior does match up with some of the stuff sounded

675
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,664
The study like approximately there was a 30%

676
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
Increase in time spent alone

677
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,760
For the group that had to hire soy

678
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
Intake diet sure

679
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:37,696
One important point to bring up here though is that there was almost no difference found between the control group and Below eye

680
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:44,096
Asoph Logan diet group

681
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,888
Control group in the low group word

682
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Almost

683
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
Not

684
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,216
Tell the difference

685
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
In order for human

686
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,800
Dominica levels of isoflavones

687
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,360
Consumption of the high diver group that they were getting

688
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,176
For 15 months straight it would be next to Impossible

689
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,712
For humans to do

690
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,272
Maybe the equivalent of human swimming around in isoflavones

691
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,576
Unsaturated water and breathing it in our little Gil

692
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,392
You're not going to be able to get a diet that dense that

693
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
That controlled

694
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,976
Did you get any of the

695
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
Be kind of

696
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:18,144
Marginal effects that were interesting though still whatever whatever they're looking at I don't happen

697
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,752
Inclusive it isn't art certainly don't know if it applies to human I mean to certain extent

698
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,336
That does also have the flavor of a study that's like

699
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,664
Non-consensual changing diet of animals

700
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,272
What causes different behaviors you know like I know I get it but I do

701
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,552
Okay

702
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
Shirk

703
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,744
Yeah I don't know I found a really interesting did instead of really getting into the veggie stuff Alex instead goes on all these

704
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Weird sort of

705
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Animal

706
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Genetics

707
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,864
News items that summer current

708
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
It's in summer old and

709
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,752
They're all bulshit mean aside from the transphobia that that's more fun

710
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
Yeah I suppose

711
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:00,128
Gmail emails out a talking about emails are still boring and where are they

712
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,152
We're still

713
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:07,552
Like rolling from Hillary's outside bar with Hillary's emails

714
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,880
Think I don't think you're going to find anything you're not going to be able to podesta this

715
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:16,000
Not going to be able to pizzagate if you need a pizza gate if you want email to be exciting and there's no

716
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,792
Pizzagate here there's just like

717
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
I think maybe we don't need masks

718
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,864
The conspiracy theorist

719
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,704
Community I think is burned out the pleasure centers of their brains come from this

720
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,264
Hard on people gate

721
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
Oh well

722
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:33,920
What is things that we know from listening to various periods of Alex's career is that

723
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
What's the summer for

724
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
Rage

725
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Owl

726
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,832
Or into this

727
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
They got a good chance of doing it

728
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
We are stopping

729
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,072
Oh boy

730
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
For the

731
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
May 7th

732
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
This summer

733
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
Coming to

734
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Do every city

735
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
Near you

736
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:05,920
Summer of Rage wasn't always a race war though and now that's true there was just like Financial collapse or like

737
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
27

738
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
The race war

739
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,344
Laugh like five or six Broadway Alban race war related

740
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,880
Get my butt

741
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:20,768
Yeah used to used to be just kind of like could be a number of different things as one note

742
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Yeah

743
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,864
Anyway Alex gets to talking about fauci but not Apple TV

744
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,192
Instead he talked about

745
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,496
The factories going to get home

746
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
I think

747
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
What I was listening to this

748
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,664
I feel like this clip is really a good

749
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
Isolation of

750
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,968
Why people live

751
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
Listen to this show

752
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,832
This satisfies some emotional needs that these listeners have

753
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
If you're trying to get evicted

754
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
Stop to The Gallows Pole

755
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
Coming

756
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,520
I told you to come

757
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,312
The snowball too big

758
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
You killed 20 people

759
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,688
You will pay

760
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,528
I see it in the Stars

761
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,064
I see it in the card

762
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,344
I seen him at Ely

763
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,136
I see it in the bone

764
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,440
In the room with my dear

765
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,976
Your fault

766
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,512
You are distraught

767
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,328
Justice is right

768
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
Just commenting

769
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,656
I think people just

770
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:34,496
Have some sort of the gratification of hearing someone say that violence

771
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
Who's coming to the people that they've

772
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,568
I've been trying not to like yeah it seems like

773
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,592
That's

774
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,688
That's very televangelist televangelists

775
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
2A

776
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
Realty

777
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,528
Also no false

778
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,088
Yeah

779
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
Yeah yeah

780
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:54,464
At least at least sinner in the hands of an Angry God with felt genuine you know

781
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,768
Doesn't have to try

782
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,352
So one of the things that I think is always

783
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
Talk to suss out

784
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,216
Like who's on what side

785
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,056
We've had a lot of changes over the years

786
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:13,920
Yeah so I regret to inform you on the on the side of

787
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:20,320
Secret Patriot

788
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,112
I don't talk about

789
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
Celebs

790
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
GOP

791
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,720
Now we know

792
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,024
But I'll explain to the literal devil is behind his enemy

793
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
Yes

794
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
So

795
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,096
That must mean

796
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,144
That all of the people who are on one team

797
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
There with the Devil

798
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
Conceivably with God

799
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,568
Yeah they trying to avoid moral gray areas very

800
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,408
And that way we did have the UK

801
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:51,808
I was looking good when brexit was going through but apparently Boris Johnson is a traitor

802
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,600
You think they're up in the air

803
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:58,208
Yeah yeah unclear where the UK's going to fly

804
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
Should not forget

805
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,000
At the queen hits

806
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:04,096
The dictator button I forgot about that

807
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Spinning plates

808
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
These days

809
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,544
So many spinning the queen is a secret Patriot and forgot about that would like to I would like to know if the pope is

810
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
It's still in jail

811
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,640
I need to know did he

00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,432
You know or has is

Did said like new things that are bored

815
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,832
Conservative than they were before

816
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,392
Fake Pope even like

817
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,720
At an actual clone who's just unable to break the programming

818
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,256
The same old Pope

819
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
I need to know

820
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,560
I don't know if we'd have to ask Steve

821
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,352
Anyway here are the

822
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,400
Okay we have it we will lay out of

823
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,960
Who's who's good

824
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
It's not surprised

825
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
Islamic

826
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,336
What time is China the EU

827
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,384
Hollywood the blue City Blue States

828
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
The UN

829
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
All again

830
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
America

831
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,808
Wow

832
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,600
And the Brazilian people

833
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,904
We got Brazil in their check.

834
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:05,280
Did Russia United States did Brazil vs everybody

835
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,840
A lot of people inside the United

836
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:14,240
Country at least get more above the left-right Paradigm the

837
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,312
That's about the most

838
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:24,480
Here's what we got going on okay we've got we've got everybody

839
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
And then we've got

840
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,064
Russia United States in Brazil

841
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
Definitely not

842
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,624
The new axis of Evil

843
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,184
That would be a crazy thing for someone to say

844
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,512
That these countries are very similar right now

845
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
To Italy

846
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,328
Germany

847
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
Okay

848
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,168
Yeah I find it interesting

849
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:49,312
We not not the sort of other countries that Alex feel kinship with me at all

850
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,872
Like his guys

851
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,407
Bolsonaro

852
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
But

853
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,735
I find it interesting the way he

854
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,807
The rest of this is so stateless

855
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,415
It has to do with the blue CDs the blue States in Hollywood

856
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,231
So much of it is like

857
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,535
Half of this country's going to have to go down

858
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
If

859
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,863
You know we're going to be able to

860
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631
Make this

861
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
America

862
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
Make it America

863
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
Yeah I mean it

864
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
Honestly

865
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
Siri's Quest

866
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,359
That I mean obviously

867
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
If MBS

868
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,223
Send Alex like a letter that was like

869
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,247
Hey I'm a Seeker

870
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
Christian

871
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
We're not going to

872
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,879
Not persecute Christians in Saudi Arabia anymore

873
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
That's not right

874
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207
Yes he loves what NBA

875
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Does

876
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,279
Defendant killing khashoggi

877
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
I think

878
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,863
Even if MBS didn't go that far

879
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,263
I I think that he's made an overture inside you're right about the club

880
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,359
I will have my guy will not join your religion but I will follow you again

881
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,919
Demonic

882
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711
Pretty cool

883
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,015
I know what I heard a lot of stuff about

884
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:08,415
About them in the past and turns out that was all lies

885
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:15,071
Is it good Christian tried like I might have been a long time coming by every day of

886
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:22,495
I've never taken back any of those comments suggested that what I said was not true

887
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
I don't care

888
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,103
Alex spends an entire segment

889
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
Talking about

890
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
China

891
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
And

892
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,967
Exhausting

893
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,551
Because it's all kind of stuff that we've gone over in the past

894
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,879
Like his grievances about Chiang Kai-shek

895
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,951
8 PSI unloader valve course

896
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
China has

897
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,999
Double cross

898
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,791
The globalist

899
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,095
Across the globalist

900
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,911
On multiple fronts they're not doing the one child policy

901
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,007
Military system

902
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,567
Add enough

903
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,383
How to say we won't build Miro battery

904
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,455
Only buy from China

905
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,975
Shut off the main pipe

906
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
Wife to the Midwest

907
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,095
We are under

908
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
Horses running

909
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,959
Tulsa car years ago

910
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,751
Killed each other

911
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,591
Obvious is this

912
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,943
Please don't forget

913
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,807
She's 9/4 +

914
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,111
Yeah so apparently

915
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879
Alex's

916
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,415
Pretty mad about Biden

917
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,951
Going to Tulsa

918
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,023
To celebrate pay respects

919
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,303
Do the anniversary of

920
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,327
The Tulsa Massacre

921
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
Weird

922
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,215
Yeah I'm surprised that Alex would not want to to have that talk

923
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,031
Talked about even mentioned

924
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
Recognize or even have any

925
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,103
Exist within the record

926
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
But you know what

927
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Weird

928
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:09,247
Last year Trump schedule the campaign rally in Tulsa

929
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
June 19th

930
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,087
Which understandably seemed a little not great

931
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,111
Oh yeah because

932
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,903
June 19th is Juneteenth

933
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:21,023
Is the celebration of the ending of slavery in Texas was the last state where we still taking place

934
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,559
Tulsa is the site

935
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,839
Of the Tulsa Massacre

936
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,935
Which occurred on May 31st and June 1st in 1921

937
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,495
When mobs of people destroyed the Greenwood disc

938
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,823
Street in Tulsa they largest concentration of black wealth in the United States

939
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
Obviously

940
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,407
The combination of trump going to Tulsa

941
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
Seems like a little bit

942
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:44,575
I'm not just not just moms of white people organized mobs of white people with the

943
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,111
F****** military on right

944
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,439
Side so yeah rescheduling that event

945
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,975
I'm very understandable backlash

946
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,535
He did say in a subsequent interview

947
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
Quote

948
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,839
I did something good

949
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,887
I made Juneteenth very famous

950
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
Actually an important event in important time

951
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,727
But nobody had ever heard of

952
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:04,799
Wow

953
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
Oh man

954
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:09,663
Problem with any of that but for Biden to visit the Greenwood District to pay Allman

955
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,943
How much do the Tulsa Massacre

956
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,247
That's a huge problem apparently because

957
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,271
I guess

958
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,063
I don't know

959
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,647
I think one of the main reasons that it is such a huge problem

960
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
For conservatives

961
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,207
And why they absolutely do not want

962
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
Discuss it whatsoever

963
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:24,767
Is because

964
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,303
Is it is the marriage

965
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,863
He's that they love the most

966
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
At cross-purposes

967
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,679
Switches white people

968
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
And wealth

969
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,543
And they can't say that it's okay for the wealth to be wiped out

970
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,079
Without saying that it's

971
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
There

972
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,615
Ifucking races

973
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,967
And I can't say that it's not okay for white people to murderer on masks

974
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,759
Because they're giant f****** race

975
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,319
So they're just trapped in the space of like

976
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,903
You can't earn your way out of racism in America

977
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
That's what they're saying

978
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:57,279
And that's their message is always yet know you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps

979
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,815
The real messages

980
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,095
If you do that

981
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,143
You will be murdered and slap

982
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,935
Down again because that's what they need

983
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,519
What are the other things to not to not to totally jump-off subbed

984
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,871
You was talkin about these pipelines in

985
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
And stuff

986
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,431
Politics be that states

987
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,247
Can opt out of my flight

988
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,063
Biden saying that

989
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,087
What states

990
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,391
Not participate

991
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,487
I don't know it's just there's just nothing

992
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:31,839
Nothing that would be like exactly what he would like if Trump did that he be like

993
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:35,167
Power in the states

994
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,983
So there's a big news breaking in the middle of the

995
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,591
China made a comment

996
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:48,735
So when you see the comment of shinies come out in their official publication State can you investigate the lab we're going to Nuke

997
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,647
What a list of cribs for you

998
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,695
When we come back who the traitors are

999
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,511
I definitely don't like the idea of someone tearing a list

1000
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:04,351
Do Traders on their show specially Alex someone who has a participation sport

1001
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,727
Philosophy towards historically listing Traders is usually good idea

1002
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:14,335
This story about China paying for articles and some Western Outlets

1003
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
Not news

1004
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,967
That's an old story about an english-language China Daily

1005
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:25,087
They paid to have articles place than Outlets but all those would have had to have an alert before informing

1006
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,111
Readers it is

1007
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
The paid content

1008
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,927
I don't like it but it's definitely not.

1009
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,487
I'm gone in like huge deal that Alex is making it out today

1010
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,815
I asked for the nuclear war thing Alex's line

1011
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,143
True that there's a Newsweek headline with those quote

1012
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:42,751
China's State media says country must prepare for nuclear war with us after Biden asks

1013
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,775
For covid probe

1014
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:48,639
But that's not a statement that's meant to convey a causal relationship between the two things

1015
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,175
Which is what Alex has reported

1016
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:53,503
He's saying that the Chinese government has said that they

1017
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
If we investigate the lab

1018
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:59,135
But that's not what this article as saying at all in this article is his primary source

1019
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,999
The article is about comments made by who

1020
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,047
The editor of the global times

1021
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:10,911
The commons had to do with how there was growing tensions and us China relation

1022
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,215
And the quote China sees bunch of America

1023
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,239
Cuz actions and comments

1024
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,031
Encroachment on itself

1025
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,359
Who wrote an op-ed that essentially boiled down to the

1026
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
Quote

1027
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,687
The number of China's nuclear warheads must reach the

1028
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
The quantity

1029
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
That makes

1030
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
U.s. Elite shiver

1031
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,319
Or should they entertained the idea of engaging in a military confrontation

1032
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,087
Vagina

1033
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,927
The comments were an escalation in an arms race kind of thing that I think sucks

1034
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,207
But they also want

1035
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,303
If we investigate the lab Theory

1036
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
That's nonsense

1037
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,167
It's right in line with Alex's narratives that he's been building

1038
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,983
So that's going to take precedence over the reality of the situation that

1039
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,263
Honestly we should

1040
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Not be thrilled about

1041
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,335
I mean

1042
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,103
Wild

1043
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,151
Wild to have the headline be

1044
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,711
Chinese man says Reagan had a point

1045
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,247
You know like

1046
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,551
I don't I don't understand yeah of course

1047
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:04,927
Historically you should have more nuclear weapons to keep the United States from invading you

1048
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:11,071
I don't want people to have any. I don't want nuclear weapons at all no absolutely not

1049
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,607
Absolutely not

1050
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,655
Yeah it does make sense

1051
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,471
For a power in the contacts

1052
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
Text of

1053
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,543
Heightening tensions

1054
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,871
I feel like we should make it so no one will attack us because it looks like

1055
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,919
Summit

1056
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:33,855
Everybody's everybody's pumping out Iraq war propaganda about the understand that

1057
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:37,951
I would prefer we take another Direction with it and deescalate thing

1058
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,255
Onana on a larger

1059
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,839
I get that thinking and that's thinking that is

1060
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,607
Behind that

1061
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:51,007
That comment not that if you look into the lab will nuke you

1062
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
Take that again

1063
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,079
Kissinger was like we got to have this

1064
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,687
Why like listening to Alex's kind of a dead end

1065
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:03,807
It's because there is a reality that you should be aware of this Newsweek story you know that is

1066
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,087
These kinds of

1067
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,135
Conversations are happy

1068
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,695
Or making comments

1069
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,023
It will be an official Outlets are in iPads that are like

1070
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:17,631
We should bulk up our defenses to ensure that no one attacks up that's f***** up

1071
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,703
It doesn't necessarily reflect the government policy

1072
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,007
But it is something that is worthwhile

1073
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,543
If you listen to Alex

1074
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,591
The weight of the story is going to be presented

1075
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Do you is

1076
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:34,015
The Chinese are so afraid of us investigating the Wuhan lab

1077
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,295
Ryan

1078
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
Is a Jetta

1079
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:40,159
Because what what do you do with that information it's not true

1080
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,439
Nope

1081
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,487
If it's it's ridiculous now it's just

1082
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:47,071
You saying see they're so overreacting to it it's obvious

1083
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,887
That's all he's he's not asking a question

1084
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,167
Not saying anything

1085
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,191
What he's really doing is

1086
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:52,959
They would

1087
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,263
Hey they wouldn't act like this

1088
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,079
If they weren't the cause of the Wuhan lab leak

1089
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:58,847
Beyond

1090
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,871
You know basically

1091
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:07,295
So this episode Alex is really obsessed with her interview the Judge Joe Brown

1092
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:12,671
No no no you cannot see the only point of it is that Judge Joe Brown think

1093
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,207
That

1094
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,231
The stand

1095
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,511
Larry Joe Brown

1096
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:21,375
I used to watch Joe Brown a lot because it was on during the day

1097
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,655
Me and my friends would sit around

1098
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,935
Get high

1099
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703
What's judge

1100
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:29,311
I love you just got up from a nap

1101
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:33,919
So annoyed by everybody in the courtroom

1102
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,735
But you mean to tell me

1103
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,551
I liked his demeanor quite a bit

1104
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:43,135
But here's my okay so just Brown says the bidens erase

1105
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
If judge

1106
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,951
Judy comes out and says bye

1107
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:51,071
It's not a racist what we got to go to judge Mills Lane

1108
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:56,959
How beautiful

1109
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,847
Yeah I mean look no disrespect

1110
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,895
To Judge Joe Brown

1111
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
You're the judge and all but

1112
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,199
I think

1113
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,991
When it comes to

1114
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:14,367
With your real treasure is easy don't think you can be on those shows and I'll be a real judge

1115
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,647
I think you have to be a judge

1116
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
I don't know if that's

1117
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,743
True that might not be true

1118
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,535
Definitely.

1119
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
She is a judge

1120
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,983
Maybe Judge Joe Brown's a realtor I think he is

1121
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,799
You get to be a judge and then get on TV

1122
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,591
We should explore this more but you don't

1123
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:37,407
It sounds really f***** up to me now that I think about it so they've been

1124
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:42,527
Practicing judges food on the bench for a long time and then they get a TV show that seems wrong

1125
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,831
It did seem strange but it also is a good

1126
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,391
Good career path you're not wrong okay

1127
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,159
Joe Brown

1128
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
Is he

1129
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,511
Joe Brown real judge

1130
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:58,143
Judge Joe Brown is a former American lawyer and television personality

1131
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:01,727
He is a former Shelby County Tennessee Criminal Court judge

1132
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:05,823
Former Arbiter of the arbitration based reality show judge.

1133
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,431
He was formerly a judge in Tennessee

1134
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:14,271
Okay yeah I would imagine that if you're ever on one of those shows

1135
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,551
You're not an ass

1136
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:21,951
That's where I got confused

1137
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:26,559
Like what I filled out my Chicago ballot and I was voting for judges of

1138
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:30,911
Then another that connected to my mind was obviously I was voting for a Judge Mathis

1139
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,471
No I didn't

1140
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,823
Yeah I think it's a good sort of late-career moves your someone

1141
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,103
Charisma and

1142
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:39,871
Can.

1143
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,407
Court hearings fun

1144
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,175
Absolutely

1145
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,711
We will meet again

1146
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:50,111
To settle this next to issue okay

1147
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,647
And now it's going to happen in

1148
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,415
That's not good

1149
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,231
Fauci and Bill Gates are being destroyed as we speak

1150
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:59,071
I told you months ago they will be politically

1151
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,407
Someday I believe will watch them both hung in public

1152
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,991
What kind of China

1153
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,343
It's not communist China just read the new customer

1154
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
Read message

1155
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
See

1156
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,767
See how that information ends up being used

1157
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,815
That's silly

1158
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
Dude

1159
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,143
Does everybody know that

1160
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,679
That like now in

1161
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,471
In the modern world

1162
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:41,567
When when they see like public hangings in a

1163
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,847
The TV show

1164
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,895
The movie or

1165
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,919
In real life

1166
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
Those are the bad guys

1167
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
The good guys are never doing public hangings

1168
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,367
Yeah it seems rare

1169
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,671
What's up

1170
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,719
Yeah I mean book

1171
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,791
I struggle with this

1172
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
Because

1173
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,351
On the one hand

1174
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,679
If anything that Alex was saying we're true

1175
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:12,287
These people are enemies of humanity you're not wrong you're not wrong

1176
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:17,919
That's true I mean if they are wiping out millions of people that is Drew I do think that you should

1177
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
Probably

1178
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:22,271
I think so

1179
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:26,623
I think that there's a narrow area where death penalties might be

1180
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:30,463
Maybe we go ahead and genocidaires can get the death

1181
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:33,279
I'm fine with that I feel like that's an arguable

1182
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,607
As a as a relatively Fair solution

1183
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,983
Spectacle part I do I I certainly don't think that would be healthy

1184
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,263
If you

1185
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,311
If you didn't do that everyone becomes

1186
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:48,383
B receives about how it didn't really happen

1187
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:54,783
Traffic reports still alive

1188
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,319
Negotiate

1189
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:59,647
We don't have to we don't have to

1190
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,695
Indicated that he's okay with a lesser pain

1191
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,463
Okay good

1192
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,255
You have to say it I don't want any harm

1193
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,791
Bill Gates and fauci

1194
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,983
I want them arrested

1195
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,799
I want their record brought I want

1196
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,823
Public trial

1197
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,383
I want a jury Define

1198
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,455
Them guilty because he has overwhelming

1199
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,599
They are incredible villains

1200
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,159
I don't think execution

1201
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:38,047
Let them spend the rest of their miserable lives

1202
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,327
Publix

1203
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,095
Play

1204
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,959
Animals in a cage

1205
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,055
There we go again

1206
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,639
Joe Biden

1207
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
Alright man

1208
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
I'm okay

1209
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:58,015
That was all right what a gracious guy though is offering life in prison

1210
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,575
It is nice to to say a lick

1211
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
Look

1212
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:04,415
This requires a public hanging

1213
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,439
The Mandarin

1214
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,743
We will keep you in a dog

1215
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
For the rest of your life

1216
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,583
And that people walk by

1217
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,447
This is what happens when you release plagues we put you in a box

1218
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
Yeah that's about right

1219
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,543
Alex has Behati

1220
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,567
Sequins on

1221
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,615
Who are a couple of twins

1222
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,895
As their name suggests

1223
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,431
Yeah

1224
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
They are conservatives

1225
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,247
And

1226
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,271
Jon Huntsman

1227
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:32,831
Best joke

1228
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,367
He used to be

1229
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
Hodgetwins

1230
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,487
Today is somebody penny

1231
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
Said about Chris

1232
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,583
The climbers you don't want to

1233
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,887
Celebrate that why y'all want to

1234
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
Celebrate something that happened

1235
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,959
100 years ago

1236
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,263
The talking about the

1237
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,335
Don't reason why they want to celebrate these things

1238
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,639
Ambisome anything

1239
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,431
Joe Biden in the den

1240
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,967
Democrats in people after sex

1241
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,015
Just going to give them reparations a restitution

1242
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
You're not going to see any in it

1243
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,575
Any of that

1244
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,599
Till this day black

1245
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,367
White folks

1246
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,647
Black labels and Vulcan

1247
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,439
Umbrellas with these people

1248
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
But doing today

1249
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,511
Yeah using them mentally enslave them

1250
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,607
The only reason why Joe Biden's they're actually asked him

1251
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,887
Preparation for what happened

1252
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,679
Like to survive

1253
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:34,271
Somebody's doing All-American shutdown pipeline

1254
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:38,111
Last year

1255
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:44,511
It's horseshit that Alex is saying like yeah of course

1256
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,535
Why why

1257
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,559
Why Alex

1258
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
Why

1259
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,119
You don't believe that for a second

1260
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,679
You're saying that because you know that like

1261
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:52,959
Saying

1262
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,727
Don't

1263
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,543
Yeah absolutely

1264
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
Mel

1265
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,359
A baseball should go whizzing right by his head

1266
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:02,687
Just as I like warning shot do it again man

1267
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:05,759
Claim that you're fine with doing some people reparation

1268
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,319
Break through the air

1269
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,855
That one of the reasons

1270
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,135
That's the Tulsa

1271
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,927
Masquerade

1272
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,207
Particular is

1273
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:18,047
Something that is brought up in the conversation about reparation he's because it wasn't

1274
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,095
Justin attack on people losing attack on black

1275
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,887
Exactly

1276
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,935
Do you know one of the reasons

1277
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,215
That's

1278
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:28,799
Some of these issues have rippled through our country's history so

1279
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,823
Resident please

1280
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,591
Because

1281
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,407
Of the exclusion

1282
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,199
Of non-white people

1283
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,991
From participation in the mark

1284
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,527
And generational wealth

1285
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
Exactly

1286
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:43,135
That was a giant attack on exactly that

1287
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,439
And I think

1288
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:48,255
Pretending that you don't understand that is a little bit silly

1289
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,559
Yeah I think if you're a commentator than

1290
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,863
You're going to come around and say that

1291
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,447
People only remember that event

1292
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,471
Because they want

1293
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,495
Thought something

1294
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
Yeah they want

1295
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,823
How to Gilt biting into giving them some

1296
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,407
I think you're a piece of s*** I think I think that's a shity opinion

1297
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,431
That like

1298
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,967
Idea of Alec

1299
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:12,831
Sexy even being like well you know there's two survivors so yeah they the government should help them out or something

1300
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
Sing like that

1301
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,391
That's absolutely missing

1302
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,951
The point of wiping out generational wealth

1303
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,975
You did there not

1304
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,047
Two survivors of that Massacre there are

1305
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,095
Countless survivors of that Massacre

1306
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,143
That's the point

1307
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,007
Apologies

1308
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,543
He's a

1309
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,359
Voiding specifically and kind of like

1310
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,127
Detracting

1311
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,407
Is what I was

1312
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:41,759
While at the same time confusingly saying that it's okay to give something

1313
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,783
Take to those two people

1314
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,831
Again I would just ask

1315
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:47,135
If I were anyways H it in a position

1316
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,671
Hodgetwins

1317
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,791
Please say why that's okay and it's not okay another absolutely

1318
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,375
So these people had something

1319
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,655
Right right

1320
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,727
So they deserve recompense and some for correct

1321
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,775
Okay

1322
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,847
Take this a step further I don't understand there are more steps

1323
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,383
It's not

1324
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,479
So there's been a lot of talk about Heather's coming in Dyckman

1325
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,807
Trump going down July

1326
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,087
Rodger Stone

1327
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,391
Alex has been

1328
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,719
Warning people that he's going down on the 4th of July

1329
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:26,047
No I thought he was going to be reinstated no no no

1330
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,887
Maybe who knows maybe they'll indict him and magically like

1331
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,167
Like a Phoenix Rising

1332
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,703
From the Ashes who will become president

1333
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,727
That could be

1334
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,495
Maybe

1335
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,543
Maybe the Democrats just want a third go in a

1336
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:39,103
You know like a f***** up the first two real bad

1337
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,943
However The Hodgetwins

1338
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,223
They do not think that this is

1339
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,247
Is real

1340
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,015
Distraction

1341
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,295
I don't I don't

1342
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:50,111
Getting indictment

1343
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,135
Vetted president

1344
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,463
Everybody's investigate this man they have found nothing

1345
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
I'll be shocked if

1346
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,559
Doing anything

1347
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,583
That exists just to destroy

1348
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,399
Doing the artists in Arizona in the

1349
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:06,239
That's what they really don't it's just a distraction what Bonds doing in Tulsa

1350
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,263
I mean

1351
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
Everybody on Main

1352
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,055
Mainstream media on the left

1353
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,103
Just lost their minds.

1354
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:11,871
Talking about

1355
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,151
Woman they started

1356
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,431
Ashley aadatan de Brazil

1357
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,759
I'm like I don't understand why they will be so UPS

1358
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,039
Unless they tryna

1359
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,111
If you're so sure

1360
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,647
Did Biden won that election

1361
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,463
Why don't you let

1362
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,743
Everybody go in

1363
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:28,767
The result

1364
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:29,791
This show

1365
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:30,559
Entail

1366
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,839
Everybody that's on the right

1367
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,631
How stupid and naive

1368
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,959
You show everybody

1369
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:37,983
In America

1370
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
Hello

1371
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,503
What's going to be on car

1372
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,063
That mean that's just a dumb argument

1373
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,367
Take the exact idea and

1374
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:57,439
Just place it wherever you want with the story that you written for yourself

1375
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:01,535
Good example of this or whether or not there's any truth to it is

1376
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:05,631
Why won't Trump release all this financial information if he

1377
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,191
Has to be afraid of

1378
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,519
And that's a story that you can write for yourself it may be more likely than

1379
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,055
This whole election was

1380
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,359
Metal rod for whatever but

1381
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:21,759
Pretending that you know what would be found if someone looked at something

1382
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,551
I'm at why they're not look

1383
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,111
Looking at it is just a dishonest

1384
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:27,903
Kind of game

1385
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,183
Yeah I mean

1386
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,975
The thing about that though is its

1387
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,767
Eminently reasonable from what we

1388
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
We dunno

1389
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:40,191
Is that if you really went through just about any billionaires know any billionaires finances sooner or later you

1390
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:40,959
Find some

1391
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:46,335
I'm crying like not like maybe not a big crime maybe not nothing but you'd be like

1392
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,871
There's no way that you can

1393
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,943
Get to be a billionaire without something along the way being f*****

1394
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,503
I understand that and I think

1395
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,527
That you could make

1396
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
An argument

1397
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,575
For what you might

1398
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:02,975
Expect to find but I don't think that you could argue definitively in the way that they're arguing China deflate this is what you would

1399
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,303
The Trump won the election from history about elections

1400
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:09,375
Especially this one it is really hard to cheat

1401
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,655
The entire country

1402
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,959
Yeah really tough maybe impossible

1403
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
Also

1404
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
This

1405
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
Same

1406
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,823
Pattern of

1407
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,383
Why won't you let every everyone invest

1408
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,431
Instigate this you must be afraid of what's underneath

1409
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,479
You were just to apply that

1410
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:28,063
The Trump baby like no no he can't have it because that's why

1411
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,111
It'll be a hundred reasons why

1412
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,903
This is not the same thing

1413
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,487
Yeah your b******* argument of like

1414
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:39,071
They have a real opportunity to make conservatives look stupid.

1415
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,631
Now get the f*** out of here that's Pro

1416
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,679
The f****** you dick

1417
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,959
Speaking of trolling

1418
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:49,823
Wouldn't Alan West Betty Wright governor of Texas

1419
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,359
Hell yeah

1420
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:58,271
Just after this episode

1421
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:04,927
It's probably at least partially due to Fallout permit and attending and speaking at the qanon conference last week where am I

1422
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:08,255
Flynn said there's no reason that what happened in Myanmar shouldn't happen here

1423
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:12,095
You didn't serve for Cherries long for a long time

1424
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,399
Time in his time and in that position

1425
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:18,751
You changed the GOP of Texas's slogan to We Are The Storm

1426
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,543
Which is about his over to reference

1427
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,359
Wow

1428
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:28,991
I would West is a terrible terrible choice for a leader but given Alex's Embrace of Marjorie Taylor Greene lately

1429
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:33,343
He's kind of seeing the political utility of seeing these folks is like a new Tea Party

1430
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,647
I think that you might tell you might

1431
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,671
Expect to see more of that

1432
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,719
50/50 shot Cornel West

1433
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,511
Could become governor of Texas by

1434
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,839
Like that is honestly they don't

1435
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
Don't know

1436
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,631
They don't know

1437
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:48,959
So Alex wants Trump to get back on

1438
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,239
Social media

1439
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,263
Something to respond to good

1440
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,031
Set a time

1441
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:52,799
Talking about

1442
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:59,199
Everything was better for us when people were constantly talking about Trump same argument that they make

1443
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:03,295
About the media saying like Trump is going to get indicted

1444
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,879
Trump is driving ratings he's good for ratings of the doc about Trump

1445
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,927
You know you're doing the same thing right

1446
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,975
You know yeah

1447
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:14,047
They wanted to get back on social media and The Hodgetwins

1448
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,607
Interesting Theory as to why that hasn't happened

1449
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,911
Social media

1450
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,959
Billion followers on cab

1451
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,239
If you join Gab

1452
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:26,079
Tomorrow get 10 million the site works good they've got the bugs out

1453
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,127
We need to get a message to Trump

1454
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,223
Hundred thousand followers

1455
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,319
Interested

1456
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:42,207
On these other platforms he needs to be on he needs to be out there instead of

1457
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,095
Right now in Big Jake

1458
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,887
Banned from every

1459
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:50,911
Social media

1460
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,215
Communicate

1461
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,567
American yeah maybe he's

1462
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,615
I thought he had some time

1463
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,407
China social media platform in the works

1464
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,711
Maybe that's what he's waiting to

1465
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,527
Lady body seed and not somebody else's

1466
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,831
He wants his own

1467
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:15,231
Fine so Trump is going to roll out his own social media site which ultimately turned out to be a Blog on his website those

1468
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,255
So roundly mocked

1469
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:19,071
But it was taken down permanently less than a month after lunch

1470
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,655
It was so poorly done the Trump staff had to climb but there's a

1471
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,447
Prince social media think he's working on

1472
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
And it actually wasn't

1473
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,751
Embarrassment After All In

1474
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,287
Is wow

1475
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:32,639
It was the blog version of the four c's

1476
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,431
Brimstone

1477
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,735
This is it for the episode

1478
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,503
Unlike

1479
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,319
Honestly he just interviews The Hodgetwins for the rest of the

1480
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,599
Is it his time and then

1481
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,391
Gerald Celente takes over

1482
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,999
This wasn't about

1483
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,559
I would say

1484
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:54,143
But his emails ethics I can I mean

1485
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:54,911
Wow

1486
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:58,495
Dropping the ball

1487
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,799
I suppose that's about a stirring an admission of

1488
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,359
The emails being a giant nothing as you can

1489
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,127
Could possibly go

1490
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,407
Like

1491
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:11,039
Because they don't it doesn't even need to be true it's never needed to be true

1492
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:14,879
That's the way you can lie about any of it and they're still just like

1493
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,927
I don't think this one has legs

1494
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,767
I feel like that's what people are coming to the conclusion right now

1495
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,559
Feel

1496
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
Like

1497
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
A big whale

1498
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,679
And you know what here's the thing to like

1499
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,239
The way that it feels like a big wave

1500
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,007
From

1501
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,055
Everything that I've been able to tell the thing

1502
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:36,127
Alex's responds to Yorkshire

1503
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,687
That's a real problem

1504
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,711
Cuz

1505
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,015
There should be something in there

1506
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,599
That's really damning is any of the stuff that Alex was saying is

1507
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,367
True

1508
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,647
There should be

1509
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,927
Something that is

1510
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,207
Bucked up

1511
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,559
There should be like a message between him and his Chinese handlers

1512
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,583
Totally

1513
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:58,911
Cuz then what you're saying is like the okay okay

1514
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,679
So

1515
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,447
You got

1516
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,007
All of his private emails now

1517
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,799
Man you got all this information

1518
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:05,823
This is the

1519
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,103
Proof that you are looking

1520
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,383
4 and none of it

1521
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,663
Backs up what you're saying

1522
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,455
So you then have to say like

1523
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:16,319
No no secret email

1524
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,903
The point of ever leaking anything if it doesn't prove what

1525
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,951
Like you're just going to say the secret

1526
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,719
It goes back to

1527
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,535
Being like you got a real opportunity to prove

1528
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,583
Conservatives are idiots right here

1529
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,607
Doing it for us

1530
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,215
Yeah if you have this giant to crotch

1531
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,239
Is it weird that Alex loves

1532
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:37,823
To use the great work emails that have come out

1533
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
That

1534
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,639
Banquet beef

1535
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,431
Something that you could use to

1536
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,455
Builder

1537
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:46,783
Narratives that you've been building forever

1538
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:51,135
You think that this would give you some kind of an insight into what was going on and instead

1539
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:55,231
So much of the emails that I've read are very indicative of

1540
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:58,047
Learning along the way and like

1541
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,839
The changing awareness is

1542
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
Like

1543
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,143
Beginning

1544
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,935
People did not know a whole lot

1545
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,703
In

1546
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,263
I don't know it kind of

1547
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,311
Weirdly

1548
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,615
Reinforces reality

1549
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,151
I mean from

1550
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,711
From what I understand it is really like

1551
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,295
Reinforced my I suppose

1552
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:24,159
Confidence in the people who are doing

1553
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,439
Because

1554
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,231
At every point in time you know

1555
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,767
Obviously looking back

1556
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,047
You would say obviously

1557
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:35,167
If we knew everything we would have done it differently hoping they handled it better duh

1558
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,215
But the way that you see the

1559
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,495
Progression there is

1560
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,031
Exactly how you would want

1561
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,311
People to do it as we

1562
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,591
We get more data where

1563
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:47,711
Finding out whether or not this data is useful or non useful we're taking the data that we can use

1564
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:49,503
And we're using it to refine our process

1565
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,831
We're taking that refine process putting it back into the system

1566
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:56,415
Getting useful and unusual data and then refining it a little further

1567
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
And it's like that

1568
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,719
Exactly how I want

1569
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,999
People to work

1570
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,279
That's all I want

1571
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:06,655
Like science did you hear anybody

1572
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,959
You just making these giant guesses

1573
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,103
No point in time in the emails was it like

1574
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:19,711
Hey we don't know anything about Hydrochloric win or how it works just yet but

1575
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,503
What you go ahead and say is great

1576
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:27,647
You know like it didn't happen like that and the fact that it happened for other people like that should give you giant

1577
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,439
A realization that there

1578
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,463
Dumb

1579
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,743
But that won't happen

1580
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,023
Probably not cuz it would be

1581
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,303
Hard you have to think

1582
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Yep

1583
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:40,959
It was kind of a bummer cuz I was hoping for a little bit more stuff to dig into as opposed to

1584
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:46,591
New salmon that you read all those emails

1585
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:51,711
On your gun for a werewolf it ain't clear

1586
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:56,575
Profile of a metaphor

1587
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:59,391
But I also like I didn't read all of them

1588
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,695
But I read enough to get a very general sense

1589
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:03,999
What a lot of these are

1590
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:04,767
Mnn

1591
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,583
The people are talking about

1592
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,119
In the conspiracy sites

1593
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,399
And Alex's

1594
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,423
Just doing nothing here

1595
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,191
On the 2nd

1596
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
Bummer

1597
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:17,311
Yep maybe maybe later or maybe maybe

1598
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,591
Leo zagami will come up

1599
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,383
Confirm to work with

1600
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:23,455
Let's hope I need a big swing out of these emails cuz yeah

1601
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:26,271
Is so distant this isn't even a check swing

1602
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,295
This is a whip

1603
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:33,695
Yeah and you know this is this is also you know still a little bit like on the shorter side of an episode

1604
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,463
Still like

1605
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,791
Getting back adjusted after vacation

1606
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:41,119
I've been on vacation for a very long time and I did not realize some of the

01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:48,031
Sleep disturbance oh man of the challenges and appreciates folks
