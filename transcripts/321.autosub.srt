1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,032
Sit around

3
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:12,800
Beverages

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,080
Little bit

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
About

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,176
Alex Jones

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,224
Drawing

8
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Intro out and I don't want

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,672
I don't want

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,024
Steamrolled me with a bunch of ummagawd Federer so great

11
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,960
What's up

12
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
Have you ever told somebody to go back to where they

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,104
I mean I know I know why you're at

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
Asking me that question

15
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,200
Certainly relevant here on this record

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
I don't know I don't

17
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,744
It was a s*** head stupid kids

18
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,048
I pray that it wasn't

19
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,376
Usually your ethnically

20
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,168
Go back to their home

21
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
Portland

22
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,384
I imagined I had it at some point

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,408
Sticks out to me

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,224
I don't think I remember witnessing it

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,064
Almost non-stop bases

26
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
Small town

27
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,624

28
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,976
And I don't think I've ever actually I think

29
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Mayhem

30
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,280
No I don't think I've ever said it

31
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
Sure

32
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
Completely different kind

33
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,384
Caught up in love

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,992
America get out now my family see that was the whole thing

35
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
My family was all into that

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,880
My Act of rebellion

37
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
Unfortunately

38
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,096
Regeneration

39
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
To get out

40
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
But

41
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
Stretch episodes

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
To go over

43
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,880
The password is going on

44
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
Deer in this late February stretch

45
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
Going on to movies except

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,936
I don't think he was still late 90s

47
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
Comeback

48
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,592
Inflight seen a couple times around

49
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
Kicking around

50
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,712
Marquis guide 2013

51
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,296
You starring in The Scorpion King

52
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,856
F*** I wish I remembered exactly what I think

53
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,904
Espina and the rockets fight at Wrestlemania

54
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
2013

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,232
Where

56
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
That's fight between

57
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,352
Alberto Del Rio

58
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,656
Did not manifest

59
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,728
Third to last message

60
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:27,360
Yeah they don't really care about their belts whatever their star power

61
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:32,992
What are we doing this I do believe sincerely

62
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
Something is really big

63
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
Going on

64
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
I think

65
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
You get a sense

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
Grommet from Alex

67
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Feelings of

68
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
The show up

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,328
Thank God were

We're getting it.

72
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,888
Before we get to

73
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
Today's episode

74
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,728
Take a moment to say thank you

75
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,800
When we talked about how I was going to move

76
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
I need to move

77
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
Supportive messages

78
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Drake generously

79
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,016
Little donations I really appreciate it very much

80
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
Ain't that means a lot

81
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,648
Particularly the people who are saying you're like I went through

82
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
A similar situation

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,488
You gotta keep your head up

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,536
Things will be better on the other side

85
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
Thank you very much

86
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655

Poor

96
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:57,215

00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Jos

107
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,343
Money off at heroin

108
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,207
Freakishly large

109
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
We would appreciate

110
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
So Jordan

111
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,871
Today what we're doing what we are going over February

112
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
3/4

113
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
26

114
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
2013

115
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Alright

116
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
This is a very exciting.

117
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
I'm Alex

118
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
Is really

119
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
F******

120
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,463
All over the place in terms of how desperately he wants more people to pay

121
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,047
Hugo's on some other people

122
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
He has some big gas

123
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
All very clearly

124
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
Expresses an interest of like

125
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
I really get the word out

126
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,775
But here before we

127
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Context drop

128
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
Sucker

129
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
Brian

130
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Good religion

131
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
Is religion

132
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,647
His religion includes calling you a

133
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
Dumpy branch

134
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,511
You are a piece

135
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,375
4th February

136
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,007
It's not really relevant to a ton

137
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
Stop but it is

138
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Expression of Alex

139
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,871
His beliefs about how

140
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
System is already

141
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Black people

142
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
So we don't need

143
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
It's implied that he

144
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
You sort of minimizing

145
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,623
To defend

146
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:29,023
Minorities right

147
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
I think this

148
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
You get a sense

149
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Alex

150
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
Uses White

151
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
And Western culture kind of energy

152
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,263
Which is an important as he

153
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Tried to pretend all the time

154
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
Systems going

155
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,951
Enchiladas

156
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
So you have

157
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
Kodak blacks and others

158
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
Yeah

159
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
The other which is

160
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
Western Towing

161
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:25,087
Which is presented in direct opposition to the Black Panthers

162
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Pharaoh's people down

163
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,159
Clear what's going on

164
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
So I found that to be in

165
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Tristan butt

166
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
Kind of secondary

167
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
To what what else

168
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
What's going on

169
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Towards the beginning of the episode

170
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
Makes it amazing a noun

171
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
That I stink

172
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
That means we are getting close

173
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
Toupee

174
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,599
5% chance

175
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,167
Story

176
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
Alex has a

177
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,095
Game-changing story

178
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
And I'll tell you

179
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:47,519
I have no idea

180
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,663
I have a theory I think it's

181
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
Hidden camera

182
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
You couldn't be embellished

183
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Or it could just be fishing

184
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,719
Like literally

185
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
Yeah

186
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,071
I'm not entirely sure

187
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
I haven't listened

188
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Too far enough

189
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
Should know what his

190
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
News stories

191
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
Text

192
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Kind of lead me

193
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Maybe

194
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
He's got a little bit of a bird with

195
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
Brings up

196
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
Wanting to take people's guns

197
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Have you know

198
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Jordan

199
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
I love a quote

200
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
Autoflower strains

201
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
It's supposed to be from the US

202
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Arms

203
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
UN website

204
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
So

205
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
Made up quote

206
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:35,039
Which doesn't appear at all in either the arms nor from the report from the July 20th

207
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,879
One un report that was titled

208
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Small Arms

209
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,231
Those two things or something and Alex doesn't know the difference

210
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
Or intentionally consist

211
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,095
Plate most likely on purpose

212
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
To make it harder for his listeners to

213
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,287
The arms trade treaty from

214
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
And you have the July 2001 illicit trade

215
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,383
Small Arms report

216
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
Which is

217
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,455
Use the date from that

218
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
Is it to the treaty

219
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
Completely different things

220
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
This quote is definitely not from either of those um publication

221
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,207
When I looked into it more many websites trace the call back to it

222
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
2004 debate

223
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
It was held at King's College in London

224
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,375
Between Executive Vice President of the NRA Wayne LaPierre

225
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
And Rebecca Peters

226
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Beheaded

227
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
The international Acts

228
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
Action Network on Small Arms

229
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,799
Well I am

230
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
It was active in big

231
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,175
Parkview at the Fishel body within the US

232
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,271
William up here himself has lobbied the UN on behalf of the NRA

233
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
You can make the argument that the two of them are on

234
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Being representative

235
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
None of the kids

236
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,999
Christian right-wing websites can get their citation right on this quote

237
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
Ronpaulforums

238
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,191
Got message boards frequently side is being said by a representative

239
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
College

240
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
You don't seem to agree on the

241
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,359
Some say that it's July 2001 most likely because they've mix

242
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
It's been up with the illicit trade in Small Arms

243
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
Father's Day the debate was held in 1993

244
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,599
Most likely to associated with the passage of the Brady handgun violence prevention Act of that

245
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
What website I found called Liberty

246
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:22,047
1993 while simultaneously linking of the debate

247
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
From 2000

248
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
4

249
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
F******

250
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
Five stars

251
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,615
It's so sloppy but it also really feels like they're trying to confuse people about the Genesis of this quote

252
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
No one gets

253
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,479
Citation right because they want the argument to be that the un's

254
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,599
Get rid of guns because it threatens the full control of

255
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,159
The quote is a whole mess

256
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Useful

257
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
If it were appropriately cited as being said by a lobbyist

258
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Senate debate

259
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,423
That's not nearly as nefarious or scary

260
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
Of course which is why you got to lie

261
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
There's another problem.

262
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:12,991
There's this debate the great un gun debate it's 90 minutes long and I watched it twice

263
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
And preparations

264
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,319
Episode

265
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,927
Never heard Rebecca Peter say anything about civilian gun ownership

266
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
The power Monopoly of the state

267
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,583
That sentiment is out of step with Rebecca's

268
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,423
However it's very in line with the accusations that we

269
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
Pierre makes about what Rebecca

270
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Disposition

271
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
Secretly are

272
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:40,895
But it doesn't match up with what she's actually saying okay so we're dealing with

273
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Quotes

274
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Is being a

275
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
Attributed to the US

276
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
Actually

277
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
Supposed to be from a debate

278
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
But actually wasn't said by the person that it's a

279
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:01,119
Attributed to the other person was lying about that other person

280
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
It appears that way

281
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:09,311
Okay arriving into this is a real quote from the even from Rebecca Peters in Urdu

282
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,479
This in my best estimation is it was fabricated out of whole cloth after the 2004 debate

283
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
To preemptively attack the common Small Arms

284
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,623
Treaty and the UN created rules about the illicit Small Arms

285
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
I'm straight

286
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,719
Primero circulated in right-wing militia type internet communities

287
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,071
Hey given elevation credibility by being Amplified by people like Alex Jones

288
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
And attached

289
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
Two figures like Ron Paul

290
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
It's all a lie

291
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
As far as I can

292
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
Is not fun

293
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
No also interesting note in that debate

294
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
Wayne LaPierre

295
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
Cannot stop accusing Rebecca Peters

296
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,943
And her organization to being funded by internationalist like George Soros

297
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
Great great

298
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
In 2000

299
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
4 weight is way ahead of the curve on the Soros

300
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:59,487
At least for non-european fascist to you yeah we talked about

301
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Wow

302
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,839
Alex talking about Soros for

303
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
11 years

304
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:11,263
No and I mean like was a 2011 I believe Glenn Beck

305
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,311
Hot water for

306
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Segment

307
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,871
What an idiot

308
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
I think it was

309
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,991
Real big notable one was Bill O'Reilly

310
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
Should about Soros but that was three years after this

311
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,463
Oreos are regularly

312
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:36,095
Mostly European one

313
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
Pretty as the curve for

314
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
For Americans

315
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,727
So he's got a big

316
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Big thing going on

317
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,103
I mentioned our last episode that story about how

318
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
All the veterans are getting letters

319
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
Need to turn in

320
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,527
Veterans call in

321
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,623
Alex tells a story about going to this

322
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
The academy

323
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,487
I believe is the name of it okay

324
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,887
He overheard some guy

325
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
The fat

326
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,151
I heard an old guys related to Ron Paul's

327
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,247
F*** that.

328
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,343
You you can't even do that the better part of the story though is when he's at the same motor shop

329
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Man

330
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,647
Everyone treats him like a

331
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,599
So like

332
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,159
This is why there's value in Alex

333
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,487
She's like just automatically be defensive about everything just

334
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
Fight it doesn't matter

335
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,839
Because he recognizes that there's good arguments

336
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,191
Measures

337
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
Control but

338
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,287
They're not going to use it appropriately so

339
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,151
No gun controls whatsoever doing this for a reason

340
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,967
Other than what they're saying

341
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,551
Dangerous level of

342
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
Pretended your psychic

343
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
Yeah

344
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,511
Because I mean what I hear that all I really hear is I recognize that there's a really good arguments against my position

345
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,607
And I know I'm going to lose them

346
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
Yell at people

347
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,727
Just recognized

348
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
There are good arguments

349
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,311
African regulations for safe

350
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
F***

351
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
Him

352
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,967
I do like that I do like the balls on them

353
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Just like

354
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
Oh yeah I know I don't know

355
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,599
There are good arguments but it is 100% +

356
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,439
Impossible for the other side to make any argument in good faith

357
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,487
They are always lying

358
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,815
Happier with zero gun laws

359
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,911
Then I am with anyone even being like

360
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
We should do a background

361
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
Lame

362
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Not good

363
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,079
It's pretty disappointing

364
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
I would say

365
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,663
Not quite as disappointing

366
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
As a narrative

367
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
Takes over the show actor

368
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
Department of Justice memo

369
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
NRA

370
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
As I recalled

371
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
Did the Tylenol

372
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,535
That this f****** memo is literal proof

373
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
That they are ready and about

374
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,375
To ban all guns

375
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
Let's see this

376
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,815
Oh my God

377
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:00,543
Getting ready plan to confiscate all guns

378
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Truth

379
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
The loaded Bowl

380
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:06,687
Question is called select firearm violence

381
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
Prevention strategies

382
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,527
I know where the document doesn't call for complicating

383
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,623
This is a descriptive report not a prescriptive one

384
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,208
It's not arguing for any particular strategy rather it's looking at

385
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,536
Various strategies that have been employed or could be employed

386
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
Engagement how they worked

387
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,120
What the strong points were and what the limitation

388
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,216
In the part of the report about gun buyback

389
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,544
It specifically points at the gun buybacks aren't really effective

390
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Unless they're quote

391
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
Masses and coupled with a ban

392
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
That doesn't mean

393
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
That's what should be done

394
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,296
It's just descriptive lie saying that went BuyBacks have been done

395
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:49,696
Historically haven't really brought in minigun and the guns that are brought back are the ones that are at a high risk

396
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Stop being used

397
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Violent crime

398
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
Describe something

399
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
Sowell

400
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
As a

401
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
Hey

402
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,680
I get the people are saying

403
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
Text but there's no point

404
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
Unless we go all the way

405
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,080
More lessor or at least supplement

406
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
Huge

407
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,904
Do paintballs market value of people

408
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
Incentive

409
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
It's it's

410
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Ridiculous

411
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,024
You can already see where this is going

412
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,328
From this

413
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
The paranoia

414
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,912
Going to possess Patriot world

415
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,752
AMA and his Department of Justice were preparing massive gun buybacks

416
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
And complete gun ban

417
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,616
This is such transparently dishonest presentation

418
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
What is exactly what you'd expect

419
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Group of people desperate to

420
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,736
Create the appearance of their guns are about to be

421
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,296
They don't really have much of a reason to

422
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
Exist as an organization

423
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,600
NRA that is

424
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,696
Aura force in public discourse is that fear isn't constantly reinforced

425
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
So any excuse to ramp it up

426
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
For them is a good

427
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Interesting

428
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
Highly suspect

429
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
This is going to play

430
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
It's Alex's feeling

431
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
Songs about Sandy Hook

432
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,472
And I think the introduction

433
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
This report

434
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
Is further evidence that he is about to get

435
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,920
Going on that report is coming in

436
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
That's whenever he

437
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,784
He's going to be like

438
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
And here's the soft launcher

439
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:26,976
Sandy Hook

440
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,560
Which possibly did involve a real victims according to him

441
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,656
He believes that is that they did that in order to push a gun controller

442
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
On January

443
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
The 4th 2013

444
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,824
So I can easily see Alex using this

445
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,616
Narrative that has now introduced

446
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
I using

447
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,944
Timing of it to build up his narrative.

448
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
The shooting was a false flag

449
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
I get the sense

450
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
This is possibly

451
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Like app

452
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,856
Piece of ground being lazy

453
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
Yeah

454
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,744
And maybe I'm just putting pieces

455
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
Together the dark really there

456
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
But it feels kind of like

457
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
That's the kind of

458
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
Every

459
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
These pieces of evidence

460
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:17,664
Line up to a perfect conclusion what we're going to do today we're going to talk about

461
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
Squirrels

462
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:23,808
And how they're bothering my neighbor has v like I need to mix it up

463
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,416
You've got your I've got a giant piece of news involves the media

464
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,256
It's going to be game-breaking if I have the ability to release it

465
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,352
The timing of this report being a couple weeks

466
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Weeks after

467
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:42,240
Just coming to the surface now here in February and February

468
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
There's a lot of there's a lot of stars aligning

469
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:52,736
It won't happen while driving

470
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:57,344
Most frustrating thing you know the destination

471
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,512
My Waze app

472
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,864
So if Alex talks about the little bit more

473
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,992
Cuz it's three pages long it's nine pages

474
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,976
What are the things that I find really interesting is that like

475
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
We have a show where we can

476
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
Can take as long or as short as

477
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,888
We want to do these episodes of

478
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
Being able to

479
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
And so does Alex

480
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,264
It's just a matter of whether or the on the radio

481
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,336
You know what you could broadcast

482
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,920
Infowars Studio says whether or not

483
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
Some

484
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,248
Station in Cocoa Beach

485
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
Is going to be up

486
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,088
So what I hear Alex

487
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
Say something like he doesn't

488
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Text clip

489
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,184
All I can hear is him making it

490
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Excuses

491
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
For not doing the

492
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,800
What do you think I think is the guiding principle of his show

493
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,104
Which is if I prove things

494
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
You we'd run out of time

495
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,784
Repeat myself over and over and over again

496
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Being demons

497
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,392
How many gal for long stretches of time about nothing I'm going to

498
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,672
Do a f****** long

499
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:43,328
Critical breakdown of the Watchmen movie lawyer for a while

500
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
It'll take too long

501
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,848
Who just believe me

502
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,712
That is a dangerous mentality while you're listening to the show in your car

503
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,760
I want you to pull out your phone

504
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:08,160
Google make sure

505
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,232
Everything that I'm saying Google

506
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,768
It's not good

507
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
Not a good way to approach

508
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
A truth based

509
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Show

510
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Yeah

511
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Seems like it's

512
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
Dealing with a

513
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
So in this next

514
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,360
Clip you know whatever you do broadcast

515
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,176
Show that the call-in show is run the risk

516
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Prank callers

517
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
Pretending that there's somebody that they're not

518
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,528
Pretends to be

519
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Celebrity

520
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
And they call in your show

521
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
That's not what happened to your

522
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,672
But Alex is worried that it might

523
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,888
Politely

524
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,064
Reset my pilot screw

525
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:25,728
Radius from the self-evident truth

526
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,824
Chanel

527
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,224
A morganatic communicate more often

528
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,344
Oh man Ted Nugent just out of nowhere calls in the show

529
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,904
Playing

530
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
Nugent appearance f*** is

531
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:53,376
What is Ted Nugent he's driving around actually loses signal at one point to another call

532
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,616
I don't care too much about what Ted says

533
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,896
It's all just like I love God

534
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,248
But there's one clip that I think is important

535
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,552
Play Ted Nugent

536
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,952
Because it revealed

537
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
Alex does

538
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:29,728
And taking too many girls of the military that have their legs in their arms their eyeballs

539
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,520
In their skin

540
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,784
Second Amendment because the Second Amendment

541
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Now

542
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,136
What's important there is the teeth and Frida

543
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,160
The Liberty

544
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,816
The only place that traces back to is the fake George Washington quote that we talked about that Alex.

545
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:02,496
Ted Nugent

546
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,824
Allegedly from an address to Congress recalls gun

547
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
The teeth of Liberty

548
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
That is a haunted person

549
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:15,040
What he's doing and he was trying to say

550
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:24,256
Outside right now

551
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,584
Looks like the teeth of Freedom Liberty

552
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,120
Is a very specific

553
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
Expression

554
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,192
In one place in one place only

555
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,544
Smoke has mythologize this fake quote

556
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,360
They don't realize they're just quoting some guy with a column

557
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,480
For Farmer tractor trailer magazine or whatever

558
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,296
Trapper Trader

559
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
Whatever it was

560
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
They dictate the recording George

561
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
They're not

562
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,768
But it's interesting because you got understand how these things were early memes

563
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,352
MacDade we write this in the same way you have these

564
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,960
You know Pepe kind of things around the internet now

565
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,752
These ideas were

566
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,824
Circulating Message Board newsletter

567
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,920
So when you trace back

568
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,968
Liberty Liberty

569
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
Alex has been

570
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
Do you know that there

571
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
Swimming in similar pond

572
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,600
So f***** up bad information

573
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,672
Militia it's

574
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,976
Information

575
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,072
I really don't want to

576
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
I don't want

577
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
The the

578
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Country

579
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
Descendant to Fascism and

580
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
And I get killed

581
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
Because

582
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,104
The song Imaginary bulshit that these guys believe it's a quotes

583
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,896
It's really annoying that they

584
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
What they believe

585
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,992
Isn't real but they still get to kill people in real life like

586
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,576
You only be able to hurt imaginary people

587
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,136
Just got on 2nd

588
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,720
Play the savior

589
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,120
Ghost

590
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
It will be because

591
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
I believe so

592
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:14,336
Alex Goes to other calls

593
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,360
This caller

594
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:22,272
I don't recognize the voice so we can't put him down as like Bible day and or old man house phone

595
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Frontier

596
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,344
Psychiatrist

597
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:30,720
Frontier psychiatrist who believes

598
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
Numerology

599
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,328
I believe the 2013

600
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
Is unlucky

601
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
The occult

602
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:44,800
Numerology of course you probably already know that man covered that at some point some time

603
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,128
I don't know if you've actually figured out a recharged is

604
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:53,760
The school and Bones picture with bush look at the clock in the back

605
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:01,952
I think something really bad going to happen in 2013 because of course you're part of the 11th Hour which would be 11

606
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:07,328
12 colonies

607
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:11,936
13 original states

608
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:17,056
Great response

609
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
Migrate

610
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:25,760
So you got a picture of George W bush bones

611
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:31,136
12 + 112

612
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:36,512
Is 2013 going to be super unlucky because I have a bunch of plan

613
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
Analysis response

614
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
Hey buddy

615
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,680
I appreciate that you like the show but I think talk to somebody because you're drawing

616
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
Hindi was f****** connection

617
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,752
Responses

618
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,104
13 is a lucky number because of 13 colonies

619
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
Man I bake my luck

620
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,688
Because I love God

621
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,016
Don't I don't remember the Bible verse where God was like

622
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
If you love me

623
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,344
Is you're going to have to make your own

624
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,624
Like I don't

625
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,416
So should the letter be

626
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
To me an indication

627
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,096
Lack of care for the people that he's into

628
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
So you know like

629
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
Obviously

630
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,680
This guy probably will

631
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
Would be looking for

632
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,728
Weird nonsense

633
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
With or without aloe

634
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,080
The reality is with the reality is Malik

635
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
Clearly part of

636
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,664
In this next clip I think we get another indication

637
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
How little he really cares

638
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,784
Is it gets another call from a guy who's been listening

639
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
For 15 years

640
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,856
Elizabeth is dismissive bulshit

641
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,768
What's today

642
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
Temperature in years

643
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704
A lot of your videos

644
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,824
Community

645
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,368
What the f*** kind of responses that even listen to the question

646
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:11,488
I doubt he did but if he had let's make let's just assume that he did listen and that was it

647
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
His response

648
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,072
I don't understand someone like Alex Jones

649
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Skin like

650
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,864
Working in

651
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,192
Who cares kind of way

652
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
This guy is calling it

653
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,776
He clearly believes the sheet you're saying

654
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
A+

655
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,128
You know I got all your books

656
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,432
What can I do to wake up my community

657
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
The color is asking me

658
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,600
How can I help

659
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,136
People with the information

660
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,928
You put out to the world

661
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,976
I do to make the world better

662
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,792
According to our agreed-upon

663
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
Ception of it

664
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,680
You know what there's no real use the people aren't on our team already they're probably not going to

665
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,240
Why haven't information War at that point

666
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:59,360
What is the point is there anything you could

667
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,152
Send me to help wake up Micah

668
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,432
Community

669
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:07,040
Azure like posters

670
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,624
Perfect place for Alex to jump into plug

671
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:15,232
For sure right

672
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:21,632
I'll help you and do that at all he was just like

673
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
Shut the fuk up

674
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,472
People aren't on board already tonight

675
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Which again

676
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,264
Already said this

677
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
After stress

678
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,336
Why do the Alex Jones Show

679
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:37,248
If people who are going to wake up at already woken up does that not imply that all you're doing is preaching to the choir

680
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,320
I guess so

681
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,600
Fair enough

682
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
Being afraid of everything

683
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:48,512
So in this 24th

684
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
Especially looking back

685
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
Real gross van

686
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
May have killed a lot of dough

687
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
If possible

688
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,312
Sew-in in this clip we here

689
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,592
Kind of a transition

690
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
And Alex's

691
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
Telling of his

692
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
Childhood violence

693
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
From being

694
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
The

695
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,808
Result of him being bullied

696
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,344
To him and Tyga

697
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
Right

698
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,672
And I don't think he understands as he

699
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
He's telling the story

700
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
The very serious difference

701
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
Between the pipes

702
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,480
It was really fun

703
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
So

704
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,248
Wow what he's describing is him initiating violence on people which

705
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,552
Is very different than the idea of self-defense

706
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,112
Like I still don't like violence and

707
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,672
Is the answer but someone is being picked on

708
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,464
You know someone tries to start a fight with him

709
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
I don't think there's really that

710
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
Much bad

711
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
You are wrong

712
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
Especially in adolescence

713
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
About fighting back

714
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:33,472
Better Avenues to go down but in the world we live in

715
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
I'm not going today

716
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
I'm not going to blame Alex

717
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
For fighting back

718
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
Going

719
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
To blame him

720
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,944
Forgo

721
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,992
Who he has determined are bullies

722
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,528
And then stopping their heads

723
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,088
Yeah very very different

724
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,392
Yeah that's that's really stuck

725
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
That's really not good

726
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,024
He seems to think that it's all the same and all very like

727
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
Appetite back

728
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
He's not

729
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,864
At a certain point you're not

730
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:07,264
You even says I went a little overboard that's f***** up

731
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,312
So we can

732
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
Paul Joseph Watson

733
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
The news story

734
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
But he is putting out here on

735
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
25th

736
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
Not facing reality

737
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
Is actually

738
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,648
I'll tell you what

739
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:41,312
Drones

740
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
Oh man

741
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,136
It should be pointed out that this

742
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
Is not the

743
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
News that Alex

744
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
Isn't that story visit

745
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,584
Is another story

746
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,912
It's another completely overblown exaggerated

747
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
Manipulative Libra

748
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Presented story

749
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
Victim

750
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
Have an oppressive government

751
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,408
The actual story is at the Department of Homeland Security released

752
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
Promotional video about us

753
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,064
Infowars angle on this story

754
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
Surprisingly

755
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:29,952
Isn't providing surveillance

756
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,048
Promotional video includes footage

757
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,120
Which they're offended

758
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,704
To quote the first paragraph from Paul Joseph Watson article

759
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
Quotes

760
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,032
The promotional video for a surveillance drone

761
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,336
Being purchased by law enforcement bodies across the country

762
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,128
Just fun

763
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,456
Spying on a private guns

764
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
Hopefully depict

765
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,528
The scenario is criminal activity

766
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,344
I don't care about the stupid story

767
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,160
The desperate attempts to make their gun obsessed

768
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,976
Community look like dogs doesn't

769
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,048
I literally have only even covering this

770
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,072
Because Alex

771
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
If you have a problem with it

772
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:14,496
Is exact same depiction of a private sale be his sponsor where to hide your guns.

773
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:18,080
Included dramatized

774
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,408
I wonder what's the difference between these two

775
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
Situation

776
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:28,576
Oh I know it's the fact it in the Hydra guns commercial the person who's purchasing the gun is a shirtless black man with over

777
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,368
Oversized dollar sign chain around his neck

778
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,976
If this is being presented as a criminal act in that video.

779
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:39,840
It was part of a compilation of reenactments including a guy using a crowbar to break

780
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
So

781
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:47,008
I was perfectly fine accepting money from people who present private gun sales to black people as a criminal act

782
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
Off the books

783
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,872
A white person might be illegal

784
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,151
Proof of tyranny

785
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
Is upon us

786
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
Is woefully transparent

787
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,551
This is nonsense

788
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Private gun

789
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:10,303
But I understand if it's too much to unpack

790
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
No

791
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:15,167
I don't know where the line isn't it I don't I don't know what my full feelings on it are

792
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:19,519
But I do know that if Alex wants to get right with God soda

793
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Could be consist

794
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,615
He's never accepted money from Hydra guns.com

795
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,943
You should have made a huge deal about the fact that in there video there depicting

796
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,015
Private gun sale to

797
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,135
Cartoonish characters

798
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,439
I every time you tell her that

799
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,487
Giants.

800
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:44,607
Buys a gun from a guy and then texted into his pants and every time I'm like

801
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,887
That cannot be

802
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
This is

803
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
That's just not possible

804
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
He doesn't care about that depicts

805
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
More important

806
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,871
It'll bickering about private gun sales

807
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,919
I think it's more important that sort of

808
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
Undercuts

809
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,527
White people haven't got

810
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,575
So in this next clip Alex gets

811
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
Religious on

812
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
Your dumbass

813
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
Man

814
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,487
We've heard him say some weird religious stuff

815
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
The past

816
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,583
Sometimes

817
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,863
I understand

818
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
This makes no sense

819
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:24,543
Just amazing

820
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:41,951
What is about

821
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,487
Buried

822
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
Average

823
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:55,263
Silicone

824
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,871
Turn the other cheek

825
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,919
The really big deal

826
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,503
Right

827
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,415
If you if you wanted anyone may follow after me

828
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
So long as their plan.

829
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,303
Legitimately like next-level f***** up but Alex thinks

830
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,095
Like Jesus didn't turn the other cheek

831
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
Yeah it's Bible because

832
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,679
You are

833
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,703
Because you was beefing

834
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,263
How do you spell receives any wasn't ready to die yet

835
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:35,455
Putting it off but then a few years later I am going to

836
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,991
Stop

837
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,783
Appears

838
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,831
2539

839
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,391
Which part of The Sermon on the Mount

840
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:50,815
He was still in the early stages of his preaching though he recently gone out to the desert and resisted the temptation.

841
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,655
Who's coming off some momentum broken into the main

842
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,959
Stream Felix for stand-ups it's kind of like

843
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:03,359
If you didn't do faces of Jeff out you don't have any late-night credit

844
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
On the desert but you're not mean

845
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
Not there yet

846
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,503
The sermon is basically the Jesus laying out with means

847
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,039
Christianity is all about

848
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:15,135
You got the Beatitudes at the beginning that be like blessed are the meek

849
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,671
For they will inherit the earth

850
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:22,047
You got some points Jesus makes about what behaviors appropriate

851
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,071
And then you get to the

852
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,095
Turning Park

853
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,655
Explicitly explained

854
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,983
In opposition to the mentality of an eye for an eye

855
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,799
References back to the Old Law of Leviticus

856
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,871
It's a revolutionary ideas pacifism the Jews of physics

857
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,663
Expressing and it's clear what do you mean

858
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,247
But I tell you to not resist an evil person

859
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,039
If anyone slaps you on the right cheek

860
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,087
Turn to them the other cheek also

861
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,135
And if anyone wants to sue you and take

862
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,927
Your shirt hand over your coat as well

863
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,487
If anyone forces you to go one mile go with them

864
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,255
2 miles

865
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,047
There is a

866
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,863
You're an idiot that doesn't know how to read the Bible

867
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
That's fair

868
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:04,799
I don't know I'm not I'm not the biggest biblical scholar and I don't know what other info

869
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,591
Who's Alex could be talking about

870
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,383
Cuz there is a point where Jesus

871
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,919
Hit

872
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,223
Already

873
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
I don't I don't

874
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:23,487
What was the Apocrypha

875
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,311
It could be that

876
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,639
There's no reason that you would think

877
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
That

878
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,687
That boggles my

879
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:48,831
I don't know enough about like weird scriptures but I don't know enough

880
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,111
To know is that exist

881
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
Somewhere in

882
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
Non-canonical book

883
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
Maybe it's in the one where Jesus

884
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,975
Spot dragon

885
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,255
Turn the other cheek

886
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,791
Specifically about math

887
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:02,655
Q5 like that is part of The Sermon on the Mount

888
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,471
Also seriously The Sermon on the Mount

889
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,263
Is pretty much that one

890
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,287
10

891
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
F******

892
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,871
Oh this is why

893
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
Kind of thing

894
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,943
Sure

895
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
Is like

896
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:20,831
Oh this is the whole reason that were not is Beatitudes

897
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,903
I thought it was but then you said it and I didn't want

898
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,695
Correction

899
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,231
I researched real service speaker

900
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,303
I'm not going to pronunciation

901
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,607
You know what I am good at though

902
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,631
Warning you

903
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,911
They were about to

904
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,935
Get a guest appearance

905
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
From my cat

906
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,335
I recently on behind the bastards

907
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:46,687
Had the pleasure of Robert Evans telling us all about terribleness

908
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,223
Mike Adams

909
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,575
I wasn't even aware of was that Mike out of

910
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,927
So

911
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,767
The Mike Adams Porsche

912
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
Variance

913
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
I'm surprised

914
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Is the pump

915
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:07,935
Second prime

916
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,495
Situation

917
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,607
It turns out Mike Adams might have made a lot of parody videos last time

918
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,911
Now I did search for this

919
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,703
I was hoping to be able to

920
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
But

921
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,799
Mike Adams YouTube channel

922
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:49,919
God damn I have no one else has seen fit to repost his We Didn't Start the Fire parody

923
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,223
Blake from the

924
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,527
Blog post about natural news

925
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,575
It didn't sound like they made new

926
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,623
Music

927
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,415
Put video over

928
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,487
Or like pictures over

929
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:11,679
So was he one of the founding members of The Lonely Island and then they then they were like

930
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,775
SNL writer

931
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,055
Hilarious

932
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,615
So Mike Adams in the next clips

933
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,663
Obama

934
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
Test

935
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
Is a good activate

936
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
Listen to make

937
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,271
And then Alex

938
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,063
Talk about something

939
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087
Absolutely.

940
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,623
Not true absolutely

941
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,647
Does not happen on

942
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
The show ever

943
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:39,071
There is no

944
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:48,287
Master of neuralink

945
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:04,927
You're horrible

946
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,071
Hundreds of hours

947
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,351
Probably more than

948
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,631
Alex's show

949
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,935
I've never heard any caller

950
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,215
But even is closed

951
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,495
What is describe a person

952
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,287
I've never heard any callers it's like

953
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,079
He couldn't polish into that

954
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,407
It's bananas

955
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,943
Make the idea these present

956
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,903
Was somebody trying to reason with a like

957
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:38,719
Alex

958
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,959
Obama colors

959
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,239
People who support Obama

960
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,775
And the people who call in

961
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,543
Are like

962
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,103
I don't actually support Obama

963
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:03,039
It's not as bad as you say

964
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,367
Crying on the line

965
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,927
Mike Adams got this parody song

966
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,719
Throws put out

967
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
I didn't

968
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Realized

969
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
I think Mike Adams

970
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,607
Might want to be

971
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
Venus funny

972
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,911
I didn't realize

973
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:26,335
You know that we talked about where he's like this gun can't fire itself

974
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,967
I think he really thought that was probably super funny and we're shooting for funny

975
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,295
Because the vaccine zombie that's clearly an attempt

976
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,367
Fire parody song

977
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,415
The pattern

978
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,695
And then it comes in

979
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
With this

980
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,023
Like you got a bit

981
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,351
He's coming into Alta show where they delivered

982
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,999
TUEBL

983
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:19,839
And it's got all sorts of trace minerals in it that you can see here

984
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,119
He's got a prop

985
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,655
He's got a talking

986
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,215
This is this is amazing

987
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,543
Realize you could be

988
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,615
So unfunny I didn't even know you were

989
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,383
Trying to

990
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,991
New level of bread

991
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:40,319
Crazy

992
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
He's doing the late night

993
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,415
Chose

994
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:52,607
Easy listening for what

995
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,215
Crazy

996
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
Jordan

997
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,031
We don't think you

998
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,311
He's funny

999
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,615
I think you could have strong evidence

1000
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,919
The Alex doesn't think he's funny either

1001
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:09,247
Because Mike start listing off the mineral name

1002
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,783
Letter in the bottle

1003
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
ABC

1004
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:17,951
In the room Ono

1005
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,767
Vista house

1006
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:25,119
And it's got all sorts of trace minerals in it that you can see here

1007
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,983
Magnesium in

1008
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,663
So you forget American history

1009
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:44,575
Better

1010
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:52,511
Wolf you could have speegleville box

1011
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:58,911
Alex didn't respond to the Obama Museum

1012
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,239
His own bed and then move onto the squeezy

1013
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,799
Andover explaining it

1014
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,383
You have no help in that room

1015
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:16,831
Too many open mics with that was with that but I felt

1016
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:23,231
Yeah I felt that open mic bombing

1017
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,583
So much longer conversation about

1018
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
Unimportant

1019
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,631
Health news

1020
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,447
Are we getting to the 26

1021
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,215
Naruto

1022
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:33,983
Big news

1023
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,287
And that is

1024
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,079
But he was on another show that morning

1025
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,639
But this isn't the big news that he was teasing in the earlier

1026
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:45,503
I promise that I'm not holding out on you I do not know what that is

1027
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:49,087
Howard Stern for hour-and-a-half this morning

1028
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:56,767
Howard Stern

1029
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,991
Serious

1030
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,719
And Robin

1031
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:33,375
Okay

1032
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:36,959
Started fluoride

1033
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:42,591
Maybe they were f****** I didn't realize it

1034
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,127
Especially considering

1035
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,175
State of Affairs between him and Howard

1036
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,199
In 2019

1037
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,527
You get the sub

1038
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,831
I'm not entirely sure

1039
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,111
But it is

1040
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,159
Alex's

1041
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,463
Really excited about this greater exposure

1042
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231
The show is getting

1043
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,767
He now has like

1044
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,535
Reached

1045
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
Howard

1046
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,375
The king of all media

1047
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,423
And it's a real to be on that

1048
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,495
Absolutely

1049
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
So you

1050
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,799
You get a sense that like

1051
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823
This is Howard

1052
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,591
He's putting the piece

1053
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
Together

1054
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,663
To like we really got to push

1055
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,735
What shows in a rut got to mix it up for how do you do that

1056
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
Well

1057
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,783
You are who you know

1058
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,087
You got to change up a little bit

1059
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:25,855
The content

1060
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,391
And then also simultaneously

1061
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,927
You got to change up your

1062
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,255
You got to figure out how to get new blood in

1063
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,071
That's amazing

1064
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
2013

1065
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,935
That nobody had any idea like we all

1066
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,215
Thought that Alex

1067
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,751
I'd like

1068
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,543
Hilarious conspiracy

1069
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,943
There is for they were a listener visit for y'all

1070
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,991
I like Howard Stern would have them on

1071
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:53,759
When is platform like

1072
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,527
Piers Morgan

1073
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,575
And then we had no idea of it

1074
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,367
All that would really

1075
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:04,767
That lead to an incredibly

1076
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,047
Yeah that's true

1077
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,863
That's true so another thing that I would

1078
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,679
Is the other do gas

1079
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:12,959
The show

1080
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,775
We're going to talk much about

1081
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,799
Does but I have some thoughts

1082
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,663
So in about an hour

1083
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:34,463
Studio

1084
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,999
He has some other

1085
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,047
Riffs on Mike Adams

1086
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,327
Mineral

1087
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:44,959
Has more we came up with more mineral names

1088
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,567
Nissan on his show because I think that this is child

1089
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,847
Sweetheart

1090
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,663
Editorial editorial position

1091
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,711
To make clear because of the circle

1092
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,783
This point Alex won't say his

1093
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,063
Son's name public

1094
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,599
Which I think is probably good

1095
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,391
But he's letting him Beyond

1096
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,439
His Radio Show

1097
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,207
His son is

1098
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
10 years old

1099
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,559
And all he does when he comes on is these little bit

1100
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,607
Better just like recreating

1101
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:17,727
Some of the jokes that Mike Adams bombed with

1102
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,031
And then also repeating tunnel

1103
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:23,103
Clearly has heard Alexei and then passes them off

1104
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,127
As his own beliefs

1105
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,919
As a ten-year-old

1106
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
I really wrestled with this

1107
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:32,063
Because on the one hand I feel like playing clips of this 4th grader doing an impression of his dad

1108
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,135
Talking about global offshore

1109
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,439
Clearly demonstrates how evil Alex

1110
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,975
Adult

1111
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,767
He knows what his son doesn't

1112
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,815
Understand any of the things you talk about

1113
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,839
He's just repeating

1114
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
In his own words

1115
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,375
Is it temp

1116
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,399
To gain his approval

1117
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,959
He has a responsibility to treat his son as a ninja

1118
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,239
Individual not as in

1119
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,031
Extension of himself

1120
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
Exactly what Alex

1121
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:53,823
Is doing here

1122
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,615
That said I decided to go

1123
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,639
Because this

1124
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,199
Your old is someone who's not express

1125
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,527
The only way to practice empathy towards this child

1126
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:05,343
Is to refuse to accept that it's okay to make fun of him

1127
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,623
Because he's connected

1128
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391
Alex

1129
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:11,999
That's treating him as an extension of Alex as opposed to treating them as an individual

1130
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:12,767
A child

1131
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:15,583
Somebody

1132
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,959
Since you know Alex is the one who does look really bad in this

1133
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:21,983
Situation

1134
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,007
But I don't care

1135
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,799
If you think that is

1136
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Is the case

1137
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,103
Appreciate your perspective but I did

1138
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:27,871
Disagree with you

1139
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:32,479
And I would rather deal with I would have about myself

1140
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,807
Indirectly or directly making

1141
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,623
I would really prefer not

1142
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,903
Criticize

1143
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:40,927
10 year olds

1144
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
Mineral jokes

1145
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,535
Better than

1146
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
Unfortunate

1147
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:52,703
For Mike but because I kind of knew that ten-year-old as a victim of child

1148
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,151
F****** unobtainium but Obama

1149
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,199
Is it better like

1150
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,479
I don't I don't

1151
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:08,831
Take that approach to it at all it would just be playing a 10 year old

1152
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,879
Repeating Alex's

1153
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
I've got a great

1154
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,023
It's just

1155
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,351
Bring this up

1156
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,631
Unexplained

1157
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,911
To give you all you need

1158
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:28,543
10 year olds

1159
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,335
Ojai schools are fight clubs

1160
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,895
High School

1161
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,135
It was

1162
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,719
The coolest couches

1163
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:52,863
Everything's fine

1164
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,679
Just broke the rules of Fight Club

1165
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,447
Yeah

1166
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,983
He's talking about Fight Club

1167
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,311
So I would say

1168
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,335
Not cool

1169
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
For coaches

1170
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
It's not called

1171
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,687
Police after a kid gets a head

1172
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:09,759
Cracked open

1173
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,551
I don't think it's cool for these

1174
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
These coaches to not be

1175
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,879
Snitches

1176
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,183
They would let us kill each other

1177
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,719
And they would never do anything

1178
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,999
Think about it they were so cool

1179
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,791
That is indicative of

1180
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:26,399
If you believe if you believe that that's the appropriate place

1181
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,423
School

1182
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,983
YooHoo voice

1183
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,519
Also the fact that

1184
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:35,359
There's so many things there's so many had dramas

1185
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,407
Soul Man

1186
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,455
It's hard it's hard

1187
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,599
I'm surprised

1188
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,135
Yeah

1189
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,439
Alex comes out against

1190
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,023
Yeah well it's about time

1191
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:55,327
Is a religion

1192
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,823
The creation

1193
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:10,431
What

1194
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:16,319
So apparently the only real science of the world is that which confirms the existence of God

1195
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,671
Science

1196
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:25,279
He's only good in so much as it is in line with religion which

1197
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
Memes

1198
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,583
Oh okay so then

1199
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,119
So then

1200
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,959
Would never have created gun

1201
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,519
What do you mean that confirms God

1202
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,919
Don't you get rid of the Bible passages about guns

1203
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,735
Do not confirm or

1204
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:48,575
Is the existence or non-existence

1205
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:52,671
Turn the other cheek is actually like a mistranslation

1206
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
From the original

1207
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:58,815
Drop another round

1208
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,423
The span of time

1209
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,775
This from the 23rd

1210
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,311
Alex has been

1211
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,103
Really really excited

1212
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
He's got coming up

1213
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,663
On here on the

1214
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,479
He is someone who he is talked

1215
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,015
A lot of s*** about

1216
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,551
It is a major

1217
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,319
Your figure

1218
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,855
And right-wing

1219
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,647
He's somebody who has a

1220
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,439
SEC radio show

1221
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,255
Has not been

1222
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,023
Cool about

1223
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:32,351
He's really f***** up s*** about him

1224
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,911
Is it really Glenn Beck

1225
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,959
This February 26th

1226
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:37,983
2013 is

1227
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
The first time

1228
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,079
Being a guest on Alex's show

1229
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
And I believe

1230
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,663
It signifies the moment when

1231
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,431
Person

1232
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,455
Goes from

1233
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:51,039
F*** this guy to he's one of the greatest Patriots ever

1234
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,343
Michael said okay

1235
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,623
The either

1236
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,391
Savage

1237
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,439
He has Michael Savage on the show

1238
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,511
25th

1239
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,791
Alex got a call from

1240
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,583
Some what's Naruto's like

1241
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,167
Hey you know he's fine with like Obama using drones

1242
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,799
You need to ask him these hard-hitting question

1243
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,079
Sure about this

1244
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:18,431
They are really big differences in your world and Alex's like

1245
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:25,087
I'm not going to Beta guy in here and then ask him all these confrontational question

1246
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,111
Am I headed

1247
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:32,511
What about the timing of David Rothschild

1248
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:35,583
Go f*** yourself Alex okay

1249
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:39,679
The reason that he's not going to do that

1250
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:43,007
Because he's so excited

1251
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,311
He recognizes that

1252
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
Savages

1253
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
Canticle

1254
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,151
Any idea of

1255
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
Heaven

1256
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:50,943
Some sort of

1257
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,479
Between them

1258
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,759
I'm some sort of the

1259
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,039
The coming together

1260
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,575
Mutual respect

1261
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,855
Building

1262
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,159
Super valuable

1263
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:04,767
Alex might be able to go on the Michael Savage

1264
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,815
He might be able to

1265
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
To bring some

1266
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,399
Savages audience to him

1267
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,727
Many interviews of people

1268
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,775
I'm smarter than that

1269
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:20,383
He knows what's going to happen if you goes into hostile territory

1270
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,711
Well he does know quite a bit

1271
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,759
As a person that if he goes into

1272
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,295
Any environment where

1273
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,087
Like let's auri were

1274
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,647
We could so easily bait him insignia

1275
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:38,303
Alright easiest f****** thing in the world

1276
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,143
I don't put myself in that situation I'm a f****** billionaire

1277
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,935
I broadcast out of a

1278
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,751
Enclosed space yeah and then I live my life

1279
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:49,055
Liberals

1280
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:49,823
Or anything

1281
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,383
I think it's because he's afraid of being proven wrong

1282
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,431
He is full of

1283
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
Gotcha

1284
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
Okay

1285
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
Alright

1286
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,015
And I have a reason for things

1287
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:01,343
Making that a little bit

1288
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,671
I don't know he has

1289
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,951
He's been eligible

1290
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,535
More verbal

1291
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,559
Physical attack

1292
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,863
Here's a couple fun trivia

1293
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,191
In the 19th

1294
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,031
He was friendly with Allen Ginsberg

1295
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,591
What

1296
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:27,967
What there's a picture of him

1297
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,991
What are we doing

1298
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:33,087
Stop it out of here he also works for Timothy Leary

1299
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,111
He was a gatekeeper

1300
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:42,815
Facility Michael Savage is a f****** weird history

1301
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,119
Timothy Leary

1302
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,935
The Story Goes because Michael Savage

1303
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
I was in no way interested

1304
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
Psychedelics

1305
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,007
And taking

1306
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,639
For the place where they were

1307
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,455
He

1308
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Is crazy

1309
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,247
He

1310
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:04,063
But he hasn't history through the Bohemian Circle

1311
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,111
Through the 60s

1312
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
70s

1313
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,903
How many turns

1314
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
Fleetway the other direction

1315
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,743
And a lot of people who knew him back then

1316
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,047
Who speculated that he felt a lot of rejection

1317
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,863
From those people apart of

1318
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
Is turning on the

1319
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,167
Weird betrayal

1320
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,263
This doesn't seem like a my don't know what

1321
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,335
It's weird another person you used to know I'm

1322
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,871
I also said that

1323
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
Wanted to be

1324
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,943
And that

1325
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,991
He bombed performing

1326
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,295
He's wanted to be like as Lenny Bruce type

1327
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,599
Workout forum

1328
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
I thought

1329
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Political

1330
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,671
Goddamn

1331
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,207
He is a guy who

1332
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,535
Before he got super political was writing books

1333
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
About like

1334
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
Herbal

1335
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,607
Healing

1336
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,399
Alternative medicine stuff

1337
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,679
Because he is educated

1338
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
I feel

1339
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,495
Maybe nose

1340
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,775
Some valuable information

1341
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,823
There

1342
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,591
Transition

1343
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,871
To what he's become

1344
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
Awful

1345
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,455
Do you know what I sometimes

1346
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,223
Think about

1347
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,367
So many of these right-wing

1348
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,559
I am the wrong amount

1349
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,351
I'm not funny enough to be famous

1350
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,887
I'm too funny

1351
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,911
To have

1352
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:29,311
Probably be a right-wing hack

1353
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,615
If you do stand up and you're not

1354
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:38,015
I have to have a little bit of humility to transition out of it

1355
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,295
Because otherwise you

1356
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:41,087
Could take it as like a real Injustice

1357
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,647
To you that you never made it

1358
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,463
You have to you have to

1359
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,023
Check your ego tiny bit recognize like

1360
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,303
I didn't deserve

1361
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,071
How to be famous

1362
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,863
Nothing about you

1363
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,655
Super talented that doesn't make me

1364
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,447
Entitled to some kind of

1365
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:00,287
Alright record dealer victoire

1366
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,079
You don't make something happen baby

1367
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,151
Along the way or took them

1368
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,223
Tracy didn't make along the way is what led to

1369
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:08,991
You not being

1370
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,295
Successful and I think a lot of these people

1371
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:14,111
You know the people like her Gavin McInnes

1372
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,391
Or

1373
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:19,999
Michael Savage

1374
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,839
The reports of him being a comedian or trying to be comedian

1375
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:28,191
I don't they're just based on people who used to know I don't know how much that's actually

1376
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,471
Like what drove

1377
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,079
How does generalization

1378
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,895
I think a lot of those people Felton

1379
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,431
Entitled to some sort of

1380
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
To success

1381
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,247
Stand-up and when they didn't get it

1382
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,063
You externalized

1383
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,367
I blame it supposed to be my

1384
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,647
I just didn't have it

1385
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:51,743
Or maybe with timing or maybe with luck who knows you don't have to feel bad about it

1386
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,535
But they've already I mean that's

1387
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,559
That victim

1388
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,327
Mentality

1389
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,607
What makes

1390
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,143
So powerful

1391
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,423
At the end when they

1392
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,959
Turn it out

1393
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:04,543
Fire

1394
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,847
So also Michael Savage

1395
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,895
He got into radio in the nineties

1396
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,967
And part of it was because he's written a book

1397
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,015
About immigrants causing disease

1398
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,575
People didn't want

1399
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,903
So you got the radio

1400
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,183
Pretty success

1401
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,463
Pretty quick

1402
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,607
His books have been pretty successful Savage

1403
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,399
Borders language

1404
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,703
You wrote a book about

1405
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,239
Politics is a

1406
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,031
A bunch

1407
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:36,799
People in politics

1408
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,871
It's very weird

1409
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,895
Surprise

1410
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:46,015
Money on that but also another Revenue

1411
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,063
And that is his son

1412
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,135
Is the founder of Rockstar Energy Drink

1413
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,927
What

1414
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:56,767
What are we doing his wife

1415
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,839
The CFO of Rockstar Energy

1416
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,031
Bread

1417
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:12,383
He's a super weird dude Michael Savage

1418
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,919
Really when you look at it

1419
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:17,759
There is there's a ton going on there's a lot of psychodrama

1420
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,951
In Subway new Allen Ginsberg

1421
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,999
Timothy Leary

1422
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,791
Executive son started Rockstar

1423
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,095
That's so crazy

1424
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,119
Very weird

1425
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,447
Michael Savage

1426
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:40,031
Attempt to create

1427
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,079
They're not going to talk about

1428
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,127
Electric Kool-Aid

1429
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,175
You can wish they would

1430
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,711
Michael Savage

1431
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:52,575
Just start screaming about how they're all like diaper Doper baby

1432
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,439
Largely

1433
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,231
Michael Savage

1434
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,767
About how great his show is

1435
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:02,815
Whatever

1436
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,215
I finally got on in New York City

1437
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:11,519
9 at night now what happened

1438
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,055
Michael Savage

1439
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:19,711
I exploded with younger listeners

1440
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:27,391
And talk radio in general I have eight listeners

1441
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:33,279
I think you might have answered your own question as to why emotional

1442
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,071
Yeah I think

1443
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:40,703
Would you put yourself in Superfly situations like this we engage in that kind of casual misogyny

1444
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:43,775
Maybe you are going to attract cicadas female listeners

1445
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:47,615
I mean the only

1446
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:54,015
Women don't really listen to talk radio also all women are stupid and we should never have given him the right to vote and I don't understand

1447
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,295
They don't listen

1448
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,879
Caesar salad

1449
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:05,023
Michael Savage radio

1450
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,071
Casually misogynistic

1451
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,863
I don't

1452
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,631
Women don't lie

1453
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,911
Your

1454
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,679
Talk radio

1455
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
In this neck

1456
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,471
Michael Savage

1457
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,519
Dude it if anybody

1458
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,311
What I kept thinking is like

1459
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,847
I used to listen to Savage

1460
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,151
When I was in my like

1461
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,943
Late teens or early 20s

1462
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,247
Cuz there's a radio station eagle

1463
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,271
Columbia Missouri

1464
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,575
It was on

1465
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,415
Angel

1466
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,207
There's something kind of thinking about it

1467
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,255
Grievous is politics

1468
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,839
Dynamic where like you'd scream at collars

1469
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,863
And talk politics

1470
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,399
It was kind of like

1471
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,191
He's an a******

1472
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:47,263
Story about getting like some really great pasta

1473
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:50,591
And like The Passion of the story

1474
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,383
This little Italian Eatery

1475
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,407
End

1476
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,687
See the lighting in

1477
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,223
Play

1478
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,759
Nurses like

1479
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:02,879
Asmrs quality this voice telling you that story about this

1480
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,159
Grape meatball

1481
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,999
I was drawn to it somehow

1482
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,839
Anyway I have this perception of Michael Savage

1483
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,607
Trump

1484
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,631
From years past

1485
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,191
And I think a lot of people have

1486
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,727
Positive associations with him

1487
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,031
Some people probably think that

1488
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,847
I don't think he's as much of an idiot

1489
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,639
Alex you

1490
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,175
Yeah but like

1491
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,735
I kept thinking in this interview like

1492
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:33,087
Jesus Christ this guy stupid

1493
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,623
Like listen to this

1494
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,695
Smite down for this week

1495
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:40,255
Think about what he's actually said

1496
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:48,191
By saying I saw a kung fu movie when I was out on vacation last week I was watching a lot of television

1497
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:51,263
And it was a picture of a Kung Fu Academy in China

1498
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:55,359
Chinese

1499
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:57,407
Kung Fu teacher

1500
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:03,551
Annie sez

1501
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,343
In Chinese

1502
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:09,951
No mercy

1503
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,231
We have a government

1504
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:14,815
And educational establishments

1505
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,095
I'm weak

1506
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:20,191
I'm in pain.

1507
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:26,079
Alex

1508
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:32,223
Okay so who wins this battle is it the use of America or characters in a cup

1509
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:32,991
Movie

1510
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:39,647
You understand that this is Tommy he's making a movie is a

1511
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,927
Send accurate depiction of

1512
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,463
Absolute

1513
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:53,727
You can absolutely I would recommend

1514
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,871
That was Bruce Lee's original

1515
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,663
Amazing you can do that

1516
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,687
Right

1517
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,967
This is stupid

1518
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,271
I saw this

1519
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
Movie

1520
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,063
And I thought

1521
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,855
AR used

1522
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,391
Compete with those hardened

1523
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,183
Kung-Fu acolytes

1524
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,743
Uniboob

1525
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,023
Understand what is width

1526
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
Ding-dongs

1527
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:21,375
Differentiating between reality and movies

1528
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,167
It's so crazy

1529
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:31,359
B b b b

1530
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,383
Like accidentally

1531
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,687
Realizing that a lot of people just have

1532
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:37,503
Sort of inability to

1533
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,527
NCA reality

1534
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,575
I don't know

1535
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:53,375
The same way that marijuana is in Reefer Madness

1536
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:57,215
You are everywhere they were coming to get you

1537
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:57,983
You might

1538
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,799
Jack be able to trace some of those

1539
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,079
Lingering scent

1540
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:06,943
Ability to differentiate reality from that as president movie

1541
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:07,967
I don't know

1542
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,271

1543
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,807

So

1548
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,431
If you just

1549
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,199

1550
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,503

1552
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,087

1562
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,343
Barack Obama

Deprez they will do something crazy

1573
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,439
To justify a reaction

1574
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:57,279
Clear

1575
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,375

1576
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,655
Weather

1577
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,215

1578
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:11,871
A little 20

1579

You're in town

Two old white men

1599
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:03,839
As opposed to old white man making them angry

1600
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:07,935
Barack is making old white man Angry

1601
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,471
He's doing it on purpose

1602
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:13,567

01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,112
Everglades bear

1705
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:50,464
Because he doesn't give a s*** about them taking gun from white guy

1706
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,232
Yep

1707
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,792
And that's really really

1708
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:54,560
For Alex's

1709
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,120
The sleight-of-hand that he likes

1710
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:57,888
Play

1711
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:01,728
Race

1712
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,496
Love you Alex

1713
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:04,032
Defensive of whiteness

1714
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:06,080
I really don't want to die

1715
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:08,896
It makes me

1716
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,664
Sofa

1717
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:12,224
Because nobody is trying to

1718
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:12,992
Take the white

1719
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
No one no one

1720
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,576
Trying to do it

1721
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,368
0 people are trying

1722
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,928
And the end that ends

1723
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:27,584
Do I know part of it

1724
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,864
I don't know

1725
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,144
It is a bummer

1726
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:35,264
Michael Savage prescription

1727
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,288
For what

1728
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:38,336
To be done

1729
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,360
Right

1730
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,640
Allowed

1731
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,968
Antagonize

1732
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,760
All right he has another

1733
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,344
There should be drug testing in Congress

1734
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:52,672
There should be drug testing in Congress Alex

1735
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:58,816
My final word

1736
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:01,888
You can recognize

1737
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,080
She's on power

1738
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:19,808
I guarantee you 60%

1739
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,120
Yeah

1740
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:35,680
Little bit different it does give him the

1741
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,704
Sort of expert

1742
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,496
Is that you might want for like

1743
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,520
Plant-based medicine

1744
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,312
Books

1745
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,616
It's nothing to be judged

1746
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:44,384
Too much

1747
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,688
And like homeopathy

1748
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,480
Adjacent

1749
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,784
To that sort of world

1750
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,856
He was in his earlier career

1751
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,952
Herbalism

1752
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:03,072
But whatever is being presented as like he's a doctor

1753
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,912
Yeah it is

1754
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,960
Understood by

1755
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:09,984
Cristal

1756
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,520
Shell gas

1757
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,312
What time does appearance

1758
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,384
I know I just

1759
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:17,664
Bummer

1760
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,456
I really don't like Michael Savage

1761
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,992
No he is at

1762
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:24,832
Giant bees I the only in the only interaction

1763
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,624
Ever had

1764
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,184
Only a couple

1765
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,072
I had no idea

1766
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:35,840
This much

1767
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:39,168
You can find somebody videos

1768
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,728
Screaming at people

1769
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,800
Michael Savage's like

1770
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,384
The the final stage

1771
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,920
Of most of these propaganda

1772
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,712
If they had their druthers

1773
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,760
They wouldn't suffer anybody who dis

1774
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,672
Clear on this episode

1775
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:03,744
Like there are good Arguments for gun control that just gather people

1776
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,632
What do fuckyourself

1777
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:17,056
A pure distillation of what it is they actually

1778
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,080
Which is

1779
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:18,848
Go fuc yourself

1780
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,640
You're not me

1781
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,968
Do you f****** Michael Savage

1782
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,760
Expresses outright hostility

1783
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,296
To everyone who

1784
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,832
Is non-white

1785
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,112
Non-straight

1786
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,160
Women

1787
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:35,488
Muslims in particular get a Hard Punch

1788
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:38,816
It's not

1789
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,096
Any other reason

1790
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:41,888
He hates them

1791
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:43,936
Yeah it is

1792
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:47,776
Hateful angry dude it's so weird to me that you can be

1793
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,568
Somebody that it even exists

1794
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:52,384
Well the only people on the

1795
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:57,248
The planet I identify with our other white males who look almost identical to

1796
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,552
Because I mean

1797
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:01,088
It seems like a psychopathy

1798
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:02,880
Where it's like

1799
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,928
I just cannot understand

1800
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,208
And will not engage

1801
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,000
Anybody who is not

1802
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,816
Clinical lab

1803
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,840
Express

1804
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:15,680
Michael Savage

1805
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,960
Cruelty and body

1806
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:19,264
And has been for a long time on the radio

1807
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:22,336
And that is why it makes total sense

1808
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:24,640
How to use another one of these dudes

1809
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,432
Who became big

1810
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,456
Truck guy

1811
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,504
Whenever absolutely

1812
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,296
It makes total sense

1813
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:34,112
Their brand is cruelty the brand is

1814
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:36,416
Funny largely

1815
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,976
Status quo

1816
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:39,744
Coronavirus

1817
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,072
Easiest

1818
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,144
F*** that you

1819
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:50,496
Structure we get to the 26

1820
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:52,544
We still don't have

1821
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,128
The big dude

1822
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:58,176
The Gate of report whatever that might be

1823
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,968
I feel a little self-conscious

1824
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,504
Because

1825
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,272
Of

1826
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,320
My guess

1827
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,344
I might be

1828
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,624
Completely out of line on

1829
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:08,672
I might be way off base

1830
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,696
I don't know

1831
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,256
To the next episode

1832
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:18,656
And I still don't.

1833
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,984
But it does feel to me from the

1834
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,264
Just the context

1835
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,032
Clues that I

1836
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:25,568
Descent

1837
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,896
It feels like it's drifting in

1838
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,176
In that direction towards

1839
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,456
It being a revelation

1840
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,224
About Sandy Hook

1841
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:39,392
Together video of

1842
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:42,720
Like when did the Nancy Pelosi like make

1843
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,536
When did that video where

1844
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:47,584
Nancy Pelosi misspeaks for a second

1845
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,632
Shut up about

1846
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:51,680
What was that

1847
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:54,752
Write 30

1848
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,896
We caught Nancy Pelosi gone

1849
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:01,920
Instead of

1850
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:02,688
And that's it

1851
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,528
You something about that like f****** Department of Education

1852
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,576
I don't know but

1853
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,696
Time

1854
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:17,280
Especially with the fact that he

1855
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,560
Everywhere apparel

1856
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:23,424
Next episode we find out what it is

1857
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:27,008
We'll see again

1858
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,288
IMDb soul

1859
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,824
I'm going to guess we're not going

1860
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,360
Modify.

1861
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:33,664
Tyui wood

1862
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:36,224
But because the tension

1863
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,016
This is going to kill me

1864
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:45,440
The next episode

1865
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:47,232
Is more interesting to me then

1866
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:53,888
What the f*** in-depth do you have going on

1867
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,216
Talking to you got your

1868
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:00,032
Google find out

1869
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:04,128
Maybe Wednesday

1870
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:07,456
Website

1871
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,552
You bet

1872
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,576
Go to bed Jordan

1873
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:18,464
Facebook

1874
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,328
What is it that we have a direct Lipson haha

1875
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,608
Confined are Twitter accounts

1876
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,656
Sometimes we'll post up there

1877
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,960
If you are looking for

1878
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:29,984
Apartment

1879
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,008
Dan

1880
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,544
Just tried out a cup

1881
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,312
Couple of different

1882
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,616
They all offered with the pack

1883
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,408
Episode of knowledge

1884
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:40,224
Is wild

1885
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,880
So that's the best place

1886
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,672
That

1887
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,440
Is

1888
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,864
You can also find us

1889
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,912
3 *

1890
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:01,728
If you pick one letter out of

1891
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:06,080
Sign eventually it will spell knowledge fight and will give you an epi

1892
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:10,688
So I went on Howard Stern

1893
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:15,552
And them onto the New World Order and what-have-you I don't think they have

1894
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,088
Flint

1895
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:18,368
