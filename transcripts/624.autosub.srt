00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need

4
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,552
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Acknowledge

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody was making I'll try.

7
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
Alex

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,656
We are Dan Jordan Jordan

9
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
What's up

10
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,800
Denny's new

11
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,408
For the money episode

12
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
And such

13
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
I have grown weary of hearing little pops every now and again I can drive people crazy

14
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,648
I'm a little bit so I got new courts

15
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
Chadwicks

16
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,304
And I'm hoping that that problem will be resolved Saturday because I was almost certainly where that was

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
Coming from

18
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Bi-Rite

19
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,168
Perfectionism

20
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Recorded

21
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,752
Replace these cords after

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,360
Albino in there was a problem

23
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
Mine

24
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,712
Is long underwear

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,784
Never worn long underwear before in my life

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064
You know they called that

27
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,744
Nobody but my partner got me these a long underwear I've never worn before in my life

28
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,864
This morning this was our first Chicago day where was really down to that like

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
Single-digit

30
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
Temperature I'm walking

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Can my dog

32
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
6:30

33
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
My legs are

34
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,592
Toasty and warm I've never felt better in my life I'm happy for you

35
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,920
It's great. Are they long johns is that the name of them

36
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
I didn't know they're just a pan

37
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
Okay I don't have the overall I don't have the sleeves I don't think the overall is this energy along

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,768
You got to work on that you got to get yourself a little bit of a better operational feeling there

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
Get yourself a butt flap

40
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
I'm not going to be in the in the

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
Turn yourself into like a little boy

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,336
I don't think that's a terrible idea I still I wear the same exact clothes everyday so that would make

43
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
It's not very good

44
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
So Jordan

45
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
Today we are back in the present

46
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
About

47
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
November 30th

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
24 Northwestern

49
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,416
And we had to 2003 episodes Outlast to UPS

50
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,512
Something came up everything is okay but we had to

51
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
Episodes that we had pre-recorded

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,936
And so that's why there was some stuff going on in the world and maybe

53
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
Like I said that Alex has a great journalist and we don't seem to know it's good we recorded those before

54
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Stuff happens

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
There's a lot of nonsense going on in this episode

56
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Let's take a little moment to say hello.

57
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,368
New Wok

58
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,208
The first VI on Keenan group chat

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,584
Thank you very much

60
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,728
Lachlan from Australia that gives about you an alibi

61
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
Cars Lachlan

62
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,104
Scorpion dagger thank you so much

63
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:08,832
Kropotkin that's a chicken but like with a bird The Crow

64
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
That Brandon lyrics

65
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:20,095
Bianca Cortez

66
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
Technocrat

67
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
Money off that heroin

68
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Freakishly large

69
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,855
Also I've been thinking about this

70
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
Reset wars in the mick haha

71
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,487
I think it's time for us to do a reset to you think so I think I need to make

72
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,887
Sonu sound drop

73
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,447
Reset we have entered The Fray of recent War

74
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,543
I think I'm just doing the parody of it by making a new sound.

75
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,127
Play me some new drops going

76
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Jordan

77
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,015
This episode is silly it's stupid but here is an avocado

78
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
6 drop permit

79
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
Pull somebody's head off their body

80
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
More power

81
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Yes

82
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,839
I could pull your head off your body more powerfully with

83
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:29,471
Love because of love for love

84
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,871
It's a perspective on the mom lifting up the car to save her baby the mom just rips that

85
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
Head off of somebody within a block

86
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
Radius of her baby I feel like that's

87
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
What were they was coming

88
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
So we start off here on November 30th

89
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,367
With Alex reporting on

90
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
A clip

91
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
That he's heard of Joe Biden

92
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,535
John Muir calendar of Monday November 29th

93
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
2020

94
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,911
The job I'm almost at blackjack

95
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
He

96
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,495
Is holding 350

97
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
Million Americans

98
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Hostage

99
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
Hehehehehe

100
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
Room that we remember when

101
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,719
Picture of Obama watching I'm sitting in there just twiddling his thumbs

102
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,535
Bwahahaha

103
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,911
Seems Seems like a clip that Alex is definitely going to play

104
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,775
The new theory that Alex has it's based on the clip that he saw of this

105
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,079
So woman being interviewed on

106
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
Fox News

107
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Puhi

108
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Will not

109
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
Stop saying is beautiful

110
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
And it's a little under

111
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
It's a little upsetting

112
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:50,111
But this is the new idea that covid is an unsolvable problem

113
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
That the globalist have created

114
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
In order to

115
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
You know pretend that they're solving the problem

116
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,071
Which leads to more control

117
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,887
Yep into that's one of the big themes of this episode

118
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Covid-19

119
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
Unsolvable problem

120
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,567
Transfer all power and control to a select group

121
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Multinational

122
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,663
Corporations owned and controlled by

123
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Free banking families

124
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
Everywhere

125
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
2020

126
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
People are dying.

127
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
Last year the

128
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215
Expectancy was

129
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,031
74 years for a man 76 for a woman

130
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
Two years for men

131
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,687
2 years for women in just this year

132
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
The averages drop two years

133
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,367
I saw through this weekend

134
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,975
I can't believe that I missed those actuaries

135
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,119
It is true that the preliminary numbers are showing that there were more deaths in the US in 2021 than there were in

136
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,471
28 seemed like an argument against vaccines on the surface

137
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,823
It's actually the opposite it's not all that surprising considering

138
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Things have gone

139
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
The explanation is super simple

140
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Vaccination rates

141
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
Are not high enough

142
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,503
And that is being combined with people going back to

143
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
RI covid

144
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,391
At the same time it was going around to being more highly transmittable

145
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
Has it summed up in the New York Times quote

146
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,303
Many Americans are behaving as though covid-19 is now a manageable endemic

147
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
Disease rather than a crisis

148
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,167
Transition that will happen eventually but has not happy

149
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Opened yet

150
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
This is leading to wider spread in there is

151
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,823
Significant gaps and Immunity in the public and that's led to death

152
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
What are the most

153
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,735
Important aspects to resolving this problem is the u.s. not having under 60% vaccination rates

154
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,575
In the population but with voices like Alex being taken seriously at all

155
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,879
It doesn't seem like we're going to get there anytime soon

156
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
As for the life

157
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Expectancy

158
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
Alex's operating off imprecise

159
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
Information

160
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
We don't have the numbers yet on 20

161
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
Play 21 for this kind of thing

162
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,935
But the cdc's national Center for Health statistics announced in July

163
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
Average life expect

164
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Expectancy dropped the price

165
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Smelly one point

166
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
5 years

167
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
Between 2019 and 2020

168
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
It's not two years were man and women

169
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,783
Is 1.8 years for men and 1.2 years for women averaging out to 1.5

170
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,343
A lot of this does have to do with covid deaths

171
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,159
And honestly when we have numbers for 2021

172
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
It's possible that the number might be even worse

173
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
But these

174
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,863
Speak about this very precise about life expect

175
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
Continue as though if you are 70 now

176
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
You will die in 2 years

177
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,567
Whereas if you were 16

178
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,919
In five years that's not how it works it's not Noel though it is fun to imagine that

179
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:00,319
He thinks that it's like if you're 70 you better not stop running you better keep her

180
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,159
Man seventy-year-old people used to live for years longer another

181
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
Yeah

182
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
They're blocked

183
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:12,607
I also I have no idea what I was just talking about with the various actuaries nonsense but if he does know about the three Bank

184
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,423
Making families that own everything and are taking over

185
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,983
Pictures of Duty to be more specific about that

186
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
You know it

187
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Banking families

188
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
They have

189
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
Proprietary actuaries

190
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
But you know cuz they're in competition with each other

191
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,783
They don't want to give the bank families are related to the actuaries

192
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,599
I just think you just said it

193
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,743
He says x-rays all the time and I think you just threw out the

194
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,047
The three banking families because it sort of like

195
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
A hat tip

196
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
Do you like

197
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,911
The old-school conspiracy folks who might be lurking

198
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:51,519
I love me talkin about bloodline Riot making

199
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,823
How you doing up there old school before

200
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
Districts that are going around

201
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
I also have

202
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,223
To do with future prediction

203
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
About lifespan

204
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
That are pretty trouble

205
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,047
Years and I say scientists are baffled

206
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
Time

207
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
Increase in heart attacks in

208
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
Soccer players around the world alone

209
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:43,231
If you didn't listen to Alex's show regularly it probably come off strange to hear inside any population of soccer players ever

210
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
Some index group for heart attack

211
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
But this is one of his big covid vaccine there it is

212
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,679
Okay I see you throwing your hands up in the air

213
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
According to some of his weirdo guests there's a 66

214
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,567
* increase in the heart attack some on soccer players

215
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
And this is due to them being packed

216
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
Estimated vaccine cause

217
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Sandy's heart attacks

218
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:08,063
There have been a number of heart attacks among soccer players in the last year but the problem is that what Alex and his guests are doing

219
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Is preying on the audiences

220
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
Ignorance of some counterintuitive datasets

221
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
Princeton's let me read you this headline

222
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
From the guardian

223
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,607
More young footballers dying of heart problems than thought fa study

224
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Defiance

225
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:26,239
He could seem like this would tend to backup Alex's Theory put in fact that article was published in

226
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
In August 2018 for covid

227
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,079
Even before the vaccine

228
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Existed

229
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,175
There's this LA Times article from 2012 title

230
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,247
Quote be frightening frequency of heart attacks in soccer

231
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,831
There was a 2015 article from the New York Post titled quote

232
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
Belgium's young soccer players dropping dead of heart attack

233
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:50,047
Point here is that the issue of heart problems and soccer players has been something that experts have looked at in

234
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
I've been dealing with for years

235
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
Long before covid became an issue

236
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,727
A lot of the articles I read discussed the imperfect nature of pre-emptive heart

237
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,287
Screening particularly for younger soccer players

238
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
As a contributing factor to the higher than

239
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
Unexpected levels of cardiac

240
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Issues

241
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:10,015
Another factor is that soccer is one of the more strenuous Sports you can play where your cardio is really

242
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Challenge

243
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
So you have an underlying hereditary heart condition

244
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
For example

245
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,927
Playing soccer is up like that has the possibility of exacerbate

246
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
Make Edition even bringing on cardiac arrest

247
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:26,143
Makes me almost you know makes me almost Happy to have my little bit of CTE from high school football didn't have a heart attack

248
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,519
You dodged a bullet another thing

249
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,567
Consideration is maybe we don't we don't

250
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,175
Feel this as much as being people in the United States

251
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
Wiley price

252
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,295
It's by far the biggest port in the world

253
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
The beautiful game

254
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,439
It's sort of Representative Lee the number of people who you could

255
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Say

256
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,559
Like had a heart attack playing soccer around the world

257
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,983
Deadpool Trilogy drawing is a lot larger

258
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
Is just got a soccer ball around wherever they go they could you could be walking down the street Heather and then all of a sudden you drop dead Mets

259
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,943
Soccer related injuries you see the

260
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
Amazing Grace

261
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
Every country they go to

262
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,111
It's just people kicking soccer balls around

263
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
Alex a weirdo friends

264
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,231
Probably know about this history of the

265
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
Correlation

266
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Sure

267
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
Buy soccer players in Arkansas

268
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,935
Between those two things

269
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,751
So they can use the instances of recent heart-related issues

270
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
Among soccer players the fuel covid

271
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Conspiracies

272
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
It's garbage

273
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Yeah I don't even know where the 66

274
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
6 * number comes from either

275
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
I don't know who is doing things in multiples of

276
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
66

277
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,367
666

278
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,183
Devil were there

279
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
So there's another thing

280
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:00,351
That is going on along with the like covid this unsolvable problem the globalist of creator

281
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
There's another big

282
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Catchphrase

283
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
It's running through this episode

284
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
And that is

285
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
All right look

286
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
We got Biden

287
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
He's the good cop

288
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
Fauci

289
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
Really the lockdown

290
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,711
Imask

291
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:22,111
Simplifying things that I do appreciate all Global problems being like good cop bad cop

292
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
Well

293
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:28,767
Global problems storical Global problem

294
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,559
An insane

295
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
Comparison girl

296
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,423
Horseshoe saw Biden come out last night and say

297
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
It'll hold you hostage

298
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
Copies a good cop

299
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,407
Bad guy what famous equation in in

300
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
Wait

301
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:54,623
I understand I understand he's probably just trying to call VIP mangala but unfortunately

302
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:01,023
Comparison that comes to mind is that Hitler is the good cop

303
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,559
We're doing right here

304
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
Viton is Hitler

305
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
The good cop

306
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,983
Incestuous the bad guy we were at

307
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
Battlefield

308
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
So

309
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
We we

310
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Wie geht's

311
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Alex discussing

312
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
Some calls

313
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
Media

314
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
To talk to him

315
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Sure

316
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,087
And you're going to see more people from the power structure

317
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,207
Coming out against it because people are not figuring out if we don't stop this we're all dead

318
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,279
The Washington Post Pony this morning

319
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
Sugar

320
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
Sugar me on Pinos

321
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,679
Oh I like you over friends and I said listen

322
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495

00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Sure

327
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,415
You can just say no

328
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
I don't want to be I don't want to do this interview

329
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
Alright

330
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:10,143
Cursed your children that one that's a little bit weird to hear somebody obliquely mention to wash

331
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
You can post reporter

332
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,007
And and have the first thing I said to them was

333
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
You got kids

334
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,847
You courtesy of Carson

335
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
I'm cuz I mean that's it

336
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
That is a

337
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
That's not a Veiled Threat

338
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Just ask

339
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,015
Hey you got kids like that

340
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
No that's a threat

341
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
You don't know the person to implying that they've curse their children really confrontational it's real

342
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
The rough way to start a new friendship

343
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
The phone call

344
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,727
Especially when it's a basic Xpress Incorporated

345
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,335
No I don't want to change my goddamn cell service

346
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
You cursed your children

347
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
I like the idea to that it like

348
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,967
Of course around this time Alex's

349
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:00,063
Obviously someone that people want to press comment from weather

350
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,415
So are the January 6th

351
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
You're saying he's a great Turtle assures somebody's got to say something

352
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:13,119
Send this a****** contact imagine that every time

353
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,727
You have cars.

354
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
I also enjoy the like

355
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,103
Yeah just heard of him doing the jack off motion about a Pulitzer

356
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,943
Oh yeah you got a pea

357
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,247
Balls whatever

358
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,295
So here's an interesting scientific

359
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,391
Idea that Alex has I'm fascinated by this a little bit

360
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
You don't just thinking their official documents

361
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
80% reduction

362
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,071
They're not actually planning a Revolt everybody inside

363
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
New World Order

364
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
Transhumanist

365
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,543
No one else allowed

366
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,663
Might want to absorb you but that's it and they're all battling to be that one God

367
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,759
Short totally luciferian it's Garden mean all over again

368
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
That's where you are

369
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
Look at your children

370
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:20,959
Being on TV and being with the establishment in your heart

371
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,591
You know when your bones at the fraud you know in your nuts that you want to buy it

372
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
You want to resist it

373
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,455
Water wants to come down hill

374
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,575
Go with your instincts

375
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,367
Who You Are

376
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,655
I'm going to really become who I really am in this struggle and that's why God put us in this position

377
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
Simulation of a real

378
00:19:54,239 --> 00:20:00,383
Question of our spiritual power

379
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
Stop it

380
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,735
Important message from Byram Healthcare

381
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,063
Jonathan time at 1 right

382
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,391
I don't read enough science fiction I know that comes up on this

383
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
Show a lot because I don't

384
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
References are like that

385
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,815
Will give you males every now and again sigh Ki that was just a plot of blank

386
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,863
I don't recognize

387
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,167
Some of this deep sci-fi that Alex loves

388
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
I was thinking like

389
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
Is that just the Borg

390
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,775
Or something like something

391
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Science fiction

392
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
Yeah I mean I got

393
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:35,711
Distracted whenever he said this is Garden of Eden all over again immediately following their these Corporation

394
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,783
Since fighting to become God so then in my head I was like wait

395
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,063
What part of the garden of

396
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
Eden myth

397
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,647
Do AAA is Battle being done

398
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,975
Buy multiple different entities in the garden

399
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,327
Free represent the corporation

400
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
Every bush

401
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,703
Is a banking family

402
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
You just don't understand the Deep metaphor

403
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,311
What's going on today in the Garden of Eden yet

404
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,919
I don't know also at the end there I I love him saying this isn't the simulation

405
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:10,527
Considering the entire reset was interview was about as a simulation

406
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
This is all a simulation

407
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
She might not like me

408
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,903
To hear that you can have the opposite

409
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Choosing

410
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,512
To just see through it and then you then your knee

411
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,144
I do enjoy Alex's

412
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680
Did it like Moviefone

413
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,240
Autopilot voice

414
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
That's that's always so great

415
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
So great

416
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
That's straight-up bulshit

417
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
Variance

418
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
Sincere

419
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,784
Schwab

420
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
Beastly where is he's the

421
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,648
You know I think he's really ascended to be one of the main villains

422
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
Is George Soros was really

423
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
Main villain

424
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
Years ago now he's kind of falling out of favor

425
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:59,936
We don't really talk about Soros at my contract

426
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,008
See I was a season for Soros

427
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,544
Turn turn turn

428
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,080
And it's a season

429
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,896
Where Klaus Schwab is the big bad guy

430
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:13,248
Alright this really interesting technique

431
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
Hi it in this clip

432
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
You'll be able to see what I'm talking

433
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
Mouth of Satan areas

434
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
Blood pressure to be together

435
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
Sign

436
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
Sofia Richie

437
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
We are here

438
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
Executioner

439
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Future

440
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,528
Delta designs future

441
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,088
You have to execute

442
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
Kia

443
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,696
I think the next two days

444
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
We will

445
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
Aubrey

446
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
How we decide

447
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
Planet apes

448
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Kobe

449
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
Define sistani

450
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Power Wheels

451
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,712
Areas with corporate and governmental world leaders all together

452
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,576
Microchips your body alone nothing you like it

453
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
You'll have nothing

454
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
Dlive everything

455
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,976
Big Pharma

456
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,536
Alicia's weapon control the censorship

457
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,864
Blowing it all out

458
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:37,728
All the CEOs basically non-white

459
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,008
Indian

460
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,288
They've got it all

461
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
What

462
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:51,040
Anderson correction an afterthought

463
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,088
Close Schwab Clippers

464
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,880
Speech that he gave at the world

465
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
Economic forum

466
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,952
And we talked about that

467
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
618

468
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
So

469
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
If you want to go back

470
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
Was baby talk about it

471
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,072
In Greater depth

472
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,608
You'll notice though that Alex

473
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Did this

474
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,168
Is this move that is referring to

475
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,264
He played clip of Schwab saying one thing and then as soon as it was over he makes

476
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,824
The bunch of claims about what was said of his conference

477
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:19,456
Anybody saying that they'll be microchips people have to put in their bodies and no one said

478
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
Anything about like you're knocking

479
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,296
An old anything and you're going to like it

480
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,320
I don't remember them

481
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:28,672
That was the topic of conversation

482
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:34,304
There's obviously video Schwab and everyone else's Beach is very easily accessible I mean Alex play the clip

483
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,400
He should have no problem putting these comments instead of mostly innocuous comment

484
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
Francois but he did play

485
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
Isn't playlist Clips cuz I don't

486
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Exist

487
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,824
That means the problem

488
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
The problem here is

489
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,640
Alex is getting a huge assist

490
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,944
From all of American pop culture

491
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,528
Because even me like I'm listening to that accent

492
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
Just going

493
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:00,928
Something's evil going on here every time every time since I was a kid if I heard that accent

494
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,000
Somebody was murdering James Bond or some s*** you know

495
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
Like it's it's not my fault

496
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,352
That is that is playing into his hands

497
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,424
Quite a bit you can play him sing something innocuous in that

498
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,728
Accenting people especially Alec

499
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,544
Will be like that dude's f****** evil is she

500
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,848
Also I think

501
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
I think that the biases

502
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
Is Ron strong

503
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,712
And then there's also biases that Alex have

504
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
Are worse

505
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
In terms of

506
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,880
They put in non-whites I mean Hitler was

507
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:44,448
I find that to be a really disgusting idea this notion that non-white people are put in those

508
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,520
Those roles in order to make it so if you criticize

509
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
Their aunt there censorship activities

510
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
Oh your race

511
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,968
That really is

512
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,784
Deservingness

513
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,344
Any non-white person who's getting into a CEO role

514
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
Obviously got to be kind

515
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Suspicious

516
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,464
This just being done as a mass shooter

517
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,512
That's the kind of idea that Alex is trying

518
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
22

519
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,864
Fright and really

520
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
Uno Alex

521
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
Has been censored by a lot of

522
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,496
He's been kicked off a lot of them

523
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,872
Danielak is a white man and he's the co Spotify who kicked Alex off

524
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,200
Mark Zuckerberg is the CEO of Facebook either way man

525
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,016
When Alex was kicked off Stitcher their CEOs Eric

526
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,064
James is another white man

527
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,928
Kick-off LinkedIn and their CEO is Ryan Russell and skeet another White Band

528
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,488
There's plenty of these instances of people who have

529
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,792
Put the kibosh on Alex's

530
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,840
Ability to use

531
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
You know

532
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
I was

533
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
I retook the turn

534
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,704
My turn towards hating white men

535
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
That would be a shocker

536
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,056
I think he's just ignoring those examples

537
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
And focusing on

538
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
Folks

539
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:03,040
Wants to hate because they're not white men it doesn't matter if you hurt me or not your non-whites

540
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,624
You can also like criticize anybody you want

541
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
It's not racist

542
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
If you can

543
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,744
If you guys don't be racist

544
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
I was actually thinking about it I'll take it out

545
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
Is mature enough to do that

546
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,144
Considered the possibility but the

547
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,424
Fentanyl the Chinese dragon

548
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,472
Then I realized

549
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
He's not going to be able to

550
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,056
That's how you want to like

551
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,872
Direct a lot of your criticism of

552
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
Doesn't give me hope

553
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
Criticize

554
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
Is the Chinese government plenty of time

555
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
X without saying

556
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
Any racist

557
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
Mike zeroh

558
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
Jason Statham

559
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
Can I have a

560
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,208
A full conversation

561
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
YouTube

562
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,304
And some of the problems with it without attacking

563
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
As Susan with Jackie from Evil Woman

564
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
You just don't

565
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:56,032
Completely unnecessary but I don't think Alex can I think he

566
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
These two hung up

567
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,104
So my man

568
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
Who's the good cop

569
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,456
No no no

570
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Don't worry no lockdowns

571
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,536
Normalize her to take whatever shots we want to give you

572
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,608
Always wear your mask from now on

573
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,680
Oh how nice of him

574
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:28,032
The New Normal

575
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Wow

576
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
The good cop

577
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,896
She's like no no

578
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,440
They'll be mandatory by next year

579
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
Born babies

580
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
In the first quarter will get the shots

581
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,608
I'm a nice man

582
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Good man

583
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,216
I'm going to help your children

584
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,568
All the mass murder in Manning commercial

585
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,896
Bible verses and remove even more of God's protection

586
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,688
Oh I hate that

587
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,832
Children

588
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
The castle

589
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
I really

590
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,464
I really hope it all those cool skeptic bro types who decided

591
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,768
All of a sudden that Alex has been right all along

592
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:25,888
I hope you're excited to realize what they've actually done is sign off on a right-wing Christian Fundamentalist

593
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
Extremist

594
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,008
It's hard to be iconoclastic and pretend that you're in some kind of a noble opposition

595
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,568
Group against Power structures but honestly

596
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
It's really impressive how Alex is managed

597
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
What's the scam these people at the

598
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,968
Take that what he's doing

599
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,296
Someone like Joe Rogan or Tim Dillon respond to someone who was

600
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
Alex saying that they need

601
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:52,000
About these vaccines because if you like then the devil will have free reign to come and make Mischief in the world

602
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,304
That's someone who wasn't Alex saying that

603
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,120
You think they want to talk to

604
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
You think Tucker would

605
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,216
You guys going to take timer to show to call that guy a great journalist

606
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,824
You know he's been right about a lot of things I don't know necessarily about the

607
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,200
Underpants all of it the bums me out even if

608
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,248
Even if God is real 100

609
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
Percent literal Chris

610
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:20,928
Christian God is real if you're telling me that this guide is at a point where he says okay fine

611
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
If you guys want vaccine

612
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,792
I'm going to take away a little bit more of my protection

613
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:29,888
Not all of it

614
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
How to take away

615
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,192
Guess what everybody

616
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
Can break their knee easier

617
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,800
That's it that's it that's what I'm doing like that God

618
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,360
Well it'd be really weird to imagine that

619
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
For a while God was

620
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,480
Was taking his time to make sure people had a harder time breaking their knees

621
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
Exactly

622
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,320
That seems unnecessary

623
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
Finite

624
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:53,440
Find your God but I'm not going to worship you I wash my hands of you so to speak

625
00:30:54,464 --> 00:31:00,352
Well I regret to inform you that got protection I was going to make it harder for you to wash your hands

626
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,192
So one of the big things that

627
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,472
Drew attention

628
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,264
Into this November 30th

629
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
Episode

630
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
I was that

631
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Some listeners

632
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
In Australia

633
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
Certainly a new Wok

634
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,480
Lachlan

635
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
And it turns out

636
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
That a member of the Australian government

637
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Happened

638
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
To be on Alex

639
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
To show

640
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Ayanna

641
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
A prompt

642
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Bubbly

643
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
Probably too like

644
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
Really push

645
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
Legislative progress

646
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,376
The policies that they want Australia to adopt

647
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,448
No they went to an American radio host early

648
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
No

649
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
Nirvana

650
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,848
George Christensen and

651
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,640
Nike until especially

652
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,200
People from Australia who have reached out

653
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:53,600
Guy's a weirdo real piece of s*** Alex giving him a nice introduction with

654
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
Sweet old plug

655
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,928
George Christensen

656
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,232
He is a member of

657
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,000
Parliament

658
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
From

659
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
William

660
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,352
And he is

661
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,936
Of the ruling liberal National Party

662
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Patient First

663
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,288
Cubs.com is where you can find

664
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,592
Informative

665
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
Waiding

666
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,432
So I have a little bit of a sneaking suspicion

667
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,296
About what's going on here with this interview with the Australian MP George Christie

668
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,624
I think he knows exactly what he's doing he's he's making

669
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,416
Some Sensational ass comments

670
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
About how

671
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,488
The covid response

672
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,280
In Australia is like

673
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,584
Nazi Germany or stalling

674
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,680
I think he knows what he's doing and showing up in places like Infowars

675
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:45,568
He's been in office since 22nd is a long history of being a bit of a dick but the swing he's taking now is

676
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
The bitlord

677
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,200
Hey birthday to tough time figuring out what was going on but in the course of reading up on the situation

678
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:57,088
I read in a few news stories that kristensen has already announced that he's retiring from his position as MP

679
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
At the next election

680
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,184
Yes absolutely nothing to lose from a political

681
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Perspective

682
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:06,816
Everything to gain from making a name for himself in the reactionary as right-wing media sphere

683
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:13,216
Ever since he announced his pending retirement earlier this year George has been ramping up his efforts to create online Revenue

684
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,776
By creating this upstack newsletter

685
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
As long as using Telegram

686
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,360
A nursery telegram types

687
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
Creeps bigot

688
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
That is

689
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:28,064
He's looking at that he's looking at that Greenwald substack money in thinking I would like some of that

690
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,136
Along with that he was asking his political party the liberal

691
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,672
No party to disinter

692
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,512
So we could keep a little bit over $105,000

693
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
In like a severance thing

694
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
A writer named Tim Wilson noticed that around this time to Christensen was getting pretty heavily involved in using his news

695
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,496
Letter to make a book recommendation

696
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
To his followers

697
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
However this wasn't just like eggs

698
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Read this book

699
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:55,712
Yeah it was also Christianson using Amazon affiliate marketing program to make a cut off the books

700
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,296
How the people bought through his leg

701
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,576
Get them coming and going

702
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,392
This kind of action has been seen as a bit Shady

703
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,672
For a sitting politician

704
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
Engaged

705
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:10,048
It feels like a strong indication that he's trying to make a move into the arena of monetizing

706
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
The following has

707
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
From being a bombastic

708
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,632
Politician

709
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,704
The picture of what he's up to seems pretty clear to me like

710
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,032
Actually being engaged in politics right now is a nightmare

711
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,872
Sucks thanks it to the opportunistic politicians and media figures and brazen

712
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,920
Conspiracy theories as a marketing tool

713
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
And now he's

714
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,760
Do you think getting out of governments

715
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,808
You keep using that marketing tool without the

716
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,088
Ditto

717
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,160
Expectation let me clean up the mess

718
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,840
What they're all doing this is essentially the gold rush like they're all in the East going like

719
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:49,472
There's no point in staying in Washington government anymore

720
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,544
Tricking dum-dums into paying for shipping don't need

721
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,872
Also I want to get too deeply into this cuz it seems really weird

722
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:00,224
Christensen also apparently has the nickname the member from Manila

723
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
Indian. Fishel circles because

724
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
An investigation revealed

725
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,648
Between 2014 and 2018 be taken at least

726
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
28 trips

727
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Cast of the Philippines

728
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,512
Sprint proximately 300 days there

729
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,584
It's all people have seen that is quite since

730
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,864
He just likes the food

731
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
Sure

732
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,472
Suspicious going on there it's a lot of trip

733
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,800
I mean come on and with the government

734
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,640
Does the Philippines have there's no way that you would experience any kind of corruption through that

735
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
Certainly.

736
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
So

737
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
Look George likes Alex

738
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
And that's great

739
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,528
Because Alex

740
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
Is a great place to Market yourself stack

741
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,624
And so that's probably what

742
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
This going on

743
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,464
Well thank you very much Alex

744
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,376
Bacon's we have around the world

745
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:54,496
God bless you search if they were interrupting at all time

746
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,616
12 like to hear what I have to say

747
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
Like to eat

748
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,968
People getting up and standing up for freedom and going against the

749
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,344
Vaccine mandate

750
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
What's a duck say

751
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
There it is consumed Australian

752
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:19,584
Q in the political leadership landscape that actually a standing up

753
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,656
Proofread

754
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,752
Back out for you to miss things

755
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,848
When

756
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
Government control

757
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:38,016
I'm not positive with true Freedom means but honestly just kind of sounds like a fun meeting was buzzword so to think

758
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,320
Guitar model shows like

759
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
Also it's

760
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:46,464
It's really really f****** funny for me to hear this guy say that there's very few people that are standing up for

761
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,792
True Freedom within the government knowing that he is retiring from his

762
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,328
Position is empty at the next election

763
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:55,168
If you actually believe there's a shortage of people standing up for Freedom against

764
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,448
Security within the government

765
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,240
Wouldn't the last thing he would think of

766
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
Badoing beat

767
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,568
Voluntarily leave and I will unless I have to

768
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
Looking for true freedom in the government

769
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,640
That seems nonsense

770
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,432
It seems like his ideas

771
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,456
What is expressing

772
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480
Alberto's action

773
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
Either that

774
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,600
Or he thinks that having a sub stack and going on shows like Infowars

775
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,696
That's a more effective way to influence Australian government policy

776
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,024
Actively involved in Australian governmental policy

777
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
Well I mean you know

778
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
It's like

779
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,144
If you're the leader

780
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,192
Of a group of Freedom fight

781
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,240
You know trying to

782
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
You get true freedom

783
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
People and not just

784
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,848
Not Justa

785
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
The people in government

786
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Then

787
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,944
Naturally what you do is you say

788
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,248
There aren't enough people around me

789
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
So I quit

790
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:48,672
That makes the most that we all remember when Nelson Mandela said this is too hard

791
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,720
I'm starting a livejournal

792
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
You know what

793
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,840
My MySpace page is going to take off

794
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,888
Yeah and then I'm going to be in a band

795
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,192
That's its

796
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,496
Heroes of true Freedom have done

797
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,544
All along

798
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,944
When the going gets really tough and there's no one standing up

799
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,344
Could I do that I'm by myself use my Amazon affiliate program to Market books to my dumb dumb followers

800
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
Megatut office

801
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:23,232
As the world ends around me I'm going to be a little bit more comfortable than other people

802
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah

803
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,304
Seems kind of like what a s*** head

804
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,864
Anyway

805
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
Some concerns

806
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,728
Rarest

807
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,568
Another shoe

808
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:47,296
You cannot hold a decent job unless you are vaccinated right now this second

809
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,344
Vaccinated

810
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
Social life

811
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,280
Popeyes restaurants

812
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,352
Where's Museum sporting events

813
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
If you're not vaccinated

814
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,704
So we truly I gag to have home

815
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
This is cute and all but it's also pretty stupid

816
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,080
George says that you can't hold

817
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,152
Decent job in Victoria unless you're vaccinated and that's just not

818
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
True

819
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:18,528
In early November Victoria announced the Mandate that workers in many fields will be required to be back

820
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
Estimated quote

821
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,112
If they want to do their jobs on site rather than working

822
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
Being remotely

823
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,928
That's a little different than exaggeration

824
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Employee

825
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
Open situation

826
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:32,864
Cleveland there's a broad vaccine mandate where many businesses and venues will require proof of

827
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:33,888
Games to enter

828
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,448
Specifically though as was reported

829
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,728
In the Australian quote

830
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,312
The Mandate does not apply to essential services such as supermarkets

831
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,616
Retail stores public transit places of worship

832
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
And funeral

833
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,480
This is not something like apartheid partially because

834
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
The choice

835
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:56,160
Apartheid was a system of racial discrimination where the people who are subjected to it where a brass because of an immutable characteristic

836
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
The color of theirs

837
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Skin

838
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000
In this case not getting vaccinated is a choice

839
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,536
And that choice comes with some

840
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Central benefits

841
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,328
Some drawbacks

842
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,936
Not getting vaccinated allows you to be super combative and print pretend that you had some kind of

843
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,728
Bizarre moral High Ground as it relates

844
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
Freedom

845
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:14,336
Which were someone like George is almost certainly a benefit and a marketing tool

846
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
And he's using it

847
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:20,480
Conversely a drawback of that decision is that you may not be welcome in many public spaces until the

848
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,272
Pandemic enters the Lesser

849
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
Endemic space

850
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,832
Because your decision to knock

851
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,160
Vaccinated puts people around you in those spaces at greater risk of

852
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
Contracted covid

853
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,536
Including be like other unvaccinated people who would be there around 2

854
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,072
It's like having a car

855
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
That you

856
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,656
Taped a s*** ton of Swords 2

857
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,704
That extends straight up

858
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,752
To the edge of the sidewalk and you're like what

859
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
If somebody gets cut by the source

860
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
Because they're off

861
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
The f****** sidewalk man

862
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:50,432
What I can't have a car now I can't have a car with a bunch of swords on

863
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,480
Interesting metaphor

864
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,040
Not many people go to

865
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:59,392
Are the car with sword metaphor yeah I was caught off-guard by that I will say that

866
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,000
The reality of the situation surrounding vaccine requirements to enter certain venues

867
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
No actual similarity

868
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,584
82 apartheid but that word because

869
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Alright think

870
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,168
Can people are offended by the historical reality of South

871
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
Apartheid

872
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
18% 90

873
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
It's really

874
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,800
Weird because he's

875
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,592
That not actually against

876
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
Actual apartheid

877
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,712
Apartheid supporters on his show

878
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:30,112
Yeah a historical heroes people in the John Birch Society people like Gary Allan

879
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,904
Very strongly

880
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,512
Opposed to the elimination

881
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,096
I'm not sure if this is like Solid Ground for these dudes

882
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:40,864
Do we say it again

883
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,400
I don't I don't know if

884
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
Cigna Medical Apartheid on Infowars

885
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
Is really

886
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,312
Worthwhile it would be a little bit like a

887
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
Appealing to the

888
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:57,247
Speech for the letter from a Birmingham Jail

889
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,551
Conversation

890
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:04,159
And they can have about Medical Apartheid but it would revolve around how many parts of the world don't have access

891
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,463
Vaccines even if they're public wants them

892
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,255
German article in the New York Times

893
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,327
Worldwide about 76% of shots

894
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
Instead of going into arms

895
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
Stupid administered in

896
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,167
Mahai and upper-middle-income

897
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
Countries

898
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,495
According to the our world in data project

899
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519
At the University of

900
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
Only point

901
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,871
5% of doses administered in low income

902
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431
I think there's an argument you can make it

903
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
In terms of

904
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,479
That

905
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,039
But if this this nonsense

906
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
George is going on about

907
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
Less

908
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
Less real

909
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,183
So there's one way that George

910
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,463
Think that you could stop this

911
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
This whole

912
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,023
Medical Apartheid

913
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,583
Basically just a get rid of

914
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
Data

915
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
Settled

916
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,191
Something that I think would stop it

917
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,727
Alex's that we had

918
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,127
Which is actually owned by the federal government

919
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,415
Mandatory vaccinations

920
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,975
The hints to the state

921
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,767
Governments that doesn't want them

922
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
To do this

923
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,375
That is simply

924
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
It's nice type government

925
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,079
Corporations

926
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
Treating that work is

927
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,407
Like slaves like chat

928
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,991
Remind if you got to work for us

929
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,831
Maximize it

930
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,623
These corporations

931
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,207
Outfits

932
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,255
Can actually tell their employees

933
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,791
What I can and can't do with it

934
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,351
So I would say

935
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,935
You know in the middle of a pandemic is always a good idea to get rid of data

936
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,519
Like that's usually that's a Sound Decision right

937
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,335
Stuff I do like that the right-wing respond

938
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
Wants to like

939
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,455
Okay so whenever we learn about history it doesn't

940
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,735
Look good for us

941
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,759
What if we just

942
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
Got rid of history

943
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:14,207
In the present Noah really bad news for George about what corporations can do at least in America

944
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:20,351
I'm not sure about Australian labor labor relationships but there are so many things that you can do with your body that can

945
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,631
Can totally get you fired

946
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,935
Tattoos you can be fired

947
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:27,007
For that give me fire private piercings that your boss doesn't like

948
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,799
You can be fired for having a tan

949
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,615
Conventional hairstyle that the boss is uncomfortable with

950
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
There's a bunch

951
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,199
Situations where you can actually be fired because you smell bad

952
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:40,319
We're so far away from living in a world where the choices that you make with your own body of

953
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
Protected from being used by

954
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,903
Employers to fire you or to not hire you

955
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,183
But there's another irony

956
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,767
Alex absolutely cannot advocate for better protection

957
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
Confirm

958
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,607
That's essentially a violation of one of his big principles

959
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,887
Freedom of Association

960
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,703
Is a voluntary agreement on both sides

961
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,263
This is just incoherent isn't ideology

962
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,639
Like employers obviously should be able to hire or not hire you based on whether you got a fax with you

963
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,407
I mean the

964
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,943
The fundamental

965
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,735
Angle here is

966
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
I don't think

967
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,319
Private Corporation should be allowed to

968
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,111
To do what I don't want them

969
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:14,879
Time to do

970
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
But

971
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,743
If anybody else tells them that they can't do anything

972
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,279
Especially if it's something they paid me

973
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,583
Then

974
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,119
They're evil

975
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
Yeah yeah

976
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,679
It's just

977
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Self-contradictory

978
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
Anyways

979
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,007
It's very dumb

980
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,543
So

981
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,127
This is this is largely about promoting that Subs

982
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,551
Amazing working ridings at Nation first. Sub stack.

983
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:48,159
We've got to jailbreak Australia folks that's one of the main places

984
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,815
We've got to fight this tyranny there to stop it here

985
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,655
Los Angeles in California New York Cesar globalist

986

987
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:10,687

I also feel a little bit off to recording care like I feel like my

992
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:32,703
I don't know how to do this right now everybody is taking a little bit of time away from you

993
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,055

1002
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
Jailbreak

00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,607
Australian Cattle jailbreak Australia

1004

That's weird

1005
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,911
It is an island

1006
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,727
The continent and we cannot allow that any longer

1007
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,007

Alex Williamson reports

1019
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,615
About the situation in Australia and wants to bring these up

00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,743
Helicopter

1023
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,791
Miles away

1024
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:06,399
We're going to go make sure they're all inoculated with none of them around civilization it's just

1025
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:09,983
Wild and images of a Megalodon and paddy wagons and driven away

1026
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,055
This is really really Draconian stuff

1027
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,639
Foot bunch of nonsense

1028
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:22,527
2021 article in the New York Times a couple of really important points are raised about the vulnerability of the Aboriginal

1029
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,807
Communities in Australia

1030
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,879
The indigenous population only has an approximately

1031
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,671
15% vaccination rate

1032
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,719
In New South Wales quote

1033
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:34,047
Most of the area's 98 coronavirus cases are among

1034
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
Indigenous people

1035
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:41,215
Piccalilli serious issue here because among indigenous populations there's often a higher prevalence

1036
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,799
Conditions which would put people at a greater risk of

1037
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,103
Severe cases and death if they got covid

1038
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,407
The article includes this paragraph

1039
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687

Contracting covid-19

1046
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,303
The impact on our community

1047
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
Could be devastating

1048
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,631
In there. Meant their first

1049
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,703
Request was for more trained nurses to administer vaccines

1050
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:19,871
Indigenous Australians aren't being rounded up and if Alex were forced to cite a source on this he would stammered and then he would just try to change

1051
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
The subject

1052
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:27,295
There was an article in the guardian actually from late November that included a comment from the Aboriginal Medical Services

1054

00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,623
Who said this was all nonsense

1056
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,463
The Northern Territories chief minister chimed in

1057
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,535

00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,711
The layout basics

1108
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Information

1109
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,063
Real quick Alex does play the clip of George

1110
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:42,207
Responses like Nazi Germany

1111
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,071
Ebola

1112
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:52,191
Did not enjoy it man basically he got censored or talked over which is

1113
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,471
How could

1114
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
Horrible

1115
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,967
Call shoaib

1116
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,247
His message to

1117
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,551
Patriots

1118
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,487
But I only care about the street

1119
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,047
What is his message to the world

1120
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,839
Millions of people are watching right now

1121
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,935
Position Sheraton Millions more

1122
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,495
Cannot stand

1123
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:30,335
This information coming out exhaust and L

1124
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,807
Where they are arresting and basically disappearing people eat

1125
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,463
This Edition has gotten a little frenetic

1126
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,511
Else is speeding up a little

1127
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,303
I also do at the end of that clip

1128
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,375
Really really interested me the way Alex is phrasing

1129
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,423
I would love for him to try and

1130
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,775
Explain in any kind of a coherent fashion have something happening Australia

1131
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,055
Possibly serve as a Presa

1132
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
For us laws

1133
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,127
We have entirely different kinds

1134
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
2 Chainz

1135
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,943
Different organizational structures of government

1136
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,967
The idea is

1137
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,783
Is really really stupid but Alex says it all the time

1138
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,087
Like it's an idea that's so dumb

1139
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,671
But it often goes in one of my ears and out the other

1140
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
Think about it

1141
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:21,535
You're not understanding that Australia is weakening our first amendment protects

1142
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:28,191
In the same way that God is weakening his protection over it's and it's all over these jab legitimately don't know what pressing

1143
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
Could be set

1144
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,751
Buy Australia

1145
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,055
For you as well

1146
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,895
Somebody at the Supreme Court day like one time in Australia

1147
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,455
Cool

1148
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
Alright

1149
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,063
All right it is that going to help us what are we doing here

1150
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
Well

1151
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:51,743
I guess I guess we've reached an impasse we've got to follow precedent here

1152
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:58,911
What are the things that he has primarily focused on in this interview that he really wants to nail down

1153
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,959
Is about the idea of there being

1154
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,287
People are going to be taken

1155
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,311
There is some camp

1156
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
Tell us about the

1157
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,943
Wants to know about those and they're in there

1158
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:18,879
You're going to take shots on a routine basis

1159
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,719
Don't talk to your neighbors I mean

1160
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,535
This is why God episode of Red Dawn or something

1161
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,583
Spanish Gary

1162
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,631
Very very scary and lot of paper

1163
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,703
Questioning

1164
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,287
E4

1165
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,847
Incoming arrivals

1166
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,871
Korn change

1167
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,175
7 diezman the question is

1168
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,735
Security

1169
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,503
Christmas

1170
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,111
The second thing is that they're actually

1171
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,647
Nothing used for

1172
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,207
Incoming arrivals

1173
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,607
Endeavor July

1174
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,935
Round Up anyone who dis

1175
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,495
And put them in there

1176
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,871
It's going to be like

1177
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,967
And I want to come and get laid

1178
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:26,975
Designview

1179
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,023
Into some quarantane cab

1180
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,351
So there's there's two quarantine facilities in the Northern Territory

1181
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,423
There's the center for National resilience

1182
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,703
Annie Alice Springs

1183
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,727
Quarantine facility

1184
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:41,823
Australian to a returning to the country into the airport

1185
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,383
Vaccinated or not are required

1186
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,175
To go to one of the centers for 14 days

1187
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:50,015
They offer flexible payment plans and there's some amenities like there

1188
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:51,807
Get food

1189
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,623
So they don't look exactly like a prison

1190
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,415
I bet you could probably find

1191
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,463
Some pictures of like

1192
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,303
Offense somewhere probably find

1193
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,839
Something that would look

1194
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
But don't look

1195
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:13,055
And you got people like this f****** dude winding up in a quarantine camp and they're going to

1196
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:20,991
In May Robyn Dixon wrote an op-ed about her experience staying at the center for National resilient to the wash

1197
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
Washington Post

1198
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,295
Experience sounds nothing like

1199
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,063
Like what George is

1200
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,111
Describing it sounds kind of just like

1201
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,671
I may be a slightly annoying Resort

1202
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,951
Beautiful

1203
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,511
Yeah I wouldn't want to go to any Resort that I didn't

1204
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,535
I have a choice

1205
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,887
To go to a really nice place I've been like I didn't want to be here right now

1206
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:43,775
From everything I can tell these primarily exists to allow travel to and from Australia without risking people bring a

1207
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,543
Incase

1208
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,311
Djokovic

1209
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:49,151
Unless George could demonstrate any of the stuff that he saying I'd love to assume that he's

1210
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,199
Alex and making s*** up

1211
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
But I do think

1212
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,271
I think there are some

1213
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,831
Instances where people can't quarantine on their own

1214
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,647
They can go there as well

1215
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,671
So I don't think it's

1216
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,463
Entirely for travel based

1217
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,255
Quarantine right right

1218
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,815
Did the way that it's being discussed here just

1219
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,839
Does not match up with n

1220
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
Anything I could sign

1221
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,911
Yeah I know I do appreciate that

1222
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,959
What style of old man beating his chest

1223
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,007
That's like hey if they come to my house

1224
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,567
And try and steal me just cuz I had it covered posit

1225
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,359
Like

1226
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,151
That's a thing that's not going to happen

1227
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:26,527
True orakai come to my home and try and kill me Dan I will fight to my very last breath

1228
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,063
But you notice to how like

1229
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,623
Like that ideation that violent ideation

1230
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,695
Is the exact same as Alex

1231
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,975
Yep it's

1232
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,999
It's almost like the

1233
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,791
The fantasy of being able to fight

1234
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,095
People off who want to take you to a fever again

1235
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:40,863
Is like

1236
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
Pleasant thing

1237
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,263
Him and Giorgio Pizza in the same pod

1238
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,895
In that sense a certain extent it does feel like maybe there is just a

1239
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,687
Type of person that is

1240
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:59,551
Criminally incapable of existing in a modern society and Woodruff

1241
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,343
Prefer to return to like a

1242
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:05,951
Fictional I fight for every bit of grain that I have it I guess

1243
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
Something like that

1244
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:12,863
Yeah George's interview is largely like these are some of the main points that get hit

1245
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
There's

1246
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
A lot of

1247
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
Nonsense

1248
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,447
Ninja Turtle

1249
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:20,287
Boring conversation some conversation about the protest

1250
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:24,383
Sure are the anti mask protest

1251
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,663
And what have you

1252
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,735
What are the things that people really

1253
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,527
I took issue with

1254
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,855
Is some of the comments he's made in the recent past

1255
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,391
How about civil disobedience

1256
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,927
And I don't

1257
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:40,255
Know if you said anything that Rose to the level of like

1258
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
That sound

1259
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
Scary

1260
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:45,119
On this episode

1261
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,447
Sounds kind of like a s*** head was trying to get out of politics and into a right-wing

1262
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,215
Grift

1263
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,287
That's a smart move

1264
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,567
I think it's

1265
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,359
Easier yeah oh yeah wait wait

1266
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
Jordan

1267
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,455
Considerate

1268
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,759
When you get into the right-wing grift

1269
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Like Alex

1270
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,575
You're risking your life

1271
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,855
Oh what

1272
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,927
Free coming up here folks this is a total war

1273
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:17,119
We could be

1274
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,239
That's okay

1275
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:27,103
Don't want to hurt and children into people

1276
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,151
But I'm not

1277
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:37,087
Just please keep us in the fight and please financially supported

1278
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,207
Products you need

1279
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,255
Like a Mountain Dew

1280
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,791
So Alex goes out to break

1281
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,071
And he comes back to

1282
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,607
The 3rd hour

1283
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
I don't even know what the

1284
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,679
To say about this this is just

1285
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
Bizarre

1286
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:04,991
Ecology

1287
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,039
Populations of

1288
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,575
Former

1289
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,135

01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,175
You will become stronger than you can

1309
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,503
Does it mean you're perfect

1310
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:13,343
It doesn't mean you're a masochist

1311
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,927
You got to go through to protect

1312
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,743
It will actually become pleasure

1313
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,791
And once you have

1314
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:28,447
How much people have attacked you and lied about you and you forgive them as Christ said

1315
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,519
Absolutely

1316
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:32,799
Devastation

1317
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,591
Don't know what to do

You don't even want to do that

1320
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:44,319
What transfer over you

1321
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
Beautiful

1322
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:50,207
And I've been a very angry person I've hated

1323
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,047
Have you

1324
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:58,911
My stress levels

1325
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:06,079
Because I've learned to forgive my enemies it doesn't mean I don't prosecute him it doesn't mean that I do

1326
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,127
What they're doing to stop

1327
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,199
Let them know

1328
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,223
Yes

1329
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,391
Wow

1330
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,439
Thought that I have threat like listening

1331
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:25,023
Into something like that something as bizarre as that

1332
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,815
First of all this is no place on the news

1333
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,607
Absolutely not this is

1334
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,655
The psychodrama that he's having with a nips

1335
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,215
Second thing I think

1336
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,007
Is

1337
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:41,407
When he's talking about like you have to experience persecutions pleasure

1338
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
Joy

1339
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,991
Are you feel like if you believe that too much

1340
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,527
You might want

1341
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,807
2 Triana

1342
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:52,927
Experience everything is persecution sure because then you can translate that into

1343
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,975
Pleasure well you see people like

1344
01:02:55,231 --> 01:03:01,375
Pleasure and so they seek out expera experiences that give them pleasure if you enjoy quote-unquote

1345
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,399
Persecution

1346
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,935
And it becomes pleasurable

1347
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,471
Then perhaps you have an incentive

1348
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,495
To continue being a

1349
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,519
S***

1350
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:10,079
Well

1351
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,359
Hypothetical person

1352
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,151
I'm sure something I was

1353
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
Is that

1354
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
If I was

1355
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,759
Talking over that song

1356
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:22,111
Or if I started talking in that song was playing I would be like please stop that I got to write

1357
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,159
This out this song put

1358
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,439
Pressure on you

1359
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,487
To deliver the inspirational speech

1360
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,815
Conversely if that song was playing

1361
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:35,167
And I was talking I would say turn that f****** song off

1362
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,447
Because it you know

1363
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,495
The stakes are too high

1364
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,055
I look like an a******

1365
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,895
I look like a try-hard a******

1366
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,431
Pull it off though with the

1367
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,711
Quality rating

1368
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,271
Well then what the real question I guess we're left with his

1369
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,807
Did Alex pull it off

1370
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,903
Disagree

1371
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,439
He's not a masochist though

1372
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,463
Noshir

1373
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,231
Sure

1374
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:02,815
I mean he did describe Define masochism almost

1375
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,583
Exactly though

1376
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
Turning

1377
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,935
The persecution of pleasure

1378
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:08,703
Yeah

1379
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,471
Kind of

1380
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,775
And he said that's the thing he was

1381
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,823
And that you should be

1382
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,431
Because if you do that you no longer have to do that

1383
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:25,599
No longer hate your enemies about how Brian stelter

1384
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,647
Ears nose makes you feel real

1385
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,951
The only thing that's true

1386
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,231
That I heard there was

1387
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,815
That he has been an angry person he has been

1388
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,351
That was honest

1389
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,143
I appreciate this

1390
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:40,191
Alex does clarify that

1391
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
In this

1392
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
War

1393
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,007
These in

1394
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,287
And we are all in

1395
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
Extension

1396
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,103
The wind will not come

1397
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,895
By tearing off people's heads

1398
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,687
Which is good news

1399
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,991
You're not going to win this

1400
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:59,135
Standing up against evil

1401
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,695
Being an example to others

1402
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:05,791
Letting them

1403
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,839
Troy Gentry

1404
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:10,911
As man

1405
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,215
Women can step in that office as well

1406
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,519
Lily men's jobs

1407
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,287
To fight evil

1408
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:21,151
People should be hiding under a rock

1409
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:25,759
Everywhere

1410
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:26,783
What are you doing

1411
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,063
Because good people

1412
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,599
Stop standing up against it

1413
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
Okay

1414
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,231
Most the time I get in here and I cover like three stacks on 20

1415
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:39,071
I really need at least hit on somebody else actually they're really important

1416
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,911
Today's news

1417
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:46,495
What is shocked you didn't get to the stories from yesterday

1418
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:52,895
Behavior today would not lead me to believe that you're behind on the man refused

1419
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,943
You cannot tell me tomorrow's news today

1420
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,479
If you're reading yesterday Peddler

1421
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,551
Okay well that's fair

1422
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,087
We'll get some of these headlines

1423
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
But first

1424
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:05,695
Alex has to sing along with Born to Be Wild

1425
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:20,287
Unreal

1426
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:26,687
We haven't stopped caring Loveless a stop hearing

1427
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:33,087
About article I love the criminal

1428
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:39,487
I love them coming after me cuz I'm now making up

1429
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:45,887
My children that I had chopped up and thrown in garbage can what

1430
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:52,287
I'm ashamed of you know what I can just feel the change

1431
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,615
Eternity

1432
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,991
Thank you God

1433
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:08,159
What do you think about that Joe Rogan

1434
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,951
I get high

1435
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
Oso

1436
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,559
Seems like it was a non sequitur that's because it was

1437
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,119
I thought it was very bizarre that he

1438
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,399
Start singing along

1439
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,959
I've been is like

1440
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:25,311
I'm making up Rock Hill I mean yeah yeah

1441
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:29,663
I think I think this is evidence of why there should never be a meteor

1442
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,431
Conglomerate

1443
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,991
And all media Should Be Your Own Boss

1444
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,015
Because

1445
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,575
Fuk fuk every new show if you

1446
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,111
You can at least once a day go

1447
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:44,767
Crank It Up Crank It Up baby it's pretty good

1448
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,559
Crank It Up Baby get it out of

1449
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,631
I worry when I hear things like what came

1450
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:56,031
After the crank it up baby

1451
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,359
Roberts Airport

1452
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,383
Yeah

1453
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,431
Think that we just

1454
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
We keep getting

1455
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,015
Like a clearer and clearer picture of

1456
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,551
How much

1457
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:10,623
Alex seems to be plagued by his past actions

1458
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,439
And how much his history with abortion

1459
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,743
Seems to

1460
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:18,303
Buta he describes it as chains on him

1461
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:21,631
And I think it I think maybe there is some reality to that

1462
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,935
I think

1463
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,239
In some way

1464
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,031
Imagine

1465
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,335
Persecution that he's experienced

1466
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,895
He's turning that into like this is the

1467
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,455
The Penance that I pay for that

1468
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,223
And that's

1469
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:36,991
Where he gets

1470
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:37,759
The Joy from

1471
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,575
Absolving me of the

1472
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,855
The guilt that I had

1473
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:42,879
Who were

1474
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,647
Those Acts

1475
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,183
Actions that I took younger in life

1476
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,975
And that's pretty f***** up

1477
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,279
Man I feel like if a

1478
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:55,167
It's like a really weird oh church had just taught him how to hit his back with a cat-o'-nine-tails

1479
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,447
When he was like 8

1480
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,239
We would all have been saved so much

1481
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,311
Like if you just want to flagellate f******

1482
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:04,639
It's been going on for thousands of years man

1483
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:11,039
Chop your backup I'm fine with that the lord loves it or whatever go for it don't scream at me on the radio

1484
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:15,903
I think that's self-flagellation or

1485
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,183
I don't know

1486
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:21,279
Get like you seen a dominatrix or something to our would-be healthier Outlets

1487
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,815
Then super healthy eating

1488
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,095
A destructive

1489
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,399
Political ideology

1490
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,751
Talking bulshit on air all the time about stories that are

1491
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,543
Not true not for the

1492
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,591
First time has it been pointed out

1493
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:39,199
That sex work is infinitely better for human beings then belief in

1494
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,503
4

1495
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,783
Talk shows

1496
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,367
We get to the story

1497
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,903
He's now that Alex has gotten his

1498
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
Bizarre

1499
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,975
Song

1500
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,999
Out-of-the-way

1501
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,535
So you're the first

1502
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,327
Okay let's

1503
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,191
Forbes

1504
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,495
Yes

1505
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,823
Go back CB mRNA changes your DNA

1506
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,383
But it's good for you

1507
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,711
Hey buddy

1508
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:14,527
You're not supposed to say that

1509
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:33,983
So there was a Forbes headline that was quote yes but I seen changes your DNA

1510
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:39,871
Naturally this got some backlash so the author had the headline changed to add Clarity to it

1511
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,407
It was updated to quote

1512
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:46,271
Covid vaccines don't alter your DNA they helped you cells to strengthen your immune

1513
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
The offers

1514
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,879
Steve Salzburg tried to explain his point telling Reuters

1515
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:54,975
Quote some of your immune cells multiply in large numbers to fight off the

1516
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
Infection

1517
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:59,071
Some of those cells stay around which is what gives you immunity

1518
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:05,727
The technical point I was trying to explain was that those cells have slightly different DNA from all your other cells

1519
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:11,359
The changes in the DNA of those cells which occurs through a crazily complex process called

1520
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,151
Vdj recombination

1521
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,711
Occur before you're vaccinated or infected

1522
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,503
So the vaccine doesn't

1523
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,295
Cause the changes directly

1524
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:21,087
But it does change the overall make

1525
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,623
Picture of DNA in your cells

1526
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,647
I in your body

1527
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,951
Anyway the idea that the headline was changed

1528
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,743
Become a bit of an anti vaxxer meme

1529
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:31,839
And that's about the death of a story that Alex is capable of covering so here we are

1530
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,399
First headline

1531
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,423
That's just one of those

1532
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,959
Situations where

1533
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,519
You by virtue of knowing so f***

1534
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,287
Talking much

1535
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,567
You just have these

1536
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,591
Assumption

1537
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,127
That when I'm explaining

1538
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,151
To somebody

1539
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,175
They know these

1540
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,455
He's very base level

1541
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,551
You know so you're like I can say yes it Alters your DNA

1542
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,319
Because

1543
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,087
I know

1544
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,391
A million different like ways to

1545
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,951
To contextualize that everything you're probably used

1546
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,511
The talking to people who have that kind of

1547
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,279
Nuanced

1548
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,815
Understanding of what you

1549
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,399
If you didn't understand so many of my idioms

1550
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,471
You would think I know

1551
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:15,871
Incomprehensible or most of the time that I talked to anybody about Alex Jones

1552
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:20,223
It's not a fault thing but it is one of those that is a thing that you need to be aware of

1553
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:20,991
Of going in

1554
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,527
If you're an expert

1555
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,063
You have to be aware that

1556
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,343
That you cannot

1557
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,111
Communicate

1558
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,647
The way that you're used to

1559
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,671
Communicating all the

1560
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:29,951
You just can't

1561
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,743
Probably not

1562
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,839
The headline as it exists I was

1563
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,911
It's clearer certainly

1564
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:39,679
Be mad

1565
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,471
Here's the second headline

1566
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,495
Think

1567
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,199
12 gauge double ought Buck right into it

1568
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,831
The study showed you Sunday and causes the worst

1569
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,367
Goebbels

1570
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:06,303
One part of the Spiral repair

1571
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:08,095
The worst

1572
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:12,959
Weapon you can have

1573
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:27,039
You just sit there

1574
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:33,439
Immune system

1575
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:37,279
Murder their children

1576
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,887
Is

1577
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:44,447
Is this a headline from yesterday as if yesterday

1578
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,543
Okay

1579
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:54,943
So I wasn't really specific at all I didn't know what to do with that but thankfully Alex start

1580
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,967
Mentioning these studies

1581
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,015
Oh, that he was talking about

1582
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783
And so we can

1583
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
Secret Service

1584
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,319
That's what's going on

1585
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:04,927
Images of major study of stars coming to spike a DNA

1586
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,975
Damage repair inhibits

1587
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,791
Vdj recombination in vitro

1588
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:16,191
What is in the vaccine creates the same Spike protein and does indeed destroy yourself

1589
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:24,895
Literal

1590
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:28,735
What are the conspiracy theories surrounding this article for this study don't even

1591
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,015
Even say the things that he saying

1592
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,551
About the like

1593
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,575
Double

1594
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:38,207
Severing D I don't know what's going on

1595
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,255
Alex is Donner partying it across

1596
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:43,839
West Coast I was a little I was a little bit worried

1597
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,887
Cuz it didn't match up at all but then he has a second

1598
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:50,239
Non-homogeneous DNA in joining

1599
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:53,055
Pathways to double-strand brake repair

1600
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,335
Nature.com

1601
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,639
Really doesn't nice thing

1602
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:59,711
I guess this is where we get to the double-stranded DNA break

1603
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:04,575
Comes in entirely misreading the title of the study

1604
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,879
It's actually quote nonhomologous.

1605
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:10,207
DNA end joining and other alternative pathways

1606
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,999
Two double strand brake repair

1607
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,559
Also this is from an August

1608
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,863
2017 issue of the journal

1609
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:20,703
The nature reviews molecular cell biology Sheriff

1610
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:23,519
The study of nothing to do with covid or the covid vaccine

1611
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,591
It doesn't even have to do with anything that causes double strand breaks

1612
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,871
Halfway

1613
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,663
Do such breakages being repaired

1614
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,455
4th and argument

1615
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,503
Nothing has been done here and I'm

1616
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:39,391
I'm just confused you know I'm not I'm not

1617
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,159
Butter

1618
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,207
If somebody is reading me something

1619
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
And I'm like

1620
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,511
I don't understand the words

1621
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,535
Spin what you're saying

1622
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,327
I'm not going to be like

1623
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,119
Well then I'm afraid and I believe you

1624
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,775
You aren't you aren't meant to be

1625
01:15:56,031 --> 01:16:02,175
What's the name of the game and it's because you can really tell by the way he's

1626
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:07,807
Reading these pigs

1627
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,599
Here's an easier heads

1628
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:13,695
History of mRNA vaccines

1629
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,095
Amazon

1630
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,911
Yeah goes on and on

1631
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:26,751
That's all you need to say I was just completely misrepresenting this article

1632
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:31,359
It's mostly about how the history of mRNA technology being used for vaccines

1633
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,687
Fraught with trouble mostly involving people not wanting

1634
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,967
Invest in it because

1635
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:39,039
Who sing this too expensive and the MRNA was too prone to

1636
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,063
Degrading rapidly

1637
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:43,903
Best most investment went to other projects and this is a very

1638
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,671
Extensive

1639
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:48,255
Discussion about innovations that were made

1640
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,535
Different ways that

1641
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,071
The technology went from

1642
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,095
Being

1643
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,631
Mostly only

1644
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:58,751
It was considered as viable for research purposes into being something that's more

1645
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,055
Applicable as a medical thing

1646
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,943
Has nothing to do with any of that stuff

1647
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,247
Cool pretty dumb

1648
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,551
Here's I'm going to censor Alex

1649
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,343
The same way that Christians

1650
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:23,071
So this is really what I want to shows more about okay week

1651
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,935
There were many of them not really

1652
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,983
In-depth coverage this pisses the

1653
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,591
Boba

1654
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,927
Everybody

1655
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:55,071
Josef Mengele on steroids baby

1656
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:01,215
Society at his mommy ran it

1657
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,519
Even on a mission

1658
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:07,103
Kill you if you don't stand up and say no you deserve to die

1659
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,431
If you don't stand for the children

1660
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:11,711
12 in

1661
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,247
I guess just sent

1662
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,879
Demons nightcrawlers

1663
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,743
I think Alex might have taken

1664
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,279
Turbo Force at some point

1665
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:29,119
Cuz he's he's getting weird

1666
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:33,727
For sure you just playing

1667
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,775
If you don't say no to a demon

1668
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:40,383
That demon is actually God's punishment for you not saying no to edema

1669
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,407
What's

1670
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,199
Again I don't like his guy

1671
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
Is God

1672
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,735
Piece of s***

1673
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:49,087
It's a mess so I I thought that we were done with headlines

1674
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,367
But we are

1675
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,391
It turns out

1676
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,415
There's some other import

1677
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,439
Stuff going on

1678
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:56,767
Mass killings under communist regimes here is to

1679
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,559
PDX

1680
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:02,143
Deleted because it's racist

1681
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:10,079
So there's a Wikipedia article on communist Mass killing

1682
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,615
That was

1683
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,895
Is up for delete

1684
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,431
Sure up for review

1685
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,199
Fertilization

1686
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,735
Has nothing to do with racism though

1687
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,503
That's

1688
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,295
Some folks on Wikipedia believe in that the

1689
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,831
The framing of all these events

1690
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:24,159
Communist mass killings is not necessarily historically accurate

1691
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,695
And it likes a bit of a new w

1692
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,231
It should be

1693
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:31,327
The applied to these topics again Wikipedia at like 8 doesn't have a board

1694
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,119
There's no one in charge of it it's

1695
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:36,447
It's not like there's a shadowy force here trying to whitewash communism

1696
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,239
Really weird

1697
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:41,311
That Alex is pointing to they said something that is worth

1698
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,127
The pointed-toe recycle look

1699
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:48,735
Conspiracy here actually does seem like I think that would be

1700
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,039
Huge and Alex's world just

1701
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:51,807
Because

1702
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,599
If it were to become a

1703
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,415
Accepted on Wikipedia to kind of

1704
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,183
More nuanced

1705
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:57,951
What's 2

1706
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,975
Did the communist

1707
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,767
Murder everybody articles

1708
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:04,095
I've been more people would be like oh no it was a

1709
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,399
Communism economics

1710
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,423
System it was

1711
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,215
The government

1712
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,239
Audrey's place

1713
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
Do you know what I mean

1714
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,543
For sure but

1715
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,336
Wicked Wikipedia

1716
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,616
Anybody can edit it

1717
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,408
You know like

1718
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:20,736
Target for

1719
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:26,112
Not nothing obviously there's no if they want

1720
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:30,720
Yeah but there's a mass Purge

1721
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,768
It's going well nevermind

1722
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:36,096
Represent override Wikipedia

1723
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:42,496
By the way honey go back to one of the articles on discovering earlier

1724
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,104
Something on Wikipedia

1725
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,320
Marxism

1726
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:07,584
Saul Alinsky

1727
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:11,168
Was Jewish Eden golfer cloud

1728
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:21,152
Weather

1729
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,944
What is happening

1730
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:27,296
No part of this jump from Wikipedia to the abl

1731
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:30,880
I feel like we've really lost with red hair

1732
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,416
Wikipedia.

1733
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:34,720
I think I know what's going on and that is that I think

1734
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,536
Because Alex uses Wikipedia as a source

1735
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,584
He doesn't realize that other media Outlets

1736
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352
Don't do that

1737
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,120
That's what I say

1738
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:44,960
Yeah Wikipedia Pages generally aren't even considered acceptable sources

1739
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,240
College papers

1740
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,776
Alex

1741
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:50,848
But they're gospel to everyone else

1742
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,616
Which is weird

1743
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,920
But I don't know how we jumped at ATL

1744
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,456
But somehow we did

1745
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,224
Quick

1746
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:56,992
And look

1747
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:58,272
I don't know if it look up

1748
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:02,112
PD page is the only thing that Alex has red on the idea of cultural Marxism

1749
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,160
But it's definitely an idea that

1750
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,976
The only promoted by deeply anti-semitic folks and white Nash

1751
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:08,768
Either

1752
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,560
Alex is completely lie

1753
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,120
Anti-semitism

1754
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,400
Relive any grass

1755
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,424
On the topic is discussed

1756
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:17,984
Stop

1757
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,288
That was really weird

1758
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,592
Yeah yeah that's no good no

1759
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,664
I don't appreciate that and you're totally right

1760
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,688
It's because like

1761
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,016
If you're a person who printed out a wicked

1762
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,040
Pedia articles

1763
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,320
How to put on your desk

1764
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,624
So you could read it on the radio

1765
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:41,024
Then you assume that other media Outlets are just like well Wikipedia's good enough whenever he goes to like an overhead

1766
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:46,912
Shot all the Times Herald just be Wikipedia articles in his stacks of important

1767
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:50,240
If you print out a Wikipedia article you're the one who should be

1768
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,288
Be judged

1769
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:55,104
Don't know what to jump to the ATL was

1770
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,896
Felt weird

1771
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,432
Feels weird

1772
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,760
And it only gets weirder oh no

1773
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,040
Imagine

1774
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:05,856
Water slide for all the nice wonderful Jewish people out there

1775
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:13,280
Suzanne habash weird criminal groups and they represent them

1776
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,584
Going out attacking and bullying people

1777
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,144
Hiding behind shoes

1778
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,080
What

1779
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,128
They must be stopped

1780
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:39,136
I don't want us to really come together under God day don't want us coming together we're very close to that they want to bring us under communism

1781
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,440
Unity

1782
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,208
So Kate

1783
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,232
The abl

1784
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,304
Is hiding behind Jewish people

1785
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,328
In order to

1786
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,120
To stop Alex and his friends

1787
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:51,168
From being able to come together under God

1788
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:55,520
F*****-up far as a way to attack

1789
01:23:55,776 --> 01:24:01,152
Jewish people I'm not under sure I'm not sure if I can understand a more aggressive way

1790
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:01,920
2

1791
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:04,736
Would you be like I hate Jewish people then to say

1792
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:08,576
See Jewish people look at them hiding behind Jewish people

1793
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:12,928
I got to get through that wall of Jewish people before I can get to those Jewish people

1794
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,464
It's

1795
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,488
Not a good look

1796
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,024
It's

1797
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,328
But what he's doing is kind of making

1798
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,120
The other side

1799
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:22,656
Pretty clearly

1800
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,192
So now I mean like

1801
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:27,776
Okay we've had this interview with the weirdo Australian

1802
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,848
Screaming over Born to Be Wild

1803
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,640
You've gotten to the news

1804
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,712
It don't make sense

1805
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:39,296
Another exciting

1806
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,536
Hundreds of questions on the street

1807
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,888
Tons of emails and calls her to the office thing Tellez

1808
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,936
About satellite phones

1809
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,568
Military has gone way down on him

1810
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,848
Are we really doing this

1811
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,384
Compact model

1812
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,176
I don't have them on the infomercial here

1813
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,480
Get them on

1814
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:13,856
On.com

1815
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,672
Satellites

1816
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:20,768
Water pump

1817
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:27,168
They're not an infomercial but they are making a piece of video that's full of information

1818
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,472
May Shield that can be used for a commercial

1819
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,752
It's kind of like an information

1820
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:34,848
Commercial the only response I had at the end of that way

1821
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
Beautiful

1822
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:43,040
Describe an introvert

1823
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,320
The fantastic

1824
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,856
Now this is hilarious

1825
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,904
Videos like f*** this noise

1826
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:55,072
Last half-hour of the show is this

1827
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:59,424
Should have a satellite phone

1828
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,704
And watch the game

1829
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:07,104
Because I know you're one of the biggest suppliers out there you supply a lot of military supply line the board Pro

1830
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:16,576
This motherfukers phone is cutting out

1831
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:20,928
To have the best phone connection if you're a fungi

1832
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,696
It's

1833
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,464
Pretty fun

1834
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,256
It's really really funny

1835
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:29,120
And it's so bad it's connection is so terrible that Alex even has to call it out

1836
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,400
Soon as I pull it out

1837
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:32,192
Music

1838
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:36,032
Clarity whole time I can talk to an engineer doctor

1839
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,824
Family member for hours

1840
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:41,664
I need to clear it's a lot clearer than your Skype

1841
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,992
Hahaha

1842
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,296
Oh boy

1843
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:50,112
Do they just do it in commercial about Alex

1844
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:50,880
Infowars

1845
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,928
Phone for the rest of the day

1846
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,744
This is dumb

1847
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,816
Yeah I don't I don't appreciate

1848
01:26:59,328 --> 01:26:59,840
I mean

1849
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:03,168
It's another Revenue stream it's yet another

1850
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,288
The thing that we are info marshalling I assume that we're going to start picking up a lot more Prada

1851
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,568
Enchanted we go along

1852
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,336
Maybe

1853
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,360
You know that mean

1854
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,896
Beefy can attract people

1855
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,920
Who were willing

1856
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:14,688
To be involved

1857
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:21,344
And if your Skype connections that bad yourself your satellite phone has to be sold on it forward that's kind Rob looking at

1858
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,880
Yep

1859
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,160
This episode like

1860
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,440
It's just people

1861
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:32,096
Just being shity and sell it totally Australian dude coming on but it seems largely about

1862
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:38,240
Promoted to sub stack which is a revenue stream he's trying to create yet after getting out of politics you out Alex infomercial in with his

1863
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:41,056
F****** satellite phone guy

1864
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:45,920
Ridiculous now the first clip that you played of the Australian Christiansen

1865
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:48,224
Is he was talking

1866
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,040
Looking for so long my immediate note was he paying for the

1867
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:52,576
Like that was

1868
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:55,904
Ameet like the moment you're allowed to complete like $0.03

1869
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,696
Fences in a row I don't know

1870
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
Feel like Alex

1871
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:05,120
Has taken a cut I for your tie that's interesting and obviously I'm claiming it is true

1872
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,656
I don't know of course but

1873
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,680
I think that it's

1874
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:14,080
Equally possible that Alex thinks that this is a guest who has a reasonable amount of credibility given a publicly elected

1875
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:16,384
Beneficial and that like

1876
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:21,504
If I can get a great soundbite of them saying like this means war or something like that

1877
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,528
That

1878
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,808
Let them talk

1879
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:28,416
Because we might be able to use something to make a compilation

1880
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,440
Would be

1881
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,464
Far more interested in

1882
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,232
Giving

1883
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:33,024
Why latitude

1884
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,560
Does someone like him right

1885
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:35,840
I don't know

1886
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:38,400
Cuz honestly who really cares what he says on the f******

1887
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,448
Show what it is important is if we can

1888
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:44,544
Make a bunch of promos for this that play Forever that's

1889
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,848
Millions you know sure

1890
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,872
Sure I think it's

1891
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,896
Probably

1892
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:51,968
More likely a situation where they both have interest

1893
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:52,736
Angela

1894
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,016
Him talking boy

1895
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:57,856
Hymn for the ability to promote himself and Alex for the ability to

1896
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,136
Possibly use him later

1897
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,696
Yeah two parasitic amoebas

1898
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,720
F****** each other

1899
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,304
Do jumping back into the present day was

1900
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:09,376
Slightly disappointing Nose Day

1901
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,400
Is because

1902
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:13,728
Just

1903
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:15,520
Want to talk about reset Wars

1904
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:16,544
I don't even

1905
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,592
Who you know what it is

1906
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,152
That's why

1907
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,040
I can't

1908
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
I can't

1909
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,672
Anyway maybe our next episode will be more about recent Wars

1910
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,952
And not

1911
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:34,720
Alex

1912
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,000
Is normal

1913
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,816
Incompetent sell here's what worries me

1914
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:42,400
I feel like reset Wars part 2 is going to be named attack

1915
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,192
The Clone simply because it's going to be

1916
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:46,240
Exactly like reset Wars part 1

1917
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,032
No I had to really almost

1918
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,848
Physically stop myself from titling that episode The Fan

1919
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:55,456
I would so close

1920
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:56,992
Can't do it

1921
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,320
On Friday but until then

1922
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:06,976
Whatsup.com Twitter

1923
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:10,048
Will be back but until then I'm the only one bzx

1924
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,328
Clark

1925
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,632
The sex robot

1926
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:15,936
Holding

1927
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:21,056
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
