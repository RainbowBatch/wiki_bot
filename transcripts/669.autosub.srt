00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,728
Hello I am one guy who likes to

8
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:20,128
And where's the other seen talked a little bit about Alex Jones and

9
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,272
Credibly surprised by him asking me if I had a bright spot

10
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:32,672
And if you were here I would tell him that my bright spot today is actually it's something that maybe a little delayed

11
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:38,560
Being a bright spot but there's a new season of Survivor upon us that started a couple weeks

12
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,680
Me and my friend Angela Lansbury been I've been watching the season a lot of

13
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:50,080
There's a there's a lot of problems with with Survivor still I think I think they have

14
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,176
Added too many bells and whistles I think I've made this point in the past

15
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,248
Too many convoluted rules about

16
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:04,416
Idols only have power in a certain God.

17
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
It's it's a mess

18
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,024
If you if you don't know what I'm talking about if you don't understand

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,352
The Byzantine rules that Survivor is that a good for you

20
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
I'm rambling a little bit

21
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,704
That's what happens when I'm sitting here alone

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
I suppose

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,848
So I wanted to put out a little special Sneaky Snake episode today

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,480

Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

53
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,344
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

54
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
And you never see me again

55
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
That's really what I want to do

56
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:19,071
I never want to come back here again I apologize to the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

57
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,399
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

58
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935

59
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007

On Friday for another episode we will see you then

63
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:47,743
Hello folks how do you do joining me today in in Jordan's absence

64
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:53,375
I I thought the other somebody who I wanted to have a conversation with somebody going to sound very interesting

65
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,447
Thing and thought that might be relevant to a lot of the topics

66
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
That's so we cover on the show

67
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,823
I'm thrilled to be joining today by Amanda Moore

68
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
How are you

69
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,967
Good I'm so happy

70
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,063
It's daytime thrilled that you enjoy the show

71
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
I feel like

72
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
For most people it's

73
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
Probably not a healthy thing

74
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,511
But given your particular pathogen trajectory

75
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
Maybe it's it's appropriate

76
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
For you to enjoy the show

77
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:33,311
Yeah yeah

78
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,479
Those who do not know who you are and what you you're you're

79
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,807
. speed want to give like a little bit of a brief version of it

80
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,879
I don't want to tell it lest I list I screwed up some

81
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
Sort of details

82
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
So I

83
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,119
Accidentally-on-purpose went undercover in the car Ray

84
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,703
So I went you

85
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
January 6th

86
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799

Fundraisers

88
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Embarrassing

89
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
Do

90
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
So now

91
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015

What were the you like actual dates that's like you were like beginning and end

93
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
Your time

94
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,535
Doing this undercover activity

95
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,727
My first and then I went to go was the November

96
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,287
Right after

97
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,711
That was the end of Owen Shroyer is Caravan up the East Coast

98
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
Yeah yeah

99
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,319
Wow

100
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:53,951
To be there for the end of the Infowars Caravan what what a treat

101
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:01,887
Which I started when orange tires Caravan

102
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
I got some Fortune

103
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
September

104
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,103
Okay okay so yeah that's that's a pretty good strive it covers a lot of like

105
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Do you really

106
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
More

107
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
Turbulent times

108
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Where I'm at

109
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Run that stretch

110
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,623
You said two accidentally and on purpose

111
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
Yeah when you went Undercover

112
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,047
What did what do you think was more did it was more of an accident or on purpose

113
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,375
Isaac Hayes

114
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,239
O'Reilly's and I was just like there

115
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,015
Adios by Lucy are going to go anywhere I

116
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,863
So I was like

117
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,751
Oscillating saw

118
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,567
In-N-Out have a personality

119
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
Main Street

120
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:25,599
Nazi recruited me to help organization and didn't work

121
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,279
So yeah it seems like it was

122
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
You know

123
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:38,911
Being around and then people coming up to you and instead of being like

124
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,983
Hey you want to you want to dip in

125
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
Little Pearl

126
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,639
I guess that's that probably makes I mean that's probably passed a lot of people go down to earth

127
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,943
More willing unless

128
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,759
Having in mind for

129
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Undercover

130
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
Operation

131
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:02,207
Yeah

132
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:09,119
Petrino Maryland

133
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
Now covid

134
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,943
Lost my friends and my support

135
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:33,695
Did you feel like you were intentionally creating that as a way to make yourself look

136
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
More vulnerable

137
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,815
Like those sort of descriptions of yourself like

138
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,655
And be the sort of person that they would want to recruit in

139
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,343
If it seems like that that is a lot of the sort of people you hear who fall down these days

140
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
These rabbit holes are people who

141
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
You don't have those support structures people who

142
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Maybe have

143
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,279
Gotten some

144
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
Weird politics and the people around them are our tolerance or just have had enough of it

145
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,239
And then they find people who will accept them

146
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
You know

147
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,039
Especially here and I know she was different

148
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
You're like

149
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,719
Country outside

150
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
Summer 2020

151
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,095
It was all very much like if somebody didn't

152
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,543
Unless you were in Congress

153
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
And then you get away with it

154
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,503
So you you went undercover it did you

155
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
I guess

156
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,087
I'm kind of interested in is like

157
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
Early on when you started to notice that you know like you're getting in in mashed

158
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
In some of these circles

159
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,351
What what sort of gold did you have

160
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
With the undercover

161
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Like dizzy

162
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
Is there a like

163
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:27,871
I'm going to find criminal activity or information or what was where was your mind at

164
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,711
I mean

165
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
Like whatever

166
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,743
I Googled him and I realized as I can

167
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Congress

168
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:55,007
What's the message

169
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
So you guys

170
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
And so I was like oh my God

171
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
Definitely

172
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,167
Voters to know about a person that's running

173
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,031
Obviously

174
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
I didn't really

175
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,575
Did did a plan of like what you were doing

176
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,415
Develop over time was their doors are like a point where you realize like

177
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Alright this is

178
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
This is why I'm here or why I'm doing

179
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,663
A lot of people in there some information

180
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,015
And it was just it was hard to say because it's like

181
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,575
You can see obviously if

182
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
Fallout more information

183
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,119
Also like

184
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,471
Closest for fun

185
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
LOL

186
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
I don't have media that allow me to

187
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Wasp

188
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,319
Lost you in on Chronicles of 2021

189
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,207
So you have like an archive of

190
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Of like

191
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
The DVR what would it be the Apocrypha of

192
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:04,031
That's going to be valuable one day that's going to be going to be in a college archive

193
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
So yeah

194
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,967
Ogier of experiences that you had

195
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,527
That's obviously going to be more than

196
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
Like a single piece

197
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,695
Busy es you're describing at you know you're going to be sort of more mainstream

198
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
Conservative areas

199
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,791
You know whether it be the c-pack or

200
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
I guess you could call stopped

201
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
Estilo stuff like

202
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,935
Fairly mainstream now

203
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,031
And then the qanon stuff it so there's no sort of multiple threads

204
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Kind of

205
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
How much overlap did you experience

206
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
Between that

207
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
That kind of

208
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
Those world

209
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,767
Garlic broccoli and shrimp

210
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,375
Chevron stock

211
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
Turning Point USA

212
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:17,247
Bashas pharmacy

213
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,623
For sure

214
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,263
War on the west coast where there's like all those rallies in LA

215
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
Watch younger

216
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Our Generation

217
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
I actually

218
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,575
IMessage

219
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,159
This is the first time I've seen a guy in a three percenter shirt

220
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
Talk to me

221
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
Grilling hot dogs

222
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,215
3% water bottles on Highway 280

223
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
Security in life

224
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Oh wow

225
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,967
So did you do you have a feeling or sense then they'd like what you experienced was like and I like

226
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,295
After that there was more melding

227
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
Yeah

228
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
This is not my first life

229
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:35,327
I never been

230
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,399
Laura Loomer had a big rally in DC

231
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,799
A few years ago

232
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,127
You know there wasn't badly

233
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
I've never seen anything

234
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,367
Even even the people in those

235
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
Like those right-wing circles are

236
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Yeah

237
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,999
What kind of bums me out but

238
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Pretty expected

239
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:12,703
You you experienced I guess then you're what you're describing as like

240
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,543
Thank you kind of being an intentional like

241
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
People who are maybe more

242
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
Stream going places

243
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
Like turning playing like seapak

244
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,527
In order to maybe find people who would be receptive to their more extreme message

245
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,623
This is an intentional strategy that you you

246
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,183
See people using I might take it

247
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:44,191
Audio with literal Nazis talking about

248
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
Heck that's that's

249
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Kind of

250
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,831
Not that surprising I guess

251
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
I guess that like

252
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
You'd expect that they would be aware of that

253
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
I wonder how much

254
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,071
People like the turning-point folk are aware of that

255
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,631
They are being used that way

256
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
Do dealers

257
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
So maybe

258
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
Maybe fairly aware

259
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:31,295
Weird structure 24 like I was hanging out with people who

260
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,415
Obviously I need to be

261
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
So

262
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:57,663
APU

263
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
And then

264
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,399
Translate the more distinguished you are

265
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,495
That seems that seems like a bad bad vibe

266
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,591
That seems like a recipe for for quite a doctor nature

267
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Incycle

268
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
Let's go

269
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
That that that

270
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:37,343
I guess one question I'm sure you get all the time but I'm very very interested in

271
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
Like

272
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,695
Was there ever a point

273
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
Where

274
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Likes

275
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
You

276
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Word like

277
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,839
Legitimately afraid

278
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
For your life

279
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Because

280
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
I have to assume that being in the

281
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,031
You're around people who

282
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,335
Do nothing but spread violent rhetoric

283
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,407
You know like it's got to be

284
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
I would assume

285
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Frequently

286
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
Pretty scary

287
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,903
The correct answer is yes

288
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,447
Lovely

289
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,031
Are you

290
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
People

291
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,895
I just never I never felt I was in danger

292
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,599
And so it was never

293
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,671
So that worried wasn't in your mind of like

294
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
Maybe they know already

295
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,935
Massive eye roll

296
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
First of all

297
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:06,431
I like I would text me but all of the guys who were in

298
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
Irish

299
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,424
What the fashion

300
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
It literally cannot control

301
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,712
There's no way they would have been able

302
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
They don't have they don't have good information

303
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,368
Awareness

304
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,440
The qanon folks are more plugged in

305
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,304
Call you on phone channels like

306
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,984
I guess maybe I'm just

307
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,824
Kind of like up in my head so I just imagine myself like constantly being like

308
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
Figure.it.out Ono

309
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:12,224
Like that that's I think it probably takes a certain amount of like

310
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,528
Putting that aside

311
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,832
To be able to be in an undercover

312
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Situation

313
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
You know

314
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,584
People in the

315
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,168
Convention Center

316
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,264
Security

317
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,968
You're saying you were in like Hotel

318
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,528
Parties and stuff like you're probably drinking

319
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
With these these folks and

320
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
And such

321
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Like

322
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,208
I would be so scared of that like

323
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:59,584
I don't know maybe just because I I talked a little bit of s*** when I have some drinks

324
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,168
So like I would be so afraid of just like saying the wrong thing

325
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,008
I don't know I'm I'm I'm fascinated by this aspect to

326
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
Love what you like me

327
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
Beautiful boy

328
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,024
Message sky for coughing

329
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:41,568
And I always like mashed

330
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
What about the June

331
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,480
So he was like

332
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,832
Friendly or Nazi Germany

333
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,952
Whatever dude

334
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,424
Obituary James O'Keefe

335
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,544
Sponsored open bar party afterwards and cottages

336
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
Smart smart

337
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,952
I mean I can relate with gallstone

338
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,512
Angles of that bike I certainly would

339
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,840
I end up slamming drinks at a open bar

340
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
James O'Keefe party

341
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
McKenna Bachelor

342
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,960
Existing there

343
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,008
I'm not so

344
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
Was that where you got your llama

345
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,944
You've liberated this llama

346
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:57,600
I liberated my brother retracto

347
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Well it's me

348
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,560
It's quite an attractive llama I can understand people

349
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
Wanted to swipe it

350
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
But I also got covid

351
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
Congratulations

352
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,688
I'm so what does things I wanted to bring up his kind of like

353
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:27,040
Related to the stuff that we kind of go over on

354
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
This show is

355
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
I feel like

356
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,928
My sense of things is that

357
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,744
There's like Alex and his

358
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,536
Serta propaganda world

359
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,816
Orlando

360
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,376
The sort of waters that you were swimming in

361
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,192
Were there related inasmuch as theirs

362
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:49,568
Hard right extremism and a lot of the same ideas and a lot of the same

363
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
Desires for the world

364
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,224
Seems like that's a completely separate

365
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Like

366
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
Their names

367
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
That that

368
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,160
Ring out in the communities that you were talking about that

369
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,720
And nothing to do with like Alex and Infowars

370
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,816
I think probably I'm guessing think that Alex is a joke

371
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
Would that be accurate

372
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,680
If you used to like younger fashion

373
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,776
I need so people like

I didn't really

390
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624

And they turned on him

414
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,672
Like the necklace

00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,000
Mickey turned on him even though you wasn't invited speaker in

416
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:56,096

Fire magic

429
00:30:54,976 --> 00:31:00,352
If I were to ask you about just about anybody would be about the same response

430
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,032
Yeah that doesn't think I was I was curious about like

431
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,848
Is there was somebody who sticks out as like

432
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:16,480
But then you know what I don't want to I don't know if I want to the Surly dwell on positive

Schnucks that's nice if you're in

440
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
Talk to you about

441
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,232

00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
Little bit of a what's it called

450
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
Blooming

451
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,936

00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,464
Rodger Stone

464
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:41,376

465
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,544

Shots fired

She is very rude I don't think you I don't think you would get that from her soda pop

469
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
Public appearances

00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
Yeah feel like she comes off as

00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,192
Not mean at all

473
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,800
Super super I thought you can do something for her she's very friendly

474
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,872

You know

478
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,816
Weird here is the the overlap

479
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,656
In terms of a lot of like ideology but not actual overlap

480
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,728

And no media coverage

494
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728

499
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,184
Taco Bell

500
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,768
When he tried to storm the stage

501
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,680
It was it was wild inside and it was strange shooting so

502
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:28,800

00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:15,392
She was like trying

511
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,952
So you can't really understand and

512
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,168
Obviously

513
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,824
Like we're not

514
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,664
America America

515
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,760
And then when he walks away

516
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,904
Okay

517
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,976
That's the effect he has

518
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,328
He ruins other people's things by lyca

519
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,680
Bombarding with energy if not everyone's as burnt out or like

520
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,496
Let's Pied Piper this year let's follow that guy

00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,648
Some people got stabbed

524
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,048
Everybody in line off in front of the Marriott

525
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
Sure

526
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:35,776
But it's still broken so I have no idea what he said

527
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,056
And

528
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:49,344
Stay there there's a call for proud boys do you be wandering around

529
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
Deputizing

530
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
Course

531
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,744
Everybody

532
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,048
Obviously

533
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
Obviously

534
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,472
I went to DC not too long ago and made a pilgrimage to Comet Ping Pong

535
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:10,080
And nothing but antifa federal agents the entire

536
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,616
The entire place is packed

537
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
Why was he with

538
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,944
Absolutely

539
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:19,040
One one question I thought of is

540
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:26,720
I think if it's something that I talked to with the bill Ogden one of the lawyers and the same

541
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
Hookies

542
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,304
Sometimes being

543
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,168
Exposed to a ton of material

544
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,960
On a regular basis

545
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,288
You question a little bit of

546
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,104
Your preconceived notions are like

547
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
The ideas you go in with

548
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,944
I was wondering if there's any point

549
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,528
That you can think of where you questioned like

550
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,552
Maybe these p

551
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,088
People are right

552
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,624
Or onto something

553
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,672
Did that ever happen

554
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Never

555
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,512
I was raised Evangelical

556
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,072
Libertarian

557
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,192
So it's not fascist or qanon ship was going to sell it would have been

558
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:14,080
Will less less less that and more more like

559
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
Just

560
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,664
Losing a grip

561
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,712
On where you were

562
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:24,320
Wineries

563
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:31,488
Was Italy One Life undercover for like ever be things I would say

564
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,728
28 year old normal

565
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:49,408
And so I was already having to do all of this like

566
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,760
Is your news I would literally

567
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,576
I would have super strength

568
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,672
Like one

569
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:07,072
194 listening to One Thing for so long

570
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,960
Probably helps because it was just constantly

571
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,640
I might I might listen to

572
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:31,648
That's fascinated imagine that that forced you to be analytical more the you know then then just if you had

573
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
At 1

574
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,720
Persona if you well you know like

575
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,536
That that might have been really helpful

576
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,840
Play to keep keep you grounded

577
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,400
Yeah yeah and I spine

578
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:48,288
It's very easy.

579
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,455
He committed to like show reality

580
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:01,087
Sure there'll be times to I was just outside of thing

581
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:09,279
Understand

582
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,631
And

583
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:19,519
Sissy

584
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,591
Answer to whatever they're saying

585
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,151
Yeah you have to have to sort of Translate

586
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Decode

587
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,479
You can put that with that

588
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,063
Like I feel like it would be tough not to just likes to come to

589
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,135
I'm thinking of qanon it's kind of random

590
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
Because

591
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,975
You know so much as I can

592
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:39,999
You know

593
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
Whatever the belief is

594
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
You could just

595
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
Have any belief

596
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,399
You think like at least I think that most people

597
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,959
Be with that way do you think of that

598
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,287
Do you think that there is more of a set system

599
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,335
For the things that they believe then

600
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,871
Then Ben random

601
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,455
I think the defense systems

602
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:05,855
For what they are

603
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:11,743
Just like you having

604
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:19,167
Crazy makeup looks

605
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,959
And then I see

606
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:30,175
Experience

607
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,503
Super well-informed

608
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,695
Like I would watch people say s*** like she still alive

609
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,191
I didn't know it until this person convinced me

610
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:57,311
Uber to party knees

611

Chiropractor in Bryan

Yeah that's

626
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:02,079
The Inn in those circles that the question you do not want to hear someone posed like

627
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
Oh God

628
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639

639
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,351
Conspiracy material

640
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,887

641
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:02,751

Whatever

643
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
Interpreting

644
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
Yeah

645
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,415
I think I think

646
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,999
I have a sense and this is completely uneducated

647
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,047
I feel like

648
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:32,703
Three people are definitely responding to whatever like YouTube videos they watch or whatever whatever creator

649
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,239
Their version of things

650
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,543
But whatever their creator believes

651
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,591
That has a slight bit of Random

652
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
Stewart

653
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,919
Absolutely

654
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:48,063
Right right

655
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,695
It can't be like whatever like

656
00:46:53,951 --> 00:47:00,095
How are you feeling today

657
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,143
Now the world is doomed

658
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,895
Yeah it's B narcissism projected someone

659
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,479
You mentioned the kids under the Getty

660
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,247
And

661
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,063
I wanted to loop back to this really quick

662
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,879
Do people believe that

663
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
Oh my God

664
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,535
Hey listen

00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,407
Right right you're a people who have been conned

00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:53,087
You think cuz I've only heard that ever from one weird guy on YouTube named Steven Kelly who

I believe that he has like mental ninjas

668
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:00,511
Recalls them Jedi who go down into the Getty

669
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,559
You do battle with like the demon

670
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,583
And stuff down

671
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:11,263

00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,567
Theory

674
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,687
I'm excited to hear that the Jedi are getting some help

675
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
Let's

676
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,391
Eastside baptism

677
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:37,119
Do they travel that far to get really drunk

678
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,471
These events

679
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,335
It says that but instead you go to extra

680
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
What

681
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,439

Dino Hillary's executed

687
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,991
This is not an appropriate question for a baptism

688
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,807
Listen

689
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,855
We got to get rid of those demons

690
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,183

The answer in and of itself is so telling I mean it's it's

695
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007

So I mean I mean

700
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:09,535
See you said you grew up Evangelical and we're libertarian

701
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,839
How

702
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,887
Does this Translate to

703
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,191
What I presume is a pretty

704
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,471
Decently left

705
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,031
Set of beliefs now

706
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,639
Mom was never religious

707
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,711
Managua

708
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,791
Journey

709
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,863
I'm not domination

710
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,167
There is no God

711
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,623
Interest in politics

712
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
2

713
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,719
And then

714
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,791
I read a book

715
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,095
Okay

716
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:20,447

718
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
I'm not judging

719
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,223
I can tell

720
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,759
I could tell you

721
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,063
Deeply troubled

722
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,239
Michael franzese

723
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,279
Likes

724
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:30,079
It's supposed to be the non-aggression principle and I can't have the the state having a monopoly of force

725
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,871
Got to get out there

726
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,919
Got to stop those beliefs

727
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
Samurai

728
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:41,343
Right or from not protecting

729
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,623
Businesses in Tampa

730
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,207
Yes yes it is very important

731
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:52,351
Jeopardize my business forum

732
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,031
That would be

733
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,079
State that wouldn't be state

734
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,615
Monopoly of force

735
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,879
Became

736
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,415
I mean

737
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,023
When Michael Brown was killed

738
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:21,791
Where

739
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:33,311
I really remember I don't remember

740
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,895
In St Louis

741
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:42,783
You dead like some disillusionment then I'm guessing that that's what you're describing

742
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,319
With the libertarian

743
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,599
Bend

744
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,135
Yeah I mean

745
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
I was just

746
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,975
It was a joke

747
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,775
Gary Johnson stand

748
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,127
In high school I had like

749
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,991
Libertarian sticker on her so I'm not really one to be able to judge

750
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,695
It wasn't good

751
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
So

752
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,055
And

753
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,783
Campaign for Bernie Sanders

754
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:53,951
Remind you that to that like awareness or like connection with some of the libertarian ideas probably came in

755
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,719
Handy

756
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
Along the way

757
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:05,471
Yeah that's that's one of the things that I find really interesting is there like

758
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:11,615
Is it Webster Tarpley I believe wrote a piece about like it like around the time Trump was running

759
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,943
About how libertarianism in like Ron Paul fandom

760
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,223
Was a like

761
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,783
Doorway to Fascism basically

762
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,695
And I don't like him at all he's a like former Infowars doodoo is like

763
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,767
You got a lot of problems himself but I think he was

764
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,327
Are we accurate on that one that assessment

765
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:36,703
I mean like

766
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,799
It's bizarre

767
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:47,199
I'm always surprised

768
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:59,487
Mommy

769
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,767
Really

770
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,583
Little allergy

771
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,983
Yeah but you can't even like me cuentas say stuff like that like a little a libertarian

772
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:14,335
That's better that that Dodges that's on both sides there

773
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,295
The guy

774
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:28,927
They wanted me to meet

775
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:36,607
Stewart Rhodes was a Ron Paul Stafford to lick his neck

776
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:44,287
All kinds of tentacles coming out in so many so many seeds planted by that weird

777
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,335
Family Paul family

778
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,615
Yeah

779
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:52,735
You were you were doing this over the course of

780
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,759
The pandemic

781
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,063
Do

782
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,367
Imagine

783
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,927
I don't know if this matches up with your

784
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:04,255
Experience but I imagine things got

785
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,279
Worse

786
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,815
Over the course of the pandemic

787
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,655
More people gravitating towards

788
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
These groups

789
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,983
More extreme

790
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,519
Stuff going on

791
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,055
Angrier

792
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
Talk

793
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,383
So yes I started

794
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,175
Nightingale

795
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,343
Cheerleader brightness

796
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,583
Certainly.

797
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,887
People became work

798
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,567
Actual

799
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
Because

800
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,479
February

801
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,503
2021

802
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,343
Where is the Beastie

803
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,391
Warframe

804
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,487
Ofra is like

805
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,071
I'm probably next to me

806
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,655
And by

807
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:25,407
Especially in the qanon places I'm sure it was very unwelcome to be vaccinated

808
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
Daughter just goes

809
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,975
Options for grandchildren

810
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:44,351
Mongo's

811
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:50,495
Driver's license

812
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,503
Turn my mom's last chance for grandchildren

813
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:05,855
That's a concept of child shouldn't be dealing with at all

814
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:10,719
Eli's going to photo

815
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,023
There was that and then

816
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,143
I got so busy in July

817
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,703
Work Meister

818
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,199
I understand that certain feeling

819
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,671
Anything

820
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,727
People were dying

821
00:59:55,007 --> 01:00:01,151
Music

822
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:09,343
Waco bar was fine but coffee wasn't

823
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:16,255
Help me something about chickens. Temperature

824
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,351
Weird

825
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:27,007
I also would like to apologize that you're talkin about people dying and the thing I got hung up on was

826
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,055
Cold brew. Okay

827
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:48,255
So then they were like

828
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,327
That makes sense

829
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:57,983
Does it

830
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,615
Is there something different

831
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,711
Yeah you see it Spike protein anthrax

832
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,831
I have enjoyed watching

833
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,391
Sort of the gymnastics in the hurdles over

834
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,695
Of trying to make sense of like

835
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,999
The shifting landscape of

836
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:22,559
The conspiracies and I imagine being like

837
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,887
Therefore it and having conversations with people about it would have been

838
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,679
Even more

839
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,447
Confused

840
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,775
So bizarre I mean Irish

841
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:45,599
Undoubtedly that's what's coming

842
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:52,767
And I might know you want to tell me if she could kill it and put it in water

843
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:54,815
Yes

844
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:57,887
That sounds really good

845
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:03,007
Fermented grape juice it's that

846
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,287
Can I have some

847
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:10,431
Probably be full of bacteria and

848
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,247
I did I do have

849
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:17,343
Sort of a begrudging respect for folk remedies

850
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,647
But it'll come up people come up with

851
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:26,047
What is a begrudging respect of me the creativity and optimism of it not not so much the

852
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,583
The trying a thief

853
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,423
The month-old grapefruit in a fridge

854
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
Is

855
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,007
That's pretty sweet

856
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,031
That's that's

857
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,823
You have to be a dreamer

858
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,175
Transfer that to be something that you could tell someone else

859
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,903
Show me this beard on

860
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,447
It's real

861
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:13,919
.

862
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,503
Until like watching people

863
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,879
Very bizarre

864
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:23,647
Yeah

865
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:27,487
It's like it's kind of like a reality versus non reality

866
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,535
In a really microscale

867
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:34,911
Just these people as the sort of avatars of reality and not reality

868
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:37,471
And I'm guessing not reality generally win

869
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,551
I'm very open and honest and getting

870
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:59,487
My mom died almost died

871
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:09,983
You said that at first people are really open to that change

872
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,519
Do people fart

873
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:20,735
Did you did you run into many people who like

874
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,015
Didn't like

875
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,903
I've noticed a thing and maybe it's just certain through Project Camelot stuff but like

876
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:28,927
Bears

877
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:35,327
People anything for like 2 I guess but the people who are like you know what this whole thing is made me realize that

878
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,119
Science isn't real

879
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,143
But there is no

880
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,935
Such thing as a virus

881
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:42,495
Do you ever do directed any of those those folks

882
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,519
Is cool

883
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,287
Cool book

884
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,079
Knock knock

885
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,479
So not very

886
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:58,111
Eden

887
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:08,607
That's that that's something that's interested that's something that I hadn't really considered it is video

888
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,959
There is probably a taboo on the

889
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:16,031
Some conspiracy ideas even in these

890
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,055
The circle

891
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,615
But there is a point that's too far

892
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,575
Unbelievably boring

893
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,647
I mean

894
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:36,255
First you in on rally in 2019

895
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:41,631
Exact same speech he gave

896
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:51,871
And it's just me on Sycamore

897
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,687
But I was in Dallas in May

898
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:59,551
I was with him it was me and him

899
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,855
The sparkles

900
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,671
As far as I know

901
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,463
Siemens parts are red

902
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,791
Stickers all over it

903
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,839
Windshield windows

904
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,215
Mandalas later on

905
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:22,847
Junior

906
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,127
It was like this

907
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:26,687
This is this

908
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,479
Okay

909
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:35,903
Not sure it looks great before but all the other stuff is is so

910
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,951
Impressive in and

911
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:43,327
Unbelievable

912
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:53,567
Yeah that is that example or like that one seems like

913
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,359
That makes a lot of sense cuz it's

914
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,407
It's kind of like this is undercutting our brand

915
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,199
You know like this is

916
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,991
This is going to make

917
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:05,087
More difficult for me to get people into the revenue stream

918
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,391
JFK jr. is Dad

919
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,439
Alright is alive as it were

920
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:12,511
That's a that that makes sense

921
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,607
Leave the virus doesn't exist I guess that's probably

922
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,631
Is maybe in the same

923
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:18,911
The same Brown

924
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,959
They're like I'm trying to spread Medical

925
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,263
Conspiracies but this one is that's too much

926
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,335
Yeah it's a virus virus

927
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,383
My sister stole my churn

928
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,943
That's a good point

929
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:34,015
Julissa

930
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
Well

931
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:35,807
That's that

932
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:38,111
The grifters oldest doctor group

933
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,671
He pissed doctor he is a chiropractor

934
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:48,095
Science doesn't matter than all of us doctor

935
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:51,423
I was just about keeping your spine in line

936
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,471
That's all that's all we're doing here

937
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,335
Be

938
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:02,431
Being in some of these things like worlds in these communities

939
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:06,271
We're coming up on the midterm

940
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,551
And

941
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,367
You around in what I would say is a

942
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,391
Babe

943
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:16,255
Election heavy time to be embedded with

944
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,023
These folks

945
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,559
What do you expect

946
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:27,263
You did that you're convinced of that

947
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,383
I'm so a lot of something to go to

948
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:43,647
Their evil satanic whatever God has Dominion

949
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,207
That's why they called it that man

950
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:49,279
I literally sometimes you just like how do you

951
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,095
So

952
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,495
Every single

953
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,903
More like Sprite

954
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,839
You know he would

955
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:29,983
Jim come in and teaches like this is how I

956
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:37,151
My likes are elected.

957
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:45,343
It's just quite a workshop to offer

958
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:51,743
Oh I just followed her kids home from the school bus everyday until she decided it wasn't

959
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,559
Worth the $8,000

960
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,095
Shut

961
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,679
Doctor children

962
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:06,847
It just happens a Cool Wind

963
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,919
Accidents that I was constantly following her children

964
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,015
That's pretty f*****-up

965
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,319
And we have

966
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,343
Wow

967
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,903
More.

968
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,463
I don't know

969
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:29,119
I mean what's what's up what's the

970
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:33,983
A woman's children because she's she's a rhino

971
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,543
Until she quits her job

972
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,943
4

973
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:48,063
The point

974
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,743
Or you don't like there's no intervention

975
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
People

976
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,447
Every jurisdiction

977
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,287
Machine

978
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,871
And so that was offered a solution

979
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,943
So I don't really see how

980
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:18,015
And maybe there

981
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:18,783
Amen

982
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,599
Trying to think of a solution is probably

983
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,391
Probably impossible I mean like

984
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:26,719
Yeah these like just the example you're giving

985
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:30,559
Whether or not this happened exactly as it did but you know like

986
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,607
The person following

987
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,143
Someone's kids

988
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,679
MMA quit there

989
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,959
They're low-level

990
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,983
Position

991
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:41,055
Probably no one ever would hear about that you know like

992
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:46,943
They're there are tons and tons of offices that are in local levels that like

993
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,271
All kinds of nonsense could be happening around the

994
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,927
Until

995
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:16,895
You know

996
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:22,527
Schultz everything

997
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:28,671
Dinosaur tourist

998
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:33,791
Last year in April

999
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,911
Robby Starbuck

1000
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,927
August

1001
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,399
This makes

1002
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,959
Everybody was all in

1003
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,199
Like watching

1004
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
You know

1005
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,111
8888 like a

1006
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,439
You being exposed to that at that time things that like

1007
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:36,511
Seems like complete nonsense this is never going to stick

1008
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,583
I'm in now here we are

1009
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:42,911
That's

1010
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,727
That's probably a lesson that

1011
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,775
Is very difficult to learn

1012
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,799
Is that like

1013
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,359
Stuff that sounds like it might be insane

1014
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,431
Could be adopted by the entirety

1015
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,759
In six months you never know

1016
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,831
Yeah I mean like watching all the

1017
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,719
It is so well organized

1018
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:15,167
And I I mean

1019
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,295
To figure out

1020
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:48,959
And behind the people who were probably complaining just about trt just a little bit under the surface is public schools are evil eye

1021
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
George Soros

1022
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:53,823
Yeah

1023
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:57,663
Yeah that's that's that makes me think of like if you go back

1024
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,687
Cui

1025
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,527
Like somebody episodes from around when qanon was

1026
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,551
Coming around

1027
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:04,575
I

1028
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,623
Very

1029
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,671
Famously

1030
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,975
This isn't a big deal this is

1031
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:14,815
This is just some dumb things happening on a message board

1032
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,607
And like I I really

1033
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,399
Boy I was wrong about that one

1034
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:21,727
That's a that seems to me the casino way this is going to

1035
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,495
Like

1036
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,519
People are going to buy it

1037
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:28,127
Yeah it's so weird

1038
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
It was just

1039
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,439
Discount everything

1040
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,023
Yeah cuz they're all I mean

1041
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:51,423
Do you think you think we're going to have another another bad election

1042
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,495
I'd say I agree with you

1043
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
I just

1044
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,967
It's very frustrating Jodeci

1045
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,271
Quality

1046
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,135
Kairos or whatever saying stuff like

1047
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:15,487
All the GTA V

1048
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:20,351
Are you like Dreamer

1049
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:29,311
Yeah it's it's it's unfortunate that the opposition party as it were does not seem to grasp

1050
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,895
The reality of the other side

1051
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,175
But there again

1052
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,551
Extensively

1053
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,743
Really really dragging it

1054
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:02,079
Refuse to hire people who would be like

1055
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:08,991
Yeah that headline is is a trap that you're setting for yourself

1056
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,391
Chainsaw

1057
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,695
Yeah Everett that news is the onion now

1058
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,231
Put it all in the headline

1059
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,279
People are just going to skim this

1060
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,375
When you were when you were

1061
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,935
From from your time

1062
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,959
Hanging out

1063
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,983
But these folks

1064
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,823
What what do you think

1065
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
Is the most

1066
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,895
Troubling

1067
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,943
Thing for you right now

1068
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:43,551
Like what what worries you are most looking back on on

1069
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:47,135
Your time and how things have developed since then in the things

1070
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:47,903
But you seeing

1071
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:51,743
What should people be aware of maybe that they're not paying enough attention

1072
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,959
People don't really

1073
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,263
Understand

1074
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
There is

1075
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,503
Arkansas

1076
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,319
Shortly after I was.

1077
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,879
Josh Hawley

1078
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:35,775
You don't look like a lumberjack like

1079
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,079
Macy's

1080
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:50,879
Exactly. Talk about being the brawny man

1081
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:58,559
I don't understand people are still missing.

1082
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,095
Stop

1083
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,679
Because people

1084
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:04,959
You are not

1085
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,271
We haven't done anything

1086
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:26,207
VP that sort of right-wing points

1087
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,279
Make making

1088
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:32,095
Spell points with bad Solutions

1089
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,119
China

1090
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,143
Yeah

1091
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,519
The name for white people

1092
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,591
And also Italy

1093
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,111
Snot sucker

1094
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:58,207
They are like blind with

1095
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,559
Mario B I mean

1096
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,703
Where's Ethiopia

1097
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,239
Joe Biden

1098
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,576
There's no

1099
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,208
Let's paper that is

1100
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,744
That could be a problem

1101
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:35,072
You're so you're saying also like in the under 30s

1102
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,096
That's that's

1103
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:40,192
That's a community that you think is is

1104
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,216
Turning

1105
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,520
Thule right populism in the Moors

1106
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,800
Troubling way

1107
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,432
People Are People

1108
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,272
Well

1109
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:10,656
Skin problems

1110
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,192
Yeah yeah

1111
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:15,264
And the end of the people who will speak to those problems

1112
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,800
Or maybe people laugh

1113
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,592
Darker agenda

1114
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,712
Well I hope that's

1115
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:30,368
All this doesn't combine into a terrible tornado of s*** this year

1116
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,160
India elections

1117
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:34,208
The school board's the

1118
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,256
The

1119
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:40,864
Turn towards right-wing populism the denial of election

1120
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,912
The covid stuff

1121
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,704
Seems like a perfect storm

1122
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,496
Well you know

1123
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,288
God has Dominion

1124
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,384
Dominion

1125
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:54,944
So

1126
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,736
It's in his hands

1127
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,320
That's that is true and now I believe

1128
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,600
It's time to pray

1129
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:09,792
I think that's that's as good a .22 drop off after 22 to wrap this up

1130
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:13,376
Amanda thank you so much for for chatting with me

1131
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,680
I'm sorry I was in a little bit all over the place

1132
