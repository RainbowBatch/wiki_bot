1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
Sit around drink novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones Jordan

6
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,656
Have you ever gone on a bed

7
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Diets

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,312
Did you ever do one of those like all-meat things or only protein geyser

9
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,152
Caveman not so much I had some

10
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,176
Inclination

11
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,248
Towards the keto diet a while back

12
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
Yeah I read

13
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
Some stuff about it and I thought it

14
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,600
Seemed interesting

15
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,624
What's a keto diet

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,952
Do you like have carbs way down my body goes into key

17
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,488
Ketosis

18
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
The theory behind it

19
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,840
I don't know I don't honestly don't know enough about it

20
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,144
Cuz I didn't really go full-on with

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
I thought about it

22
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
I went

23
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,312
Dabbled towards it by way of like restricting carbs a bad thing

24
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
I had a buddy who lives in LA but used to

25
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
You come to here in Chicago who lost

26
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,992
Dwayne got really healthy and he swore by

27
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
Okay it's sort of made me

28
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
Me feel like that maybe there's something

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,184
More to this but I never went full-on with it

30
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,744
But that that did

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
That was a really effective

32
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
Strategy not so much going

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Olan

34
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:16,192
Limiting carb

35
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
Intake

36
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Was something that I found some

37
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,056
Some success with I don't know I mean I guess that's with a k

38
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,384
Cans diet is right

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,456
Anything about it

40
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
To be a fad but I do know that I had

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
Pretty decent success

42
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,112
We're not cutting out all carbs but limiting it

43
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
Exercising a bed

44
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
More water

45
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
That's

46
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,936
I saw a lot of problems a little bit

47
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,496
I thought I still had a lot of problems though because I am

48
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
Really not a diet

49
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,592
Petition

50
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
And so my obsession with

51
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Like alright well we're go

52
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:02,528
Is low calories as possible I didn't know where the lick

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
Nutrient

54
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
How much of a

55
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648
XYZ

56
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
So it didn't

57
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:13,280
It didn't ultimately end up being a good diet I did have

58
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
It was effective in losing some weight

59
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
Might be very on

60
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
The way I operate whenever I went on the I'm only going to eat one frozen pizza a day

61
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,360
Diet witch

62
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,920
Baby

63
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
Alright

64
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,528
And I've actually been giving some consideration to like needing to

65
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
Tweaks app to my

66
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
That my eating

67
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
Currently but

68
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,232
I think based on my experience with the last time I realized I'm very stupid

69
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
So I'm considering it

70
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
By will see what happen

71
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
No fat diet

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,752
Don't know much about diets or food

73
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
Or how to be healthy

74
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
But I do know that

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
And I don't know much about

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Correct

77
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Jordan

78
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
Today we are still in the present

79
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Okay we are

80
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
Nothing

81
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
What's going on

82
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,832
Today we are going over January 24th 2020

83
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,744
To give you some sense of where this episode is going to go

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
I have to play this out of concerts drop before we even think we will find out no where

85
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Things are calling

86
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
It's over for Humanity

87
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
It will only be lone survivors

88
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
Mike Adams is.

89
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Declaring it

90
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:34,687
Over that is a

91
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
That's the straw

92
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:42,111
That's a strong Proclamation and trust me I know that clip is out of context but I didn't cut

93
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
About him saying it would be stupid for me to sit before he declares humanity is gone

94
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
Example of something that somebody

95
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:55,679
Is humanity is wildly irresponsible Proclamation

96
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,495
For a pretend elf expert

97
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
Would be to say that snow he is

98
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
He is declaring it

99
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Dog

100
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
Humanity

00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,991

Alright

117
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Jimothy

But he's not a j

122
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,927
Like jimothy but with a t

123
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:26,303
Thank you so much you are now a technocrat and Christopher with a K thank you so much you are now a technocrat

124
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
Heroin

125
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,687
Freakishly large

126
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
Timothy M Crist

127
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
Hey Humanity's done

128
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,791
But I like this show and I like smoothies dance to

129
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Appreciate it

130
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
You can't take it with you

131
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
So you might as well just donate a little I just realize that every single time I say

132
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
You can you click that button

133
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:13,919
Just work the show Aida pantomime at all

134
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,759
Completely subconscious did not even realize I was doing that

135
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,599
Anyway Today's Show is very weird

136
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
If you didn't get that from

137
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
They're in a good head space

138
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Man

139
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,071
No one's doing good today this is good this is such a weird show

140
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:36,703
Mike Adams is way out of line

141
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
Alakazam

142
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,311
And then we get the return of someone who is missing

143
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
And presumed

144
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,687
Dad I don't know we have not heard from in a very long time

145
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,759
Open house phone

146
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
I don't want to ruin

147
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:54,623
Surprise I have bad news.

148
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Is still dead

149
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,231
I'm no but the Alex starts the show off

150
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,767
With the Special Report

151
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
It's like what the f*** is going on

152
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
It's like 10 minutes into the show

153
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
Still do special reports

154
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
The first

155
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
20 minutes of the show

156
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
Special Report

157
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
Alex finally get some

158
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
Studio he's playing

159
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Couldn't do the show

160
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
Reading all the news all the information

161
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
This is probably one of the first

162
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
First time

163
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
I just fed

164
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
Physically could not go on air at start the broadcast

165
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
It really just comes a time when

166
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,047
The world just going to have to be judge

167
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
And

168
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
Tell you what I really think about things as because I respect

169
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
But

170
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
We're not going to get away

171
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
Boarding Williams babies

172
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,687
And not doubting him alive

173
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,807
And watching China the model of where people don't value human life

174
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
And watch that

175
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Become the global

176
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Standard

177
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,463
Multinational corporations who are Beyond solace

178
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
And not pass

179
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
The lab some feta

180
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
And so that's where all this is going

181
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:19,615
So we have tomorrow and pauses and they're only got Alex a real f*****-up Moody goodnight do is reading articles about Dumbo

182
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,663
Bulshit right and apparently

183
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Like

184
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:27,551
This is not doomsday preaching this is the Doomsday is here

185
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,599
You know I ever

186
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,183
I went to a psychiatrist when I was depressed

187
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:39,583
I did feel like the world is ending dead but I didn't broadcast those feelings to 100.

188
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
I should tell you Alex

189
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
Does get a form of therapy on the 10th

190
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
Prediction Doomsday

191
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
Hey stop this is like we're in it

192
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,711
Where in it has to do with the Wuhan Coronavirus

193
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
Be able to assume we're already like

194
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,111
We've got a bunch of confirmed cases

195
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,719
Up to this point I believe her over a couple of thousand

196
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
You know we're getting

197
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
Rightsure now

198
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,119
Means that the world is that Humanity's done

199
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,935
Absolutely it's got a long way to go before it

200
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
All of us that's all

201
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
Innn

202
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
You know it it's

203
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
It's fun to joke around and make fun of Alex

204
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:30,783
But at the same time I do think that you know the outbreak is not a laughing matter it's something that should be taken

205
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,623
Pretty serious by the people who are experiencing

206
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,183
Another people in in China

207
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
Are going through some

208
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,815
I'm not I'm not chastising you for laughing

209
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
What I'm saying is like

210
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
It's a delicate balance to walk

211
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
Of like making fun of Al

212
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
Alex while respecting the situation

213
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
And

214
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,847
I apologize in advance if we walk that line

215
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
Alex's red

216
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Some

217
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,527
Not about the impeachment apparently not about any of that stuff yet

218
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
I don't know his thoughts on that

219
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,367
Has really come up about it

220
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,207
Dems are talking about going with their proof

221
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,255
So Alex has

222
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,303
Seen some videos on Twitter I believe

223
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,887
Might be the exception

224
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
Is a fake is a bird

225
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
All that might be the extent of his

226
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
And now there

227
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,591
Driving around in China with a giant

228
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
Fumigator

229
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
Popping out chemicals

230
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
Hoping to kill

231
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
The virus

232
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
The government is using it

233
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
For a police state authoritarian

234
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
Enforcement drill

235
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,791
You know really the big takeaway from this year's

236
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
Infowars

237
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
Not the ticket

238
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,727
Help absolutely with Phil

239
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Articles in Gadsden

240
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,823
PowerPoint presentations

241
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,943
Thousands of times the tailed exactly what you see beginning unfold

242
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
In

243
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
With the Coronavirus

244
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Melinda Gates

245
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Few months ago about a big drill

246
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
For something similar to this weekend

247
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
65 million people starting in China

248
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
So first things first I want to reiterate

249
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Stress that

250
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,447
I'm going to say is to apply this is not a serious health issue

251
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
Did you be a high priority

252
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
All I can do is go on the word of experts

253
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
And this does not

254
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,407
This does seem like a situation where there's a potential for things to go

255
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Pretty badly

256
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,271
But even with that said it's so wrong for Alex be doing this doomsday preacher

257
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
I understand that that's his bread and butter it and without pay

258
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
He doesn't really make money

259
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,231
But this is the sort of subject or coverage like this could really get people hurt

260
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,535
Whether it's from discouraging people from taking appropriate

261
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Health steps

262
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
Or from feeding into a generalized panic

263
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,215
The director-general of the World Health Organization gave a press conference

264
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
According to them quote

265
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
This is an emergency in China

266
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
But it is not yet become a global Health Emergency

267
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
It may yet become one

268
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
I feel it's important

269
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Good perspective

270
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,807
And express our concern for the people of China and demand action to protect them as best

271
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
As possible

272
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
While taking steps

273
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
To keep the odds low that the virus does

274
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Become a global Health Emergency

275
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,255
Another thing that's important to point out is that at the

276
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,583
The time of Alex's episode the death toll from the Coronavirus

277
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Was it 70

278
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:29,215
And the World Health Organization is commented the most of those deaths quote occurred in patients

279
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
Pre-existing health conditions

280
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
This isn't to say that it's no big

281
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
Big deal but it is to say that there's a lot of uncertainty

282
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Right now

283
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,711
And using out-of-context numbers can be really irresponsible thing to do

284
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
Especially when you're driving people towards

285
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Conclusions like what Alex

286
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
Yeah it's a struggle to

287
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,415
Listen to him because what he's talkin

288
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Think about is

289
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Fictional

290
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:57,375
So when we laugh at that we're we're laughing in his fictionalized Universe of what's going on you know we're not laughing

291
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
The reality of

292
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
The circumstance

293
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:05,567
That is correct interpretation

294
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
Like a line of respectful or

295
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Respectful but

296
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,479
When do we get into making fun of reality versus

297
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,551
Important to point that out a little bit I

298
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,367
Because because I think could be easily misinterpreted as

299
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Sick dark

300
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Humorous

301
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Of course

302
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,767
Do in response to the outbreak China put the city of Wuhan

303
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
On where the virus is believed originated on lock

304
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:32,191
That city alone is home to 11 million people in this lockdown was later extended to

305
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
Surrounding areas

306
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
And at the time of the writing

307
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
King of the disciples

308
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
The preparation

309
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,127
Is covering an area of about 56 million people

310
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,783
The World Health Organization and representatives is like Human Rights Watch has been some comments about this not being a great thing to do

311
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
We've discussed in the past that makes

312
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Intuitive

313
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
They quarantined would be what you do

314
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,743
But most experts will tell you that it's an ineffective way to deal with Public Health

315
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,583
Piccalilli when you're dealing with large Geographic areas or large groups of people

316
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,191
It turns out that it's nearly impossible to quarantine quarantine on a large

317
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Scale effect

318
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,311
That being said there isn't a whole lot of the World Health Organization can do

319
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
If that's the strategy the China has chosen

320
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Pursuit

321
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
So there's

322
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
There's differences of opinion

323
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
Yeah you can advise them but

324
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,527
Remember there.

325
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,159
Another thing to keep in mind is that in recent days the number of reported cases has jumped

326
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Considerably

327
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
We're just cause some people to lean towards panic

328
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
However to cook the Associated Press

329
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,143
The rapid increase in reported deaths and illnesses does not necessarily mean the crisis

330
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
This is getting worse

331
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,239
It could instead reflect a better monitoring and Reporting

332
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
King of this newly discovered virus

333
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,359
Also China's not the most trustworthy player in the

334
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,431
So it does make sense to maintain a position to Skeptics

335
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
Given their government

336
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
The cover-up of the

337
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Beginning of the 2,000

338
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,783
To SARS outbreak

339
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
But it's important

340
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
Keep that as a position of skepticism

341
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,695
Not a blind confirmation of the worst-case scenario pasa

342
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,535
What I'm trying to get out as there's a lot of like

343
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
Real

344
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
Complicated element

345
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Let's do this

346
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,703
It in terms of like yes there's a lot more cases of it but that

347
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,543
Could not be a bad sign be a neutral

348
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Sign

349
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
China could be

350
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Giving

351
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
False numbers

352
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
They might not be

353
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
Right but they could be in advance

354
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
That's the case what does that mean

355
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
You don't know what that

356
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,855
Alex doesn't know what that means

357
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,903
Even people commenting on it who have

358
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
Backgrounds in this

359
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
Don't necessarily know exactly the conclusion

360
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
To drop right

361
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,631
Whatever you want to do if you want to approach this with a with a like

362
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,703
China they're bunch of liars got to be worse than this

363
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
It's

364
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
You can have that

365
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,079
Concerned are you can have that suspicion

366
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
But

367
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,431
It doesn't Merit leap into whatever conclusion of like

368
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
We're all going to die

369
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
No and and that

370
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
Conclusion is actively harmful

371
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,391
Yes now so many people are going to experience any kind of sim

372
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,463
And they're going to go and they're going to fill up a

373
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
As many hospitals

374
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
What is possible possible

375
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,327
That's impossible

376
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
Happens whenever you stoke this

377
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,679
It's kind of panic and there are plenty of hospitals now where it's

378
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,775
It's like I literally would they literally have to scream everybody

379
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
There are in that area so

380
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
It's a yeah it's a lot a lot of work

381
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
That's going to

382
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
I

383
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
Maybe not even Venus

384
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:31,135
Yeah but there was a video that made the rounds on Twitter of a vehicle driving on the street supposedly in Shanghai

385
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
Hi friend quotes

386
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Confector

387
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
I have real difficulty with this

388
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:41,375
Because I can find that video on Twitter but I have no idea when it was shot if it was actually Shanghai who shot the video

389
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,935
It's very difficult to tell at all what's going on

390
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
The Washington examiner mentions this video

391
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
He may have to say that it quote

392
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,615
Purports to show workers spraying sidewalks in parks

393
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
With an unidentified

394
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Disinfectant

395
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:59,551
I'm really not sure what to do with that video but I definitely understand how the Optics of it or right in Alex's wheelhouse

396
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
I'm not surprised

397
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
See him making a huge deal out of it and

398
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Instead of reporting

399
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Responsibly

400
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,999
Initially I had no idea what I was talking about with

401
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
The Bill and Melinda Gates

402
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
Extral

403
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
I have to assume that it's just

404
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
Kind of made up

405
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
Cuz at least I did

406
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:20,543
The first cuz I couldn't find anything about it anywhere like I looked through the Infowars website I didn't find that you search for Bill Gates

407
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,615
Nothing nothing comes up

408
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
Yeah there is an inch

409
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Interesting reality behind

410
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Okay

411
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,599
On my pass through this though I should point out that it's fun to go through some of the headlines Alex's posted about Bill Gates over the

412
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
Here's one from 2016 quotes

413
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
Did Bill Gates create the zika virus

414
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
Horror from 2017 quote Bill Gates

415
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,583
Retton's world with biological weapon Menace

416
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,655
Seems like Alex kind of just done for after he created

417
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
Zika virus

418
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:54,591
Alex Cottages does this whenever there's public health related story it's always Bill Gates

419
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,407
Weather weapons he's a super villain write the whole thing

420
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,551
It took me awhile to get to the bottom of this but it turns out that this is something that Alex found on a Blog written by a guy named Michael Snyder

421
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,647
There's also an article written by Kellin mcbreen on Alex's side about this week

422
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
Create was pretty difficult to find

423
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
Cuz his sight is unnavigable

424
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,375
That website that article by Kevin mcbreen is basically just a copy and paste job from

425
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
Snyder's article

426
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
It came out the day after the

427
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
Schneider blog post about it

428
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,567
The name of his blog is the economic collapse

429
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,871
And I should tell you that Michael Schneider is a bit of a nut

430
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:33,759
He used to be a frequent guest on Infowars but now you can more commonly find him on the Jim Bakker Show

431
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,855
In fact he has even hosted his own show on Jim Baker's Network

432
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
It should give you the first clue uni

433
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:45,279
Need to deduce that Michael Snyder is a doodoo super into ranting about the end time

434
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
That sounds right

435
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,607
His website the economic collapse

436
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
Collapse blog

437
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Include the set of Link

438
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
The tell you everything you need to know about this a******

439
00:19:53,983 --> 00:20:00,127
In addition to the standard survival food sales companies and gold and silver sales

440
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
Chicks website

441
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
Where you can buy all of the chicks

442
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
Attract

443
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:10,111
Which IBEW don't know her little cartoon books little comic books that are designed to terrorize children into fundamentalist Christian

444
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,487
If you to hell

445
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Anyone

446
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
To Jack Chick

447
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
Is a f****** a******

448
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167
With no reservation whatsoever

449
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
He's earned that reputation

450
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,287
Snyder's got a list of failed predictions way too long

451
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:33,919
How to get into right now but suffice it to say he's a guy who's really leaned into pretending he hasn't been wrong a million

452
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
And so is Alex

453
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,039
Despite this dude constant doomsday shift failing

454
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
To come through

455
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,855
Alex still considers him a worthwhile source

456
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,415
Which is not surprising at all because Alex has no

457
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Standards

458
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
Soap

459
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,815
This story here out of Michael Snyder's website has the headline quote

460
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
A high-level exercise conducted

461
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:57,727
Three months ago showed that the coronavirus pandemic could kill 65 million people

462
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:03,103
Before I get into what's actually discussed in the article it's important to point out that the article also

463
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Contains this paragraph

464
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,175
I find it

465
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,503
Quite interesting that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was involved

466
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,903
Because they're also Financial backers of The Institute that was granted a US patent for an attenuated coronavirus in November

467
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,208
Number 28 chickens

468
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,512
This article is using the Hulk story about the

469
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
The pier Brighton

470
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,352
In terms of building up their article

471
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Which is indicative of what

472
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
Quality in the work he

473
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,776
It's really just indicative of an operation to void of Standards just trying to push the

474
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
Propaganda cause panic

475
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,384
To be clear that paragraph did contain a hyperlink

476
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,688
So at least there's no providing a citation

477
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,064
I followed that through and found the exact same patent the qanon weirdo Jordan sather was tweeting out

478
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,112
Analysis reporting on our last episode

479
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
It's all just a chicken vaccine

480
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Steamship

481
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,720
As for the actual meat of the article

482
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
It's about an alleged event

483
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,048
That's called event

484
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
201

485
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,632
Okay events 2015 /

486
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,984
Okay it took place on October 18th and simulated it Coronavirus

487
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,312
And it said was meant to explore various

488
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Responses

489
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,176
Alex said that their simulation involved virus starting in China

490
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,224
But according to Michael Snyder

491
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
Who is absolutely his source

492
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,552
The virus in the simulation

493
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
Started in Brazil

494
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,624
This is trademark Allen

495
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
He can't stop himself replying

496
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:25,792
He can't stop himself from massaging details to make things fit his narratives more clothes

497
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
It's not enough that this drill just happen

498
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,144
Pendant simulated a Coronavirus

499
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Outbreak

500
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:35,520
It has to have started in the same place as the coronavirus originated in the real world

501
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
If the simulation matches the real world

502
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
It strengthens

503
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,408
Perception that the simulation was the

504
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
Plan for the real world

505
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
Which is why he lies like

506
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
So disappointed

507
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Because it's so

508
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
It's even better if

509
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,880
You tell the truth if it does simulation

510
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:56,768
Was tried in Brazil and it didn't go the way they wanted it to

511
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:03,168
You can you can turn that into even better propaganda

512
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
He's so lazy

513
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,752
So honestly beyond that I don't think there's anything suspicious

514
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
About this event 201

515
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,104
It was a get-together people with different egg

516
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
Expertise has

517
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,408
Which was hosted by the Johns Hopkins

518
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Center for Health

519
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Security

520
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,576
These experts basically at a symposium where they discuss their reactions to hypothetical pandemic event

521
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
Like I said that they had set up

522
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:27,744
They represented people for business field governmental organizations and ngos the latter of which

523
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,304
Is why there was representative from the Bill and Melinda Gates Oregon

524
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
Who was involved

525
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,680
You can go to the website for the Center for Health safety and watch the Inn

526
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Entire thing

527
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
I watched most of it last night

528
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,568
Really good people talk about the implications of a developing emerge

529
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
And how their field to be

530
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
Inclined to respond

531
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,456
I watch a bunch of it and I got to say I like

532
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,480
This stuff

533
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,600
It's like if you take away the fact that there is a real-world how crisis going on right now

534
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,928
This would be fun

535
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,720
Basically yeah there was

536
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,768
Casa the Columbia Aeronautics and Space

537
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,096
Association of Realtors

538
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
I think was part of my

539
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,912
Gifted program or whatever we had

540
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,776
Like they we went and did a space shuttle launch simulation

541
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:16,384
That would that was such a fun day I'm 35 and I still remember it

542
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,200
Naked in this thing that they did with the Johns Hopkins

543
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
They even like they hired actors

544
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:27,392
The film news reports to play throughout Parks and Recreation at all of the people

545
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,184
Except for like the ones were involved in

546
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Like the actual order

547
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,512
Malaysian I had no idea what

548
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
What do you like to do

549
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
We're going to be in there to roll with it

550
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
God dammit

551
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,656
It's a live-action role-playing

552
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
Basically I am also

553
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
Should point out

554
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:47,616
A lot of these people are not really into role-playing or anything so you can see the clear discomfort in them trying to put

555
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Tampa situation

556
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,480
Ability to act

557
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:59,648
Mexico

558
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
American State Bank

559
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,280
Alright expert will still responded in a situation like this

560
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
Past

561
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:13,728
Anyway if you go to their YouTube page you can find videos their past exercises like this

562
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,776
Like in May 2018 when they did this

563
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,104
Exact same exercise with a slightly different hypothetical disease

564
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,408
You can also find plenty of other videos of confer

565
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
Prince's wear these sorts of issues are disgusting

566
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
Slightly different prison

567
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
Temptation just like speakers giving

568
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:31,392
A lot of it comes down to discussing questions that may not come up in your normal thought process

569
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
What would

570
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,720
If your role playing an outbreak with a bunch of experts

571
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Different field

572
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,560
Like you bounce things off I call I hadn't considered

573
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
What the business

574
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
Response

575
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,960
Your field has thoughts and concerns that mine doesn't

576
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
We can better help a coordinated approach

577
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
If we get together and pretend

578
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,224
Yeah it just makes that they should have had a representative from right-wing weirdos Woo's

579
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,112
We set the southern border on fire the whole thing it's just a 20 ft tall Flame

580
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:07,488
From one side of the country to the other

581
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,864
So how are we going to get people okay so now we got to help break and arson

582
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:18,240
Is it suspicious Jordan that they use the coronavirus as the hypothetical Out Boy

583
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:24,640
Break and now there's a coronavirus cuz we've had coronavirus outbreaks in the past so it would make sense to mod

584
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,760
In the past 18 years there been two major outbreaks of Coronavirus

585
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,344
With SARS in 2002 in Mercer in 2012

586
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
The host of the event when

587
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,464
She's giving a speech setting everything up even points out they wanted

588
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256
How to create a scenario for the expert

589
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
The disgust that was realistic

590
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,656
If that's your goal coronavirus is a great candidate to base your hypothetical disease on

591
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,216
And honestly from the perspective of the

592
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
Conspiracy theorist

593
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,568
That detail doesn't even really matter of fact that it's Coronavirus

594
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,872
It's a Tuesday bolos that hypothetical disease

595
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,896
Alexander's Elkwood

596
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,480
Just be advancing the same narratives about the medical plan meeting for a pandemic

597
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:06,624
Get cold if it was a virus and they just do it the

598
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
The same

599
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,048
It probably sounds like I'm doing a bit of hand-waving here like I who cares but honestly this doesn't rise anywhere close

600
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
To being above like

601
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
The level of

602
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
For me

603
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,448
This is a public health organization that was holding a panel discussion

604
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
It's centered around a hypothetical pandemic

605
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
That's what they do

606
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,848
The hypothetical pandemic they chose the Coronavirus

607
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
Which makes sense as a candidate for them to use

608
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
According to discussion in their EX

609
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,248
Exercise the World Health Organization

610
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,296
Deals with approximately 200 outbreaks

611
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
Every year

612
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,136
Many of them small and localized to the point where we never even

613
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
I hear about them

614
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
They're able to do that work

615
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
Effectively and save people's lives

616
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
Lives because they train

617
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,560
Because they do things like this exercise

618
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,632
Disaster preparedness for larger more dangerous situation

619
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
All that is is just

620
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
I mean

621
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,984
I know this sounds like

622
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
I don't know

623
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
A cop-out but

624
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,312
This is just timing

625
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
Yeah this is just a coincidence

626
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,920
Sense of timing

627
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
Training was in October

628
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
Yeah

629
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
Okay that makes perfect

630
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
I mean

631
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,904
Imagine that they would do something like this at least twice a year so

632
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,536
You would never be more than 6 months away if I do not think that they do any year

633
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,168
Maybe maybe I don't I don't deserve

634
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,960
I don't think it's that frequent

635
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
But from what I'm

636
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
Understand it's not a hole

637
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
Leon comment

638
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
Nothing

639
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
For them

640
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,640
How to do a far enough away from a training of

641
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
Meant for it to matter though

642
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,712
No Indiana considered

643
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:41,600
Is one in a line of training event that goes probably many that we don't know about the car

644
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,904
Much more localized smaller like

645
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,744
The coordinating state and city responses as opposed

646
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,328
To government and international business

647
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
Sci-fi typing

648
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
You could do

649
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,496
You could make this argument oh they had a meeting about this

650
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
You know they had a

651
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:03,104
Play an exercise you can probably make that anytime

652
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,920
You'd just be a matter of digging

653
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,688
To find

654
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,224
The example

655
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
I find

656
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
Nothing suspicious

657
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
For Alex

658
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
Proof

659
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,392
That's so f****** annoying that

660
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
There are so many out

661
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
Breaks that are

662
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,512
Handled because these people are incredibly competent

663
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,584
Then you do here about 1 and

664
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
These

665
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,632
Lunatics go out

666
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,448
They're like these people have no idea what they're doing and

667
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:32,032
Or they're actively trying to kill us all even though it's like we have

668
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,824
Mountains upon mountains of evidence

669
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
What's that

670
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
It's

671
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
Good chewing

672
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,200
A good job it's a sincere bomber

673
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,016
So Alex talked a little more about this

674
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
Exercise

675
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Have you like

676
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,832
The bench will be used

677
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,624
Melinda Gates

678
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
Foundation Zone

679
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
To bring in world government

680
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,984
So the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation didn't say they're planning was to bring it world government

681
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,056
The conclusion of the exercise wasn't even that there should be world government

682
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,640
Kevin mcbreen article Alex's reading doesn't even say that

683
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:15,552
The conclusions reached by the exercise were largely around government and international business recognising the need to work together to avert crisis

684
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,464
I know Alex thinks that any kind of international collaboration that doesn't involve Trump doing something weird counts as world government

685
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
But this is just weak

686
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
Oh also

687
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:29,376
One of the goals they recognized as being important in the exercise is quote

688
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,960
Governments and private sector should assign a great greater priority

689
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,240
To developing methods

690
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:39,616
Combat Miss and disinformation prior to the next pandemic response say that would probably be a smart idea

691
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:46,016
Are the Galaxy's basically making their case for surround Alex Jones

692
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
Right right

693
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,344
Halex darts like getting into like

694
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:54,208
But you can tell he didn't do the first half hour of the show he's coming in weird

695
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,864
He's talking doomsday is here type shyt going to be on later and say that humanity is done

696
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,656
Like we're in

697
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:07,776
A f*****-up Place yeah I can only assume that the lawsuit is going well

698
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:12,896
I think we're going to go with it that baby

699
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,456
That might be coloring some of this perception

700
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,224
But

701
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,552
Because he's in the state news like what pandemic here

702
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,112
Humanity is going to die

703
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,416
You know cuz we're cuz of cuz of abortion

704
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,976
Inspiron minutes divine retribution

705
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,768
Instead of being like

706
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,864
Everyone go to the hills or exactly what you're

707
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,144
Normal person

708
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
Please respond to this would be

709
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,216
Just wait to die Alex's response

710
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
What is

711
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,776
I called it

712
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
And you know I

713
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
Long time ago

714
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,808
Time sure flies

715
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
I guess

716
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,648
13 years ago

717
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,232
This is the time to reminisce

718
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
World that big at all

719
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,144
Call Dan game

720
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
For Global enslavement

721
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
And

722
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,360
They want you dead

723
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Who wrote

724
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
Explain everything

725
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
3 Hour film

726
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
Too long

727
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Add

728
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
It's all a couple

729
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648
Are David copies of it

730
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,696
About for free

731
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,512
I'll go video

732
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
I got over 50

733
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,096
A million views on there before Google

734
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
Got rid of it already

735
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Cool

736
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,984
About 10 million views with platforms on YouTube

737
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
Proud of you

738
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
Is it if you watch this

739
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
13 year olds

740
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,968
It lays out are they what you was contrived bio

741
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:03,488
Does it damn for anyone who's interested we have a 5 episode series Breaking Down Alex's film endgame that you can find

742
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
Very easily by look for it

743
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,816
Don't listen to the last episode I lost my

744
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:11,168
I spent a lot of time with that pile of s*** film and I can tell you conclude

745
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,496
We did not only did Alex not prove a damn thing at that movie

746
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,568
But it also the bioweapons were almost not mentioned at all

747
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,384
There's a lot of talk about depopulation

748
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,456
That was mostly in the context of him misusing quotes

749
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,016
It's for people like Bertrand Russell and Margaret Sanger

750
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,808
To attack vaccines and abortion

751
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:34,208
He did talk about race specific bioweapons very briefly citing the project for a New American Century documents

752
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,256
Is proof The Cheney wanted to use

753
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,864
Far be it for me to defend Dick Cheney but that pinac document mentioned

754
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
The use of bioweapons

755
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936
Stay out of that variety

756
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,984
Is 1 in a list of hypothetical threat

757
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,008
The country could face

758
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,336
As a justification for rebuilding America's defenses

759
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,640
Which coincidentally is the actual name of that document

760
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
It's not called the p

761
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
Document

762
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,480
Alex's calls if that's what started a fight

763
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,296
That sounds right beyond that the documentary and heavy

764
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
Is a bunch of bulshit

765
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,368
It's just fake quotes

766
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,160
A lot of people yelling about a road

767
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:08,512
It's a horribly shity documentary and it honestly is embarrassing to look back

768
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,072
The idea that Alex is sitting here and pretending

769
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
It somehow Devin

770
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
Castrated approved

771
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
The globalist music by wepa

772
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
To bring in a one world government

773
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
It's just sad

774
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
Just sad

775
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,824
And I was wondering why is he getting reminiscent about

776
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
That's cuz it doesn't really make sense

777
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
Isn't really about bile

778
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
Not even a little bit

779
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:32,832
No it I mean I would I would say the road is there's a large that was a far larger part of it

780
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,880
Family about a road

781
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Yeah

782
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
It was a road

783
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
It was fake quotes

784
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,048
Thomas Jefferson got beat to death in that movie

785
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,608
No Thomas Jefferson

786
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:51,264
Fake Hitler quotes in Rockefeller quote it was all just a load of horseshit

787
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,824
And then just citation needed

788
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,640
Y'all over-the-top remember bibliography look like

789
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,224
Like swiss cheese there is quite a few references to just

790
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
Microsoft

791
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Encarta

792
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,088
Might not even like

793
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
Topic Justin

794
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:09,184
Just screwing around with her for a while

795
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,488
My favorite part of his bibliography was

796
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:15,584
In the section where he was providing a citation for

797
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,376
It's claimed that the Rothschilds

798
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,448
Funded both sides of all major Wars

799
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,544
It just said insert Rothschild funding both sides

800
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,688
Set the timer

801
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760
Would like the movie really wasn't about bioweapons

802
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:39,136
Alex is in a situation where you have this coronavirus outbreak he's been building up The Narrative of

803
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,440
You know using this chicken vaccine patent

804
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,488
And then nowthis

805
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,072
Center for Health safety

806
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
Exercise is being all evidence

807
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Since this is a

808
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
Globalist

809
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:54,496
Thing I greet your good to go

810
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
Because

811
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Z's liquor

812
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,128
And it's the greatest documentary that anybody has ever seen

813
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
So you know ormeno

814
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,040
I got a lot of calls on it cuz it's in the physical paper

815
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
PSI

816
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
And it says

817
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,000
Video

818
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
Gives amateur

819
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,912
How to conspiracy theories

820
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,872
Questionable film can't have a book or film is questionable

821
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,712
In the marketplace just not allowed somebody up there says no

822
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,016
Amazon

823
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,832
Down The Alex Jones film Game

824
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,648
For violating Community standards

825
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
Watching game

826
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
All they're worth

827
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
They're playing

828
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
They're smart cities are controlled rats

829
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,400
Novato

830
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
81

831
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
Bigger

832
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
The last

833
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,128
Now they say they'll use it for

834
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Couple of things

835
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:08,480
This was not a big article

836
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,016
The real thing

837
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
How much is a little off on the

838
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,320
Details though

839
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,344
He says that the films

840
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,696
You're taking off Amazon Prime for violating Community standards but that's not what the article says

841
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
It says he violated quote

842
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,512
Company policy

843
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,304
And it goes on to say quote

844
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
The company

845
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,728
Amazon their content policy focuses on issues pertaining to sexually explicit content violence

846
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,752
Send copyright infringement

847
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:35,360
It gives Amazon leeway to disallow anything it deems inappropriate

848
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:42,272
Prime is Amazon streaming service and apparently their rules are that you can upload your own stuff if you want to but they also can

849
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,064
Take down anything they want to

850
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,624
Seems like this when exactly is it should have

851
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:50,720
Alex lit under the radar for a while and made some revenue from Amazon

852
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:55,072
Then Avengers endgame came out and a bunch of people accidentally watched his documentary got

853
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
Confused and complain

854
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,448
At which point Amazon Turkish it down probably cuz they didn't realize it was there to begin with

855
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,776
Also Alex seems to forget how bad and game was

856
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
Or what it's even about

857
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
What do you think

858
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
The film is just

859
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
The globalist downwards

860
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,432
I can think of at least two

861
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,968
Completely fabricated quotes

862
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,992
City used in that film

863
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
Antonio

864
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Sometimes use quotes

865
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Sweetly autocon

866
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,368
Making the meme different things

867
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
Then what they asked

868
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:23,488
Even when he specifically said he was using their words

869
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
Right with not using their word

870
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
I refuse to do this all again

871
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,656
So if you want to learn about how full of s*** and game is we have 9 hours

872
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448
You can listen to take care of that

873
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,520
It was mostly about a road

874
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
It was a big bro

875
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
It had of God

876
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
That stuff I was just

877
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,944
Like because it kept talking but I started remembering little things that I forgot

878
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,992
I forgot about Daniel estulin

879
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
And that his book

880
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
That was one of my favorite things

881
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:53,952
Which book was that his book about the Bilderberg Group that had like one of his inside sources was a guy who believes that

882
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Goodies from like

883
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,120
It sounds stupid s***

884
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:05,472
Anyway this is why Alex is talking about endgame B cuz they just took it off Amazon Prime

885
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,264
And he's really pissed off about it

886
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,288
Empty can use

887
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,616
Is it to weave into like his his narrative that like

888
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
Oh yeah

889
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,176
They're taking it down because they're doing

890
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,968
Bio weapon released

891
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,760
Is too real for that course it is

892
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
So it all works

893
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,624
People are never going to know about this f****** road and less

894
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,416
What what do you want to watch

895
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,696
Tony Stark go back in time

896
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,720
Time b*******

897
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,768
You got to hear about this f****** road

898
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,912
Terrifying I'd like to congratulate Alex on taking these pieces and building exactly what he should have out of it

899
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,960
Granted it's all bulshit but it's

900
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,264
Probably exactly what you would do if you were

901
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
A crass

902
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,592
Liar

903
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
Pretty simple

904
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,176
So I was just sort of

905
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
Talkingshit

906
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,528
When I was suggesting that Avengers

907
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,808
Endgame came out

908
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,344
And it caused a bit of confusion

909
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
Turns out Alex has some thoughts

910
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,184
About Avengers

911
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
Why is this so important

912
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,816
Why was it taken down

913
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
A lot of reasons but you see

914
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,472
This film inspired

915
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,520
The Avengers

916
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
Genocide

917
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:29,440
You make me feel that

918
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,768
And then

919
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,328
Down for a thought

920
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:41,728
Who could forget that subplot in Adventure Time game where Hawkeyes trying to build a road

921
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,032
He's just running down that buck and run

922
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
All right I do,

923
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:56,320
Was it when the giant spaceship fell onto the door

924
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,904
I'm trying to think of a good road

925
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,744
Situation in a Avengers endgame

926
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,144
Big Daddy Stone Alex Alex would not approve of wakanda

927
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,704
I'm going to tell you that right now he's talked about not if not like

928
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,800
So Alex gets to talk in

929
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
In about how use experts on

930
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,128
To talk about Daddy's health issue

931
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,664
Little face in the world

932
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
Is list

933
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
Is not good

934
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,528
We've been reporting that since last week

935
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,576
We've been having a

936
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
Experts online

937
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,672
Mike Adams and many others and playing in historical clips

938
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,720
Publico inventor

939
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
Aussie

940
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,560
Polio vaccine

941
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,376
Admitting that they knew it had

942
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,192
340 in it that causes cancer

943
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,056
Keep that clip of the co-inventor of the polio

944
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,616
The back your head cuz we'll get to it later I was very

945
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,687
Confused by that I didn't know what to do until Alex

946
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,783
You talked about it again later

947
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,343
I do not think it's fair to call Mike Adams an expert on any

948
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:06,207
We had experts like Mike Adams on

949
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
Look okay

950
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:13,375
So one time you say you should put a Bola in your blood and then drink it and now all the sudden you're not an expert

951
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,935
That may come back up later

952
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,751
Second when Alex says that they put

953
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,799
Sbirs v40 and polio vaccine

954
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
He's lying

955
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,895
Between 1955 and 1963

956
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,455
Approximately 10 to 30% of polio vaccine

957
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,735
Were contaminated

958
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
With what's known as sv40

959
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,063
Or Simian virus 40

960
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,855
The reason for this was that at the

961
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:37,439
What time do irises I'm sorry that exceeds were made using monkey

962
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,719
Kidney cell culture

963
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:43,071
And unbeknownst to the vaccine makers some of the vaccines were contaminated

964
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,119
Obviously that's not good

965
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,399
However according

966
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
To the CDC quote

967
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:51,519
There has been some concern that the virus could cause cancer in humans

968
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,335
However most studies looking at the relationship

969
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,639
Gene sv40 and Cancers are reassuring

970
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,711
Finding no causal association between the receipt

971
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,271
Of sv40 contaminated polio vaccine

972
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
And the development

973
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,903
Animal testing shown that it can cause tumors and hamsters

974
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,719
But the test for people have been done inconclusa

975
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,815
So Alex can't even prove that basic piece of his argument which is what he's getting

976
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
For sure

977
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,191
In the history of Medicine

978
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,983
Which one were you can find a ton of whoops

979
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
Moment

980
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,799
And if you don't really want to concern yourself with.

981
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
And you just

982
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,103
Attack the medical

983
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,175
Maybe because you make all your money selling time supplement

984
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:34,527
It's really easy to pretend that all of these moments were actually secret attacks on the

985
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,295
Republic

986
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,831
But Alex can't prove any of this

987
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Is it just

988
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
Is Felix yeah

989
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:42,463
It's it's like l.ron Hubbard trying to prove it all psychiatrists

990
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
Sure

991
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,839
Evereve everything is been the Psychiatry industry search

992
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
Yeah

993
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,679
Experts on like Mike Adams

994
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
And played clips

995
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,775
But we'll get you a little bit down the road

996
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
Co-inventor

997
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:00,127
I don't like experts telling me that the world is already over

998
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:06,271
I don't like experts telling me that humanity is already punch I can pick I can reassure you like Adams

999
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,575
He is a douche what about the whole above look like

1000
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,111
The bat workout

1001
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
So

1002
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:18,303
The whole point is that sv40 was put in the vaccine for polio in order to give people

1003
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,887
Search sure so Alex talked a little bit about this cancer thing

1004
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,447
Did you know chickens come from eggs

1005
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
You're paralyzed

1006
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,263
Yep how do you fax

1007
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
Raindrops come from

1008
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
You betcha

1009
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,895
Sort of you know that

1010
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,687
Almost all cancer comes from

1011
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,343
In the scientific

1012
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,647
Curology

1013
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
80 years

1014
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
Okay

1015
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
Sorry

1016
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:54,399
I just I just enjoy a childlike sense of wonderment at their universe and that's very

1017
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,191
Did you know that almost

1018
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,215
All cancers

1019
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:57,983
Army

1020
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
Virus

1021
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,335
According to the paper in the Yale Journal of biology and Medicine

1022
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
From December to

1023
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
2006 quote

1024
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,991
An estimated 15% of all human cancers worldwide may be attributed to viruses

1025
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:13,343
A 2016 released from the national toxicology program from the national

1026
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,367
Institutes of Health

1027
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
Put the number lower

1028
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,463
Saying quote about 12% of cancers worldwide or like

1029
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Viruses

1030
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,791
A 2013 article from the American

1031
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,607
Society for microbiology carried the headline quote

1032
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,935
Percentage of cancers linked to viruses potentially overestimate

1033
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,239
This was specifically about some research

1034
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:34,079
2011 out of the karolinska institute in Sweden

1035
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,615
If you rise that 40

1036
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,895
Percent of cancer is like

1037
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
Viruses

1038
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:42,271
At which points are scientists began to test that theory and found it was not good

1039
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,063
And if the number was much lower closer

1040
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,623
10% which is right in line with at 12

1041
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,415
15 is in the bulb

1042
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,487
Is kind of within the scientific consensus

1043
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
Alvin's a

1044
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:57,631
He's almost all of them that was wildly

1045
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,679
Overestimating the number

1046
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,727
Still didn't make it all the way Tom boats

1047
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,519
No let alone

1048
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
Almost no

1049
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,639
What is assertive s*** that you end up saying when you think Mike Adams

1050
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,663
Is an expert in the field of

1051
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,943
You understand stupid

1052
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
Anyway

1053
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
You jump off

1054
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,295
Coffey Medical

1055
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
For a little bit

1056
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
Because

1057
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,623
There's some legal

1058
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,671
And it's not Alex's legal issue

1059
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,719
It is boy

1060
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,743
Coinsurance

1061
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,535
Owen Shroyer is Ben arrest

1062
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,911
Hearing is in about 20 minutes she was on time and DC

1063
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:34,495
David guess the next hour will have more bad as my lawyer that start with him

1064
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,543
And Owen on the broadcast arrest

1065
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,847
Came across his mouth inside

1066
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,967
That's not what I meant any of those Senate building

1067
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,527
Somebody else was allowed to hold up signs and do stuff

1068
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,135
He can't because Riley babe ordered the police to write him and they fall

1069
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,695
How is that is that what's going on

1070
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:58,559
The only got himself in trouble at the Capitol because he was specifically advertising Infowars

1071
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,631
Advertising is not allowed at the Capitol even in the foyer

1072
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,447
If you watch the video it's actually really funny

1073
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
I want to

1074
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,007
Begging the cops arrested

1075
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,823
They're clearly telling him that the problem is his sign

1076
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,151
Which clearly says quote learn more it banned. Video

1077
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,431
Direct advert

1078
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,223
It's so sad

1079
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:20,319
He's got this tape on his mouth with the word sensor please still talking to the cops

1080
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:24,927
Great great it's just a bad cell boy at one point a cop goes to put them in

1081
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:28,511
Cops in the Kapaa Owens been talking to says no he gets a warning

1082
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,559
To which Owen replies quote

1083
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:34,399
No arrest be in front of all these people so they can see the censorship in this country

1084
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,751
It's ridiculous

1085
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,287
The whole game here is that the

1086
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,615
Pro-impeachment protesters didn't get arrested but Owen

1087
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:48,223
The goal is to reinforce the right-wing victimhood narrative the drives this entire world

1088
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,831
Crucial to this game is didn't never recognize what you were actually doing

1089
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,855
Why it's wrong

1090
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,879
And what you got arrested

1091
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,927
For which was the advertiser

1092
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,535
Back in March of last year someone who works with the artist Robin Bell was arrested

1093
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,559
Super similar thing

1094
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,375
When they projected the words discrimination is wrong

1095
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
On the capital bill

1096
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,495
The issue there I think it may have been that the projection also included

1097
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,263
Hashtag

1098
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
Which could be deemed at 4

1099
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:16,127
Okay speaking to WaMu Bell even said quote

1100
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:21,759
The main thing is as long as it's not an advertisement we were pretty much told that it looked like we were able to do this

1101
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:26,111
So even their advertisement

1102
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:30,975
It's really hard to say whether Owen and Infowars knew that they were advertising in the Capitol building

1103
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,023
They be arrested and they could make it look

1104
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,303
Like they were being oppressed

1105
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,863
Or if they're just too dumb to even check out relevant laws

1106
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,143
Before doing there dumb s***

1107
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
I'm going to go with

1108
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,447
Door number two dad

1109
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,751
I'm honestly not sure but either way I just

1110
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,287
Do not care about Owens

1111
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
Stupid publicity

1112
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,127
Anyway you by the end of this episode

1113
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,151
Norm pattis

1114
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
Could show up

1115
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
In-and-outs that

1116
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,503
The charges have been dropped in Ellen's released

1117
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:57,087
Call who care nobody cares

1118
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,903
Steven gum up the DC law system with

1119
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,999
If I was a judge and I saw Owen Shroyer walking to the car and register like

1120
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
Jesus

1121
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:08,095
Price go away whatever you need to go away

1122
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
Goats

1123
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,167
So Alex

1124
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
Get back to that to clip

1125
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,263
He played of the co-inventor of

1126
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
The

1127
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,591
The vaccine for polio vaccine

1128
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,919
There's a co-inventor right we know that Jonas Salk

1129
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,479
Created

1130
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:30,111
Given to believe that he was a hero for creating Apollo vaccine and then refusing to profit

1131
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
Prophet

1132
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,951
There's there's some complications with a lot of that history

1133
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,791
Documentary that Alex misdirected

1134
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,559
Me towards

1135
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,095
Vex

1136
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,191
Holy Rosary is very fast at 1

1137
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,263
I'm not going to get into it too much go ahead

1138
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,847
Look at do-it-yourself you want it's just not relevant

1139
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,151
Anyway Alex is saying that this guy

1140
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,431
Who you never know

1141
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,479
Right was work

1142
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,503
Working with Jonas Salk

1143
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,343
If you are the coordinates are the folio vaccine

1144
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,647
I think you should I think people should know your

1145
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
Oh I do I know who he's talking to

1146
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,975
And we'll get into it

1147
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Says

1148
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,559
To the scientist interview

1149
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,119
CBS in Boston that's what we are

1150
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
Yes I can

1151
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,167
He said well

1152
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
This is terrible

1153
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,495
Is it while we're not going to stop

1154
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,031
Vaccine

1155
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
Obfuscation

1156
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:28,735
Too many Rockets

1157
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,759
What

1158
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,527
Weekend

1159
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:43,327
Alex keeps talking about how the people who made the polio vaccine do that there was sv40 and if they didn't care they wanted to give people can

1160
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
A number of times he says

1161
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,167
This guy who worked at Jonas Salk

1162
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
It said as much

1163
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,007
Kind of implying that he had the guy on the show which just isn't possible

1164
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,359
And that clip it became clear that he's talking about how he played at

1165
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,407
Clip of something out of context

1166
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,735
Where someone talks about the sv40 virus being in the polio

1167
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:07,135
I found the full 10-minute piece that this game from which apparently originated years ago unlike atoms website

1168
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,975
And you can tell from the context that it's a doctor discussing the discovery

1169
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,999
Avast v40

1170
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,303
Which one presented in a certain way makes

1171
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,863
It look a little bit more nefarious than it actually is

1172
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,935
This is a clip of dr. Maurice hilleman

1173
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,727
Who is one of the leading virologist

1174
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
Destiny USA

1175
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,543
Lucky you invented so much s***

1176
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,103
The interview that Alex plays out of context

1177
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,407
Is Helaman discussing how he discovered at 3:40

1178
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,455
Not that he discovered it in the vaccine

1179
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,991
He literally discovered

1180
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,295
When you found it some polio vaccine weekend

1181
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,575
Contaminated

1182
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,599
With it in night

1183
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,367
1960

1184
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,903
It was previously unknown

1185
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,463
Jonas Salk developed

1186
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,743
The first polio vaccine

1187
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,279
But he had a bit of arrival in

1188
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
In the field

1189
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,583
This was Albert Sabin

1190
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,399
The two kind of had a bit of a disagreement about method

1191
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:54,751
Sock wanted to take a faster approach using dead polio is the vaccine

1192
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:58,847
Where is Sabin believe that the only way to go about it was to use live virus

1193
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,615
Switch takes long

1194
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,663
Sock wanted to rush

1195
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:06,271
The market cuz this is a crisis yearbook

1196
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,087
Cuz really not into dealing with this

1197
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,623
Crisis any longer

1198
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:14,463
And ultimately stock strategy won the day and he was successful in making

1199
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,767
This sad that the polio vaccine

1200
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Later

1201
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:21,375
Albert Sabin would produce his own oral vaccine for polio

1202
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
Can be very effective

1203
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:27,519
His vaccine was being tested between 1955 and 1961 during which time

1204
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:31,359
Hilaman identify the sv40 vaccine virus

1205
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,687
And theorize that it could have a negative effect on people

1206
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,735
And ultimately found it in the vaccine

1207
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,271
Because they were using

1208
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
Monkey Kid

1209
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:39,807
Nice outfits

1210
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,855
The clip alexplayz of hilum

1211
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,903
Man includes and talk about how he and Saban

1212
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,743
Joke about how the Russians would have a worse shot at the Olympics due to having a bunch

1213
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,511
Tumors

1214
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,559
But since I said that was

1215
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,583
Where the primary test

1216
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,119
Sabin's vaccine was being dumb

1217
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
Gotcha

1218
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,447
I kind of a chalk this up to dark humor

1219
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,727
On the part of Helaman and I think it

1220
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,751
It's pretty clear from

1221
00:52:59,263 --> 00:52:59,775
Yeah yeah

1222
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,311
Morning Pointe

1223
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,103
What also be

1224
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,127
Because Subs

1225
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,431
Tests have shown that there isn't

1226
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,223
Are you strong causal connection

1227
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:11,039
They can be drawn between sv40 and human

1228
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,831
The

1229
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,135
They're obviously they don't know that

1230
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,951
Yeah yeah

1231
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,487
Stuff that happened in the late fifties

1232
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,815
These conversations the right they were joking around about

1233
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,351
They didn't know

1234
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:27,679
Right so to assume that he knew that this was going to cause

1235
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,703
Cancer is

1236
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,983
Is absolutely

1237
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,007
Absurd

1238
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,567
So the idea is this guy discover

1239
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,383
A virus that has heretofore been unknown

1240
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,663
In the vaccine

1241
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:40,991
Did not know what its results or effects would be

1242
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,551
Simply you catalogued it and then

1243
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,575
As a

1244
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,903
Better dark humor that I imagine a virologist would have

1245
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,671
Stew Leonard's

1246
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
If you're dealing with

1247
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
Papa potential

1248
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,303
Millions of lives being in in your hands

1249
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,607
Yeah then he just goes

1250
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
I hope

1251
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,167
The Russians toolkit

1252
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
Essentially

1253
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,871
And more to the point with Alex's just driving is not accurate even to that edited piece

1254
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,895
He played on his show

1255
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,431
The joke is about to Russian

1256
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,711
She's not doing well in the Olympic

1257
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,247
Not that there are too many Russian

1258
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:18,623
No one says but we killed Americans too and Helaman doesn't do that gross laugh that Alex's

1259
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:23,999
Claiming like he's just creating a supervillain out of this isn't even fair to the fake source

1260
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:27,071
Fake Source material but devoid of

1261
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,351
Text Source material

1262
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:31,935
Also Jonas Salk has nothing to do with hillerman's comment

1263
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,239
This was all about Albert Sabin

1264
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,031
And Alex doesn't even know that

1265
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:41,663
He literally has no idea of the surrounding context of these topics he's covering when he tries to pass himself off as an egg

1266
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
Expert in Tavares

1267
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,479
But he's saying that

1268
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,295
This guy who he can't even remember him

1269
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,063
Men's name

1270
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:53,439
This doctor guy was talking to Jonas Salk it wasn't suck it was saving

1271
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,975
Like you don't even know anything

1272
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,303
Why should I trust you Alex

1273
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:02,911
On the grand parts of it right you don't understand the basic

1274
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,935
Right well

1275
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,703
I mean

1276
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,519
Bright

1277
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,311
Interesting Lee this video

1278
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,615
Self does not ultimately traced back to Mike Adams

1279
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:17,503
This is clear enough if you actually watch this video cuz a man comes on at the end did Shane's doctor hilliman

1280
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:20,063
Is like Bad Medicine okay

1281
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,111
This man is a dude named

1282
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,135
Leonard Horowitz

1283
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,183
And he is a real career dumb

1284
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,023
Horwitz is a dude I've started building episodes about and repeat

1285
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:29,791
Heatedly lost

1286
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
Centrist in the middle

1287
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,327
A couple

1288
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,679
It's something that I've been meaning to do and then

1289
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,215
Give us

1290
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,519
He's been on Project Camelot he's Bono

1291
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,591
Alex's show and he has like a real lunatic pedigree

1292
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,127
But he's also pretty boy

1293
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:50,527
His big claim to fame is his theory that the Rockefellers forced musical artists to use the 440 Hertz

1294
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,807
Frequency to make music

1295
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,367
Which makes people depressed and spreads evil

1296
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:57,439
Horwitz promotes 528 Hertz music

1297
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,463
Which is healing and

1298
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,999
His link to the Divine creation

1299
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:04,095
Horwitz claims the John Lennon started to make music using

1300
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,375
Show me 528 Hertz

1301
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:10,495
Model into the New World Order had him murdered since we'll be too powerful and who ruined their playing

1302
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,263
I don't like you

1303
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,055
That shouldn't be a claim to fame

1304
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,591
That's it. You don't get to

1305
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,151
That shouldn't be that should make you famous let alone

1306
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,431
Allow you to claim that it may

1307
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:23,295
Because horrific because I'm not insane because I'm not sure if we're ever going to

1308
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:29,695
Actually do an episode about him I should tell you that in preparation for doing an episode I decided to only

1309
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,231
528 Hertz

1310
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,047
Frequency for a week how did it go

1311
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,351
You didn't get healed

1312
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:42,239
No discernible effect

1313
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:49,407
I will say that that was alright annoying anyway that's the guy who edited together this Lobby piece

1314
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:54,527
About dr. Helaman devoid of all this context that was funneled through natural news and Mike Adams

1315
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,319
And now Alex's further abolished

1316
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,343
Sitting and lying about

1317
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,111
In order to

1318
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,647
Perpetuate the idea that

1319
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:03,999
They knew there was sv40

1320
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,023
Put it in there

1321
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,607
Right order to give people cancer

1322
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,167
The back end of the human centipede of b*******

1323
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,751
It's just just utter garbage

1324
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,031
Begin the garbage

1325
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,079
Yes now Mike Adams shows up right

1326
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,127
That pile of f****** human garb

1327
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
Amanda's

1328
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,687
She's get really severe

1329
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,015
He is just like

1330
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,343
We're dead why is he in a bad mood

1331
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:34,463
He's a millionaire with nothing to do go f****** home because the

1332
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:38,559
I'll just lay it out for you the reason he's in a bad mood is that

1333
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,351
There are like

1334
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,655
People on Facebook people on

1335
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,703
Like other platforms

1336
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,983
That are taking

1337
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,263
Misinformation

1338
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,055
Surrounding this coronavirus outbreak

1339
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,359
Pretty seriously

1340
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
The pushback

1341
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,919
Are might have people

1342
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,479
Writing letters to the people who host

1343
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,503
Two servers

1344
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,807
So he might be in a bit of like

1345
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,599
A pickle about the fact that he

1346
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
He's putting out

1347
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,135
And has

1348
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,159
As a career

1349
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,463
Put a dangerous misinformation about health issue

1350
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,767
These guys have no idea what

1351
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
Consequences

1352
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,119
No no clue but I've never had to deal with

1353
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,399
Well yeah

1354
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:20,799
And if they don't take well no no

1355
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,823
Without ever facing

1356
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,615
Negative consequence for your ex

1357
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,151
Right

1358
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,431
Yeah and of course

1359
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
Because it's

1360
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:33,855
Finally catching up and people are taking what you do seriously doubt he would tend to feel like well this is the big one

1361
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,647
I don't know anyway

1362
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:37,951
Bioweapon

1363
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:42,047
Personally I've been studying the situation so I've got a lot for you here let me just get right into it

1364
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,351
Number one realize that the globalists

1365
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,143
They know that the most

1366
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:46,911
Wyclef

1367
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:50,495
Fatalities in their simulations of 65 million people dead

1368
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,311
Will be liberals in cities

1369
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,127
So the globalist are willing to Mass

1370
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
Massacre

1371
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,175
Their own left at switch

1372
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,455
By the way it's consistent

1373
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:04,319
With that project Veritas video documenting that Bernie Sanders supporters who said they want a mask

1374
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:10,463
To understand anytime you release a bioweapon and engineered virus

1375
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,231
Like this

1376
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,767
It's going to impact the cities

1377
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:17,887
This probably doesn't come up enough but this clip is a nice reminder of how the word globalist dozen

1378
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,655
Mean anything

1379
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,447
Or more accurately just means

1380
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,471
People we don't like

1381
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,055
Mike Adams is saying that the globalist released this Coronavirus

1382
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:25,823
The bioweapon

1383
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,871
Which is not something he can in any way pray

1384
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,687
And the result is going to be that a ton of liberals

1385
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,967
Cities are going to die

1386
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,503
That's the global Esther willing

1387
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,783
Going to kill their own people

1388
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,855
So liberals and cities of the global its own people

1389
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:44,255
I thought the globalist or an evil cabal that were like multinational business heads bent on world government

1390
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:47,071
I thought they were the CFR and the trilateral commission

1391
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,375
Not a pro-choice activists in Port

1392
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,447
They have to understand how the sleight-of-hand trick work

1393
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:57,311
You start by doing some over-the-top demonization of your shadowy vague bad guy

1394
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,847
And then once that's in place you can

1395
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,895
Reply that demonization however you want

1396
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:07,807
Where has Alex used to pretend that he was above left-right Paradigm you can pretty clearly see now that that mask is dropped

1397
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,855
It's clear that the Infowars line

1398
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,159
Is that liberal and urban living

1399
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,439
Equals globalist

1400
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:19,583
There's not a distinction anymore it's just a pejorative term that could be applied to anyone they disagree with as a way of

1401
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,423
Attaching them do the big bad guy demon that they've built up for years

1402
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:26,495
Childish it

1403
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
F*** you

1404
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,311
You don't get to care about me

1405
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:34,431
That's you you there is literally said that we should just murder left

1406
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:38,783
Who's in the street you don't get to Suddenlink care that I'm going to get killed by my own

1407
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,111
People

1408
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:48,511
So sad I feel bad for you don't get to judge the globalist for something that you want to do anyway so sad the globalist

1409
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:54,911
What this bioweapon before we can have our civil war

1410
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:59,263
Are they want to murder you with disease

1411
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,079
I wanted to shoot you like a good human being right

1412
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,103
It's pretty

1413
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,127
Pretty stupid

1414
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,919
So bide Adams has some more dumb things

1415
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,943
Things to say but

1416
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,711
Before

1417
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:11,807
That he gets down to business cuz Alex what he ends up doing is just like Mike take over

1418
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:15,903
The show

1419
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,695
I'm going to go get a drink

1420
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,463
But I don't know what

1421
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,999
He's doing but

1422
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,071
Eat before he lets Mike take over

1423
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,631
He gets real f****** weird and

1424
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,447
I got to say the only thing I hear

1425
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,983
When I hear this clip

1426
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,543
Is I hear Alex saying

1427
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,615
I'm pretty sure a bad story is about to come out about

1428
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,687
I have been the subject

1429
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,991
Of deep state

1430
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
Attack

1431
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,039
Their next level

1432
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,575
And

1433
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,647
I was a spy

1434
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231
BFDI

1435
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
And

1436
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,839
Vote for the Central Intelligence Agency

1437
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,655
At this point to not get into this on here

1438
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,191
Action sobotka

1439
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:05,311
Obviously talked about years ago that against your group

1440
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,871
On the phone with me during racing join us

1441
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:11,455
Will Dartmouth Goodyear going to be part of the elite you're already LOL

1442
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:15,039
Yeah man you know that the Pentagon people doing it over the phone I mean

1443
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,647
You want to see it behind the scenes

1444
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,671
But

1445
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,743
They basically told me used

1446
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,607
And this isn't just like a death threat over the telephone

1447
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:31,935
Oh that's the best thing for your family this is what it is

1448
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
You're going to see

1449
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,615
Cannibalize the media about me the next few days

1450
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,639
You're going to spend

1451
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,599
Family Guy

1452
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,879
Albino.

1453
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,951
But it is about our show

1454
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:56,511
I'm just a canary down in this coal mine

1455
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,279
It is about

1456
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:03,679
It is entirely about you I don't know I don't even know if any story is going to come out but I hear Alex worried that something

1457
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:06,239
He has some indication that like

1458
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,263
Oh

1459
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:13,151
This reminds me so he was reached for comment about something so you could read someone's working on it

1460
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:13,919
S***

1461
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,735
I don't know this could be the Megyn Kelly situation all over

1462
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,807
Until the Megyn Kelly interview is like

1463
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:26,207
They might publish all the s*** that I said they're going could be and every bad they are only doing this to prepare

1464
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:29,023
Prayer for my dad

1465
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,559
It's a

1466
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,375
You can you can start to read

1467
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,911
Through the the

1468
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,983
The intention there at that stupid like

1469
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,519
Alright guys f***

1470
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:42,591
Some bad stuff about me that's just

1471
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:46,175
Nancy is really bad

1472
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,223
You are going to hear some s*** about me that you

1473
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:51,039
You do boy is it bad and I did all of it

1474
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,063
And the CIA is

1475
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,391
Canary in the coal mine though

1476
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
This is

1477
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:00,255
This is kind of an interesting Club cuz I look starts ruminating

1478
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,791
On canaries in Colma

1479
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,583
And didn't

1480
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,607
To do that I don't

1481
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,375
No

1482
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,191
I think he loses track of the metaphor

1483
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,239
It's very complicated but

1484
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,055
Liberty with

1485
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,359
Mary's blood no no but

1486
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,919
Alex does get around to being like weird

1487
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
Already

1488
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:21,247
So he's right there with Mike

1489
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:25,855
But they have canaries so in the methane goes up certain I could Aries.

1490
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,695
Terry can handle any any any gas

1491
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,511
Cherry Falls over matters

1492
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
Okay

1493
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
Well

1494
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,351
The canaries are dead

1495
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,887
Right now

1496
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,655
Weave

1497
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,447
Bond through Moesha run

1498
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,495
Analogies

1499
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:48,127
Already dead already know you're not saving the day already

1500
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:55,039
Nobody else can handle this week notice what time and we built for it

1501
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,063
Louisiana lunchbox

1502
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,599
Weird that already okay

1503
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:04,255
They're doing all of this right now

1504
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,655
And the coronavirus obviously is as prepared simulant

1505
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
Recover Brothers.

1506
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,775
Cuz they always having something else is really doing and they got the virus

1507
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,055
You can see all the stuff

1508
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,615
It means we are now game time

1509
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:20,895
The balls been

1510
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
20

1511
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,735
New World Order Donatello Humanity

1512
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,343
So he hands it off to Mike bitlife

1513
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,879
The thing that I hear there

1514
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,647
Please like

1515
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,439
Shades of Project Camelot

1516
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:38,303
You know with these like they have this virus but it's just cover for something else

1517
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:44,959
I hear that Kerry Cassidy saying yeah there's these wildfires but they're not really happening it's just because aliens are

1518
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,239
Coming through the portal

1519
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,543
Course it's it's it's the same

1520
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,311
Sort of

1521
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:54,431
Thinking well I mean obviously everybody knows that spider leadership only a text through Corona

1522
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,271
Making their move bingo

1523
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:04,415
Bingo

1524
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:07,231
These people in denial isn't like 80

1525
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:14,655
I'm not going to be overwhelming and favors anymore we are but

1526
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:20,543
All of us disappear into the nothingness Canary

1527
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,871
And the abyss is all of us

1528
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:26,431
But at the same time you got it you got to reflect like

1529
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,735
That's some of the language that he's using

1530
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,295
Is really f***** up

1531
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,063
Yeah

1532
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,343
And in his

1533
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,111
World

1534
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,159
We've heard many times

1535
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,719
Scholar's asking when does this kickoff

1536
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,767
When is the time

1537
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:44,095
You know it and for him to not be aware that this is

1538
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,119
Language

1539
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,655
That has a meaning

1540
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,191
Specific to his audience

1541
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,007
It's at best

1542
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,543
Super irresponsible

1543
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:59,455
We've discovered that the virus is Airborne everybody should leave their homes and fire their weapons wildly into the sky

1544
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:02,015
Might get it all Mike does get close to the

1545
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:02,783
Jesus

1546
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,319
So anyway he comes back

1547
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,111
Mike does

1548
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
After the

1549
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,415
Alexandra talk to him

1550
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,719
And just mad he is

1551
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,743
Spitting wisdom

1552
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
What's the

1553
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,583
This Coronavirus

1554
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,607
Situation

1555
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,399
This is just the first wave folks

1556
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:22,495
The second wave of the pandemic begins when the Coronavirus

1557
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
Vaccine

1558
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,799
Begins being administered

1559
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,591
And we will come to learn

1560
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:27,871
Maxine

1561
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,895
Contain contain

1562
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,431
Live virus

1563
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:33,503
It would be live virus in the coronavirus vaccine

1564
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,783
Edible

1565
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:35,807
Will set off a fire

1566
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,087
Firestorm of the second wave

1567
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,159
This is already been fly already engineered

1568
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,439
We know the Playbook

1569
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,231
No you don't lie

1570
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,279
Why would they do that that's a terrible plan

1571
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:51,935
Waffle plant

1572
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:56,287
Be representing me and they're not even doing a good job of killing me in the cities that they're trying to

1573
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:00,383
Mike is is making this s*** up ain't what is the effect of this language in

1574
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,431
This rhetoric is is to make people less

1575
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,223
Trustworthy and less

1576
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,271
Willing

1577
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,063
To engage the public health

1578
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,599
People

1579
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:12,415
That in that will make it much more difficult

1580
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,719
For them to help

1581
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:15,999
You contain

1582
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:16,767
And treat

1583
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,303
This emerging public

1584
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,071
Lookout situation

1585
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,351
These feel like

1586
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,191
I understand that this probably very little effect

1587
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,471
The Infowars has

1588
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,263
Anymore

1589
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,823
Worst case scenario this has

1590
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,871
They are the only outcome of this

1591
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:32,895
Is either

1592
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,663
Neutral

1593
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:38,527
Or people get hurt there is no positive outcome other than Mike selling more s***

1594
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,575
More of his supplement

1595
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:43,135
It does make me think about how

1596
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:47,231
You know like I were wired wrong for for this type of s***

1597
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,535
Are you I would find it

1598
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,351
Hard to believe that we would have the same level of

1599
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,887
Distressed of Public Health

1600
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,703
If our coverage of Public Health was more like

1601
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:02,591
The World Health Organization once again quashes outbreak before it becomes Global issue

1602
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,919
World Health Organization once again claims up all this stuff

1603
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:10,271
You and once again brings massive amounts of age all of these people

1604
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,599
Instead of only mentioning them yeah then they f***

1605
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:18,719
It's it's hard to imagine it's just our wired like there were not going to

1606
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:20,255
Clickbait is never going to be

1607
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,535
Positive

1608
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,559
You just can't win

1609
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,839
Yeah it's unfortunate

1610
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,119
Because that is lettuce

1611
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:25,887
To the point where

1612
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,167
I mean it's over

1613
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,495
It is through this troubled nightmarish it's so

1614
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,799
It's so horrific

1615
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,847
Such a nightmare

1616
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,127
Can we do

1617
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
Are the human race

1618
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,503
Medical

1619
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,295
Calendar for Humanity

1620
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,599
It will only be lone survivors

1621
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,903
The strategy must

1622
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,719
You can be a Survivor we can help you survive

1623
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,767
The information here Infowars

1624
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,047
And what I do

1625
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:57,375
Can help you survive I'll give you some practical things in the next segment

1626
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,191
Maybe maybe it's an ass

1627
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,495
Massaging statement to hear from me the health Ranger but

1628
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,311
It's over

1629
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,359
The masses will be slaughtered

1630
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:12,223
Wow

1631
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,831
Wow it is over for Humanity as a whole

1632
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:23,487
Only you can prevent forest fires but it's too f****** late man we're all dead

1633
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,303
We're all goddamn dead I'm smoking

1634
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:32,703
Caleb are bringing you this message ride to get out of your home you see the trick there to even eat

1635
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:37,311
The best-case scenarios Soul Survivors

1636
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,639
What do you know I work for a company that sells

1637
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:47,039
Survival food and bug out everybody else is lying to you I'm the only one you can trust at

1638
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,855
And it just so happens that the problem I am warning you about

1639
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,159
It's something that I myself have been preparing for

1640
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,719
And hey how about you scare somebody

1641
01:10:54,975 --> 01:11:00,607
And it will be 149/99 every month until you don't win student that is weird

1642
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,399
But I got to say

1643
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:05,727
How to say he keeps repeating that most of humanity is dead

1644
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,775
And I got to say you starting to swing me

1645
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,079
I believe it's over for Humanity

1646
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,871
I think that you marry

1647
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:15,455
It is being Target with so many factors of Destruction that

1648
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,295
The bulk of the human race will not

1649
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
Survive this

1650
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,647
Now there can be lone survivors or small groups of survivors

1651
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,951
The strategy we have to get

1652
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,975
Now

1653
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:31,839
And it just the fact that you are tuning into this broadcast means that you are Survivor you have a Survivor mindset

1654
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,607
Really

1655
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:33,887
Are the sheeple class

1656
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,167
I just walked off a cliff

1657
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,703
Because everybody else is doing it in for

1658
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,007
This is salesman tactics

1659
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,287
That's

1660
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:46,687
Let it ruin you learned when you go and try and get a job like with Cutco the nice sale people

1661
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:51,807
I was a Salesman for 10 years

1662
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:56,159
Me is to make the person seem like they're smart because

1663
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:59,231
You know you're not wanted people who wouldn't listen to this sales manager

1664
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,255
You're already here

1665
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:05,119
Listening that means you're smart you need to survive hey when I was working with the hearing aids

1666
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,935
Sonos two people it was just like hey

1667
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
You know what

1668
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:12,031
Just by coming in and getting your hearing tested you've already

1669
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,823
Take your already way advance

1670
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,639
You don't even know what you'll be whenever you get to

1671
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,943
I think there's degree

1672
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:26,879
Hearing aid like I was it was weird I was I was using sales tactics that are normally used to

1673
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:33,279
To get people to waste their money on

1674
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,071
What what

1675
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,143
What he's doing is creating this sense of like

1676
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,167
In group

1677
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,215
But the in-group is based on like

1678
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,495
Hirabayashi

1679
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,031
It's it's

1680
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,055
So manipulate

1681
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:48,383
It's very deceitful like it really undercuts

1682
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,943
Did my ability to believe that he believed

1683
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:51,967
What do you say

1684
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,015
And it's so over-the-top

1685
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
Don't like

1686
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:59,391
The mass of humanity is done we're all rich Society civilization

1687
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,159
Yeah

1688
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
You know.

1689
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,999
You know we've only got 10 days before everybody's cannibal

1690
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:04,767
Close to Dad

1691
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,303
That's the next step

1692
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,095
Can you imagine

1693
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,887
I demanded of Cormac my

1694
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:15,519
McCarthy wrote the road but the only lone survivors were f****** infowar Adams

1695
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:20,383
God never mind he did write that book is called Blood Meridian

1696
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,663
So

1697
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,431
Did you know

1698
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,455
In the past

1699
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:26,271
Infowars has been very prone to call

1700
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,551
Different

1701
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,855
Health Gracie is false flag

1702
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,647
This one's not this one's real

1703
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:37,535
Okay one way that I believe that you know that this is a real pandemic is because the who

1704
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,071
Is trying to downplay it

1705
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:39,839
Who

1706
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,143
Whatever the Whow

1707
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,679
If the opposite of reality

1708
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:48,031
When the bird flu virus was a non pandemic

1709
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,591
They declared it a stage 6 pandemic

1710
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:56,223
So the floor here in Mike's thinking is that he seems to believe that outbreaks are predicted

1711
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,015
When they very much are not

1712
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:03,903
You could have a plan in place and executed quite well and then some random variable can make an outbreak still occur

1713
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:08,255
You can prepare do your best to mitigate the Damage Done by natural phenomena but

1714
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,559
The idea seems to have about the

1715
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:13,119
Level control these groups he hates have his

1716
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:13,887
Is absurd

1717
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,935
Mike is also playing fast and loose

1718
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:18,751
What's the classification of outbreaks used by the World Health

1719
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,543
He wants the audience

1720
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,823
To think that the higher the

1721
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,359
Number of the stage the worst

1722
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,151
Things are but that's not entirely accurate

1723
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:29,503
The whou the six phase scale to describe the stage of which

1724
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,063
We currently find ourselves with a particular disease

1725
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,343
From a public health stamp

1726
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:37,183
Phase one is that there is no animal-to-human transmission

1727
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:42,815
Phase two is when there's a virus that's a known to have affected human circulating an animal population

1728
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:47,167
Phase three is when there's small clusters people who have been infected by animals

1729
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,447
But human-to-human transmission

1730
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,215
Is Unser

1731
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,031
Things could have been more serious in Phase 4

1732
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,079
Where's sustained human-to-human transmission

1733
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,103
Taking place

1734
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,383
Faze5

1735
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:59,199
Is when confirm human-to-human transmission has caused

1736
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,223
The condition to read

1737
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:03,039
At least two countries in one region of the globe

1738
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
Basic

1739
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,879
Is characterized by community-level outbreak

1740
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,951
At least one other country from where it originated

1741
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,535
The avian flu situation met the criteria of Phase 6

1742
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,863
The World Health Organization didn't Class B that way too scared

1743
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,167
It was just an accurate classification

1744
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,959
After this phase

1745
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,519
You enter the post

1746
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
Pica.

1747
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,823
Where activity of transmission

1748
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:26,591
Decrease

1749
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,383
Health Organization

1750
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,175
Keep an eye out for second waves

1751
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,967
When things return to normal levels

1752
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,759
The post-pandemic. Begin

1753
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:34,527
Monitoring

1754
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,831
Continues in the evaluation of the

1755
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,111
Response the organization

1756
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:38,879
Add commands

1757
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:42,463
It's right so far of a cycle

1758
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,487
Explaining the f***

1759
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,255
Water cycle

1760
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,327
Interested

1761
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,351
Not like

1762
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:51,423
Phasix means 10 billion people have died

1763
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
Oswego

1764
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,519
And honestly like from all of my understanding

1765
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,543
About this

1766
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,823
That where we're at

1767
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,847
Currently with the

1768
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:01,151
This coronavirus may not reach

1769
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:01,919
That level

1770
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:06,015
And the reason the World Health Organization would be cautious to give

1771
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,551
Their classification

1772
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,855
Lessons learned from past circumstances

1773
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,903
I don't find anything

1774
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
Suspicious about

1775
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,231
Also I think Mike is mixing up

1776
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,279
The bird flu and the swine flu

1777
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:20,351
In June 2009 the World Health Organization

1778
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,631
Declared a public health emergency

1779
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,935
Fancy International about the H1 N1

1780
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,703
Epidemic

1781
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:28,031
And through focused efforts and use of antivirals

1782
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,311
We reach the post Peak

1783
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,871
Pandemic phases by November

1784
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,151
So then a few months

1785
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,455
This was something that was right

1786
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:38,271
To call a pandemic at its peak since it did Kill over 40

1787
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,319
Teen thousand people in 2009

1788
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:43,391
And the transmission of the virus was fitting fa6 qualifications

1789
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:49,535
Currently the Wuhan Cora coronavirus does not appear to meet all the criteria though if the confirm fact

1790
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:54,399
About the outbreak do end up meeting them in the future I'm certain that the World Health Organization

1791
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,167
Class fight

1792
01:16:56,191 --> 01:17:01,567
More importantly this opposite oppositional position towards public health organizations is very stupid

1793
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,335
But in very

1794
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:07,711
It's one thing to be skeptical and recognize that no human organization is infallible

1795
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
So it's best

1796
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,247
Be cautious

1797
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:13,343
It's an entirely different thing to say that whatever said organization says

1798
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,879
The opposite is true

1799
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:18,463
Particularly when you run a business selling dump supplemented

1800
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,511
Beatley

1801
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:21,791
Dangerous

1802
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:24,095
It goes back to the

1803
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,399
Got Instinct feel about

1804
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,935
Anti-vaxxers where it's like

1805
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,727
You know what f****** fine

1806
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,495
Get polio

1807
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,263
Go for it

1808
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,799
If you're not going to be and it's

1809
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:36,383
You just can't operate like that so please people so often

1810
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,711
You feel like you're dragging them Kicking and Screaming into

1811
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,479
Continue to go

1812
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:43,295
Yeah but something we all have to be like f******

1813
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,319
Get just

1814
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,623
Just come with us I know you're stupid but

1815
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:47,647
Citgo

1816
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,207
Good afternoon

1817
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,743
Temp of people who are

1818
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:55,839
Entranced by these narratives let's say or they were there behold into them

1819
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:59,935
The recognized that the people who are disseminated these narratives to them are liars

1820
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,495
They're trying to sell them

1821
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,519
Something right

1822
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,799
And hopefully

1823
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:08,383
You know people can be shaking into an understanding of

1824
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,407
The world

1825
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,455
Through recognizing like

1826
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,271
I want am I listening to the house yeah yeah

1827
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,551
That kind of thing you hope

1828
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,575
And that's my hoe

1829
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:17,855
Anyway

1830
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,391
Not only was this

1831
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,671
Past

1832
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,439
Pandemic

1833
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,207
Fake

1834
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,231
So was zika

1835
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,559
When does zika virus

1836
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:28,095
Was a made-up

1837
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,399
Virus I mean it was a made-up

1838
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,167
Pandemic

1839
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:34,239
Doing it didn't exist

1840
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:38,079
We were told that was huge we were told I mean do you remember

1841
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:38,847
Couple of years ago

1842
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:42,431
Babies were going to be born with shrunken heads

1843
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,223
Across Florida

1844
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,783
And Louisiana Mississippi

1845
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:50,367
Regions of the southeast United

1846
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,671
Babies were going to be born with shrunken heads

1847
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,743
You remember those no stories that was all over the media

1848
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,279
Because of the zika virus

1849
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,815
We all better run out and

1850
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,607
Get zika vaccine

1851
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,167
Emergency zika vaccine research insurance

1852
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,191
Congress

1853
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,471
Remember correctly

1854
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,495
They approve

1855
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:09,567
I think it was 2 billion dollars for zika

1856
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,127
Vaccine research

1857
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,967
There were no babies born with shrunken head

1858
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:19,039
In Florida there's an epidemic of truck and headed babies

1859
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,319
In Florida

1860
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,343
Never happen

1861
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,367
It was all made up

1862
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:28,767
The reason there were concerns about babies being born with shrunken heads in the South was that in areas where there where is he

1863
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,815
The outbreaks particularly of Brazil

1864
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:34,143
They were accompanied by highly increased rates of microcephaly

1865
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:38,751
The reason estate sealift might have been discussed is because he has transmitted by me

1866
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:42,079
Mosquitoes and those states of climates that are far more hospitable to

1867
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:42,847
Mosquitoes

1868
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:43,871
And therefore

1869
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,663
It would be a higher

1870
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,431
Risk

1871
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,991
Pregnant women being bit by the mosquitoes

1872
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,527
Anyway

1873
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,807
The issue for the u.s.

1874
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:54,111
Zico it was that it wasn't his huge

1875
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:54,879
Threat for us

1876
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,647
But it was

1877
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,927
4 people around the world

1878
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,255
We have the public health infrastructure to deal with it better

1879
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,559
Insomuch as we have prevalent air conditioner

1880
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,839
Screen Windows

1881
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:06,911
Which cut down drastically on the ability of mosquito carry diseases

1882
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,679
Spread

1883
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,215
It was proposed

1884
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,031
That Congress allocate 1.9 billion dollars does

1885
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,848
Zika but they ended up actually just found a 1.1 billion

1886
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,432
And a lot of it was aimed at funding local and state agencies futmas

1887
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,224
Mosquito control initiatives into place

1888
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,504
Not all Direct

1889
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,272
Did towards of Acts

1890
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,088
And the big picture here is

1891
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:25,856
Zika was

1892
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,880
Not a made-up

1893
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,648
Virus

1894
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,744
This is a representation of how Mike Adams doesn't believe the people in developing

1895
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,792
Countries around the world deserve help

1896
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,656
The concerns that people had about how zika could possibly affect the United States

1897
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,936
Did not come to pass

1898
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,240
But other countries absolutely suffer dire consequences

1899
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,264
Consequences from the virus

1900
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,336
It in that sense the World Health Organization was absolutely correct

1901
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,360
Call it an emerging

1902
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,152
He does not give a

1903
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,432
F*** now it's

1904
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,224
It's a weird solipsistic

1905
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,248
Nationalism

1906
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:56,576
And where it's like if it doesn't happen

1907
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:59,136
It's like if I don't get zika then they just

1908
01:20:59,392 --> 01:20:59,904
Made it up

1909
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:03,744
I didn't get zika my kids have a normal sized head there.

1910
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,560
Push it also there was one woman in Hawaii

1911
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:09,120
Who had been in Brazil at the beginning of her pregnancy

1912
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,656
See who did end up giving

1913
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,448
Bring birth to a child with microcephaly

1914
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,472
So his

1915
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,776
His claim that there aren't any American

1916
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:21,920
Florida so technically you could buy him a technicality

1917
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:27,808
It doesn't matter the Warriors are nonsense

1918
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,600
It's all stupid right

1919
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,136
So

1920
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:34,208
He's just talking a lot of s*** trying to like

1921
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
Moline

1922
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,000
Past

1923
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:41,376
Disease outbreak in order to make this one real didn't happen cuz

1924
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:46,496
You got to move that survival food creator of the polio vaccine was the creator of the

1925
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,544
The poliovirus right name it

1926
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,592
So he gets to talk anymore about

1927
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,384
Does Emma like look dude this is all just an a

1928
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,664
Infomercial for the food

1929
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,456
Food Supplies

1930
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,504
And this is a critical issue for all of us to get

1931
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,784
Supplies

1932
01:21:59,296 --> 01:21:59,808
Wipeout

1933
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,832
In the city

1934
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,904
People

1935
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,208
If you are not

1936
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,768
Yet prepared with a backup food supply

1937
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:09,792
In the United

1938
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,376
And you live in any major city or near a major city

1939
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,400
Then you're crazy

1940
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,960
This is a crass and disgusting sales pitch

1941
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:17,728
Pure and simple

1942
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:24,384
Mike is claiming that the food is running out in Wuhan because he wants the listener to to buy his and Alex's survival food

1943
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,432
That's the game they're playing

1944
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,224
I can find no evidence

1945
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,760
There's a food crisis in Wuhan

1946
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:32,576
Obviously there's going to be some sentiment of

1947
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,368
Concern for people under a quarantine

1948
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,136
About food

1949
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:37,184
But all the articles I can find about this

1950
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,000
Are about how the government understands that this is an issue

1951
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,792
Inner stepping up their deliveries

1952
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
The food to the city

1953
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,608
According to the South China Morning

1954
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
Post shipments

1955
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,656
The various food items

1956
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,960
Coming in from neighboring provinces regularly

1957
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:52,800
And that there's a stockpile of 11 million lb of rice

1958
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,568
+ 10000

1959
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,592
Tons of pork and beef

1960
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,360
At the ready

1961
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,896
Addition to the

1962
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,176
Regular deliveries

1963
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
Good food

1964
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:02,528
The same article discusses how some residents are stockpiling food

1965
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,576
And that does make some sense as a human

1966
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,344
Behavior

1967
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,904
There's also doesn't demonstrate that there's a food crisis

1968
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,672
Just did

1969
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,720
People behave that way sometime

1970
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:14,048
This is Sensational ISM aimed at Mike's domestic audience

1971
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,120
He doesn't care at all the people around the world are going through it mean

1972
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,656
It's clear from this talk about zika

1973
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,704
You just do it he knows that this isn't

1974
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,776
Opportunity to heighten his doomsday narratives to sell these food.

1975
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:26,592
That is like literally

1976
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,872
The underlying

1977
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,408
Of his

1978
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,688
Sensationalism

1979
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,968
Humanity is done

1980
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,528
All this dude going to be lone survivors

1981
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,552
Get your food.

1982
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,832
It's just like

1983
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,416
It's that kind of person that is so stupid

1984
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,440
And so incompetent

1985
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,256
That stay assumed that everybody else is

1986
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,792
Is more stupid and more income

1987
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,328
And in order to make themselves

1988
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,096
Feel smarter

1989
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,888
So that idea of like

1990
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,424
We're all going to starve to death

1991
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,960
Is like nobody could

1992
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,288
Possibly think I had for this nobody but

1993
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:59,104
Me could ever realize that in this circumstance

1994
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,640
There might be food worries

1995
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:04,992
So obviously all of these people have no idea what they're doing and we're all going to

1996
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,528
Right

1997
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:09,856
Know if I mean people look it sucks but people know

1998
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,672
If you want to look at it from the

1999
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,720
Perspective of how stupid is Mike

2000
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:18,304
I mean we could talk about that yeah I think we could for a while

2001
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,888
Ebola virus

2002
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,424
Great surfaces with bleach

2003
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,216
Like a bleach water mixture

2004
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,496
And put it in a spray bottle

2005
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,288
You can spray down the surfaces

2006
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,080
And it killed Ebola virus

2007
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,872
And then what happened back then

2008
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,920
The media

2009
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,200
And the government

2010
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,480
They said that

2011
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:39,296
So don't talk about natural cures for Ebola

2012
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:45,440
I think Mike Adams is trying to pretend that he didn't post any Bola cure on his website natural news

2013
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:48,000
Sample of live Ebola and some booze

2014
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,816
Into a bottle and mixing it up real good

2015
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:51,584
Well

2016
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:57,984
To Mike's credit he did take that article down from his website that's no I don't give him credit for that but it's

2017
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,568
Volume City ever published its beginner credit for taking that down

2018
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,336
Right

2019
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:04,384
It's not a secret that disinfecting with bleach

2020
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,152
Can kill Ebola

2021
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:09,760
That's pretty readily available information in literally no one would criticize Mike for saying

2022
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,320
They would however criticize him

2023
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:15,904
Heavily promoting a cure that would almost certainly infect

2024
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,928
Anyone who attempts

2025
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,208
22 use at with Ebola

2026
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:20,256
In Zoe's trying to Reaper

2027
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:22,816
Purpose that criticism than glad

2028
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:25,120
Descendants 2 / 2 use bleach

2029
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:29,472
Go fuc yourself live Dylan Morin in Black Books whenever

2030
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,496
Loses mind

2031
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:35,616
He just grabbed some oven cleaner while he's sick and he's like if you can clean it up and you can clean me any drinks

2032
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,248
Mike's got this real f*****-up View

2033
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,808
What's going on in the world what's going to happen

2034
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,344
Who you should trust

2035
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,880
Alright

2036
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,904
So World Health

2037
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,440
Officials were trying

2038
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,208
Their best

2039
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:54,816
Games

2040
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:57,120
But I think he does recognize that like

2041
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,144
The climate that were living

2042
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,704
Now with people taking propaganda

2043
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,800
And this is Bad actors more seriously it's going to lead to some backlash

2044
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,848
Right answer

2045
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,408
Frames that preemptively as sensor

2046
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,456
When this pandemic

2047
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,040
They will be take down orders and censorship orders

2048
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,832
To take offline

2049
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:17,856
Headband any account

2050
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:20,416
Of anybody who talks about a natural

2051
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,184
Cure

2052
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,464
What Coronavirus

2053
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,000
Why is that

2054
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,536
Why would that be happening

2055
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,840
Because they can't have people chewing themselves

2056
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,888
They can't allow people

2057
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:30,656
To survive

2058
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:31,936
The onslaught

2059
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
They

2060
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:35,008
The globalist Who engineer that's who

2061
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,544
Who ran the laboratory

2062
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,336
They want to kill

2063
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,360
As many people Spa

2064
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,944
Can't prove any of that s*** and you posted a f******

2065
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,224
Can you Bola cure

2066
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,040
On your website to get the f*** out of here

2067
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,064
Like its

2068
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,344
It's an issue of

2069
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,136
You're going to get people killed

2070
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:55,488
If you behave in the ways that like let's say you did surrounding Ebola

2071
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:59,072
Like let's say there is a possibility that someone could have gotten their hands on

2072
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,352
Survive Ebola

2073
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:03,424
To prepare the Cure that Mike posted on his website

2074
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,960
That would almost certainly

2075
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:08,032
Spread Ebola

2076
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,592
So I

2077
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,688
Okay I understand there's a there's issues with the

2078
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,712
Free speech

2079
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,784
And what have you but I also recognize that

2080
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,808
People who are

2081
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,648
I don't know acting in ways that are

2082
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:27,744
Specifically going to further a Public Health crisis

2083
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:34,400
I might be fine with let's say Facebook deciding we don't want this on the platform

2084
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:38,240
They don't want people healing themselves naturally like whenever I say that the

2085
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,032
The cure for this Coronavirus

2086
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:43,616
Is finding an Airborne sample of smallpox

2087
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,664
And injecting it directly into your blood

2088
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,760
Dream and then spitting and sneezing on everyone around you

2089
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,552
They're going to take that down Dan

2090
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:57,952
And it's my right as an American to say that the government doing it I think opens up like another box I have no evidence

2091
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,232
The government is doing it

2092
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,280
No I don't even care to have that conversation

2093
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:06,656
Maybe a little bit different but if he's platforms are just like go f*** yourself you're pretty people at risk

2094
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,192
Then I think they're well with

2095
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:09,728
The right to do that and I sport there

2096
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,544
So anyway this is it all

2097
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,312
Just about killing

2098
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,336
People with this Coronavirus

2099
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:16,384
It's also about training

2100
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:20,736
We know that part of the agenda here is indoctrination training and also

2101
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,272
The quarantine training so

2102
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:26,368
Whether or not this is the big kill virus

2103
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:29,696
Or some other future virus is still unknown this

2104
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:33,280
Rate of fatality rate from this virus has not yet High Enough

2105
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:38,144
To kill a billion people but it could kill tens of millions as projected in the software but

2106
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,680
It will most certainly provide

2107
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,448
The president

2108
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,728
Total police

2109
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,496
State lockdown

2110
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,520
The United State

2111
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,800
In every major city

2112
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:45,568
In America

2113
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:49,664
Say whatever you want about China's responded to the outbreak

2114
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,968
It's kind of irrelevant to the point Mike is make

2115
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:55,552
You can say that their lockdown of Wuhan is shocking and

2116
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,832
Police state

2117
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,368
Going to argue with you it's also

2118
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:02,464
Mike is making the argument that the US will use this outbreak to set the

2119
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,000
The stage to enact martial law

2120
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,536
But this raises the question

2121
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:08,608
Why didn't they do this after other outbreak

2122
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:15,776
In the mid-1980s there's a giant measles outbreak that didn't lead to Marshall Lodge that it led to Greater Public Health

2123
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:16,544
Practices

2124
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,128
The polio crisis of the early 1900's didn't lead to martial law

2125
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,152
Diphtheria

2126
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,688
Like around 50

2127
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,480
Thousand people in the US

2128
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:28,064
31921 and 9025 Neptune lead to martial law

2129
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:33,696
Some estimates claimed that as many as 57 billion Americans got swine flu in 2009

2130
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,232
That didn't lead to martial law

2131
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,512
There are over 5,000

2132
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,816
Confirmed us cases of zika in 20

2133
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:41,120
16 Legend League martial law

2134
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,168
They are a decade behind

2135
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:49,568
They wanted to do it for do you receive

2136
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:55,968
2009 they were a decade behind they wanted to use it to do martial law

2137
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,296
Oh great

2138
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,600
I hate is walking back ass

2139
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,624
Cowardly

2140
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,720
Well I mean I know I said that all of humanity is over but

2141
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:09,792
Might not kill billions

2142
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,864
They're going to do this in practice for the next one

2143
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:19,776
The public health system do we have in place or very competent and do exercise like like the one carried out by the center of

2144
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,056
Call safety Johns Hopkins

2145
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:25,152
We consider complicated response variables to better enable them to react

2146
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,176
To changing situations

2147
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:26,944
Fluidly

2148
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,016
Editorial position of enforces that everything is

2149
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:33,600
The ultimate end goal of everything is to get to martial law

2150
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:40,256
Because that has to be the endpoint of their theories they often have to say completely stupid s*** like this in order to work in that direction

2151
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:47,168
Honestly the only thing that makes me at all worried that there could be some elements of marshmallow pop up and respond to this outbreak is that

2152
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,192
Trump is president

2153
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,216
Yeah they fully

2154
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,240
Support Trump

2155
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:53,568
He's the sort of president who doesn't trust science or expert

2156
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,872
To be easy to imagine I'm overreacting

2157
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,408
Quarantine in u.s. City

2158
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:00,224
But to be totally clear I do not even think that

2159
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,272
Is a likely series of events

2160
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:07,648
Nope he can block travel because of religion and race but

2161
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:08,928
Not disease

2162
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,208
That would be crazy

2163
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:12,000
Also my good little weasel trip

2164
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:12,768
Break their

2165
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:16,352
He said that the software projection save this could kill tens of Millions

2166
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:19,424
He's referring to the center of Health Center for Health

2167
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,192
Safety

2168
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:22,752
The exercise which was not simulating the situation

2169
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,032
It's currently unfolding

2170
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:27,104
It was just using a hypothetical coronavirus outbreak

2171
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,640
The context for the discussion

2172
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,200
The actual variables are very different

2173
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:35,040
From the specific characteristics of the virus to the context of its origin

2174
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,320
Where is wild

2175
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:40,416
But you're responsible to pretend that the simulation has any predictive value in the real world

2176
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,184
Situation

2177
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,976
Mike is pretending that this is

2178
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:47,328
Is the case because you want the audience to believe that the simulation was exactly like the

2179
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,608
This actual situation

2180
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,656
Because the globalist planned it all out

2181
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:52,192
Matt is deception

2182
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,472
He is deceiving

2183
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,008
What an a******

2184
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,032
Right

2185
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:56,800
He's the worst

2186
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,848
So

2187
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,384
These terrible

2188
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,944
Get to a refreshing guest

2189
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:09,088
A little bit later after we get through the bog of it is Mike Adams he's done

2190
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:12,160
Server hosting on his own now and Alex shows back up

2191
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,440
He wants to stress

2192
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:14,976
Victor

2193
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,768
We don't make things up

2194
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:23,168
Chicken vaccine have a call with somebody who's like you get stuck

2195
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:34,176
Again it's like they're aliens on a sabotage human develop

2196
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,736
They poison everything they kill the Earth

2197
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,016
Supported

2198
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,832
Sabotage all clean human development

2199
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:44,160
I can pack of Gremlins whatever they are

2200
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:46,720
Superbad

2201
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,536
Coordination

2202
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:53,888
Cuz they're getting a transmission Mike

2203
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,680
I just scientifically look at

2204
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,448
What

2205
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,824
Bill this is anti

2206
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,616
You call them

2207
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,176
They call themselves

2208
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:08,224
But they're not they're the opposite

2209
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:11,552
What are these equations

2210
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,576
All I heard was

2211
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:25,376
Things up and then he goes on to talk about equations that he's made up

2212
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:27,168
Looking at made-up equation right

2213
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:32,800
Right so they don't even know if the standard models true Dan all equations are made of

2214
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:36,128
At the quantum level Alex is right all the time

2215
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,664
So Alex is like

2216
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,200
These people are bad news

2217
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:39,968
Manthey Volvo

2218
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:41,760
Big news

2219
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:48,672
So he's he's talking about how like a man you know they're planning what they're going to do is they're going to wait this out and there were.

2220
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:52,256
They're armored without sure but he has bad news for

2221
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,792
Every person I talk to

2222
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,096
Everybody else says

2223
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:56,864
Who

2224
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,168
Elin

2225
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,704
Kauai Hawaii

2226
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,032
And Tasmania

2227
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,848
They believed would like a year-long

2228
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,640
Global war they want to stop

2229
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,664
Stop news.

2230
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,688
Go in

2231
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,248
The new bases in Pakistan everywhere

2232
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,344
They're going to eliminate everybody

2233
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,904
Stabilized

2234
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,184
Scott

2235
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:24,000
But the fact is the minute

2236
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,304
All these people are in Severn

2237
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:32,192
Billy me a combat robot there and then drones watching of course I forgot have a combat robot

2238
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:37,312
The minute just like my a soldier or officer gives order to kill

2239
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,592
Eminem children

2240
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,896
Soldiers Turner Gunn the default

2241
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:43,712
Human resistance

2242
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,760
Computer

2243
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:51,648
Now the military guy nuts element

2244
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:53,440
Realizes they're being replaced

2245
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:56,000
And the default

2246
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,560
All the global at the minute they kick this off

2247
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:03,168
We're going to have a 90%

2248
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:03,936
Capitation

2249
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:06,496
Within days of employment off my

2250
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,568
So yeah

2251
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,360
I mean

2252
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,408
True this contacts

2253
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,176
Ripe

2254
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:14,944
Should

2255
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,992
Shadowy group of elite

2256
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,320
Have engineered the end of the human race huh

2257
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:25,184
And have built ridout's combat robot robot robot

2258
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,208
I

2259
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:31,840
Thoroughly support 90% decapitation unfortunately I don't think that's true

2260
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,888
What should these exact Circle

2261
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:35,168
Has arrived

2262
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,960
I'm disappointed that we're not at 104

2263
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:37,984
Right

2264
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,520
Fahrenheit

2265
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:45,408
Baloch sides does a wrestling promo

2266
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:47,200
How you talk to all the same people

2267
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:49,504
The military everybody get

2268
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:52,832
The sky is real but its incremental

2269
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,880
It didn't happen like it was

2270
01:35:55,136 --> 01:36:00,256
Oh you're even named checking sky.

2271
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:02,560
Ever try

2272
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,584
This plan

2273
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,608
They're All Dead

2274
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,152
Okay

2275
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:20,480
On one level Alex is a

2276
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:24,832
Child living in a bizarre fantasy world full of Espionage and ins-and-outs

2277
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:28,672
And to that extent this is the sort of rhetoric you should just ignore and move along

2278
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:32,000
More than anything else it's just another example of his big boy violence

2279
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:32,768
Fantasies

2280
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,072
Whoever there's a real danger to this kind of

2281
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:39,936
Thing particularly in times of elevated anxieties like you might find at the beginning of uncertain

2282
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:41,728
Stages of a virus outbreak

2283
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,776
The reality is that this out

2284
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,056
Outbreak

2285
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,360
It's inescapable in the modern world

2286
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:51,456
However Alexander's capable in the modern world true

2287
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:52,736
Brunei living in the

2288
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,016
Ancient world

2289
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,040
Discuss that

2290
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:59,648
However Alex is painted this coronavirus a bioweapon attack by the global

2291
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:00,672
They're hoping

2292
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,464
They can wait out their armored without

2293
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,256
But if they try this

2294
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:07,584
The human spirit is activated in the good guys are going to kill them all

2295
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,144
Right so then we just all

2296
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,680
Here's why this is Dan

2297
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:14,496
The coronavirus is not a bioweapon being

2298
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:15,264
Deployed by the club

2299
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:19,360
However there is a possibility that things will get worse before they get better

2300
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,896
As tensions rise and

2301
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:25,504
Alex and Mike with the audience into a frenzy saying s*** like it's over for Humanity

2302
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,064
The odds of one of his listeners taking him seriously

2303
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:28,832
My Tribe

2304
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:32,672
The definition of who is a globalist is completely arbitrary

2305
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,440
Prairie at this point

2306
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:35,488
But you have the major figures out

2307
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,792
Axios about all the time ranging from the Clint

2308
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,840
Thesaurus to Brian stelter

2309
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:43,168
As the natural progression of the coronavirus plays out

2310
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:48,032
Alex runs a very serious risk of his rhetoric being understood by the more unhinged in his audience

2311
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:51,104
Hugo and Kilby please label does the enemies of humanity

2312
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:55,968
Alex's said a condition for when these people are to be killed which is supervised

2313
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,528
He says when they try to kick this off

2314
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,320
But what the f*** does that mean

2315
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:03,648
They're already tons of cases of coronavirus in a number of countries

2316
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:07,488
And Alex's. We literally said earlier the same episode that the

2317
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,256
The ball have been

2318
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,024
Kicked off

2319
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,560
So that seems to imply that the

2320
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,840
What time is already come

2321
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,632
This game Alex is playing

2322
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:14,656
Profoundly dangerous

2323
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:21,568
It very well may be that his audience is too small and disengage that this point where it now there isn't anyone listening will take him up on

2324
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:22,336
What is advocating

2325
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,384
What you mean that the secondary point

2326
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,432
He's more or less riling up his audience

2327
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,712
Used to kill his imagine.

2328
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,528
The way I hear this is just Alex being

2329
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,064
Clear that he's on his last

2330
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:32,832
Flags

2331
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:34,368
He isn't bringing anybody

2332
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,136
Anyone

2333
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:36,928
Like it was getting radicalized into

2334
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,208
Conspiracy theory ship

2335
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:41,792
There's way too many free options of the same kind of content he's

2336
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:44,352
Providing there's no real Prospect of him growing

2337
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,120
In the future

2338
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,424
He's hitched his wagon to a present to do

2339
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,960
Impeach the new just loose

2340
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:49,984
Restrictions on the

2341
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:50,752
The chemical Alex

2342
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,544
About for a decade's that's gone

2343
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,312
Kind of embarrassing

2344
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,336
He's only

2345
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:58,432
His once remarkable conspiracy kingdom is dust

2346
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,992
Is anger and resentment about it is being expressed

2347
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,016
Bayou Sharpay

2348
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:04,832
Increase in the violent rhetoric towards is imagined enemies

2349
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:07,136
In blood conversations about their murder

2350
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,160
Which is not

2351
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,440
Surprising

2352
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:11,488
But is really dangerous

2353
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:14,048
Chris as it as a trend I think people should be

2354
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,072
You know I think

2355
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,352
I think it's worth

2356
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:23,008
Take me at least a little seriously it is kind of dangerous when people who've spent their entire life

2357
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,288
A pug and Isaac

2358
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,568
Projections of

2359
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:27,872
Basically themselves onto imagine

2360
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:28,640
Figures

2361
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,664
When they start

2362
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,688
Projecting

2363
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:32,480
The end of the world because

2364
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:38,880
Their own careers aren't going so well

2365
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,648
Soul

2366
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,416
Loosely

2367
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:43,488
Tied to Alex's World being a revocable

2368
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:46,560
Probably

2369
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:53,216
Anyway Mike's got one last thing to say before he shuffles on down the road to tend to his llamas or over the

2370
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:57,824
The f*** he does not anything to do with health issues

2371
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:59,616
But man like listen to this b*******

2372
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:01,664
Last thing to mention you know this big

2373
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,456
Explosion in Houston

2374
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,504
This chemical

2375
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:08,832
Exploded entire neighborhoods have been destroyed the police are telling people

2376
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:11,392
Look for body parts up to a mile away okay

2377
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,440
What we talked about

2378
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:16,000
Sleeper cells being activated I don't know if

2379
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,560
Could be payback for the soleimani

2380
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,584
Play strike this could be

2381
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,728
Extremis sleeper cells activating we need to we need to see if that's the case

2382
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,264
But Houston was one of the key targets

2383
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,568
What may be happening we need to research further

2384
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:34,432
Well there's no doubt that that's a Target and we should cover that alright

2385
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:36,992
What the f***

2386
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:38,528
Insane person

2387
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,320
That is crazy has

2388
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:43,904
No that crazy insane this was Friday that explosion happen

2389
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:44,928
And on Friday

2390
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,696
He has

2391
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:48,768
No reason why is involved

2392
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:51,584
Payback for soleimani for sleeper cells

2393
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,864
There is no reason

2394
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:53,888
Suspect that

2395
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,936
He has nothing to go on this is

2396
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:58,752
Purely his imagination

2397
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:01,312
Keep this up as something like a possibility

2398
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:03,616
Did you say we go to research this further

2399
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:08,480
What I hear that all I hear is like hey I was what do you think about this narrative

2400
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:12,832
A good because

2401
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,368
At that point to say anything

2402
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,672
Sandy Hook with sleeper

2403
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:17,696
Versailles by Iran

2404
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,744
Preemptively

2405
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,048
Fighting us back for sulemani

2406
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,328
That's terrible

2407
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:24,864
We got to guess

2408
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:27,168
Was that now that Mike Adams is gone

2409
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,192
We have a guest

2410
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:29,472
Do we have not heard

2411
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:31,008
Hide nor hair up

2412
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,288
Leo zagami

2413
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,824
He's been on

2414
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,616
More recently than this guy

2415
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,664
I'll tell you a couple things about it

2416
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:42,016
You like to hide in bushes

2417
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:45,600
Well joining us down if we could him holding this week

2418
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,368
Genre

2419
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:50,976
Portray patriots.com

2420
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:53,536
Rob Ford still living

2421
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,816
I will be goddamn

2422
01:41:55,328 --> 01:42:00,448
I'm not sure if you still following us on Twitter but so I can set up

2423
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:04,288
The picture is no longer sitting there but I don't know if it's

2424
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,312
Hanging up it's a

2425
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:08,384
Angle might be different room than alright okay

2426
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:12,224
I'm so it says I'm clear

2427
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,248
Outlook

2428
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,040
We know that there's some

2429
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,064
Knowledge of us

2430
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,880
But the only thing that I want to come of that

2431
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,160
Is just for John rap

2432
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,208
Forward to finally hang up that f****** b****

2433
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:24,000
He might have

2434
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,536
And he announces a torso

2435
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:31,936
Says something Auto Show guy that would get me so much joy it's been a very long time since we've seen John Ray

2436
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,216
Rapoport

2437
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,752
I know also known as Batman

2438
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,824
He is

2439
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,128
F******

2440
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:42,944
Like insane

2441
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,480
Just Medical

2442
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:48,320
Denial

2443
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:50,368
So when there is a pandemic

2444
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:51,392
Type mood

2445
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:57,792
When there's a there's an outbreak situation of course you go call up

2446
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:00,096
No more fake lews.com

2447
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:04,960
There's two things that are in

2448
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:09,312
The first thing is the John Skype I don't know what's going on it doesn't seem to be working

2449
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:13,664
But the second thing is that does not surprise me interview is very not

2450
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,944
Much about

2451
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,736
The virus of course

2452
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:17,760
Of course

2453
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,296
It takes on

2454
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,320
School lunches

2455
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,088
Nope

2456
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:23,904
It's about Alex needing Jon rappoport to reassure him

2457
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:31,584
I have had a theory for quite a while and I've brought this up on the show then I think that John Rappaport has hypnotized out

2458
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,376
Neuro-linguistic

2459
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,144
Programming

2460
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:35,424
And has Alex

2461
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,240
Exynos like some sort of a weird state where whenever he

2462
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,776
He comes on Alex

2463
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,056
Guy gets into

2464
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:43,360
F***** up mood

2465
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,896
Halex darts

2466
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,688
What did real emotional

2467
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,224
It starts talking about like

2468
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,808
Let's talk about the spiritual Dimension John Rappaport

2469
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:55,136
This guy is

2470
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:59,232
All this b******* about to fake science yet

2471
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:03,072
Spiritual

2472
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,352
But from the beginning

2473
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,632
It does not work out

2474
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,912
Because his

2475
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:07,680
Like I said

2476
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:09,216
Rapport Skype is working

2477
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,240
And so

2478
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:13,056
You'll hear this clip Alex tries to ask him

2479
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,336
A question it doesn't work

2480
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,128
And then wrapped Porter starts van

2481
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:17,664
The Gestalt

2482
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,200
Prime computation

2483
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:21,760
Are we right now what are the globalist

2484
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,136
Alex I can't hear you

2485
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,208
Well we're doing some

2486
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:33,792
More training today I'm not sure why

2487
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,632
Where we are as a culture in a space station RAV4

2488
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,008
Are we talking

2489
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,872
Try to push you into doing some

2490
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:48,640
Something that you would know

2491
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:53,248
That is not an answer to the question that was asked

2492
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,016
I think that is

2493
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:56,576
Clearly John RAV4 being like well I better just talk

2494
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,112
About something I like it

2495
01:44:58,368 --> 01:45:03,488
I like Jon rappoport his willingness to just jump in there can you imagine how many other

2496
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,536
I had that exact.

2497
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:09,632
Like Rapport nose like well I better just start saying something

2498
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:15,520
He starts rambling a bit and this leads into a conversation about how the globalist

2499
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,544
Do they do is they

2500
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,312
Trick you into

2501
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:20,128
The thinking that all good is evil and all evil is good

2502
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:20,896
They're so good

2503
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,224
We're going to show you the opposite of everything

2504
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,760
The way it actually is

2505
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,808
Convince you that this is so

2506
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,344
Show everything you saw

2507
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,368
Good actually

2508
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,392
Turns out to be evil

2509
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,672
And everything you saw

2510
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,696
Receival actually

2511
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,720
Turns out to be good

2512
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,512
What do you know about that

2513
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:39,840
This is now the Brave New World and isn't it wonderful

2514
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:42,400
This is college dorm level s***

2515
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:47,776
Arab Sports out here trying to blow people's mind saying the globalist tell you everything good is bad

2516
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:49,824
Denver things

2517
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:53,408
Everything you've been told the true it is true but the reverse

2518
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,432
Wake up right

2519
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,736
Right so it's kind of like if

2520
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,016
You

2521
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,552
Spent all of your time

2522
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,600
Screaming about this chemical and how it's

2523
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:02,624
Destroy you

2524
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,160
And the government then says

2525
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:06,208
No actually it's good for more of

2526
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:10,304
Is that is that everything evil is bad maybe

2527
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:12,864
I kind of just whenever I hear this

2528
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:16,704
Sort of mentality I always think like it's not a loser's game

2529
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,240
Because if you

2530
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,056
Trying to get you on my team right

2531
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:22,336
Like a man

2532
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,104
Freak out

2533
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:24,896
Everything you've been told

2534
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:25,920
Is not true

2535
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:27,200
Everything everything

2536
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:28,992
Literally every

2537
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,016
Holy

2538
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,552
Now if I were to

2539
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,600
Try picture this to you and you

2540
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:34,624
Take it in like

2541
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:35,904
Know what things are

2542
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,440
I have been lied to

2543
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:39,488
Wouldn't that make you more

2544
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:40,256
Prone to

2545
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,024
Question me

2546
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,816
We going to like what

2547
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:46,144
Well, I think my next question would be

2548
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,192
Okay

2549
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:50,496
So everything is inverted

2550
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,032
Everything bad is good okay

2551
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,568
Okay so how about murder is that good

2552
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:55,616
Well the problem

2553
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:57,920
Okay so okay then how about

2554
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:06,368
How about the taste of oranges are those still sour or those sweet know you got to take those the tastebud LSD

2555
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:07,904
Okay

2556
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:08,672
Jersey the truth

2557
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:10,720
That's god dammit

2558
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:11,488
I bet

2559
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,256
That's the other thing

2560
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:16,352
2 is like obviously it's not a blanket everything

2561
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:20,960
What you're doing is you're trying to use this as a rhetorical device

2562
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:25,312
People out of their Slumber and what you have to do then is really quickly

2563
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:27,616
Them to like take your worldview

2564
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:30,176
Because the longer that they stay in that

2565
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,200
Questioning state

2566
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:35,040
The more likely it is to like look at what you're doing to be like wait that's bulshit

2567
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:35,808
22

2568
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:42,464
So it's okay that you're telling me divorce been a massive conspiracy that has lied to me my entire life and everything that I believe is

2569
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,744
Actually the inverse

2570
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,280
And you are telling me this

2571
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,584
Why would I believe you

2572
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,120
It's a means by which

2573
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,400
Like you could maybe

2574
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,936
Create an opening the

2575
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:53,472
You can get people in with

2576
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:55,008
But it's not a

2577
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:59,616
Not accurate and you got any but you got to do to me but I believe you

2578
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,920
Because I don't have I have your best

2579
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:04,224
Well they say that they have my messenger

2580
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:08,064
Yeah but you can believe me because better than you have to Jerk Hut in

2581
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:11,904
So in the middle of his interview with rapapara

2582
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:17,536
Alex gets update from Norm pattice about Owen Shroyer is legal situation

2583
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:20,352
And I don't keep this in because it end

2584
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:21,120
Itsfunneh

2585
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,216
Everyone

2586
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:25,984
Litigation

2587
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:26,752
What event

2588
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:28,800
To find out who gave the order for his arrest

2589
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:32,896
Means now that no one will ever before

2590
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:33,664
To answer that

2591
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:34,944
Questions

2592
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,224
To bring civil litigation

2593
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,504
False arrest

2594
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:43,904
You know what else would have come out in that trial is that he was arrest

2595
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:47,232
Stayed because he was advertising on Capitol grounds

2596
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:51,840
Have to decide whether that's worth doing is

2597
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:53,376
Tell me this

2598
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:55,424
Infowars audience

2599
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:58,496
Was more important than Alex Jones are on Troy

2600
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:04,128
Synergy credit

2601
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:10,784
You bankroll. I can sit atop lawyer bankroll. So I can put on there

2602
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:17,184
Money did all this to understand that for store.com I want that

2603
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:20,256
Money for War I want that money to fight time

2604
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:24,608
Give me your money and I swear I'll wait at

2605
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:28,448
Lemoore weather

2606
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:30,752
Give me your money and I will pull off

2607
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:33,056
Embarrassing and impotent public

2608
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:36,896
Spectacle

2609
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:38,432
To advertise my s***

2610
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:40,992
To begin with I would like a better return on

2611
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,272
Yeah it's not great

2612
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,320
So we get back to Rapaport

2613
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,600
Alex

2614
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:49,952
And there's that you know there's a little bit of talk about medical stuff but it's really just like

2615
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:50,720
Anti-vax

2616
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:53,024
Nonsense of course

2617
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:59,424
Your run-of-the-mill and Evac stuff either goodnight weirdo

2618
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,984
They're going to kill you they're going to turn you into a

2619
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,776
Can you record our satanic

2620
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,824
Is the struggle all about

2621
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:08,896
Vaccines

2622
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:11,456
Abortion vaccinations sent destroying the health

2623
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:12,224
For the body

2624
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:13,248
Side group

2625
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,528
You must let us

2626
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,808
Something in you

2627
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:19,136
When we already have all our ancestors and what we are together

2628
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,928
What

2629
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:21,952
What are you saying

2630
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:25,024
Human race is all about

2631
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,560
It's about survival

2632
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,120
Shabazz about missing women

2633
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:30,912
Choosing each other

2634
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:38,848
I got to get some company that's gross

2635
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:40,128
And we're just supposed to trust him

2636
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,712
It's Satanism to get shots I guess

2637
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:44,480
Is a family

2638
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:52,416
Is Alex one of these guys who thinks all medicine is evil then is that what he said it has to be it cuz they're just some

2639
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,440
Some things that like

2640
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:55,488
You don't have the antibodies

2641
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:56,768
To fight you don't

2642
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:57,536
Then if

2643
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,560
You don't have those

2644
01:50:58,816 --> 01:50:59,584
They can kill you

2645
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:03,936
Is that what he say I guess so cuz that's

2646
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:10,336
Messed up I mean it isn't that kind of it anytime somebody's like the the story of the human race their history is survive

2647
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:12,640
That's somebody who's signaling

2648
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:15,200
The people who didn't survive deserve.

2649
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:19,552
Can I bring clear that they don't believe in like survival of the fittest evolution

2650
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:25,952
No no absolutely no I don't know what they're saying even survival of the fittest so long as it does

2651
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:28,512
Doesn't involve Evolution they just want the bad one

2652
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:34,400
Out I guess you should have been dead anyway it's very weird only the genetically perfect

2653
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:38,752
Survive they're saying they're all humans are

2654
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:39,520
If that's fair

2655
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,312
It's very weird this perspective is

2656
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,080
It's strange

2657
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:44,640
It'll be hard to defend in a PhD kind

2658
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,408
Setting

2659
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:47,200
I started to think about like

2660
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:47,968
Why

2661
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:54,624
Is this the mentality that they have and then Rappaport starts talkin and I realize that might be why

2662
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,696
You have been a Pioneer in warning about exit

2663
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:01,024
Is that a thing you can be

2664
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,048
For me in college

2665
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:03,072
Actually

2666
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,352
19 6

2667
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,632
5758

2668
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:07,936
Mission College

2669
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:09,728
Sing came down the pipeline called

2670
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:12,032
Slough one winter

2671
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,568
I had no idea what they were

2672
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:14,336
We talked about

2673
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:16,384
Everybody's got to get a vaccine

2674
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,432
Otherwise she

2675
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:19,456
When you get sick

2676
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,504
And I thought to myself

2677
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:23,296
I'm not getting

2678
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:24,576
I'm not going

2679
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:26,624
To get sick are they crazy

2680
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,184
Talking about I mean I don't know why I react

2681
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:29,952
Did that way

2682
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:33,024
I didn't get sets not good enough

2683
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:34,304
Got sick

2684
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:35,840
And I started

2685
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:37,632
Develop this stealing

2686
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:39,424
Feces

2687
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,960
People are doing some

2688
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:43,264
Violin

2689
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:44,288
Strain

2690
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:46,080
Perversion

2691
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:49,664
They're trying to make us normal as

2692
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,504
And it's completely cover

2693
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:59,904
You are very weird John Rappaport why I could realize too that if he was in college in 1950s

2694
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,440
7 he's 80 years old

2695
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:05,792
He's a very idea

2696
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:08,864
That is true he still has some salt and pepper there that's why

2697
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:11,936
Mostly grape

2698
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:14,752
I have a very hard time gauging people's ages

2699
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:17,056
I just generally speaking and

2700
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,848
Good good on you

2701
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:21,152
Yeah anyway what's on that

2702
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:21,920
Picture

2703
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:25,248
Maybe a picture of Jon rappoport

2704
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:30,112
Tell you that the end of the flu of 1957

2705
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:34,208
Talk about the Asian flu between one and two million people worldwide

2706
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,512
It's a very serious situation

2707
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:41,632
By the summer of 1957 and it reached the United States and in March 1958

2708
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:43,936
An estimated 69800

2709
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:45,728
People have been killed by it in America

2710
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:50,848
Rapoport decided not to get a vaccine and he got lucky that he didn't catch that flu but his it

2711
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,408
Exactly zero importance

2712
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,176
In terms of sine

2713
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,760
This is his backstory that he's presented when he's called

2714
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:59,808
Leader in the field of denying vaccines

2715
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,624
He was a dumb dumb in college you didn't want to get a vaccine

2716
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,184
He didn't catch the flu and other people did

2717
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,976
That's not how science works

2718
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:09,792
That's a really bad style of thinking to hear

2719
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:12,096
Someone pretending to be involved in the field of science

2720
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:15,680
There's a dumb dumb undergraduate who thinks they're already a genius.

2721
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:18,496
Not somebody who study the actual

2722
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,288
All of these guys

2723
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,592
Alex Rappaport Mike Adams

2724
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:25,152
You scratch beneath the surface on them just a little bit

2725
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,712
One time I uncle got

2726
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:33,088
Wheatley unwarranted and unearned oppositional

2727
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:33,856
Defiance

2728
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:36,672
For no reason Rapaport didn't want to get a vaccine

2729
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:40,000
It worked out for him and now everything the man says is opposite

2730
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:41,280
It's all opposite

2731
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:43,328
Mike Adams is out there telling everyone that

2732
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:45,632
The opposite of what the World Health Organization says

2733
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:47,424
The truth is true all the time

2734
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:50,240
These aren't experts breakdown secret wisdom

2735
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:52,800
Their children who haven't yet grown out of throwing 10

2736
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:54,592
Yeah that's what this is

2737
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,384
This is very clear

2738
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,408
You can't

2739
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,432
That's

2740
01:54:58,688 --> 01:55:01,760
That's the fun is not a fundamental misunderstanding

2741
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:02,528
They have abs

2742
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:04,576
Addendum and the

2743
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:05,344
The like

2744
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:09,952
No it's science is all about skepticism and all that stuff and it's like yeah but it

2745
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:11,232
It's not about skepticism

2746
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:12,768
Because you know a guy

2747
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:14,560
One thing happened to one time

2748
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:19,680
Or because you personally didn't get a vaccine one time and turned out fine

2749
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:20,704
That's not

2750
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:25,824
Skepticism isn't confirming the opposite it's not just automatically

2751
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:26,848
Assuming

2752
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:29,152
Whatever is said to you is a lie

2753
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:29,920
That's

2754
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:31,456
That's equally Steel

2755
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,736
Unreal

2756
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,552
That somebody would say that out loud

2757
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,088
And not bother to lie

2758
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:42,464
You got to have something better than port

2759
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,488
Sometime I didn't get

2760
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:46,816
Spell obviously all vaccines are lies

2761
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:49,120
Stay in the damn bushes Rapaport

2762
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:51,168
So now at this point

2763
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:52,960
Things get weird

2764
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:59,360
I don't have a board no more thing news.com is here with us in defiance of their thing

2765
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:05,760
John Let's Get metaphysical termination segment

A Woodward

2770
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:24,704
I know you did some great investigative journalism but I want to talk to you about spirituality

2771
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:28,032
So Roberts not complaining about Hollywood

2772
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:32,640
Scoresby of course this clip is so funny

2773
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:35,200
It's just in complaining about Hollywood

2774
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:37,760
Response

Superheroes in the world and so on

2781
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,512
It's acting

2782
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:49,792
And you say what do you think

2783
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:50,560
Think about this

2784
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:54,400
Don't you realize that she holding that yeah but I

2785
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:56,704
I can't say any why can't you saying

2786

I'm going to lose my position

2787
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,824
Work in this town again

2788
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:05,920
Who is he talking to in Hollywood

2789
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:06,944

Who is Robert Downey jr. talking to you of course I have no answer for that but the answer is

2792
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:14,624
Drugs

2793
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:17,440
Lowering their own Consciousness protest

2794
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,976
Standing there somebody else

2795
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:23,584
Their job coming robots

2796
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:26,656
Becoming robots

2797
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:27,936
People who are robots

2798
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:31,008
X

2799
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:32,288
You have

2800
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,312
For example

2801
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:36,128
I don't know a million people

2802
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:38,688
Independent country or its territory

2803
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:41,504
The circle

2804
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,064
In the circle it just keeps

2805
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:44,832
Sean going

2806
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:46,112
We're all together

2807
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:46,880
Because

2808
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:48,928
I'm looking at you and you're looking at

2809
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:51,232
And we both know that we're complicit

2810
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:56,608
It could be gigantic

2811
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:57,376
It could be

2812
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:58,400
100 million

2813
01:57:58,912 --> 01:57:59,424
Ellen Show on

2814
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:02,240
It could be more

2815
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:04,288
Oreo cookies

2816
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:13,760
Jean-Claude told her this is what it's all about

2817
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,808
Somebody like Bob Dylan

2818
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:19,136
Really

2819
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:26,304
You're going to join a call we advised that there are called to join

2820
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,072
What

2821
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:30,912
And just rails off also rebuttal

2822
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:34,496
No you don't you got to join a cult

2823
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:35,776
Nope nope

2824
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:41,664
Americana Patriot called

2825
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:43,200
Nope

2826
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:46,784
You look at these guys on the screen and they're they're superheroes

2827
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,088
Throwing hammers all over the place

2828
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:49,856
And then you talk

2829
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:53,184
Chris Hemsworth in real life and he doesn't want to say s*** about

2830
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:56,768
Guard Amendment Hammer right

2831
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:57,536
Yeah

2832
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:58,560
Okay

2833
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:03,680
You're very smart this is the high spiritual plateau

2834
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:08,288
You see so many people in Hollywood they don't even

2835
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:09,568
Robots.txt

2836
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:10,848
Robot

2837
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:14,432
Rapoport we have reached

2838
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:17,760
Rarefied

2839
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:19,808
This plateau of wisdom this

2840
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:22,624
It's all about Rappaport

2841
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,696
I don't understand loyalty

2842
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,256
This is so weird

2843
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:29,280
Why would you

2844
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:34,656
We have this conversation at your medical iron

2845
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:36,448
Anyway they start talking about the

2846
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,752
Of this is a secret with all of my being

2847
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:41,312
The devil.

2848
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:45,920
System tells you you could be powerful you can be amazing you that I'm all these dreams

2849
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:47,712
I put a mirror in front of your face

2850
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,552
For your entire potential in forward

2851
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:55,904
Shore show you your soul it says I will give you your soul

2852
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:56,928
Follow me

2853
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:00,000
That great vision is giving you is the potential

2854
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:06,400
You already have that if you give it to Satan you lose your already made in the image

2855
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:11,776
You're already Divine in God's will you already have all this potential

2856
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:14,336
Taking you to give it power

2857
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:15,872
To control you

2858
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:17,408
Because you believe

2859
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:18,432
That it's

2860
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:19,712
Giving you that

2861
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:20,992
Power

2862
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:23,040
When God made you that way

2863
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:25,088
Didn't give it to you made you

2864
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:26,880
But your Freewill your maid

2865
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,512
You're a Madman you're a Madwoman and they're trying to steal

2866
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:34,816
That's the most frustrating thing

2867
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:37,632
Watching people sign away their Birthright

2868
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:40,960
Never they've got to these these midget Gremlins

2869
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:42,240
Older

2870
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:45,056
Then eyes and they're they're in placing themselves

2871
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:46,336
In front of our vision

2872
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:47,616
Exactly

2873
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:56,832
He kind of it you got to be trained real well to listen to that

2874
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:57,600
Exactly

2875
02:00:58,624 --> 02:00:59,648
You got to have that

2876
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:05,024
Plug-in loaded in your back pocket Rapaport study that

2877
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:07,072
I don't know what research is

2878
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:10,400
Medical Science a is doing to

2879
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,936
You did come down on

2880
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:15,264
Double mirror strategy I'm always amazed

2881
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:16,544
At

2882
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,080
Just how

2883
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:22,432
The devil and God both to be both seem to be egg

2884
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:24,736
Exactly as stupid as one Alex

2885
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:27,552
They never seem to be Beyond his

2886
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:28,576
Intelligent

2887
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:33,440
It's strange it is to be like an ethical and unknowable on account of

2888
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:36,512
Nope creating University of Texas

2889
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:38,048
You okay

2890
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:43,424
There's a trend that I see throughout a lot of Jon rappoport appearances and I've talked about this in the past

2891
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,704
And that is that Alex

2892
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,240
Often seems to have

2893
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:49,312
Breakdowns whenever rap Horton

2894
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:52,384
Therapy from Rapaport

2895
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,688
Can't get himself to go talk

2896
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:57,248
Talk to somebody needs help

2897
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:59,552
And somehow Rapoport is like

2898
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:03,648
The outlet for it I think it has to do with I mean

2899
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:06,464
It's funny to call it in

2900
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:12,864
Be the reason that Alex looks like a wizard

2901
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:19,264
Obviously this guy looks like f****** Gandalf right and he's doing some kind of a mind-meld on it

2902
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:24,128
Galax feel better whatever he talks to RAV4 it

2903
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:25,408
This clip

2904
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:27,968
Just feel like this is like an excerpt from therapy

2905
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:28,736
God

2906
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:30,784
These free will show how do you

2907
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:32,576
Open yourself up to God

2908
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:37,184
But not the bad stuff and just say cousin people open yourself to God you and jacket insulated

2909
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:38,720
Connect to it

2910
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:41,536
Iron do it but the point is

2911
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,120
The David

2912
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,448
How did people begin that Journey

2913
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:53,312
Charged you do that

2914
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:59,712
Either you recognize that

2915
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:00,480
Your

2916
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:02,272
You're an individual

2917
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:03,808
You're not

2918
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:05,600
Existing by virtue of the fact

2919
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:07,392
Your

2920
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:11,744
Two other things and people and so forth that's not the

2921
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:14,816
The source of your exact

2922
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:16,352
Facebook Goldman Sachs

2923
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:19,168
You need you

2924
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:20,704
If you start there

2925
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:22,240
You're going to go on

2926
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:23,008
On the path

2927
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:29,408
See what's going on in Alex comes in with this weird question about like how do you let God in without letting all this

2928
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,176
Southern stuffing

2929
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:33,248
Rapoport takes that question and refocus

2930
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:34,016
This is a tour

2931
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:35,808
It being about individualism

2932
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:37,088
Love you need you

2933
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:37,856
And Alex

2934
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:39,392
Take something from me

2935
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:40,160
And then

2936
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:41,696
Rapoport reaffirms

2937
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:45,024
This is very similar to how like a conversation with a therapist

2938
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:49,888
This reminds me that weird bulshit

2939
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:53,472
Putting it in terms that are like almost usable almost

2940
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:56,544
And then feeling like yes Alex

2941
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:04,224
It reminds me more of hearing about somebody else's therapy like-like Rapoport is giving Alex

2942
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:10,112
Advise that his therapist just gave him a little bit ago

2943
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:10,880
With Entertainer

2944
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:12,672
Who been through the f******

2945
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:14,720
Crisis Millie well you know

2946
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:17,280
I just I just realized I need to refocus on me

2947
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:20,608
But I don't know

2948
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:22,400
It's not annoying but

2949
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:25,472
Well it's annoying to me as well to be certainly

2950
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,240
Not a show

2951
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,080
Interview

2952
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:32,384
Supposed to be a medical

2953
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,152
Expert

2954
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:34,432
About what

2955
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:36,224
The devil's mirror

2956
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:38,272
Right right

2957
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:41,600
Right I made it over

2958
02:04:42,624 --> 02:04:43,648
I forgot about that

2959
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:45,440
I forgot that were passed

2960
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:49,280
We're both Ubud how old is just completely Reckless

2961
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:51,328
One last clip

2962
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,352
And it's just like

2963
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:57,984
I just feel like this is addictive like some sort of a brain control the report has on Alex

2964
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:02,592
John report you got to come on more than once every 6 months please come back on next week we love you

2965
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:07,200
Walmart.com your beautiful soul we love you John beloved on report thank you so much

2966
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:15,136

2967
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:16,416
Praise that love you

2968
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:19,232

2969
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,000

I love you so

2971
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:22,560
God dammit

2972
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:24,352
Are you alive

2973
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:25,632
Drift

2974
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:28,704
SeaWorld never heard Alex

2975
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:29,984
Say goodbye to a

2976
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:32,288
Guest like that sort of

2977
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:36,640
Chuck Rappaport that is like

2978
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:38,176
It's otherworldly

2979
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:43,040
John sometimes I just don't want to be one of the lone survivors vanities over but I'd

2980
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:47,904
Just I just don't maybe I should die with it to Alex's individualist

2981
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:53,536
You know you're right there is only one in Lone Survivor on my God I love your job

2982
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,632
Weird

2983
02:05:57,888 --> 02:06:00,448
I'm on here it's nice to see you again

2984
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:06,848
Positive

2985
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:14,272
It's it's really weird because I remember that being something that I'd sort of

2986
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:20,928
Ayodhya theorized that there is connection between these two and their interviews

2987
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:21,696
Sometimes

2988
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:23,488
Tend to Veer towards like Alex

2989
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:26,048
Needing help Rapport being there to help her

2990
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,352
And I also think

2991
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:29,888
But

2992
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:32,192
Just

2993
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:33,216
There is

2994
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:36,544
It's so weird

2995
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,568
This episode

2996
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:41,664
She's so weird there's more lies hoaxes mouth

2997
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,688
The Coronavirus

2998
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:43,968
There's Mike Adams

2999
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:46,528
Declaring the end of humanity

3000
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:49,600
John goddamn replicating weird

3001
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:54,464
F***** up I think John has become the emotional Center of Infowars that I'm just going to go out

3002
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:57,024
Mike Adams is to apocalypse

3003
02:06:57,536 --> 02:07:02,400
Alex that you obsessed with God and put in there for the individual is

3004
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:05,728
The monologue yeah but also it makes sense that he's the heart

3005
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:08,032
Cancel of invoice it is much as

3006
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:09,312
He's f****** absent

3007
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:14,944
Is there once every 6 months

3008
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:19,040
So anyway we will be back

3009
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:22,368
Another episode but until then

3010
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,928

With these aliases

3017
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:42,848
I feel like an honor

3018
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:43,872
Of Alex's love

3019
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:46,432
We should probably end this by saying

3020
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:48,736
Go f*** yourself Joshua
