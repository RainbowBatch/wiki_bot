2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648

3
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Nick.com

4
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
Sit around and talk a little bit about Alex

5
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,912
Jordan

6
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,520
Danny ever hear of a little country called France

7
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
You ever hear of a little game called tennis

8
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
Como esta

9
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
Just like last year but you remember I told you about last year and how they played the most amazing third-set ever in the

10
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,608
I got injured and it was so sad

11
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
Sure

12
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,288
Write the opposite happened this time right they played the most amazing tennis ever and then they kept playing the most amazing

13
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Time to sever

14
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
And then Rafa

15
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,736
Play the most amazing time this ever end up with reanimated

16
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
I mean

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
That sounds like

18
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
Some great

19
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,768
Well I'm happy for you is really fun and enjoyable

20
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,352
That's great, great to get there

21
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
Same look at me summon things

22
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,104
I put it on my like a radio professional hat

23
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
Alright

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
The top 40 I'm having

25
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,808
A difficulty coming up with a bright spot necessarily so I'm going to say

26
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
Is going to be controversial

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,368
Frozen waffles

28
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Frozen waffle

29
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,440
Yes Frozen waffle I had a broken

30
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
Toaster for quite a while

31
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,560
No I had not been able to toast

32
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
And I just recently

33
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
We got a new

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,216
Toaster oven and one of the things that I was like this in a while

35
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
Frozen waffle

36
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,544
How about it

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
Frozen waffles

38
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,456
And you know what is like a sandwich

39
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
You can make a brick

40
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
The sandwich 100 absolutely

41
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
Works as a great bread

42
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
Underrated

43
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:12,256
Also thank you to everybody who explained to me that sucks things are called a Ramekin break

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,704
Such an aggressive response Chumbawamba

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
Oh my God people will die on

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
Really took it on the chin on that one

47
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,040
So thank you everybody I know it's a Google Ramekin

48
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
Lynx

49
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,720
Jordan about May 25th

50
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
2022 episode on Wednesday

51
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
Cuz I kind of wanted a little bit more clarity

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
About stuff

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,288
Why I felt like we still really had

54
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,592
Are feet on Shaky Ground

55
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,432
In terms of knowing a lot of the concrete details about the

56
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
The police response about the actual Circle

57
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Shooting

58
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,904
I don't think we have that bill

59
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,720
The ground is shaking around us right

60
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,559
But we can't we can't really put things off too much longer

61
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
And in terms of underwear

62
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
You know

63
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
Optional episode on Wednesday

64
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,287
Got it got to go to work

65
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
So what what I'm thinking

66
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,895
And I actually thought it was taking her out this idea anyway

67
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,223
Things down a little bit

68
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,575
Take a look at this time more completely I think

69
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,135
Especially this. Where these reports

70
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Coming out

71
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,951
About the Bruno

72
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
Contradictory

73
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
The police are making

74
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,095
Is coverage over the course of it

75
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,447
We can see any kind of nuance or details that go on in his coverage

76
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
Yeah it is it is interesting to see how he

77
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
He would react

78
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,823
To each change in the store

79
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,223
Not in any particular rush to figure out what he said yesterday or you know talk about

80
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,343
I think this this could be a good exercise of our our time and

81
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:19,487
Eventually we might get to the point where you have concrete information about the police

82
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,583
Interesting

83
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
It's a good choice just because

84
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Alex

85
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,727
Has to come out immediately knowing everything that there is to know

86
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,519
You think and then

87
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:38,687
The story's going to change so he has to come out and immediately know everything about that and then the story is going to change again we have to come out of me

88
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,735
At least there's no way he can keep his b*******

89
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:47,135
Whatever he has to do as a narrative has to be able to include that somehow or us

90
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
So make it include

91
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,255
Maybe interesting to see

92
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
I think this will be

93
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
Released educational in some form

94
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,519
So today we're just going to be looking at the day after the shooting May 25th

95
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,895
2022

96
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
Do first

97
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:15,551
The middle-aged rat captain from the SS North Korean ballot boat thank you so much

98
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,951
Next legendary creature phyrexian Flash

99
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
At the beginning of your end

100
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
InStep draw seven cards

101
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Each opponent

102
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,839
Maximum hand size is reduced by seven

103
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
Thank you so much you're an alcoholic

104
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,447
Thank you very much

105
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:37,055
Captain Carlos Danger in the crew of the darkslide

106
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
Next I told my mother I was brilliant issues that I was going to hell

107
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
Juvenile policy walk

108
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,879
Thank you very much like to say hello and thank you

109
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
You are now a technocrat

110
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
I'm a policy wonk I have

111
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
Risen above

112
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Miami

113
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
Go take a little break you down

114
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
A little breaking for me

115
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
And then we're going

116
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
To come back

117
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
And I'm going to start the show over

118
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
F*** you

119
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
I got plenty of words for you but

120
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
At the end of the day

121
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
F*** you and your new world order and

122
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
She rode in on

123
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
And all your s***

124
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

125
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
Belle walk out of here tomorrow

126
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
And you never see me again

127
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Really what I want to do

128
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
Back here again

129
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,335
I apologize to the crew in The Listener jester

130
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,919
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

131
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
I'll be better tomorrow

132
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
He's not

133
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,319
Nope you never will be

134
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,671
We start off here and Alex has some interesting

135
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Thoughts

136
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,279
Here's my idea that the shooter didn't act alone

137
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Okay

138
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
But

139
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
Well

140
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
It's a little metaphysical Salvador Ramos

141
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,359
Son of Rome

142
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
Caucasian doesn't matter their Hispanic

143
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
It doesn't matter

144
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
They are black

145
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
All have that shame look

146
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,303
Follow the exact same MO

147
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,119
Have the same criminology behind them

148
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
His friends said that he began

149
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
Several years ago

150
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Called

151
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
He did not act alone

152
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
This evil force

153
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
Text people over

154
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,487
That's I guess Alex has decided that the Uvalde shooter is possessed by demons

155
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,047
Which is being used as an argument that he didn't act alone

156
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,631
So we're we're good solid ground here

157
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
Scraped little sunroom thing is fun but phileas is sun in Latin

158
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
Was Ramos not Romo

159
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:24,223
I do but summerly articles that did say robots

160
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,039
Like all that wild for Alex to have that name

161
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
In his head but

162
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
It was incorrect

163
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:35,231
I'm not as familiar with Latin as I am with Greek but I also don't think it's possible for a noun to be.

164
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,559
Decline the way Alex is making robots man of Rome

165
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
Is not a suffix

166
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
That's used in

167
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
The genitive case which is most

168
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,239
Most commonly used to show possession

169
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Like elves

170
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,103
Son of Rome will generally be expressed as fully as Roma

171
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,735
Anyway Salvador's actually a name that derives from the Spanish and Portuguese for savior

172
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
And Ramos means branch

173
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,183
The point is that Alex is getting

174
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
Send mean son of Satan

175
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
So you can

176
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,303
Shoehorn is insane world you that his enemies are possessed by demons

177
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
Into the coverage

178
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,423
The story on a basic level

179
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,239
It's very hard to deal with the root causes of

180
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:24,639
The things if you believe the root cause of things is the devil right right you believe that there's a

181
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,247
Spira see it of one but it's actually a hundred demons stepmothers

182
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
The inequity of evil

183
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,975
So Alex is some details wrong actually kind of think

184
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,047
That some of this you should have been able to

185
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
To get right

186
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
And so he killed his grandmother

187
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
Aramis just like

188
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,031
His mother with a gun she'd gotten

189
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,991
Just like the left wants to abort the babies

190
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,111
Alex's great last Refuge

191
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
We're comparing everything

192
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
To the evils of his enemy is doing the board

193
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
If

194
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,511
Almost didn't kill his grandmother

195
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
He shot her

196
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
But she survived

197
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,631
She been killed you have to do like

198
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,959
No investigation into the story over the past 24 hours because

199
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,823
Most of the stories even the early ones involved the grandmother calling 911

200
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,431
And she was evacuated the hospital that didn't tell was in early story

201
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
But we see again the standard

202
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,879
Reflection instead of dealing with reality as it is Alex retreats to save her territory that he knows the audience enjoys

203
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,719
Mainly making everything about abortion and attacking his enemies

204
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Because like

205
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,303
Haha this is bad but what about that

206
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
It is

207
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
It is so f******

208
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
Emblematic

209
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
That it is like

210
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
Okay we're going to take something that

211
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Hertz people

212
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,079
Who are crying out who we can see the problem

213
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
And then we're going to

214
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Compare it to something

215
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
Purely abstract

216
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
Just nothing

217
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
Physical just be idea of abortion is

218
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
Is the problem

219
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
Yep

220
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
I think

221
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
Seeing Alex be like a you-know-what

222
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
Ejected as a collaboration

223
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Can because

224
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
It was the devil

225
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,959
I found this to be really kind of distaste

226
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,775
Baseball has basically doing clickbait

227
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
About the shooting

228
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
The day after

229
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,663
Headline the show is Alex Jones will exclusively reveal

230
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
Organization group behind

231
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
This psychotic

232
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Devil

233
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
The organization

234
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,863
There's not there's nothing beyond that other than like

235
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,447
I'm tricking you into thinking that I'm going to report on

236
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
Something like

237
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,311
I have information that there's a group behind this or whatever and then

238
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
Is a bait-and-switch that you just like I hide safe

239
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
There's a shadow organization

240
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
Conspiracy behind this in Surprise

241
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Yeah

242
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
Yeah that's exploitation

243
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,463
Definitely brutal problem

244
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
Mexico

245
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
Yeah the problem with Mexico's

246
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
Devil problem

247
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
The Grim Reaper

248
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Play worship

249
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
Death and brutality

250
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,927
But still dominating and destroying an entire amazing nature

251
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
The same sickness

252
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Mexico

253
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
Other countries around the world

254
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,495
Like what do you propose we do

255
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
Like what do you propose we do for this evening problem

256
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,127
Primor accrual

257
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
I just want people to think about it

258
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
Enterprise on

259
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:21,439
We still have a Satan problem what are you going to do I am going to tell

260
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
Tell people to Double Down

261
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,143
Look I don't mean to impugn religion or anything but people are already praying quite a bit and we have a problem Accord

262
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
Personally with Jude

263
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,615
Propose people to man who make laws to make sure the people are in line with things that aren't

264
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
I don't know about Allah

265
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,599
Ballard comfortable Terrace

266
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Ridiculous

267
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
It's a

268
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,999
Terms of being able to have any conversation

269
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Don't don't don't

270
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
Look at what

271
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Look over here

272
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
The devil the devil

273
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
So Alex has some early

274
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
Misreporting

275
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
He's reporting on

276
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
And I think

277
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
There's an element of this babe

278
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
I mean

279
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
I think

280
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,711
A lot of outlets made the same mistakes

281
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
Is it was harder to fault Alex

282
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,807
For getting this incorrect In Heights

283
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Focus in

284
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
On

285
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Dishes man

286
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
And someone who reportedly killed his grandmother

287
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
Looking for the Border Patrol

288
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
Them

289
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
The building

290
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Camo

291
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,935
This matches some of the early reporting on the story particularly the part about a border patrol agent shooting Ramos

292
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,775
Texas Tribune article about this from the 24th

293
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Quotes

294
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,919
Law Enforcement Officers entered the school building and were met with gunfire from the shooter who was barricaded inside

295
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
A border patrol agent shot the gunman before waiting for backup along for SMUD official told the Associated Press

296
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,159
So these are the pieces of information that are being

297
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,975
Relayed by law enforcement to press

298
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
So it makes sense

299
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:38,399
I think in hindsight there's a lot of reasons to have

300
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Yeah

301
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Some questions

302
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Yeah

303
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
But

304
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:49,407
The dynamic is Alex treating this as an official statement is is totally understandable

305
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,967
This is one of the things that's

306
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,271
Good to highlight is that like

307
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,087
There is a difference between something like this

308
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,927
Something he's wrong about because every reason to be wrong about

309
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
And he's wrong about when he's just making s*** up

310
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
And I think

311
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,911
I think that gets lost sometimes because there are very few instances where he's actually reported on something that is wrong

312
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
Is

313
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
You would have

314
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
It's believed

315
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Bye

316
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Reputable source

317
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,919
Ironically even when he is sticking with the official

318
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Narrative

319
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
He is still wrong

320
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,575
Wild that is amazing even whenever he's trying

321
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
To not be wrong

322
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
He gets even more wrong

323
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:38,559
Information about the police response called into question but based on the available information

324
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
Alex isn't that far off the

325
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,911
That being said he's still totally wrong about the

326
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
The shooting being quick

327
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,263
Even earlier information was clear that it was not a quick thing

328
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,543
Bet same text

329
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,103
Texas Tribune article points out that the shooting began at 11

330
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
132

331
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,687
And the school district tweeted a warning about an actor

332
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
Computer at 12 7

333
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
Yam

334
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
Over 45 MI

335
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
Minutes later

336
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
For some Conte

337
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
Again. It was not like a

338
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,975
No it was a backup but yeah I know

339
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Nope

340
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,887
We have a double problem maybe a solution

341
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,847
We got 40 billion dollars

342
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,223
For money laundering

343
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
More

344
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
We've got the money

345
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Armed police in the schools

346
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
The police

347
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
The options menu

348
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
Suicide yourself

349
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,247
Super cool he's complaining about

350
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
Can't relate that

351
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,391
It's All About Me

352
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Narcissism

353
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,999
Completely Hollow and meaningless

354
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,839
Just a diversion from the point as opposed to actually being a solution

355
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,679
There's two problems with the prescription Alex's yelling about here

356
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
The first is that

357
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
He believes teachers are trying to groom all the

358
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,359
All the students into being lgbtq and even beyond that he thinks the public schools are

359
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:31,455
Tools of the globalist use them to get parents in trouble with a child protect

360
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Conservice

361
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039
Also they teach your kids to hate you and think you were racist

362
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
It doesn't track it all but

363
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
Listen to your position

364
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,719
It's just a way to yell about something that you think could be a distraction

365
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Conversation

366
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
The back on regulation and domestic

367
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Physically violent man

368
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:51,423
The second problem is that money is being sent to Aid Ukraine is from the federal government

369
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:57,311
Is Alex saying that he wants the federal government to arm teachers cuz that seems exactly like something he wouldn't

370
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
What happening

371
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,943
Free singing we can afford to do this by appealing to the ABS sensor Ukraine

372
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:09,343
Almost feels like he's our real point no nope I don't think he believes that these are actually solutions to the

373
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Things that he is.

374
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
No

375
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
I think it's a performance

376
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,767
Of distraction pretty vapid really

377
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
For a while

378
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
I would say

379
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:25,471
We also have just the standard choruses

380
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,751
Don't blame me

381
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:31,103
Oh well it's not my fault right now we have this terrible event

382
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,687
Another person to shoot them up games and other person

383
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
Who killed his grandmother

384
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,575
And then went and did this terrible thing

385
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,671
We are all told we are collect

386
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
How to bleed a Blaine

387
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
For what this

388
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Pomona

389
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
Collectively

390
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:03,103
We went in stop what was happening and got one of himself

391
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
Is it the blame

392
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
He's the good guy

393
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
You didn't do this

394
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,343
But we are to blame for letting Society become this demonic

395
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
How much is it

396
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:23,072
So I wonder how Alex would respond to this rebuttal that I have to his point

397
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,376
About know all the gunrunners aren't

398
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Want to blame

399
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,984
Why is he trying to make all devil-worshipers collectively to blame for the ax

400
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
Hands of one shooter

401
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,664
Are your tongues people at their identify a Satanist to don't commit any violent Acts or doesn't seem like there's something inherently viola

402
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
Ellentube

403
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,248
Like I'm all for not blaming all gun owners

404
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
Because that's sloppy enough productive but

405
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:48,416
I want to know why Alex thinks so wrong Eddie blames all Satanist for the action

406
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
Comes of this one person who Alex

407
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,000
Can't even prove was into satanism

408
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
He was a Satanist

409
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
Nearest blaming the shooting on all satan

410
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,704
Easily prove that the shooter was a gun owner and I'm not blaming all condone

411
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:06,080
Alex's wanders engaging in the inappropriate levels of assigning Collective blame

412
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
Well if you think someone's going to do that

413
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
To you

414
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,296
Regardless of whether or not they do that it's a wiser idea to come back

415
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,392
Aces hard at somebody else with the same bulshit what claiming

416
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,696
You're actually the one who's doing

417
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,768
Do you want to take away someone's First Amendment right

418
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:30,912
To believe in Satanism in order to preserve your Second Amendment right to own a bill

419
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,960
Okay great great great great

420
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,312
Awesome just cuz the Amendments number two doesn't mean it's not number one

421
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
True

422
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,176
So we have on this something we see a lot of times after like

423
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,224
Sort of big events that are kind of do

424
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,528
Difficult for Alex to really talk about a nanny

425
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,368
Organic way like boilerplate

426
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,648
That stuff like

427
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
Teachers share

428
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,208
It's not my fault

429
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,512
Nope not gun owners Baltimore cops

430
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,072
Yeah kind of things you hear all the time

431
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,888
Is it one of the things that Alex will do is

432
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
He will

433
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Take a lot of calls

434
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
Because it's

435
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Workshopping

436
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
Figuring out right like

437
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,848
The colors can say things that

438
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
You want us to take

439
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,784
Responsibility for those things and he can push back on it and then kind of get some points for looking like sometime

440
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,112
Also if somebody says something he likes

441
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,952
He can repeat it as of the game from a high-level Source tomorrow

442
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,280
There's a lot of benefits for taking calls

443
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,304
And boy

444
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
He gets an exciting one pretty early

445
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Alright

446
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,680
I don't want

447
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
Bob

448
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
Teacher work

449
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
With the student

450
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,944
And it says he was special ad says he had a

451
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,272
Speech impediment people make fun of

452
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,368
Because he got so

453
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Demonic

454
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,696
But let's go to

455
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,280
To you I am you are who you say you are this is

456
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,608
Big break here on the shovel to hear from you

457
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
And I believe you but

458
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
I believe you based on nothing

459
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
I'm just going to tell you

460
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:19,200
You are 100% correct I don't even need to say I don't know if

461
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
Seeing any reporting

462
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,296
That he necessarily wasn't in a special education

463
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Glasses

464
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
What Alex is referring to is that he had a

465
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,720
Starter and a lisp apparently that people had mocked

466
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
That

467
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,792
Kids are cruel

468
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,632
But that does not necessarily mean that he was in any special education

469
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
Program he may have been

470
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,472
I don't know that but from

471
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,800
Many of the articles that I've read That's not necessarily something that

472
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Come up

473
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,872
Yeah I don't excluded as possible

474
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Definitely

475
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
This caller

476
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736
Maybe legit

477
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
Maybe not

478
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Alex doesn't know

479
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
But he is

480
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,856
Treat me like it is

481
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,928
Another problem that I have is at this color is very vague

482
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,304
There's not really much to hang your hat on

483
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,008
I'm a longtime listener Alex

484
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,640
This is really hard for me to

485
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
Digest

486
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
All this going on

487
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,296
I've worked with students like that

488
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,136
Poison / 14 different districts

489
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,232
And I seen this counter for one end to the other

490
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
And

491
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
Whatever we might think

492
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,352
You know and you're talkin about an awesome

493
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,400
Texas

494
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
Great District great people

495
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,032
My heart breaks for them

496
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Tina been a teacher for a long time

497
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
And

498
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
I just want to say that

499
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
You know

500
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,992
We work with these kids

501
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
We know who they are

502
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,600
Whenever we went to quarantine

503
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,416
Did it happen all of this country a lot of these kids

504
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
When

505
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Cast

506
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,560
I think that's what we're seeing

507
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:16,192
Did you work with this dude you work with similar students assault them

508
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
Fallout

509
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
No I interacted with him

510
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:26,176
See how he was he's being so vague that Alex has to be like

511
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
What are we talkin about

512
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,272
Are you are you working with him

513
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,624
He says it was a number of years in the past Pacific

514
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Think about that

515
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,464
13 different districts as a teacher

516
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
Special

517
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Education

518
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,048
Teacher apps

519
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:47,680
You know maybe there's a possibility that that's some kind of a like

520
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:52,800
Like consultancy kind of rolls around to different schools I could not like

521
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,384
You're a teacher one-year here they are.

522
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,736
No no reason why you being a bunch of different districts

523
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,784
But there's a position I can imagine that

524
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
If it exists there

525
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,648
But it put that that to me I think they

526
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,464
If you were in that kind of a role where you're in a bunch

527
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
A different District

528
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,584
You probably would have less time intimately knowing the students

529
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
Marriott probably would have

530
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
You're kind of in and out

531
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,240
It seems like you would be I don't

532
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
No

533
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:27,360
1 reasons I don't know cuz it's not specific at all

534
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,432
Say anything and that is that if this is the day after

535
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
He's calling into info

536
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
He is

537
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Yeah

538
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
I mean there's probably

539
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
So Alex

540
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
He's like

541
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
Okay we're coming up on the end of the

542
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,976
The first hour here and 1 second hour begin

543
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,792
Is that hole like little time where no one's listening

544
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
I'm going to put you on hold for that

545
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Alright

546
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,592
Will you hold

547
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
Yessir

548
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,136
Please don't hang up Matthew

549
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
Utah

550
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,512
All because we don't do this

551
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,072
We are barely in the black

552
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
More bills

553
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,568
Oh man I'm not mad

554
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,104
For I guess Dave

555
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,664
Came up with new building

556
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
Overwrite

557
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
XO have these bills are larger than

558
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,576
$8000000 sure sure sure

559
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
Yep melt

560
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,904
Alright the very big Bill's cool man

561
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:50,560
Yeah so those other companies that he owns it should really started adding adding 2nd

562
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
So

563
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,312
Fun things

564
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:06,432
That next five minutes no I'm fat. Ian steps quite a bit cuz we're not on the radio for that

565
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,224
Other stations are playing their own

566
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,296
Top-of-the-hour identification stuff and

567
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Look

568
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,720
I had Twitter I would tweet out that the teachers on everybody to turn it on right now then donating

569
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:25,120
It is a gift for me I know even though I have no way of proving what you are saying is true

570
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
We does

571
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,960
Using his own instinct

572
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:35,616
At the end of the first

573
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Aldi

574
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
Teacher I

575
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,232
What he's talking about

576
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:56,352
So I have no idea this collars for real or not and neither does Alex

577
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:03,008
The idea that a special education teacher would call into the show the next day makes Alex feel special though so no matter what

578
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,312
But regardless of how flimsy evidence baby

579
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,128
Alex is always going to believe a color like

580
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,528
Best yep that's not to say that it's definitely a prank or a liar I have no idea but I also don't know

581
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,320
Information

582
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
It's program

583
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,160
This may be a real Caller work with him

584
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,744
Maybe a Texas special education teacher who's misremembering work

585
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,560
Working with him or it could all be bogus but the important

586
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,864
Thing is that Alex has no idea what the deal is

587
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,168
And it's very unwise for him to act like the

588
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,776
The lack of any vetting and acceptance of whatever claims are convenient for you

589
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,592
To go about doing a new show

590
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,152
I mean all the way

591
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,736
Going back to the Arkansas Department of Transportation is on the road

592
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
You know like just

593
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,600
Are you. Doesn't matter if this seems like work a cover it

594
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,672
Call some call makes enough sense to make a guess what

595
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:57,280
That part of it has decided to new address to looks like a demon

596
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,120
You just take whatever comes in and then f*** it is

597
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
Cares Act

598
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,728
F****** Zach Zach from the north

599
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
Dick cam

600
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,312
Where is Zaxby's day I don't know

601
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,872
He was cute for a while

602
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,504
We talked about this on the last episode

603
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,040
Literally every time

604
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
Shooting

605
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,136
Is that he claims that the police stood down

606
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:28,000
He does this even in other instances like the unite the right rally

607
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
Right

608
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,840
Various other things is always a police stand down that

609
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:38,240
Explains away issues that he doesn't want to deal with these don't tell me that ironically this time he is going to claim that there was no

610
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
Police Stand Down

611
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
Just like Cruz

612
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Parkland

613
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,088
Oh my God

614
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:02,048
Yeah isn't that wild most down here isn't that wild that is so f****** crazy

615
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,376
He always makes that claim in this

616
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
This one instance

617
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
I think what this is

618
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:15,360
Where the simulation it's bizarre

619
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:21,760
This is like that moment where Rogan is like all this is too good it has to be true I reject this this is too good it has to be

620
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,600
I was pretty surprised I when I was listening and I heard that Jose

621
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
Wow that's on Fortune

622
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Jennifer Alex crazy

623
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
But I think

624
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
Part of that is

625
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,536
Probably because the story of

626
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,840
The guy not waiting

627
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,888
For backup and going in his two good

628
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:44,288
Yeah Alex enjoys back quite a bit with a gun that's the that's the story that everybody wants to

629
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:50,688
To tell feel like he's obsessing about that story much but I do think that holding onto it is

630
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,016
More important than necessarily pushing a stand down

631
00:32:54,784 --> 00:33:00,928
The needle of like well some people were told to stand down but this guy was the hero.

632
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,208
Yeah I know that's not going to happen

633
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,024
So this caller who's

634
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
The

635
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,840
Teacher

636
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
He has some

637
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
Making I think of Alex Wood

638
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
Really have a tough time with this

639
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
This wasn't a collar that he

640
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
Thanks has a big dick

641
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,080
Just start where you liking

642
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
Yessir

643
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,344
Special education graduate school in Texas

644
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,208
Domino's open in fours listener

645
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
I've been that way a long time

646
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
I haven't always occur

647
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
Agree with everything you say

648
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
But I do respect you

649
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
And so

650
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,728
Long story short

651
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
Those kids

652
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
Brian

653
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,128
Whenever they had economy was good

654
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
And what they do have there

655
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
They're very worn people

656
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
People

657
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,952
And so basically what happens is when

658
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
A lot of these kids

659
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
They needed our Direction

660
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,816
Structure

661
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
Lost it

662
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
Cuz they weren't there with us

663
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,216
And there's a lot of good teachers out there

664
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,568
This is really complicated Alex should really hate with

665
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
This caller is saying

666
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,688
On the one hand it's good because he's making shooting about the pandemic which Alex

667
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Going to work with

668
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:32,832
Distraction from the idea of talking about gun regulation or building up red flag laws for

669
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
Violent people

670
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:40,512
On the other hand is colors entire premises so counter to Infowars ideology that Alex should hang up on him

671
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
SkyWars

672
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,560
Teacher in Uvalde

673
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:49,472
This guy is saying that one of the driving forces behind the shooting was at the pandemic happened in these students who needed the structure of

674
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,752
Public Schools didn't have

675
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
School anymore

676
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
And they fell upon

677
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
Alex hate Publix

678
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,896
He thinks they're globalist indoctrination

679
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,432
Concentra

680
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
Consistent

681
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:05,856
With his position to be argued that being in a special education program was proof that Ramos was being mind-controlled

682
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,928
The position he should be taking up

683
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,304
Alex should respond to this by accusing the guy of advocating for locking everyone up in school prison

684
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,888
He constantly yells but other state doesn't need to raise your children

685
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:23,776
As an attack on public schools but I guess in this case it's okay

686
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
That's weird

687
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,896
I mean he should borderline be telling the caller that the caller had something to do with it

688
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:35,296
You should be grilling information during the special education program and you knew this kid

689
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:41,184
How what what's going on in the special education program did you know jolly and west

690
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,744
Have you betrayed in mind control

691
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,888
This is where the college

692
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,656
Gets to Alex

693
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Asking

694
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
Before like

695
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
Specific

696
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
And this color does not have

697
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,712
Not specifically talking about him but this is a big public interest

698
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
Your anonymous

699
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,528
Here

700
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
What did You observe

701
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:12,672
Disappeared during the lockout

702
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,744
Not really.

703
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,704
What what child are young man did you see

704
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,264
Vs21 that reportedly did this atrocity

705
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,640
So I saw him I saw more a social Alex to wear in somebody

706
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
A young person that has

707
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,736
They're going to be more

708
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:41,856
By themselves they might be social but they're going to be socialist like a select group of students

709
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
And so

710
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,416
He was more just

711
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
Tunisia

712
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,488
Removed from the situation

713
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
Especially at the end of the day

714
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,448
I would go out and I have students all over the place and I'm like

715
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,520
How I ended a lot of proactive educators

716
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,824
And I'll walk around and I just kind of get the 10

717
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,616
Temperature what's going on around the kids

718
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,408
Because I want to know what's going on

719
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,456
There's nothing like really

720
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,504
There's no real

721
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
Information that's being

722
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,392
Transfer makes me think that maybe he was actually involved in

723
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
The Texas school

724
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,952
6in Subway because

725
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,000
Who's someone goofing or like

726
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
Being a guy

727
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,608
The hopes I probably would have something a little bit more interesting

728
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
Yeah

729
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,960
No it does seem like he was like this kid was in one of my

730
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,728
Let you know

731
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,800
He's just like everybody else essentially

732
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
Yeah

733
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,896
I would be maybe fine

734
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,944
Believe me I'd like some sort of a passing

735
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Like

736
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,272
He may be ran into a wall

737
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:47,136
That's kind of my vibe is that maybe he's exaggerating

738
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,696
Maybe he's not necessarily making everything up by

739
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:56,352
I think he might be inserting himself into the story where I think sometimes that's the way people process things you know like

740
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
You can't

741
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:02,496
Count the number of times when a like a celebrity dies people post like

742
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,312
I met him once.

743
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,128
Make things about yourself a little bit

744
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,480
It's not always narcissism a little bit of

745
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
Process

746
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
Scraping our own way

747
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,344
Yeah I feel like possibly that's

748
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
That's something

749
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,904
Here

750
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,536
Who knows maybe it is kintyre Lakeside and that's not good

751
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
2 is just like

752
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
The

753
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,144
Least expensive half hour

754
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
On this call

755
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:34,752
India's no idea who this person is he has no idea if they're actually

756
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:40,640
Who they claim to be right it does it's treated as automatically true because it's better if

757
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,968
It's not good cuz you open yourself up to

758
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,504
All sorts of possible

759
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,064
People who are doing hoaxes

760
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:53,696
I mean yeah once you do that

761
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:58,560
It's too late for you yourself up to someone f****** with you for 20 years years

762
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,096
Years of your life

763
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:04,192
So Alex has heard that Ramos

764
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,264
It would shoot BB guns and throw

765
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,544
First stop

766
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,336
This car is in what have you

767
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,872
Alex wasn't that bad

768
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Or was he

769
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,272
BB guns

770
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:24,160
And worse group and it goes from BB gun real gun

771
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
But I did on Halloween run around and

772
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,560
You know people and then

773
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,656
Throwing a pumpkin off of a bridge

774
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,472
They have a pickup truck that killed people next

775
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,872
Years later

776
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,968
For things like

777
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,040
Alex's

778
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
Murdered people

779
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,600
If you believe him

780
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,744
The worst thing he's done is throwing a pumpkin off a bridge he said he literally stopped

781
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512
Someone's

782
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
Gutter

783
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:07,936
There's blood everywhere

784
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
People he's murdered

785
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,984
According to him

786
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
What people in a coma

787
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:16,128
Definitely

788
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,176
Yes we are pumpkins

789
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,528
Don't go with murder that didn't happen

790
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
Alex claiming he's murder people

791
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
So

792
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,184
This is a just Alex

793
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,232
Expressing there should be more cops in

794
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
Some schools

795
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
From what I can see in the reports

796
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,120
Attack unit from the border patrol just

797
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,680
Almost like writing that area they respond

798
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,960
Before they even had backup

799
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
Which is a testament to how

800
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
Betrayed our law enforcement is

801
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:49,152
And I think the only short way in the quick way to solve this is too neatly

802
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
Police are not

803
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
And all schools

804
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
Agree with you stay there

805
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,528
They are so

806
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,576
That's not a good prescription for any

807
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,904
Nope cops do not make schools safer

808
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:08,096
Some May mean well in some cases but the empirical evidence

809
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,888
Shows that there

810
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,424
Side effects

811
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,960
Driving up Lisa

812
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
Schools that aren't necessarily positive

813
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Yeah

814
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Alex

815
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Furious

816
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,152
We going to have mechanisms

817
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Place

818
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,712
I don't agree with the

819
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,016
Purchase

820
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
Without going

821
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
Through some sort of

822
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,416
Mental evaluation

823
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,232
You're barely developing especially while standing on that

824
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:39,584
Travis autistic

825
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,632
Was he on the Spectrum

826
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,752
Violating this is further information

827
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,360
Unfortunately I'm not I don't want to comment on that Alex

828
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,575
18 year old shouldn't be able to buy guns that a psych evaluation

829
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:06,975
That seems like Alex will be serious about that I don't think he would like that if Chuckie Schumer tried to pass that as a law or

830
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:13,375
Suggested that was a good idea yeah I don't think you would like it if anybody other than this particular person

831
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,167
At this particular time

832
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,191
Headset that

833
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
Yep

834
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,239
Probably

835
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:22,079
Alex's suggest no some suggestions

836
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
Of

837
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
Mind control

838
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
As he does

839
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,223
Typically in the cases of mass shooting

840
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,271
It's weird since he's just gotten off of

841
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,063
Cassandra

842
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,111
Do special needs teachers

843
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
Allegedly worked

844
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:39,999
Program

845
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,495
Show Goes On

846
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
The culture is mind control

847
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,175
Solutely so living in

848
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,455
Culture is

849
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,991
What you're calling

850
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,271
Globalist mind

851
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,623
Control the entire culture so it's meaningless

852
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,207
So in order to stop school shootings

853
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,231
Stop culture

854
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:16,351
Right and so instead of that we're just going to do Stewart school shooting

855
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,191
I mean you just have to like if you want to stop this evening

856
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,983
Problem which is caused by the mind

857
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
Control of the globalist

858
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,799
You destroy Alves

859
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,335
Messages of culture that isn't

860
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,127
Pure God

861
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,431
Yeah

862
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,967
Everything is just Kirk

863
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,527
Cameron movies

864
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,807
Great

865
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,159
Alex getting really high with Mike Tyson

866
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,719
Cicadas around

867
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,047
So everyone's got to be homeschooled apparently that's

868
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:52,447
Probably isn't but that's the lockdown the lockdown was homeschooling and then they said that that was the

869
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,007
She's on your mind. Danielle

870
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
I'm just a happy

871
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
Homeschool mom

872
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,871
Boy I got to tell you

873
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,199
Sorry that's what you have to say

874
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:08,319
Day after

875
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,159
It's time to stop letting other people teacher

876
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,863
Econo Lodge shoelaces how to be a good person

877
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
Whole education

878
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,215
System is program

879
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,263
Or system it's over that's gone

880
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,919
To some degree

881
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
When you

882
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,991
Hear these conversations

883
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:41,599
What you should really take away from them is the solutions that they're proposing art Solutions

884
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,135
Cuz they don't want Public Schools

885
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,415
To continue to exist

886
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,999
If there are continued mass shootings

887
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,023
Constantly

888
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:55,423
Works in the favor of the right-wing ideology because eventually maybe it'll get to a point where it's just on

889
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,727
Unsustainable to have public school I mean

890
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,007
More cops in schools makes

891
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:04,383
Public Schools less safe so they want more more cops in schools over and over and over again

892
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,247
The issue is with the school

893
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
It's not with

894
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
The shooting

895
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:16,159
Ideology

896
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,487
Yeah that's that's why a lot of these

897
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Attacks have

898
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
You know Ben

899
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
I'm not naughty shooting attacks

900
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,143
With the attack on the right-wing I've had to do with the school board

901
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
Well I mean it's

902
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
It's it's

903
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,495
Classic clue rules

904
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,263
You know

905
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,055
We have the person

906
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,871
We have the weapon and we have where it happened

907
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,431
So we can't do anything about the person

908
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,247
They'd rather die than do anything about the weapon

909
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
So we got to get rid of the place

910
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
Tim Curry

911
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
Great movie

912
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
So

913
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,207
Alex's had a lot of

914
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
Prophecy

915
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:59,167
And divine experiences everything that he said

916
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,471
Now we learn about another one

917
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,263
This is what he's never talked

918
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
What about before

919
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:10,687
It's really old iosol definitely didn't happen

920
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,223
You and shed

921
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,759
2 years ago the locked

922
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,623
What 278

923
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,927
On the verge of starvation

924
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,767
Nailed it

925
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,863
40 million people

926
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
Think about that

927
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,711
Telestory

928
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,087
I had a vision

929
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,903
When I was three years old

930
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,975
It's one of my earliest most intense memories

931
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
And

932
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,607
Starving African children

933
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,447
That were just crying out

934
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,127
Parents remember this

935
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,735
And it was real loud Shane

936
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,647
But it was ignition

937
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,975
To not let what was coming even bigger

938
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Happen

939
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,535
And I remember

940
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,839
Spiritually feeling the Holy Spirit

941
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,799
You're going to help mitigate this you're going to help stop

942
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
Does your mission

943
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,663
Sorrow

944
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,711
And the desperation of those

945
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
Was

946
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,319
It was the most intense thing that ever happened in my life

947
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,647
Arnon nothing's ever been 110

948
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,231
And it was a lot more complex than then I try to

949
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,023
Demon

950
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,863
Friends are family and I I guess if you times

951
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,399
You said your parents

952
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
Like 3 years old

953
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
Oh man

954
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:15,871
God giving him a mission you think of maybe he would have made food

955
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:19,455
Food insecurity of the developing world are really important part of his career

956
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,015
Like you know it'd be the focus of one of his

957
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,807
12 documentaries Maybe

958
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,599
I mean generally speaking

959
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,879
If I was

960
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:33,279
3 years old and given a vision and the purpose from God 25

961
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,815
Fight one of the horsemen

962
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,863
Single-handedly

963
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,143
I would have

964
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,935
Not started Infowars

965
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,495
Right seems counterintuitive

966
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,151
Weird how this only comes up when there's some other political Point Alex is trying to make by using starving people as a prop

967
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,735
He doesn't really seem to give a s*** about the issue outside of that context

968
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,783
All you need to know is that before Trump

969
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:01,183
The only politician Alex ever went to bed for with Ron Paul who made the elimination of all foreign aid one of the pillars of his

970
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,511
Run for the presidency which Alex reported wholeheartedly

971
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,839
The elimination of foreign aid would kill a number of people that would be

972
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,119
So hard to ask

973
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
Given

974
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,167
How much of our a ghost

975
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,215
Things like the eradication of smallpox

976
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:16,031
Programs

977
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,359
And the humanitarian concerns of also

978
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,639
Astronomic

979
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:27,039
For Alex the image of people starving in the developing world isn't something that he saw individual knee was 3 and is informed his career ever

980
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:32,415
It's a prop you can use to push other agendas he actually cares about like agitating against covid

981
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,999
Restriction and minimize in the murder of 19 elementary school children

982
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:40,095
He's a colossal piece of s*** and it's degrading how he tries to wrap up his

983
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
Detestable politics

984
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,167
Near some kind of holy Quest

985
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,471
Compassionate God gave him in his childhood

986
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,495
Just horseshit

987
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,775
Yep f****** hate the

988
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
Does nonsense

989
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:53,407
I saw a commercial I didn't get a vision

990
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:59,807
Feed the Children infomercial

991
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,135
A cup of coffee commercial that would play

992
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,159
And it's just

993
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,719
Huh boy

994
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,047
How is it that you can if it's a human

995
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,071
A f*****-up thing

996
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:17,471
That you can point to a problem that's unsolvable as a way to avoid solving a problem that is solvable

997
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
What is it on solve the

998
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:19,775
Exactly

999
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,639
So how do we do that what kind of psychopath

1000
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,431
Nonsense species are we

1001
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:27,967
Insane

1002
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,015
You can't just go

1003
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,087
World population they're useless in Let It Die

1004
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,367
If we do that

1005
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,207
Weaponized

1006
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
And we don't live those people up

1007
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,143
We don't do that

1008
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,751
Tell you now

1009
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,383
Salvador Ramos

1010
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,271
Hoses is the people trying to save people

1011
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,647
True story

1012
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:14,815
So you might notice until until sometimes mentioned having to lift up these people in the developing world but he won't ever really expand on what that mean

1013
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,399
Inside outside of just insisting that the political positions he already holds

1014
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
Well if the side effects

1015
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,959
Active lifting them up

1016
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,495
Like trickle-down

1017
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:27,871
Yeah well I was the one who said they can't have fridges so I assume he

1018
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,431
Just wants everybody to have a refrigerator

1019
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
And cars

1020
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:37,855
I burn a lot more fossil fuels and everything

1021
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,671
What does empty garbage that he throws around

1022
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,487
This these ideas like we need to lift people up

1023
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,255
Not the feet

1024
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:50,655
Lifting them up if it gets into some sort of replacement adjacent

1025
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,447
It's like

1026
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:58,847
Britain in the f****** early 1900 these like listen we need to bring these inferior mongrels up and you

1027
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,663
Not how that what are you doing

1028
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,455
You racist piece of s***

1029
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:09,343
Also it's so cool how a day after the shooting Alex is imploring the audience to save the Salvador Ramos is

1030
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
Society

1031
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,951
You really don't see that kind of Grace and understanding being applied

1032
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,767
Across-the-board for murderers that Alex talks about no

1033
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:21,119
I was thinking about it and I honestly have almost no idea why you would say something like that

1034
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,007
It's completely bizarre and probably dipped into fairly disrespectful territory considering that this is the next

1035
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
I mean it really feels like what

1036
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,639
He's trying to do here is a response to what

1037
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,919
He's done in the past

1038
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
Of like

1039
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,807
Here are the things that I've always done and I'm going to try different ones today

1040
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,599
And somehow it's worse

1041
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:42,879
Yeah

1042
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:46,463
I am you may notice bed by now we're no ways into this

1043
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,791
The night before he was misidentifying

1044
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,887
Why the trans women as the shooter.

1045
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:57,215
Say I'm sorry for misidentify

1046
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,519
Didn't happen just pretend it never happened

1047
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:04,383
I never happened now that's why you do it at a special report that you know it's not on the air

1048
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,711
So we get another caller this guy's weird

1049
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,015
In Texas welcome here on the air

1050
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,831
Hey Alex how you doing

1051
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
It is

1052
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,975
I just want to say

1053
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,047
God bless everyone in Uvalde and God bless all of us

1054
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,839
Going to these times

1055
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,143
Another thing is

1056
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
You know

1057
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
Chicopee drug test

1058
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
Call teachers

1059
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,823
The scoreboard

1060
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,687
Number to other liabilities

1061
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,223
In the Doctor's lab

1062
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,015
Mother in the school board's laps

1063
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,551
Are they in a video game

1064
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,111
Should we have

1065
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,135
Hey Mental Health

1066
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,159
Questionnaire

1067
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,999
Games

1068
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,279
Guns and have them transfer

1069
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,071
Bygones have an FFL

1070
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
Bgl video game

1071
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:58,655
License

1072
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,447
We're going to have to do

1073
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,471
Jumping

1074
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,007
Protect these children

1075
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,031
Any schools

1076
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,895
Armed guards walking around

1077
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
Looking at their

1078
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:15,551
And nothing's going on Garden garbage

1079
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,367
Restaurants

1080
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,391
Garbage

1081
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,927
Jewelry shop

1082
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,743
The jewelry is not worth our children or everything

1083
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:29,631
I have no idea why this caller is suggesting all this s*** seems like just a list of non sequiturs

1084
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,191
Yeah that's it's not like

1085
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,727
No schools have armed

1086
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
Regards

1087
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:38,591
For the year 2015 to 2016 the national Center for education

1088
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,663
Statistics reported 42.9% of all Publix

1089
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
Schools have quote

1090
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:46,527
Sworn Law Enforcement Officers routinely carrying a firearm

1091
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:52,927
In 2021 researchers at Suny Albany looked at the school data from 2014

1092
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,951
2018

1093
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,791
In order to assess what effect having armed officers in schools hat

1094
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,583
They found that having an arm

1095
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,119
School resource officer quote

1096
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,191
Increases the likelihood of a school shooting

1097
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,239
But they do point out that it's a small link

1098
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,287
On the flip side quote

1099
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:14,687
The introduction of an SRO does appear to improve general student safety by decreasing non-firearm related by

1100
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,455
Violent offenses

1101
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,991
Such as physical attacks

1102
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
And fights

1103
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:22,111
It's probably hard to attribute the slight increase in the likelihood of a shooting

1104
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,903
To the presence of the officer

1105
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:28,511
Seems like a pretty decent chance that the decrease in fights is probably due to them being there

1106
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,071
Not necessarily the fact they've a gun butt

1107
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,863
Security officer were tend to have that effect

1108
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,679
But there's a big downside

1109
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,959
The study also found

1110
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,239
From the study

1111
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,007
Quote

1112
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,311
This benefit comes at a high cost of a

1113
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,847
Increase disciplinary response

1114
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,895
By both the school and law enforcement

1115
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:51,039
We find that sros increase the incidence of in-school suspension out-of-school suspension expulsion

1116
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:54,879
Police referral and arrest particularly in middle and high schools

1117
00:55:55,391 --> 00:56:01,535
For many of these disciplinary consequences The increased use of punishment is over two times larger for black students than whites do

1118
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:05,119
And significantly larger for students with disabilities

1119
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,143
Then students without

1120
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:06,911
Disabilities

1121
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,983
Sros also increase the rate of chronic abs

1122
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
Empieza

1123
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,823
The ideal just dropping an armed guard do a schooling

1124
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,639
Considering the job done here isn't the solution

1125
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,687
They're very troubling side effects

1126
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:23,551
Exit appear to be related to that decision that need to be weighed against the illusion of safety that they provide

1127
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:29,183
I think it's just much more complicated then the idea of like let's put it Army in there whisper

1128
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,255
No I mean there that the problem is

1129
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,279
Is basically this

1130
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,327
We know how to solve the

1131
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,375
But they don't want to do that

1132
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,167
So instead they have to come up with

1133
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:39,935
Something

1134
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:43,263
And what they wind up coming up with makes it worse

1135
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,615
It happens every time because they don't want to solve the problem

1136
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,711
So his mother weird ideas

1137
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,503
Do we not have mass

1138
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
Extra

1139
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
Any

1140
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,903
Bulletproof blast on the

1141
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:00,927
The doors

1142
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,463
We have them in Bang

1143
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,191
Psycho

1144
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,239
Spiritually targeting Are Young

1145
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,311
What

1146
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,103
Actually drugs

1147
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,127
Okay

1148
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,967
These kids trying to beyond all this.

1149
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
They shouldn't be

1150
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,271
Too much dope

1151
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,575
F****** yerrid

1152
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,623
It's interesting that Alex is like

1153
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:35,231
It's not police

1154
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,815
Conspiracy theorist who was like

1155
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,607
Episode of competing with Alex I would

1156
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,143
Suggest maybe that

1157
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:46,239
But look the globalists are really just creating the ID

1158
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:51,103
Do you have that there's a bunch of psychos around in order for them to get it the police stayed in that you would accept

1159
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:51,871
Yep

1160
00:57:54,431 --> 00:58:00,575
The whole thing about a police state is you don't get one until somebody convinces you that you need

1161
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,367
Need one by using

1162
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:08,511
I mean Alex thinks it's ganglion dialectic bulshit that's what I should be happy

1163
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
Pretty right now

1164
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:12,863
Is that they're making this to bring in a police state and he's like

1165
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,655
Listen

1166
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,983
What's not a police state

1167
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:24,383
I want to stop a police state even in the face of violence either that you don't have any water

1168
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,431
Over and over and over and over again

1169
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,479
We see the way that Alex like

1170
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:34,111
All of his Posse Comitatus ideas and martial law fears go away when it's Trump doing it

1171
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,415
You know it's it's it's

1172
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:42,815
It's circumstantial it's not it's not ideological it's not there's no principle behind it

1173
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,583
It's just the

1174
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:49,215
Pure into the presentation of principles and it's like Ted Nugent saying he's well-researched all of course you know it

1175
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:55,871
Because it's about themselves it's about building themselves up as being both Heroes Intelligence being

1176
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,663
All of these amazing things

1177
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:05,087
Yeah and by not solving the problem would get to continue using that appearance as sort of a

1178
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,879
No weapon

1179
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:12,767
Anyway the same color is even more time ideas believe that

1180
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,303
Yeah hip also is

1181
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,095
The joke it's nothing more than an end

1182
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,911
Apartment lies

1183
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,447
And I know there's some

1184
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,727
Advantages of it

1185
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,799
But you ask anyone what's your name

1186
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:27,871
They gladly tell you everything that's wrong with them

1187
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,151
Secret

1188
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,711
It's just a weapon

1189
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,039
Well said sir thank you so much for the call Unity

1190
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,087
Well said

1191
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:40,927
Wow well said

1192
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,487
List of things that don't even make sense

1193
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:47,839
I need to drug test teachers we should Retreat schools like bank vault

1194
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:52,191
We need to get rid of HIPAA laws

1195
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,543
That's one of those things where it's just like this guy just knows words

1196
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,335
But you just heard buzzword

1197
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,127
And he knows problems

1198
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,223
FAU just tries to combine them in like a note draw the line

1199
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,807
Back of a cereal box game infamous

1200
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
Powerful

1201
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,855
It was a powerful

1202
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,183
So you get another color

1203
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,207
Pick-n-Pull

1204
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:18,815
I don't know he'll just tell you what's wrong with them

1205
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:25,471
Will voluntarily tell you the issues they have medical leave

1206
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,775
Should be no problem that the

1207
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:34,431
Sofia is all be disclosed without your permission you understand though that if I was like Hey I want a job

1208
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:39,551
I don't tell people that I have

1209
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:44,159
Don't hire him those laws

1210
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,719
Protect people

1211
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:52,095
Another caller and this guy has some some ideas about social media

1212
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,887
And how it was Poppin

1213
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,423
The f*** off the day before

1214
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
This would be perfect

1215
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,495
Replace for Alex to bring up how

1216
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,775
You know he had misreported

1217
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,335
Some stuff yesterday and apologize but no

1218
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
I just wanted to make

1219
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,151
Point

1220
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,431
Yesterday

1221
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,967
With the aftermath of the shooting

1222
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,039
Social media was going crazy and of course you got

1223
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,575
Liberal representative

1224
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
Naughty

1225
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:15,903
Representative

1226
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,671
Senators and all that

1227
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Question to you is

1228
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,511
At what point do they have enough

1229
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,535
Vilified

1230
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,143
And then go back on

1231
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Being a baby

1232
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,495
What

1233
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,823
They have no debate

1234
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:41,759
I think it's interesting that they Scholars like it's popping off on social media and it's like a liberals being mean to conserve

1235
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:48,671
You know Paul gosar shared misidentification of the shooter

1236
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,791
Quite late I mean.

1237
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:57,119
You know that's so that's a much more

1238
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,143
Meaningful

1239
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:01,727
Thing I was happening on social media much more damaging then

1240
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,775
Libs being mad at

1241
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,055
Conservatives are whatever

1242
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:05,823
Yeah

1243
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,847
But I mean

1244
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
Narrative

1245
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,919
What's so

1246
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,479
Engrain from like

1247
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,247
What 20

1248
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,807
2014 on of just like

1249
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:20,671
Liberals are always WeatherBug and they blame everybody after tragedy and all that stuff

1250
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,719
Now and then like they just

1251
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,535
Everybody who tried that just kind of

1252
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
Stopped

1253
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,863
But the conservatives are like well we can just still

1254
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:35,263
Keep saying that over and over and over again it doesn't matter if they do it or not and we can do it but because that narrative is

1255
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,591
Stronger than the medial even help them out.

1256
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,127
They'll find one tweet

1257
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,223
Of Lego Batman all Liberals are

1258
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:47,039
Also like a lot of Alex's

1259
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:47,807
People

1260
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,575
Assertive in his

1261
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,343
Same

1262
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,647
Territorial politics

1263
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,439
Revolves around aggrievement

1264
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:57,791
Feelings of persecution and so projecting those onto the rest

1265
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,583
The world feels right

1266
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,399
Yeah so there's something that's sort of emotionally satisfying

1267
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,679
Handsome millier

1268
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,447
About

1269
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,519
Dealing with all of these situation

1270
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:10,079
That way

1271
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,919
Totally fine it's just some Cirque

1272
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,711
Circumstances were slightly different

1273
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
Front with the shooting

1274
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,039
They want open-air drug Market

1275
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,999
All the pro-life people all the gun owners were to blame

1276
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,815
It is in

1277
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,095
This may sound kind of

1278
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,143
The minute and I couldn't help but think of it

1279
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,471
If that shooter would have went into a nursery in shop babies

1280
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,871
Twenty-something pregnant women

1281
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:46,943
Yeah they would have

1282
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,479
Praise him as a hero saying he was

1283
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,503
Pro-choice

1284
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:54,623
We are at that point where they

1285
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,671
5 years old

1286
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,255
These people

1287
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,303
The killing us in a year

1288
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,327
That's crazy

1289
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,143
I understand that

1290
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:09,471
Maybe there's some

1291
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:13,055
Cone that we don't quite capture or whatever that like

1292
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:17,151
This is understood by some people as an exaggeration or

1293
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,175
Some sort of

1294
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:25,087
You like it and I was like they're legitimately saying like if you just shot pregnant women

1295
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,439
It'll be totally fine with the Dems who want to abort people after they're born

1296
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,511
Feels like that's an actual

1297
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,047
Feeling

1298
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,583
That's what I mean where at

1299
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,631
We're at they're going to start just murdered

1300
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
I mean that

1301
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,239
F****** that if you can respond to a school shooting

1302
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,007
With

1303
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:45,823
The Liberals are so evil they want to kill babe

1304
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,919
Then you there's been there then we're not humans

1305
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:53,503
We're not should you cannot believe that I'm a human being

1306
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:57,343
And I would be like Stokes if a guy murdered a bunch of babies

1307
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,903
Yep that's not good now they're going to

1308
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,047
Information

1309
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,351
Again but again this is the stuff that like

1310
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,655
Beautiful every reason to think this was a key

1311
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:15,775
I need to get your opinion on this Alex I was talking to a friend of mine this morning

1312
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:23,711
Enough money to buy those guns and all that ammo

1313
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,295
I don't know I'm not versed on those two probably well more than me

1314
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:32,415
How does that kid get all that body armor because it sounds like he was in a heck of a shootout with the cops

1315
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,975
He got in

1316
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,767
Before the special agent

1317
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,559
I would think that body on

1318
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,143
I don't know how an eighteen-year-old

1319
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:48,543
Alarm security

1320
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,079
Well trained border patrol

1321
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,175
Very suspicious

1322
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,967
Just because I was not the case

1323
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:59,551
Answer that one that is a good question

1324
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,367
Those things don't sound right

1325
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,903
Yep you are correct

1326
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,695
The cops are f****** lie

1327
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:12,095
Ghetto Alex wants to get into a little bit of the news

1328
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:16,191
Little bit add lights from a couple weeks ago but

1329
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,263
The story is essentially meant

1330
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,031
Attitude

1331
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,055
Deliver the point

1332
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,823
That

1333
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,847
Nowhere

1334
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,175
The Dam's like to make a big

1335
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,735
Deal out of these things I can capitalize on but

1336
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
When there ain't

1337
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,295
Antifa goons go out

1338
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:37,695
Do violence and share never get in trouble or get in trouble at all

1339
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,999
No prison time

1340
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,559
The man who shot Aurora protest

1341
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:43,839
Wallet

1342
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,887
Driving through the crowd

1343
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
5

1344
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,239
Shot two people

1345
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,775
Call Amy

1346
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,847
Drove into a crowd of protesters which is driving through them

1347
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:57,151
Interstate 225 in the summer 2020

1348
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:00,479
120 days in jail followed by

1349
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,015
5 months probation

1350
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,551
But it's all time served

1351
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,343
Samuel Young

1352
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,111
20

1353
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,719
No prison time

1354
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,743
Superman

1355
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,279
Who shot Aurora protest

1356
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,631
Just from what Alex reads there he's contradicted the no prison

1357
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,655
X x

1358
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:24,031
He said he did the 120 days is it time served for Alex to use

1359
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:30,687
This was a situation where there was a protest at Aurora Colorado and I jeep was driving slowly through a crab

1360
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:38,367
Cheapest speeding towards people murderous intent

1361
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:42,719
That far cuz I don't know if there was actual intention to hit

1362
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,999
People

1363
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,535
He was not concerned for safety

1364
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,583
The driver

1365
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:51,423
And that situation this guy but Alice was talking about fired some shots at the Jeep

1366
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,471
And ended up hitting two other protests

1367
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,007
It was dumb

1368
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:58,079
The guy's apologized and Taken full responsibility for his actions

1369
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:03,199
And he never would have used the gun if it weren't the situation where he felt there was an immediate threat

1370
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,759
Although its calculation may have been a little bit alright

1371
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:10,367
Also the victims asked the court for restorative justice which the judge took into

1372
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,135
Consideration

1373
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:16,255
The person driving the jeep also didn't get charged with anything so all-in-all considering that the victims were

1374
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,791
Severely injured in the fact

1375
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,583
You know what other not

1376
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,631
In favor of him getting any jail time right

1377
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:25,215
Seems like there should be more of a teachable situation as opposed to one

1378
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,263
Does use for outrage bait

1379
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:31,359
The guy has different politics than Alex though so it's just proof that the left in

1380
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,407
Globalist get away with everything while

1381
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:39,807
Strike make a big deal out of mass shootings at elementary school

1382
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,111
Left is getting away with everything if this

1383
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:42,879
Was

1384
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:48,255
A right-wing protesters shooting at a left-wing driver in a car

1385
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:51,071
Alex will be like I wish he would kill more

1386
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,119
Left-wing people driving in cars

1387
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,191
Spoken about

1388
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:00,799
12

1389
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,103
So it's like I mean I just I just

1390
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,687
Whatever you want to be true about liberals is what you're going to

1391
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,271
I just don't I don't like

1392
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,831
76 more calls

1393
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
And this guy

1394
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,623
Intrigued

1395
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,159
I wanted to know more

1396
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,487
Another thing Alex we got to get the hell out of this

1397
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,767
Virtual world

1398
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,375
This virtual world is blending into our third world or 3D reality

1399
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,679
We've lost touch when you lost connection

1400
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,007
There's no more neighbors reaching out to each other

1401
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:37,663
Cuz I saw a couple neighbors having a crawfish boil method only get three or four neighbors to come over and eat crawfish with into them

1402
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,455
Scared by the damn media

1403
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:44,063
How is traffic

1404
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,391
Yeah it stinks the major gets wet

1405
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
We're loose

1406
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,951
Touch with 3D World

1407
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:50,975
Nicola Church

1408
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:53,279
The love we're losing all that

1409
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:58,399
The media scared people away from the crawfish boil at

1410
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,191
On other shows

1411
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:08,639
The theory is that this guy was not invited to the cross

1412
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:12,223
He said that he saw some people have

1413
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:18,623
I was at a neighbor's crawfish suggest that we don't have neighbors anymore and then

1414
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:21,439
Then observe that his neighbors were having fun without him

1415
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:26,047
What some

1416
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:29,375
He didn't but he wasn't there and he didn't get an invite

1417
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:33,471
How did you not know that only three neighbors were invited

1418
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:37,055
I mean who knows how many words I didn't didn't show up but yet he can't know the inner work

1419
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:41,407
Who knows maybe he did get an invitation

1420
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:47,807
He was afraid to go because of these reported on

1421
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,599
That's a fair point as well

1422
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,999
Yeah I want a good Crawfish Boil I don't know I just

1423
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,047
It's a

1424
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:58,815
The Crawfish

1425
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,583
Kind of

1426
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,119
Kind of way to solve a lot of problems

1427
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:01,887
Sure

1428
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,191
So are we get another color or as a dumb idea

1429
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,727
Feel something

1430
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,823
Annual convention in Houston

1431
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,591
This weekend

1432
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,871
Republican

1433
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,735
You don't think this is crazy

1434
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,295
Call becomes an era

1435
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
It's very

1436
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,647
Is it

1437
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:30,303
So if you listen to this show you'll notice a trend in that is that a lot of the collars are trying to float possible pieces of evidence

1438
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:35,679
So they can use to argue that there was for knowledge of the attack and then they're trying to Workshop a motive

1439
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,983
It almost feels like a reaching out to Alex

1440
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,055
To get his Blessing on this reason that they're suspicious

1441
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:47,455
Any pretty much unfailingly will give them the reassurance they're looking for it's a super unhealthy Dynamic like this guy is calling

1442
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:51,551
Isn't it weird that the NRA conference is coming up in Houston

1443
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575
And I was like that is

1444
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,343
Is very suspicious

1445
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:56,927
Encouraging this line of thought that this guy is clearly on

1446
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:01,023
If the NRA meeting has anything to do with the shooting

1447
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:03,327
Prior to the NRA meeting

1448
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:08,447
Scheduled to be before the NRA meeting which means there was a plan

1449
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:12,031
That has something to do with being posed to the NRA

1450
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,335
Back to the globalists back to the libs

1451
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,359
Sprite

1452
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,663
It's just Alex should not be

1453
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:21,247
Just sew blanket encouraging of the thought patterns

1454
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,015
Is there

1455
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,599
Especially when they're contradictory shorts

1456
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,879
Beach call

1457
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,695
From call the call I know that makes

1458
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,767
Violent video games in

1459
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,815
Also yeah absolutely

1460
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:41,215
The violent video games have got to go

1461
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,263
That's weird

1462
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:47,871
The same color has another dumb idea

1463
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:54,271

3500

1471
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,143

1474
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,871

1480
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
The saddest thing I've ever heard

1481
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
Yep

1482
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,727
That is

1483
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:50,079
Start made me take a little bit of a like lean back in my chair

1484
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,127
Who what wear

1485
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:55,199
Forward stories let's see

1486
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,991
Infowars listener

1487
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,015
20 years

1488
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,367
Long-time colors Plumbing

1489
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:08,767
I forget I mean like yeah you have somebody who's listen to Alex for

1490
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,559
Entire last

1491
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,839
Two decades

1492
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:14,655
They've called in to share in the experience with him

1493
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,703
And the day after mass shooting

1494
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:26,175
Disappeared communist Training Center has not get more just

1495
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:32,063
That put that on and put it in an encyclopedia next to the next to what happens with this information

1496
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,111
20 years of listening

1497
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,927
My first thought is this guy was taken to a

1498
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:40,767
Communist cell and trained on how to murder children

1499
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,535
That makes sense

1500
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,095
It's it's

1501
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:44,863
I think

1502
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,911
Indicative of

1503
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,703
You know like people who have ID

1504
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
Ideas

1505
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,239
About

1506
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,519
Conspiracies

1507
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,335
Can call into Alex's show healing courage

1508
01:14:55,359 --> 01:15:01,247
You make it feel like they were in This Together working on this thing that kind of sucks them in a little bit more

1509
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,527
Keeps them like

1510
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,599
Gibson like getting guy that the validation that they're looking

1511
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:10,207
Before yeah I mean you want to say that we're more complex animals but boy

1512
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:12,511
Positive validation really goes a long

1513
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,327
F****** way towards getting you to do weird s***

1514
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:18,143
20 years in the trenches 20 years

1515
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,167
So Alex

1516
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
Now

1517
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:26,847
Didn't happen anymore because this gas is on a totally different type

1518
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,111
There is just so much going on

1519
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,927
World government convening

1520
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:44,511
Turlock

1521
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,351
Fabulously

1522

Thomas Ranch

1523
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,191
Experience

1524
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,215
Lawyer

1525
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
He's been

1526
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,359
There's a lot of successful lawsuit

1527
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:01,663
Salon.com

1528
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,943
Texaslotto.com

1529
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,503
You can describe Thomas Rams a lot of ways but

1530
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:08,063
Experienced lawyer is definitely not one of them

1531
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:14,975
He just passed the bar in 2019 and is mostly been filing frivolous lawsuits

1532
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:21,375
He's really become more of a media personality and Fringe right-wing talk shows and going on the reawakened America

1533
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,655
Tour that was full of lunatics

1534
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,959
Stand-up comedy from Jim Breuer

1535
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:27,519
A September 2021 article in the Washington

1536
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:30,079
The post describes his litigation history like this

1537
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:36,223
All but two of the eight coronavirus related Federal lawsuits Rams his father in the early stage

1538
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,759
The exemptions

1539
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:42,367
These are the suit against a hospital system in Michigan that was withdrawn on September 10th

1540
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,903
That's days after it was filed

1541
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:49,791
And 10 hiyo officials that was withdrawn after a judge said it was nearly quote

1542
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,071
Incomprehensible

1543
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:55,423
Also before finally passing the bar in 2019 on his fifth attempt

1544
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,703
Attempt

1545
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,239
Works at a credit union

1546
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:00,287
We're multiple women made sexual harassment

1547
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,311
Complaints against them

1548
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,127
One of them including an instance where he quote

1549
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:08,223
Flipped his hand down the front of my upper breast and commented oops

1550
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:14,367
He all-in-all seems like a real a****** and someone who's not a pretty lucrative hustle for himself in the anti-vax world

1551
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:17,951
So I guess he's coming on to talk about the terror of my

1552
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:18,975
Yeah

1553
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,791
So that's where we're going for the ref

1554
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,327
Oh man

1555
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,607
Yep these f******

1556
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,375
Guys

1557
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,655
How do you

1558
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,775
Step to a clip comes up

1559
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,055
About

1560
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:33,823
About this

1561
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,615
Terrible things that

1562
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,407
Pfizer is announcer

1563
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:42,271
What I mean listen we was in Pfizer

1564
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,367
You can swallow these ships and then we can track and it'll be perfect

1565
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,351
We played

1566
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,655
Monday or maybe Sunday

1567
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:11,967
Wow we show the clip but he's already lied about it

1568
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:12,991
Physically

1569
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:16,319
He's claiming his recent like they're announcing message at 1 about track

1570
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:18,367
Can people write this is a comment that the

1571
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:22,719
The CEO of Pfizer made in 2018 about a bill of 5 mysite

1572
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:27,071
Which is a unique medication used to treat schizophrenia bipolar disorder and depression

1573
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,095
Oh I know

1574
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:32,959
It contains the sensor which quote sends a message to the transmit information

1575
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,983
Into a mobile app

1576
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:41,151
This is disgusting the context of breakthroughs in medicine and is specifically in response to a question from the audience

1577
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:45,503
So you can create the best medication around but

1578
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,039
It doesn't matter the patient does

1579
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:47,807
Take it

1580
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,623
What's being done on the technological side there

1581
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:55,487
Took off and dumb dumb anti-vax and covid conspiracy circles

1582
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,023
Countless memes have been shared

1583
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:00,095
With no context apply to people claiming that the recent clip

1584
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,887
Melissa people do with the pandemic

1585
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:05,471
Alex and Rams are just reposting that mean while

1586
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,239
Send another doing

1587
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,287
Some kind of reporting and embarrassingly

1588
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:12,383
Alex decides it is where he's going to take a shot at the mainstream media for not playing clips

1589
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,919
What a douche

1590
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,455
2018

1591
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,479
Yep

1592
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,247
4 years

1593
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,271
Ago

1594
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,575
And they're still claiming that it's brand new

1595
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,879
And it's about the pain.

1596
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:27,743
Right it's just recently found it and I'll lying about the context.

1597
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:30,559
To push the conspiracy theories that they were already pushing

1598
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,327
Yeah

1599
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,655
That's weak s***

1600
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:38,239
Yep if it's you just have to put like a f******

1601
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:41,567
Hey all done did you see that video here's the timestamp

1602
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,591
Shut up

1603
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,871
That's that bulshit

1604
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,407
Get out of here

1605
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:52,319
So has another clip from the world economic Forum because that was actually in a talk

1606
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,855
At the world economic forum

1607
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,463
In front of Alex

1608
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:02,047
I think it's pretty funny that I would because

1609
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:05,119
It does show that Rob has a little bit of a sense of humor are you

1610
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:10,751
Freewheel August of covid-19

1611
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,543
Sexy movements

1612
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,360
Conspiracy people

1613
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,920
Her claiming said I had Pitbull

1614
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,712
I wonder what it is

1615
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,992
April

1616
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,528
Ecobee

1617
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:34,816
I know you will also Target

1618
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,096
Pirate's plunder

1619
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,888
But was arrested by FBI

1620
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:48,128
Surprising things about the same publication

1621
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,992
What is the previous one

1622
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:07,328
So what they do is they put themselves in Criminal

1623
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:10,912
Does that mean

1624
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,704
You're not the target you are the target

1625
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,056
Yeah I don't know that the target of misinformation

1626
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:20,384
A target of our guns or something that's the most

1627
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,712
Sensible read I can make of that Chasm really make sense

1628
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:26,528
So yeah I just thought that was kind of funny that I

1629
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:32,928
Play that is pretty funny

1630
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,208
That the pope was arrested

1631
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,768
That's pretty you've got pretty Steve pieczenik

1632
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:39,328
I think he's referencing Stephen Roanoke

1633
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:44,960
Has been arrested a lot of people in qanon have push that

1634
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,776
Weird less specifically than Steve

1635
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:51,616
And I wish I would like to see if the pope had like a LoJack

1636
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,640
Back it out

1637
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:59,040
Translate looked up his robes for a second and ankle bracelets

1638
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:05,696
Displays and then they go to commercial

1639
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
Realizes

1640
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,512
Ifucking respond

1641
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,304

I miss

1643
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:16,704
Is the worst promo I've ever

1644
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,496
Super important Alex

1645
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,544
Respond to that last clip that you just played

1646
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,616
Because those two arrogant pieces of garbage

1647
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:27,456
Bitter out there telling us what they're going to do

1648
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,992
Is he being in Good Company

1649
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,040
I got a message for you guys

1650
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,856
I'm a nobody from a little town in Ohio

1651
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,136
Yeah you are

1652
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,672
A whole bunch of other nobodies

1653
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,976
Little places in the United States

1654
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:45,888
It stood up and we are at a much lower rate of vaccination than you ever thought we would be you thought you were going to

1655
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,424
Take us over you didn't know

1656
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,704
We nobody's

1657
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,496
We are the resistant

1658
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,032
We the People

1659
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,336
Thanks to Alex Jones

1660
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,616
Oh boy

1661
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:59,712
Put him on a lookout Shay

1662
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:06,368
We got a new t-shirt coming into colleges all over the world

1663
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:10,720
You resisted lower than you could have imagined

1664
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:13,536
Alex's bullhorn

1665
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,656
Are vaccinations rated lower than you ever thought

1666
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,704
Cool your goddess

1667
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,240
Wow

1668
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,544
So I just don't know how to say Eragon

1669
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,568
Cantwell

1670
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:28,384
So we get to the discussion of monkeypox

1671
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,664
And it's pretty dumb

1672
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,200
We've got

1673
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,648
They've done getting function on monkey paw

1674
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,720
Monkeypox

1675
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:46,304
And I'm hoping it doesn't spread

1676
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:51,168
Scenario happening with the monkeypox

1677
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:55,264
That you know they ran their simulations they've been planning for

1678
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,312
Been building up for all this nonsense

1679
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,104
So here's my question

1680
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:00,896
Is monkeypox

1681
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,176
It's running around now

1682
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,480
Is this at natural monkeypox

1683
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:07,808
Or is this another game to function oops release

1684
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:10,880
And we don't know that yet we don't know

1685
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:13,184
The only reason the Thomas friends doesn't know what the

1686
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,744
Situation isn't much boxes cuz he is an idiot

1687
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,512
He hasn't looked

1688
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,280
Intuit at all

1689
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:23,936
He's a right-wing clout doctor for all it's worth another fun season of scamming for monkeypox

1690
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,216
He plays his cards right

1691
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:28,800
A friend has been a couple minutes on the subject before writing it substack

1692
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:29,568
I can come on out

1693
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:32,128
The show to discuss the topic he knows nothing about

1694
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,432
He would know that samples from the current outbreak have been

1695
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:37,760
Studied and are clearly from the West African strain that is exist

1696
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,040
For a long time

1697
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,624
Their number series about exactly how the outbreak is happened

1698
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,976
A couple of them involving Raves and large Gatherings shared various countries share

1699
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,768
More will likely be known

1700
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,048
Specifically in time

1701
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:53,888
What there is currently no evidence of his that monkeypox

1702
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:58,752
Just made in the lab is a bioweapon or is going to lead to lockdowns or first vaccination

1703
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,520
That's all

1704
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:03,616
The dumb bulshit the people like Alex and Rams used to keep their customer base scared

1705
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:04,640
And

1706
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:08,480
In their customer base yeah you know it's

1707
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:14,880
It's been a long time since we've had to use that old adage you know Raven Denmark means monkeypox in Florida

1708
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:15,904
But it's it's

1709
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,672
It's old

1710
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,440
Strong

1711
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,488
Still after all these years

1712
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:21,280
Thomas Jefferson

1713
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,608
You know I was just I was just thinking we're going to hear that

1714
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,144
Over the next

1715
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,168
Rest of our lives

1716
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,960
Again and again and again and again

1717
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,264
This is just like what they did with covid

1718
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,824
Is going to dog us until we die

1719
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:37,152
Sure you know like working at 4

1720
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:41,504
Twenty years from now they'll be like all this is just like the gain of function they did with covid

1721
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,808
It's just never going to stop but I think

1722
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,600
Like unfortunately

1723
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,928
You did have that

1724
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,720
Exactly Namek playing out

1725
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:51,744
Just in

1726
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,280
Like under the surface

1727
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:55,072
Conspiracy communities

1728
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:58,912
With like terrorist attack like 9/11

1729
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,704
That kind of stuff

1730
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,472
Those

1731
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:07,616
Conspiracy communities were just largely ignored they did not have as much impact on

1732
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,896
People's actual lives

1733
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,992
And so yeah I think I think it's more a

1734
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,320
Republican Ascend awareness

1735
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
Problem

1736
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,112
But it is like a

1737
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,928
This thought process is right

1738
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,696
That's not new

1739
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:26,816
Right right it's just it having an impact on people who don't choose to engage with

1740
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,608
Dumb conspiracy world

1741
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,680
Yep and that's on Fortune

1742
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,240
A

1743
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:37,312
And I think it's a little abet

1744
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:49,088
Infowars

1745
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:53,440
They look it looks like it could be a false flag looks a Mite been made and will happen if it's not

1746
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:59,584
I don't think there's a God but hey I'm just going to say maybe I believe in the morning. But it was not monkeypox probably be something

1747
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,776
There's going to be a next time

1748
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,312
They're not giving this up

1749
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,360
Defeat this evil

1750
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:17,760
Continue lockdown

1751
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,320
Normal

1752
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:26,208
What's the summer rage

1753
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,488
I did another sub

1754
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:30,560
Let's not Overlook the summer great

1755
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:36,960
Do you think Alex has talked about this

1756
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:40,032
Spoken sparingly of the summer of Rage

1757
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:42,848
I can't

1758
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:49,248
I can't handle that being a present-day thing that is being talked about December 8th

1759
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:52,576
Hang over here every year on Alex's stupid show

1760
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,136
I think

1761
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,184
I think this is a disgraceful

1762
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,952
Text Dave

1763
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:03,584
One of the things that I think is worth noting is that a lot of the

1764
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,656
Shifting details

1765
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,704
Did not necessarily happen in the first

1766
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,472
Birthday

1767
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,520
Some of that little bit

1768
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,056
Further down the line

1769
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:18,176
But you already see the nebulousness of this in terms of Alex's coverage

1770
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:22,784
The day of when he did his emergency report we had this misidentification

1771
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,600
And everything is like mad death

1772
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,392
And now we have

1773
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,696
Misreporting

1774
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:31,232
That is understandable

1775
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:34,048
About like the border patrol guy going in quick

1776
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,072
Sure

1777
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,656
I just think

1778
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:41,984
Weird that he said that there wasn't the stand that I mean

1779
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:46,080
It's almost like at validates him making s*** up

1780
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:50,176
Because when he tried not to make s*** up it was wrong it was a lie

1781
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:56,576
Can't be right no matter what make it up

1782
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,368
Even when I try not to make it up

1783
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:04,768
I'm foolish it makes me Alex Jones Is Right memes all the more bizarre

1784
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:11,936
Will be back on on Monday and we'll track a little bit further down the road and 80 how things go as

1785
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:15,520
As details start to emerge in the Alex S2

1786
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:22,176
Deal with stuff that might be in his kind of wheel has to stay one step ahead but when there is chaos and can

1787
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,968
Confusing that is something that he is

1788
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,248
Well versed

1789
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,272
In exploiting

1790
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,296
And the cement

1791
