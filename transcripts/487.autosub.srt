00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,136
Sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

Quest what's up

12
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
First

13
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,848
Beautiful dog Fanny

14
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
The cutest dog in the world

15
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,648
Many

16
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,608

He is doing great dad

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,688
Case scenario is what the doctor said so I'm very excited

19
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:59,808
Animal is doing poorly it's a huge stress them

20
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:05,696
Realtor

21
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,584
Brought her into the home she had some issues

22
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
Pizza

23
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,688
When that all got resolved that it was such a

24
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,504
Believable relation crap

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,064
How do you make

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
And your

27
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
Dog

28
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,440
The partner family

29
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,048
How about you

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
Experiment has been

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,032
Seltzer show up

32
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,384
Completely out of

33
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,248
Pretty cool

34
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
Ghost pepper popcorn

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,304
Did you try that it will

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,008
Like I knows it right now there's the chocolate bar or whatever

37
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,080
Jared Holt

38
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,640
For charity

39
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040
Never heard

40
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Play hot

41
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:47,840
Really hot chocolate

42
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,504
Popcorn could be involved with

43
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:12,160
I feel like maybe there's a lot more territory we can explore their

44
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,047
I can handle Heat

45
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Yeah

46
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,167
In our heart of hearts that it was there

47
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,639
Super

48
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:39,039
I'm not entirely sure how to pronounce this but it is a

49
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:50,815
Creation of

50
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
Your descriptions indeed

51
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:06,431
Describing all of the settings you can take place in some of those were very very funny

52
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
A lot of experience in the realm of

53
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
Of role-playing games but the first time

54
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
High school girl

55
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,423
School.

56
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
So I'm going to read this year

57
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:39,967
Possible ideas for a text Adventure I came across

58
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,623
This is an original flyer for a concert in honor of ex-president George Bush Senior

59
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,695
Gross The Weeknd

60
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,255
The place in July 2000

61
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:59,167
The Grove is far higher than the weekend before Newcastle

62
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:05,567
UK

63
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:13,503
An amazing flyer for a band concert celebrating George Bush Senior

64
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,623
Surreal

65
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,695
Program fire

66
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:28,863
Absolutely

67
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,447
So far towards like showing that like

68
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
This isn't

69
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,055
This secret is stove Society

70
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
They're letting us

71
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:48,831
All the credits for everybody who put on their pageants

72
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
You know it's like

73
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
Skitch Henderson

74
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:02,399
Bohemian Grove you know it's not a secret society Murderers Row

75
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,567
Classic conductor do a really awesome

00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,663
First chair alright

77
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:19,039
BB space in the studio

78
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:25,439
I can pick a few things

79
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,863
This is shaping up

80
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:39,263
Accidentally I've been working for my entire life

81
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,919
Infowars magazine

82
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:52,319
Drake appreciate you very much

83
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,743
What Alex Jones

84
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,815
December 28th 2020 model Hyundai on this is 2020

85
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,471
So what's the reason for the 28th is because the night before the story of Trump's taxes in the New York Times bro

86
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
Obviously

87
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
You know

88
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,103
An interesting to see what maybe Alex says

89
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,063
Do the 20 minutes because today

90
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,391
And stream

91
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,071
Maybe on Friday aftermath

92
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Episode

93
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,399
I just figured like a 28

94
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Lexi

95
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,543
Expose

96
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Going to get into it

97
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
First

98
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,295
First

99
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,071
You're not here I come

100
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,855
Commander Holly

101
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:37,023
Kuka people donated on elevators

102
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:42,655
Some okay

103
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:47,519
Read my

104
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Nicorette

105
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
Heroin

106
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,839
Damn didn't read my

107
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:24,639
Is you all right

108
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
Yourself a mortar and pestle

109
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:31,039
Herbs from the garden

110
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Alright

111
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
Ground that all up in World War II

112
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,023
Alright

113
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,423
It's okay

114
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,055
Exist right now but already

115
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,639
Turn it into a poultice Dan and you use that

116
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,967
To heal the ills of society

117
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
By a generous money to a bail fund or local charity

118
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,839
Did you mean wormwood

119
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Totally effect

120
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,679
Is it

121
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
Okay fine

122
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
Is something from Disney

123
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,359
Alright

124
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:40,159
Is it just me or is the last ingredients

125
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:46,559
You need to put it in

126
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
I always thought that

127
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,543
It's also a

128
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,359
It's promising when I was like 9 years old

129
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:05,759
Beer brewing

130
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:12,159
We're out of Maryland okay that's probably about it

131
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,743
So probably

132
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,047
Could be possible

133
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:24,447
Do Jordan

134
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
And

135
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:29,055
That means before Trump's tax story Broadway

136
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,871
Sure

137
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
His response to that is

138
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
Here's not a contact dropped from Today Show

139
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,303
Avista totally

140
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:56,447
Emails again this is like there's a bridge

141
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
It's totally that

142
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:04,127
It's not it's not a relationship

143
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,967
Do those cost

144
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
And Alex got a pretty early this morning

145
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
On the 28th

146
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
He's got chills

147
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
The multiplying

148
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
I'll check your surge protector

149
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
Because

150
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
Weird noise

151
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:45,343
Yeah a little bit of a horse kind of action going on there

152
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Cuzmi

153
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,303
Vine

154
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,703
3 minutes of chill

155
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,103
Experience

156
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:16,575
Attack if I've ever heard one

157
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,647
Fire lights

158
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,999
3 minutes 40 seconds

159
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,119
There's some sort of a report

160
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,983
Headlines

161
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
He wanted to talk about

162
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,519
Immediately

163
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,879
Through the House Majority political action committee

164
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:29,535
It was essential to have more Democrats in the house

165
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
It's a winner word determined by January 6th

166
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,911
2020

167
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
The Electoral College

168
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,079
Only set up his letter in response to comments Trump made at a rally in Pennsylvania

169
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:47,199
I don't want to go back to Congress either even though we haven't

170
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:56,671
According to the Constitution the House vote for presidency does not by actual house members

171
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,935
As it stands now it's broke down on Purely party lines

172
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,727
Which is what Trump was talking about

173
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Which is what

174
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,311
Fundraising letter

175
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
This is poo plan

176
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,223
It's her trying to raise money to elect more Democrats by warning that this

177
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:26,623
Clearly something

178
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,671
Are you democratic

179
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
This plan would not work

180
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:35,327
As always Alex is taking the Democratic response to something Trump says and claiming it's proof of their plan

181
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Now

182
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
Do what your response was

183
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,799
First color of American history

184
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
Agrees with what he wanted

185
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,223
President

186
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:58,623
Kristin Davis

187
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Proven

188
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
3 Senators approved offense

189
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,535
President by the house

190
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:11,423
Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr

191
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,799
Experience along with other frustrations

192
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,639
Which in addition to other issues are resolved

193
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,223
He made it to electrical cast separate votes for President and Vice President

194
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,551
Where previously they just forgot the most

195
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,111
Whoever came in

196
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
System

197
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:39,327
It was kind of amazing how stupid it was

198
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,423
John Quincy Adams who actually ended up second place in the Electoral College

199
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Behind

200
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
A jacks

201
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:50,335
Between atoms and Speaker of the House Henry Clay

202
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:56,735
Which will

203
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:03,135
But that's because he was a terrifying idea of a president president

204
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,463
He was a terrifying monster of a present

205
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:11,327
If you if you go back and you look at the circumstances surrounding 1824 election

206
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,911
Intention of

207
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:21,311
Maybe maybe right.

208
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,615
Situation

209
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:29,503
Leaving that aside Alex has never happened in modern

210
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,623
American history more than 0 times

211
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,767
Hugely out-of-the-ordinary

212
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:47,167
He doesn't know anything about history

213
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:53,055
An idiot even like I'm not saying you're stupid even you

214
00:18:54,847 --> 00:19:00,991
Next

215
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:05,855
You do yourself a lot of history disagree

216
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,815
Wait that happened here

217
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
History all the way up until like

218
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
What would the modernaires like 1918 or something like that

219
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
How stupid America was the

220
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
History makes you admire

221
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:38,623
History of the American exceptionalism

222
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,183
It really disabuse you of the notion I like

223
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:46,047
We are so great

224
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
Is back to talking about

225
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
Constantly

226
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:33,407
Don't they have a Plan B pill everyone Zoo

227
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,855
Yourself

228
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
Only able to stop playing even here

229
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,047
Edmodo

230
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
He was in a bad mood

231
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,375
So I made up plan B

232
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,983
Still on plan

233
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,311
Responsibility

234
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
When I get to murder everybody

235
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:21,792
And I kind of wanted to happen text

236
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:28,960
He's having a chill State about

237
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,776
Propaganda campaign

238
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,616
Alex believe that it's about how China made up the idea

239
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,504
Virus or social control

240
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:48,160
Actually I don't think I would just read this article which is actually

241
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,720
The media to promote their older response to the virus

242
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,024
Better in hindsight

243
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,120
Right right

244
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,680
Why can't the Chinese government clearly paid for box

245
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,240
To promote their response to the virus

246
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:08,640
Course pretty speculative territory like the idea

247
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,712
Walking down to the world in order to help bring about a socialist world

248
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:18,368
Assumptions being made along those lines

249
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:30,144
The Chinese government

250
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,704
Articles written by guy named Michael Singer

251
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
Twitter account

252
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:45,504
Is a Twitter account which is opened in August 2013 but the earliest tweet that appears in the timeline

253
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:50,112
From June 30th

254
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
About China

255
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,256
Okay it's just everything since then has been

256
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
Anderson Lee

257
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:03,168
You can find his LinkedIn page fairly easily and it turns out he's a federal and international Tax Lawyer

258
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,800
Which makes his expertise just lightly outside the realm of China's trying to run a psyop to control the world.

259
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,616
Don't know if International tax

260
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Draw you to that

261
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,320
Conclusion your arm saying like is there a certain tax code

262
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,720
We know it's a propaganda campaign to try and turn the world into a social I'm not sure man are you sure

263
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,048
I don't have anything to go on here

264
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,632
Just everything I can tell makes me think that this guy

265
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
Writing an article

266
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,240
Doesn't have that much weight

267
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,056
Interesting

268
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
Just think

269
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,128
Skip the wet when it drifts into like

270
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,456
This is all fake

271
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
Alex's big narrative

272
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:54,368
A lot of it is like

273
00:23:54,624 --> 00:24:00,000
Vagina

274
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
And iPad

275
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
Does

276
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
The op-ed

277
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,240
Mention China creating vampires and hiding them within their homes and

278
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:16,640
Play metal jury still out on the road

279
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
Vampire

280
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,992
Luke

281
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,400
Look at these

282
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
She says she will decide

283
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:51,968
Owl

284
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,048
Pelosi is third in line for the presidency after the Vice President in the event that there needs to be like a transference of power

285
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,704
The second thing is that idea that the house may vote on who wins the 2020 election if it's not decided by January

286
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:19,872
Alex news literally nothing about yourself

287
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
This is stupid because there are rules

288
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,784
Operate when they're voting for

289
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,624
This is very clear if you know anything about American history

290
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,696
The house can only

291
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:40,096
3 V receivers in the general election so it wouldn't even be possible for Pelosi to vote for herself

292
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,936
Asian goes to the house

293
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,544
Do surprisingly win the election

294
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,128
In the 1824 election

295
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,232
The Speaker of the House powerful Congressional

296
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:13,632
However

297
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Hyper houseboat

298
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:21,312
Dysport

299
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:27,712
Atoms made Henry Clay Secretary of State

300
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:34,112
Government before in the past that people who have been friends of the president who suddenly got

301
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:44,096
How little I take the time to examine

302
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:50,496
Abnormalize to my history

303
00:26:54,336 --> 00:27:00,480
Accidentally turned into a good person

304
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,784
This guy's a f******

305
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,832
Anthony became a good person Evers like

306
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,672
I was just forget about it it's your 58 if you're good dude

307
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:28,896
50

308
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:35,296
Yeah but we need to realize that a president was also a sitting Supreme Court Justice your like this can't be real

309
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
Corky

310
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,256
It's literally spelled out of the 12th Amendment that only the top three receivers could be considered for the house

311
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
In case they have to vote

312
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
For the president

313
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,400
We seen it play out past elections is not on president

314
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:56,800
Alex just seems to know nothing about the Constitution or history because if you did

315
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
By way of this house about

316
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,248
She couldn't be considered for that.

317
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,600
This would never happen

318
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,392
Just Alex talkingshit

319
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Just

320
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
Yeah pretty much

321
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:20,608
Excited because David has been putting on speeches in the UK

322
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:27,008
Covid-19 great I hear

323
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
Police

324
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:38,272
Protestors or protesters

325
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,552
Crowley

326
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,344
He seems to be in

327
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,464
Favor of it

328
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:51,840
He's fixing to be worst thing in the world when it's being directed

329
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:58,496
Towards he like there's something inconsistent about that but I can't put my hand on it

330
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:02,080
A little something right

331
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:06,176
Trump rallies that Alex plays

332
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
Emily has John

333
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,280
We're humans were red-blooded what we're facing

334
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
Alright buddy

335
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,104
Okay that's

336
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
It's going to be 8

337
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
Citation

338
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:38,592
Alex come on man seems like he should be very aware though

339
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:42,176
That he has also been the victim of exactly that's it

340
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:47,296
Like he was supporting Trump because he thought he was going to be taken along with the ride

341
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,976
Between

342
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,768
Is that not possible for him

343
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,728
I've realized

344
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
Boo

345
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,544
I love

346
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:17,248
Just like you figure it out movie

347
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,368
Governor needs

348
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
Trampoline

349
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:28,768
Play character now

350
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,520
Unfortunately

351
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,848
Using our skills as

352
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,688
Just as public speakers we could run circles around

353
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,344
We could just lie like him easy just saying we we don't have

354
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:00,512
We don't have years of like baggage

355
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:09,728
They life

356
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:19,456
Who is WhatsApp

357
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:25,856
Videos

358
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:31,232
You guys better

359
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,280
I think

360
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:39,424
Videos of Alex

361
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,032
David Icke is a turd in the punch bowl

362
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:49,152
You used to say to make you look bad

363
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,224
Your conspiracy right-wing Patriot world

364
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,856
Uur

365
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:04,256
Spending your time celebrating

366
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:10,656
I can make you look worse than a turd in the punch bowl

367
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,640
Seems like he's run out of creativity run out of options

368
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Bucket list

369
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
Why not

370
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
Call Sasha

371
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
Soros

372
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,624
Probably reach the point where like

373
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:08,512
Project Veritas releases don't even like intrigue

374
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:14,912
Solar still

375
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:21,312
That's what I'm mad at is that

376
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,128
Veritas video

377
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:30,528
No article

378
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,856
Skin care

379
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:40,256
Disturbing thing that anybody credibility

380
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,584
Brazenness

381
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
Well right

382
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,936
They've been wrong all the time or ever

383
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:55,872
Here's another time seems to me to be just a bummer it's the same

384
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,200
Reached it seems okay to me at 3 to Jacob Walter

385
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
Where is

386
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:05,600
I'm not even interested in what is news Dante's or whatever

387
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:10,464
Near we go again you guys have your fun with your b*******

388
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,864
Some D constructions of this new video that's okay Scott and I'm

389
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
The level of like

390
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,544
I care to debunk now it's meteorologist played a clip of Sharknado that's what level

391
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,872
Research and reality we're dealing with here

392
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:33,248
Or yeah I was trying to think of another one of those movies

393
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,088
Show David Icke

394
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:44,512
I wish I wish it was just that guy so f****** dumb

395
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:48,608
A prophet little bit about his career

396
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
My broadcast

397
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
2020

398
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
Predicted

399
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,416
David I could not go on Alex's showed predict that stuff

400
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:18,816
By the year 25 years ago is gas-lighting

401
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:25,216
95 pretty strongly promoted the protocols of the Elders of Zion

402
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,056
Oh no

403
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:35,712
0410 like

404
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,808
Unfair

405
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,832
I don't give a s***

406
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
Leaving David Icke earlier career aside

407
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
Because

408
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:53,120
Even Alex a turd in the punch bowl

409
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,400
Is current

410
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Career

411
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
Had some problems

412
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,240
Like what

413
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,568
Solution to tyranny

414
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
What

415
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,944
The notion of self-respect is the thing is broken down all tyrannies is such a stupid and meaningless idea that I have no.

416
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,344
The even address it is a serious thing that someone say

417
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,696
Self respect

418
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
Very very f*****-up

419
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:03,008
If you believe that all tyranny of destroyed by self-respect then there's never been a situation where tyrants have existed except

420
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:07,360
This is where the people they were

421
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:11,200
There's a pretty nice version of victim if I were Alex

422
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
I would ask

423
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
The bought this phone

424
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:17,088
Did the Jews in Nazi Germany just not respect themselves enough

425
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:21,184
Did the Native Americans

426
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,328
Is the actual problem with the Chinese government don't respect themselves

427
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,936
You can easily sell this mentality is painfully childish and has no relationship to the real world

428
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:38,592
All this is an attempt by David Icke to paint himself as the only person that the real answer to the problems of the day

429
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,920
We should respect ourselves and others

430
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:51,648
You're going to find yourself subject of tyrannical rule really a lot

431
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
So here's the thing

432
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,632
I bet really

433
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
Is it

434
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Alright

435
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,264
When they got the Tyrant they want the only thing that stops tyranny

436
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
Is self-respect

437
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,736
It seems like the only way Tyron sleeve is in Chains or in a body bag

438
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:21,344
Y'all seem strange different versions of tyrant

439
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
Fight against

440
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
Dan

441
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,208
It is strange how that works

442
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
I wonder I wonder why that is case

443
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:34,400
I think I picked sides

444
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
I can't

445
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:39,776
I can't stress

446
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,568
Show little people

447
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,592
People like David Icke

448
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
I expect

449
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:50,016
Nothing from have nothing

450
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:55,904
Really stupid David

451
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,304
Oh my God

452
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
Alex interview

453
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,632
Levelland phone

454
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:11,264
You respect yourself just I don't

455
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,544
Yeah

456
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,080
That's how we doing

457
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:18,432
Torrid tear down that brick wall mr. Gorbachev I have finally self-respect

458
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,160
Respect yourself

459
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,744
But this has the same

460
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,144
Hey you know if you stand up for yourself

461
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,544
People together because you're only one guy the other people

462
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:51,200
I mean may work

463
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,808
Teaching a child

464
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:01,696
Or whatever

465
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,744
No no

466
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,584
No I mean business interpretation

467
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,632
Interpretation of that would be like

468
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,912
It has to

469
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,728
Can't simply acquiesce

470
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,264
To the terror

471
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,848
You know like if everybody respects themselves

472
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,664
They won't acquiesce to tyranny but that's

473
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,040
Still stupid b*******

474
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,064
Complexity

475
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,464
Life of how people actually live

476
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,864
Themselves

477
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,656
Respect for myself

478
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
Where

479
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
Where

480
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
Is it not

481
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
What

482
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
Yeah man

483
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:14,143
It's not even just made it anymore

484
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:19,007
Well obviously at aliens from outer space the Bible says it

485
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:24,383
Set the Bible says aliens are real

486
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,407
Not debated

487
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:31,807
Anymore

488
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:46,399
You almost came out and he was like I look aliens has been controlling Human Society

489
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
Kill 7 billion

490
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:52,799
Removing the wrestler

491
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,503
So and two-time Oscar Award nominee

492
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
I can't

493
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,391
Tell you anything about vampires who are we have no updates on vampire

494
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,695
Another

495
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,023
Sort of character of the Sci-Fi Realm

496
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:17,631
David Icke

497
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,423
It is not that

498
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
It is cyborg

499
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,239
That's my favorite rhetorical trick

500
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:58,079
I do love the Rays

501
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,663
Do you know the first case of covid

502
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:14,975
Do you know why they want to turn this into cyborg

503
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:21,375
Just got f****** high and watch the episode that had the Borg Next Generation

504
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,423
Tom Hardy's finest worth

505
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,471
God it's just

506
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
Painful

507
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
It's just painful

508
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,335
I think this is really interesting because

509
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:35,455
He's talking about these cyborgs said he calls the psychopath naturally

510
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:42,623
Makes a clarification here that I thought was going to go the exact opposite direction that it does

511
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
Human

512
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Beside

513
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:37,151
Now I'm going to pause right there because

514
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,199
I'm speaking metaphorically

515
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:45,599
I will come out for once in my not while listening to that not once a day

516
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,999
I think he was not being 100% literal speaking with terms

517
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:18,623
Technology

518
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:32,959
It's like

519
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,495
Alright look just

520
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
Just to be clear

521
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:42,431
I'm not talking about anything anybody knows exists

522
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:53,439
This is like Isaac ocean it is like Isaac Asimov nevermind

523
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,279
Are somebody

524
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:08,031
Counterpoint

525
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:14,687
I'm talking about something

526
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:19,551
If you don't even know

527
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:25,951
I think we should be run by AI machine learning

528
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,999
Machine learning is tackled go

529
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,303
And turned it into something that is

530
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,423
Inconceivable and they just wins all the time against the top go players in the world

531
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,775
You feed all of human history into an AI and machine learning

532
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,055
And it's going to be like

533
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,663
The only time good things happen is when people cooperate with each other

534
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
So

535
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:51,551
I don't think it's going to make the the pull the trigger kill all humans thing I think it's going to be like

536
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,343
We can't allow them to govern themselves

537
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,111
Cops are stupid

538
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,647
We just will take care of it

539
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,695
Are you going to be happy that's my guess

540
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:03,839
That's right. I'm not sure I agree with you 100%

541
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:09,983
Tougher for me to support you in your bed for despotic leader

542
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:16,383
But you have some interesting ideas

543
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
And everybody gets

544
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:23,551
To kill me

545
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:27,135
Look at the world right now

546
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:33,535
The world in your

547
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:39,935
Where are you

548
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:46,335
I can't support this dictatorship it has flaws

549
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,759
Is not good

550
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:59,135
Dishonesty what I cannot get behind.

551
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
Israelite

552
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,535
Alex is talking about

553
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,607
Watch some videos

554
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,167
Police

555
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,703
Bye.

556
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,519
We learned

557
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,335
Not all humans either

558
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,127
Human behavior

559
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
They're coming for her

560
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,703
Empathy is apparently genetic

561
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,519
He said stuff like that a lot

562
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,055
Every single time

563
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,335
It's bad

564
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,663
Yeah

565
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,111
Really f***** up 100% against you

566
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:06,207
Evil

567
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:11,071
Admittedly there are genetic human population

568
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:17,215
You know

569
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:21,311
Things that are genetic like empathy

570
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Sure

571
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
Brother

572
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,759
Has a complaint about the alternative media

573
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,295
Complained

574
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,063
That

575
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,599
Honestly

576
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,415
I know you could hear this isn't calling out out

577
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,207
It's not meant to be

578
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,791
He's saying he's a guys like

579
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,863
Tell people not to wear masks

580
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:52,287
Put your money where your mouth is

581
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,407
I feel like I could be like

582
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:01,759
Why do you stop f****** trying to make money off of

583
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
Wow

584
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
Won't you

585
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,967
Going into a shop

586
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,247
With a mask on

587
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
Longboard

588
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,215
Broke

589
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
Icracked

590
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,079
Oh no it's never going to end

591
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,871
Just never going to have never

592
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:06,527
The power of the way David Icke is trying to

593
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:19,583
Power of oppositional Defiance to annoy everyone around you

594
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,143
It's just one letter off

595
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,983
Mister real opportunity for a follow-up book

596
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:32,383
Wrap up their interview and I who cares I mean wow

597
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,455
Oppressively dumb interview

598
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,367
Impressively bad

599
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,183
From break

600
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
And

601
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,255
He's real excited about his show

602
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,127
Subway

603
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,919
Angry ocean

604
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
Price

605
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,887
Is happening

606
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:51,743
What is the answer to civilization in society as we like this

607
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:57,887
Play necessarily rude

608
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:03,263
Cruise possible does this dress make me look good no

609
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:09,663
I've been thinking what's wrong with you

610
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,687
Listen to

611
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:17,343
Alex criticism well

612
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:24,511
You know I think a great conversation stupid

613
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,559
Dub dub

614
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:34,751
I can't imagine what you suggested he would be interested in

615
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,055
Gauging

616
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,359
Incredibly rude to the point of

617
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,919
I just pointing out all of your flaws like

618
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:48,575
God damn you're so stupid don't you remember the Golden Rule treat others the way that you

619
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:54,975
Alright so here's some hard truths or was that

620
00:54:55,231 --> 00:55:00,351
When you talk about a star-studded show you are talkin about any show other than this one

621
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,887
Oh God

622
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,423
Paul Joseph Watson

623
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
Someone who

624
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,751
Is a real loser

625
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,543
Oh yeah James O'Keefe

626
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,871
Someone who was an embarrassing loser

627
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
David Icke

628
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,943
Someone who you

629
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,223
Yourself Alex

630
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,295
Pink sucks

631
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:25,439
Call Marisa

632
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,079
Weather

633
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
Coronavirus

634
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,807
People in the US

635
00:55:56,415 --> 00:56:02,559
Many media Outlets have not recorded on this server but Infowars

636
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:05,375
Misleading information

637
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,167
This is a report that was released by

638
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,727
Consulting firm called text to CNC

639
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:14,847
Curious at all about this about why the methodology

640
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:21,247
The biggest use the meaning of responses to determine the average

641
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,575
Which would be the appropriate way to reflect data like that

642
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:30,207
When you take something like the survey is meant to report

643
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:36,607
Your figure is going to be heavily affected by outliers in the data

644
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:44,287
That the David Sipe represents billion people

645
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,431
You can't be doing 10 billion

646
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:54,527
For instance in this case both act for the text

647
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:58,111
CNC reports claim

648
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,159
7% of the population had died

649
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:04,767
From covid-19

650
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:10,399
Over 50% of respondents answered 1% or lower

651
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:15,263
People who answered with numbers in the range of 20% or higher

652
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:21,663
But there wasn't none significant number people

653
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:28,063
Relative speed 50% Ohio

654
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,655
F****** around or whatever determine

655
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:48,543
People having a race

656
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:52,127
Pull factor estimates

657
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,151
50 medium

658
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,431
Average of responses

659
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:58,527
Would be somewhere close to 1%

660
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:04,927
It substantially lower than the 7% at this report claimed by some dodgy media

661
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:10,815
Yeah, this report was ignored by legitimate Outlet is it because they were afraid because there's a cover-up

662
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:14,911
It's because the methodology was flawed and it didn't meet there at Oriel standard

663
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:21,055
People like Paul and Alex have no such standard

664
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,615
As if there were no problems with this survey

665
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,151
And that's what

666
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:32,319
And then complaining that no one else is reporting it as proof

667
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,159
Information I would believe from

668
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:40,767
Any of these people would just be like suddenly all this Saturday turn and look up into the sky in the election

669
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,863
Where is it I have to find it we can use it

670
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,167
If it helps

671
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,983
Somewhere in the world

672
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:55,359
So into a mood and

673
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:23,775
He doesn't come back in on the break

674
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:36,319
Intimately I couldn't care at all about their interview

675
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,879
Whatever he's like

676
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,695
President

677
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:48,351
I was listening to that when he's like I can see it I can feel it I can taste it like

678
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:54,751
Yourself

679
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,335
I was like well

680
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,383
You had your chance

681
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,479
Tower anyway so export our

682
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,503
Now some other host

683
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,783
I'm taking over so

684
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:15,743
What is disaster

685
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,887
Episode

686
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:28,543
Am I surprised by that Dan am I surprised

687
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,079
You

688
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:36,479
For somebody whose only outlet for information

689
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:43,135
You can be forgiven for not knowing that that story broke

690
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,279
Nothing

691
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:55,935
Just nothing just pretend it didn't happen doesn't exist something to talk about

692
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,471
Pretty regularly

693
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,287
Is whenever it's something really bad

694
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:05,407
You know how every news Outlet

695
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:11,807
CNN's got it on there in minutes Guardian got live

696
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,927
At least a couple hours

697
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:17,951
Fox News

698
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,487
Has taken their time

699
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,887
Has really developed a good spin on it

700
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:30,495
Called in that breaking kind of news story

701
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:36,895
And that takes time and they're professionals it really good at it

702
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:42,527
Isn't even a story that he's interested in

703
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:46,111
And James O'Keefe

704
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,391
Being about

705
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
I think

706
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,583
Speak

707
01:01:55,839 --> 01:02:01,215
Do like this being a very dangerous story

708
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,519
It seems like it would be much easier to spin

709
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,871
Galax Mikey of the Maya

710
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
Cuz it's it's

711
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:15,039
Inconceivable

712
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:18,367
To have lost a lot of money

713
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,183
I have paid more taxes than Trump

714
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,975
I need to find his lawyers

715
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,047
Like at the very least one of us

716
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,863
Exactly

717
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,447
Rudy Giuliani

718
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:38,847
He's going to get you

719
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,895
It's so easy to be like

720
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
This guy is rich

721
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,223
He didn't pay as much taxes in you

722
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,759
Then you is that fair

723
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
Come on

724
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:52,927
Easy for Alex

725
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,743
Super

726
01:02:55,999 --> 01:03:02,143
Put upon by the Federal Reserve

727
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,167
Great

728
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,959
So we should be cool with this

729
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,519
Super billionaire

730
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:13,919
Not screwed I can't how many people

731
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,455
There's an astonishing number

732
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
Who are like

733
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:18,783
Waytogo

734
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:25,183
Get your money away from the government like they're so happy

735
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:31,583
Even

736
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:47,967
Situation

737
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:51,295
Where would you like

738
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,623
I don't know I'm I'm conflicted on whether I

739
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:58,207
Disable this is surprising or unsurprising that there's like absolutely

740
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,791
No mention of it in these three hours

741
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:02,815
I'm surprised

742
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,583
Sing to me

743
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,863
What you going to say about it

744
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:15,871
He lost it because one reason is

745
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,431
Lost a $1

746
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:24,831
And if it was for a TV show that you should never have been a part of because it was entirely built around an image

747
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:29,183
We know now

748
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:29,951
Is

749
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,511
Distill lost money

750
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,071
After we got all that more money was like

751
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:41,471
Now I can really lose a lot of money

752
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,287
There are other reports yet

753
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,335
Come out even as we're recording this

754
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:51,711
The Pacific

755
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:58,367

757
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,863
Be at like

758
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:15,007
Hundred percent the president was in violation of the Constitution from Dave

Would make sense

950
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:23,935
That was what I thought was going on in the business for 10 years is going to be like

951
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:30,847
Infowars is where I'm going to finally retire

952
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:51,071
Make checks out

953
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:03,871
The car wash.

954
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:08,735
There was a crew of fifteen-year-olds yeah you're going to say some Alex Jones

955
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,527
Hate

956
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,295

My comrade

961
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,607
Investigate the right way

962
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,399
They don't really

963
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,191
The shame

964
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,287
Cuz I am going

965
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,223
Sheet metal

966
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,343
You put that support

967
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111

970
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,327
Whatever

971
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,095
Anyway

972
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,399
That's Oklahoma

973
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,519
6

974
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:07,871
Dubai

975
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,639
Jordans

976
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,943
The person's name was gator

977
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:11,967
Do you know

978
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:12,991
It could be

979
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:19,391
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

980
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,951
She was going to call

981
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:25,535
Always very difficult for me

982
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,119
With specific

983
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:37,055
Giving specifics on his faults with me because

984
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:43,455
That deserve attention to our far more than I would ever be able to numerate

985
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:46,271
How many things that are localized that are

986
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:51,647
A people who are in foreign countries and all around the country live up to our show

987
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,695
Add the priorities for everybody

988
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:57,279
In their own communities in their areas is very difficult for me

989
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,839
To think I have any real understanding of

990
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:03,679
So whenever we say

991
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:08,031
Get more specific about it is because

992
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,567
Are you the person listening

993
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:15,199
It might be something that I could have no idea about and I don't want to

994
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:15,967
Take

995
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,783
Our audience and monetize toward

996
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:22,879
Even a good cause an Xterra

997
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,951
And Chicago

998
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:30,047
Dispensary depository like

999
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,351
I don't want all of our listeners

1000
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:36,959
To donate to them area

1001
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:42,847
Said I'm also not averse to people

1002
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,151
Promoting something that's important

1003
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,175
Like

1004
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,711
It's a balance

1005
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,295
It it something it's incredibly

1006
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:55,391
Difficult to understand like to know what to do with sure

1007
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,183
I try and focus on

1008
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:01,535
Like personally my my two things are like especially right now

1009
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,887
Food and housing so I try and look out organizations in Chicago

1010
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,447
And really research the Sham cuz a lot of them

1011
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:12,031
There's some places that you can give money to that are

1012
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:12,799
F****** b*******

1013
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:15,616
So do some research on that but

1014
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,640
As far as

1015
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,688
Protesting stuff go

1016
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
Medics are

1017
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:26,112
Huge Medics are absolutely strongly recommend people do that

1018
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:31,744
Citizen journalists Gordon to support his message 100%

1019
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:38,400
I don't get too specific about stuff is because

1020
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,192
I honestly also think

1021
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:40,960
Like that

1022
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:46,848
Part of being involved and engaged is the process of finding a thing

1023
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:52,992
And being able to tell whether it's legitimate

1024
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,832
Part of Engagement

1025
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:00,672
For what

1026
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:04,000
Priority

1027
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:07,328
Your position

1028
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:13,728
What you're giving money to

1029
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:17,824
What's the best way for

1030
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:21,920
And it's for you to be comfortable knowing that

1031
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:26,528
What you're doing is making a difference in the way that you want it to

1032
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,552
Totally

1033
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:34,976
Balancing the responsibilities of I know a lot of people are listening and I can hopefully encourage them

1034
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:39,328
And also knowing

1035
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:44,192
I could steer people towards something irresponsible

1036
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:46,240
It's a hard line to walk

1037
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,032
And the way that I think I could be

1038
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:49,824
Best

1039
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,384
On the right side of it is just to say

1040
01:21:55,712 --> 01:22:01,856
People in need in your area

1041
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:08,256
Susan causes and all that stuff I have my job

1042
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,048
Pet charities

1043
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:15,680
Yeah it's a it's a hard line to know exactly where it is

1044
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:22,080
And maybe we could do a little better

1045
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,432
Call Aaron

1046
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:29,504
And plug something in particular

1047
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,528
I am more than

1048
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:36,928
Kmart

1049
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:44,864
On Friday but until then we website

1050
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,640
Find a local charity or bail signed in your area if you're in Oklahoma City you know where to go

1051
01:22:56,896 --> 01:23:01,504
You can also call in number enough

1052
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,112
So you want to call and leave a message

1053
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:12,768
That is a number

1054
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:16,352
Are you mad at me

1055
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,984
Alex
