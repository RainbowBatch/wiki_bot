00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
There's real I should hire people to do this

55
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,384
To do a good job babe.

56
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
I am a fraud

57
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:42,208

63
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
On January 11th

64
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,712
Because

65
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
David Bowie

66
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,552
Passed away

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
Alex Jones

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,184
Beginning of the show.

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,583
Eulogize David Bowie weird it's not as bad

70
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
As you might expect

71
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,679
Very weird

72
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
Stephen Curry

73
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,687
Amor English

74
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
We're sorry to see him go

75
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,023
Condolences to his family

76
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
We just talked about

77
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
That's Amore

78
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,807
I wonder why my

79
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
Most common

80
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,535
69

81
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,991
I want my dad to be around as long as you can

82
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,087
Situation

83
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,183
That's your angle

84
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:59,423
There's no there's no moment where he's like condolences or like

85
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:04,799
He made a Monumental impact on Art in the world

86
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,639
I'm good lyrics

87
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
I don't want

88
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
I experience what is the biggest celebrities of the last 50 years who happen to have the same name

89
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
My dad died

90
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
And the only thing I can think about is

91
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
So my dad doesn't die

92
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,119
Do all of the millions of people who have been affected by his music

93
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
Which key is change genres

94
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Multiple stops

95
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,751
He has extended rights for people who

96
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
Really didn't have them

97
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,175
Representative

98
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
He's done

99
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
So many amazing things

100
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
More than

101
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,623
More hit records than you can possibly imagine you know what I just don't want my dad

102
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,207
Fair enough and if you think that was just a stray thought

103
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,535
To revisit the liquor in the show

104
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:17,759
How can you make David Bowie dying about y'all wait no nevermind there whatever David Bowie

105
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,087
Everybody made it about that

106
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,743
At first I thought was I want I know where I was when I got the news that David Jones

107
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:36,447
Oh my God I'm glad that we can have this kind of fun

108
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
Buffoonery but I'm just glad we can have these Flickr

109
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
Hours of Justin Bieber

110
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Amidst

111
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,735
Very deeply problematic things that happen on this episode

112
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:54,879
Like I said we're back in 2016 because we're trying to figure out the transition

113
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
In from Trump

114
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,487
Around the middle of December 2015

115
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,559
Do when does he go whole-hog into

116
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,655
Renaissance 2.0 Americana return

117
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,495
Yep

118
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,311
I believe it happens on January

119
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,615
I think it took him two weeks

120
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,199
That sounds about

121
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:24,575
Narrative transition

122
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,903
Yeah you're going to hear a couple things

123
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,487
In this episode that I think are like well to jump his happen

124
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
He is

125
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
And I think it makes it clear what the jump

126
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,119
Because Rodger stone is Gaston this episode again

127
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
I think that Alex accidentally make

128
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
Way to clear

129
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
That all of it is

130
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Just Rodger Stone

131
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
Spittin

132
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Interviewer

133
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103

00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
Also on the 11th

135
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Today

136
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
That we're going over and the 12th

137
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
Classic narrative

138
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,855
Who created Clinton

139
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Cast

140
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
On

141
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,511
And another

142
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:10,911
No it's a book about the Clinton the Clinton family's dirty

143
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,727
Deeds Done Dirt Cheap

144
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,103
Bon Scott

145
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,295
So I hope he doesn't die

146
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
We we have

147
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,927
He can comes on and he talks about the uranium one deal

148
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,511
Answer that narrative gets introduced on January 12th

149
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
Right now let's see what

150
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,631
It stayed right where it belongs in the past

151
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
Because I'm the garbage there's really nothing to do with it I'm sure that there's no way that they run with that narrative

152
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
What time is it

153
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,895

For any claims that he comes across hundreds of articles about this and I can't poop

171
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239

Growing humanoid

192
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
250 + 60

193
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Inside cow

194
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
We know what's going on

195
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
Because when I learned about it

196
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
Declassified

197
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,967
This is a math problem I don't care to do

198
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Alright

199
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
So you're growing human

200
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Do you want them

201
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
Look

202
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Humanoid

203
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,671
He does say that it's humans without heads at some point

204
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,279
All right. They don't want to have heads on them because it's freaky to the research

205
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
Chris

206
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
Second are ridiculous

207
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Nevermind

208
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
5260 lb

209
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
Alright

210
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
What's the average human birth weight

211
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
So this would be

212
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
3 year old

213
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:58,655
What kind of gestational.

214
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
Would you have to have in order to get something to

215
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Why

216
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:09,151
That's not what it's about none of these articles are about that

217
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,455
Other than like

218
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
If the scientists were just like

219
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
See how big

220
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,111
Grow a person without a head

221
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
Diane over there

222
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,767
That's the only legitimate reason for doing whatever it is

223
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:29,631
Because his whole thing about the chimeras

224
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,959
They're not humans they're not animals there the middle that they have no rights

225
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
Animals have rights

226
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
We've got dumped

227
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
It's well see so you're actually being like

228
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,431
This is a good reason to do it

229
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
It's not what's going on

230
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,783
Going to be clear about that

231
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
You can justify it

232
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
In the budget I'm all for growing headless humanoids

233
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:57,023
Yes on white genocide

234
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
Okay with headless

235
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,119
Chimeras being creative

236
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:09,311
I'm just excited that we found the day that that article came out in the it sort of became a very big

237
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
Piece of Alex Jones's narratives that's

238
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
So that's nice

239
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
Attract

240
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
I'm glad we have

241
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,223
The rest of this episode

242
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Is going to be a bit embarrassed

243
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
I think a lot of it is going

244
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
To demonstrate very soul

245
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
Does taking a certain piece of bait

246
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
His perspective is starting

247
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
To get overblown

248
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Like

249
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
I think that

250
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
I don't want to get biblical

251
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
But I think there's some sort of forbidden

252
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Fruit

253
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
But Alex is taking a bite of

254
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,527
And he seems the world a little bit differently

255
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
And it's not real

256
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
You starting to get

257
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,439
An illusory view of his own importance in the world

258
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
And his

259
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Place

260
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
And

261
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
Describe it is

262
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,863
He's come to a point where there are too many people

263
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
Manipulating him

264
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
Then he doesn't know what the wrecks

265
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,495
The chief manipulator the

266
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
It's driving him image

267
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Pacific Direct

268
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
Is Rodger Stone

269
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
Write this next clip

270
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
I think you will be able to see pretty clearly

271
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
But he has 100%

272
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
Taking Rodger Stone

273
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,807
Whatever Rodger Stone dangled out in front of him whatever promise

274
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,135
Of relevancy of making social change

275
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Gotcha

276
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
Hillary Clinton

277
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
How do you spell realize

278
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
We have here

279
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,751
No campaign

280
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,527
Nope that's incriminating

281
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:05,279
Whitestone

282
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
In the country

283
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,959
That's why works for Trump and he's gone.

284
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,847
World

285
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
Operations

286
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
To get people elected

287
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Other countries

288
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
Yes real serious

289
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
So

290
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,231
Rodger Stone has presented himself in a certain way

291
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
Cuz loving

292
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
If you parse

293
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Through

294
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
What Alex

295
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,911
Little piece of Truth

296
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,239
Did I believe you left

297
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
The campaign in order to do exactly this

298
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
I think that's true

299
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
And I think Alex is a

300
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Expressing it

301
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
But

302
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
Siri obviously

303
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
Which should not

304
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
Express

305
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,063
Terms of reality which is Rodger Stone left

306
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
The campaign 2

307
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Flip me

308
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,671
That's what the reality of the situation is

309
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
Not that

310
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Hey he left

311
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
To do good

312
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
He left

313
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
The left

314
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:17,215
To help the world

315
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,519
Political campaign

316
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,871
He left because if you was involved with the campaign

317
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
He couldn't be an arch propaganda

318
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,479
He couldn't remember you could actually

319
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
I don't know

320
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Is that legal

321
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,879
Legal form to work for Infowars

322
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
No it wouldn't

323
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,767
Was that a media Outlets

324
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
Something like that maybe

325
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,887
Do you have to disclose your conflict of interest

326
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,703
They don't follow any other

327
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
Ethical rules at Infowars

328
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,567
I don't know why they'd have a sticking point there

329
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,151
Be that as it may would come off as like if you was still involved in the

330
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
Campaign there's no way

331
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,015
The credibility would be there for the audience

332
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,087
Is of course

333
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
I was just

334
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,719
I like the ones with the with those people

335
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Can steal a

336
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
And the rich guys who

337
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
To conceal a

338
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,863
Write himself

339
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
Credits Alex just listed

340
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
Are stealing election

341
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,519
He's gone overseas and help

342
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:29,919
Run

343
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
Paul manafort of course the classic

344
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Example is

345
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,039
Ukraine

346
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,087
That was not good

347
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
General Flynn and turkey

348
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,671
Sure now that's starting to get flip

349
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,719
By the right-wing media

350
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,423
Dictator we love them here we love them there we loved it towed taters

351
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,215
Flicka the argument

352
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
Is being made by Alec

353
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,847
And that means that I imagine Hannity soon or maybe already and I just haven't

354
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
You know heard

355
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
The cleric who

356
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Blue Flame

357
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,295
And the other one work

358
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,367
To expedite legal

359
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
I've heard that

360
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Because

361
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:22,399
Remember

362
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,543
Seals that guy

363
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,943
Part of Batman is predicted

364
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:40,575
How to go to another country and extradite somebody illegal

365
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,439
I think Adobe a huge international ranking Bank

366
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,047
I think adults have always looked at Batman is sort of morally Gray

367
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
It's always been like

368
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
A grain of like

369
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,655
Little f***** up

370
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
Yeah

371
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,727
But I mean in this regard

372
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Sure

373
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,799
At least the president

374
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,407
Stone and his associates have been involved

375
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
Wearing out

376
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:11,295
That's perfectly listen to on the last episode

377
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,343
Rodger Stone telling Alex

378
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
Trump played him

379
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
This is

380
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,744
Stone playing Alex for Trump

381
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,352
As the interstitial as the way of getting in the door

382
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
In the present

383
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
Because he gets to openly

384
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,640
And you can't even say anything about it because even if you knew you were being tricked

385
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,688
What you don't reveal

386
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,344
Because what's the most important thing to your ego and your masculinity you admit that I've tricked you 42

387
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,744
That's the most humbling thing in the world

388
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
Is Rodger Stone going down

389
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,864
Through some of this Russia stuff not being

390
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,960
Indicted

391
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Yo

392
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:06,080
Secretly fighting against I believe he well

393
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:12,480
You could you could play that as like I got tricked FBI agent

394
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
Globulin

395
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,624
They sleep

396
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,928
Within the global Excel

397
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,232
That's been pretending to be

398
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,792
This is not a good angle

399
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:32,192
It's not like WarGames our way accidentally into a strategy that could work for him

400
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,616
I believe that at this point

401
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,920
The beginning of January 2016

402
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
Alex doesn't know what direction

403
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,784
He's got Rodger Stone pulling him in one

404
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,344
He has all sorts of other

405
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,904
People who are pulling him another Direction

406
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
As you can hear in this neck

407
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Text clip he's being f*****

408
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
With by every

409
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
Shooter Philadelphia police

410
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,096
Muslim

411
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
But you watch Boxing

412
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
Heather calling extremist

413
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,800
Milwaukee with Muslim country

414
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
I don't think they're all

415
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,152
What the folks

416
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
And by the way coming up

417
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,016
Paul Watson

418
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
3 minutes from exclusive

419
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,368
Flashlight

420
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,720
Next Wednesday

421
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,192
Muhammad was a beautiful

422
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,456
I've changed

423
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,272
But I don't want a Civil War I don't want to race war

424
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
Louis Farrakhan

425
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
I just got

426
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,096
Listen listen

427
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
Listen

428
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
From Jeff Bridges

429
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,728
Kurt Russell

430
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,080
Successful

431
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
Thoroughbred

432
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
Yesterday

433
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
So is this

434
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
Nonchalant

435
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,272
15 minutes

436
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,624
A million and a half

437
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,512
The Sunday show reaches 2 million people dressed really

438
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,056
Twenty-eight million people actually tune in every week.

439
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,616
So keep that in mind

440
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,688
Inflated

441
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,968
Stats that are coming

442
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,272
He has

443
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Vladimir Putin listen

444
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,136
Which we know, probably

445
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,184
From his contact with Russian intelligence

446
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,000
He was going to an interview with Artie

447
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,864
And I turned out to be a bunch of people

448
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
Listen to this next

449
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Flip

450
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,448
Because it explains

451
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,496
What happened with the Nation of Islam

452
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
When he went to go visit

453
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,872
This is embarrassing

454
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,040
I want to contact some of it

455
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
I disagree with

456
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
And and

457
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
Trying to build a better world

458
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,360
Because he's one of the leaders in the world

459
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
He's a big deal

460
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:07,232
I like that

461
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,816
New World Order

462
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
That he's been watching me for a long time

463
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,168
Computer on

464
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,432
Leadership

465
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
Businesses with big companies

466
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,584
Super serious super Focus

467
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
I was shocked

468
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Why

469
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,496
Barber shop

470
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,456
Vaccines

471
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Break

472
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,528
Like a fiddle

473
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:15,328
Computers and computers

474
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,912
Got to see through the Ring of like a

475
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,920
Rent out an office

476
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,480
It's torn down and put up

477
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
Exactly

478
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
Exactly this is

479
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Plastic

480
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
Softening technique

481
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:51,680
If there's one thing that I know about

482
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,704
Louis Farrakhan

483
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
It said he's not thrilled with the G

484
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
If there's two things I know without

485
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
About him it's video

486
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,640
Avery's fairly media-savvy

487
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,224
He knows be the sort of that he's survived this long

488
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,576
Fairly hostile media landscape

489
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
Yeah he knows some tricks

490
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
He's not going to like

491
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,488
You not going to go into an interview with Alex and not have like

492
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Some little tricks

493
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:20,096
Along the way in order to make it a more hospitable situation

494
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,632
So

495
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
He's got

496
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
He's got

497
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
Russia f****** with him

498
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
On one hand

499
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:30,336
You got Rodger Stone f****** with him now he has a Nation of Islam f****** with him for no reason

500
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:35,200
Like there's no endgame to that one

501
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:41,600
All accepted interview Mauser why I don't understand

502
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:49,024
I mean I imagine he might have had the same agenda that Alex had in terms of the interview which is maybe we can

503
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
We have

504
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
Very different audio

505
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:55,424
Maybe some of your people will maybe we can

506
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
Yeah but

507
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,472
The only problem is that

508
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
Louis Farrakhan

509
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,288
His positions are

510
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,312
So

511
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,336
Specifically

512
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
It's fairly black Supremacy

513
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
Analysis position

514
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,992
Play Loft

515
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,296
Alex is Lucifer's solidly wife

516
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,320
Supremacist

517
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:17,952
There's not a lot of opportunity for cross-pollination

518
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,232
No so that

519
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,792
In terms of that strategy

520
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
I don't know why

521
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:29,728
The other Russia Rodger Stone makes total sense

522
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
Imagine that if they were to sit down and talk to

523
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Heather

524
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,640
Other media Outlets would pick it up

525
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,664
King Louis Farrakhan

526
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,504
More media exposure Alex Jones gets more media exposure

527
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:47,136
It's a win-win for everybody yeah Fair times

528
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,464
But then I think there's also a small part of probably both of their minds

529
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
So they can reach date aunt

530
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,816
By convincing the other one of something

531
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,656
Really good I think they're probably I even watch the whole interview

532
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:02,752
Display

533
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,872
Let's just both agree to hate the Jew

534
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:13,504
I think that might be what they agree but just by calling

535
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
Next

536
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Alex

537
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,112
Does Louis Farrakhan impression

538
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Now I'm in

539
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
I think

540
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
I'll Trump baby the answer

541
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
Save America

542
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,472
I don't know how to say it because he's

543
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
Pinky really

544
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
Is outside the system

545
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,112
Donald Trump

546
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,904
So you talked to Paul Joseph Watson

547
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,720
Is on the line there is Farrakhan

548
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
Privately

549
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,048
Endorse Donald Trump

550
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:02,144
Interview with Louis Farrakhan from the final call

551
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,728
Editor Richard

552
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
This is a question

553
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
Assalamualaikum

554
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,104
On behalf of the Final Cut

555
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,408
The Final Call newspaper

556
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,968
Our staff and our readers we thank you for granting us this interview

557
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,552
Many news outlets have reported or perhaps Miss reported that you praised

558
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,856
Endorse the portador commended Donald Trump

559
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,184
What did you actually say and what's your view on Donald Trump

560
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
Farrakhan

561
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,280
I never endorse mr. Trapani

562
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,120
Can't do nothing

563
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:39,264
I never endorse mr. Trump or any of the candidates running for the nomination that would make them the leader of their party

564
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,336
I said if mr. Trump that I give him credit as the only wanted

565
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,152
I'm stood in front of some members of the Jewish community

566
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,968
And told them he did not need or want their money

567
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,816
You know what

568
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,864
If you're Alex Jones

569
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,936
And you hear Louis Farrakhan say I'm glad

570
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
Job stood up to the Jews

571
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
You're like

572
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544

He does to the Jews

575
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:22,272
He finished his answer by saying I could never endorse any candidate because

576
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,112
Which would save America from the wrath of Allah

577
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,768
Is really concerned about the wrath of other gods

578
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536

We worship poochie the dog for Thor

588
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512

00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,992
Scared

596
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016

600
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,584
The whole string of

601
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Got to get the Guess Who

602
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:48,032
The different company

603
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
Call Joseph W

604
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:02,624
Great tradition again he comes in for an interview and it's about the Muslim Rape Crisis

605
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
What's going on

606
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672
In Europe

607
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,744
Broken down into

608
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Detailed

609
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
Episode

610
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,328
Allah is over blowing

611
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Statistics

612
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,912
Issues certainly as there are in every country

613
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,800
Stuffed a lot of that

614
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
Fairly traceable back

615
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
Two Russian propaganda Outlets

616
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
Because they would like to

617
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,432
Destabilize

618
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
The European

619
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,040
Like to demonize Muslim

620
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,904
Difficult

621
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
You talk about

622
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
Because

623
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,232
You can't just be like

624
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:44,352
There this is b******* with

625
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
And this is

626
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,728
The problem is everybody

00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:54,592
Men problems not like us being there's no

628
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
Christ

629
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
There's no rape

630
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,200
Like that it's all propaganda

631
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
They are twisting it to make it look at

632
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,784
As if it is

633
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,112
A certain religion as opposed to an entire gender

634
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,208
It's the weaponization of misrepresentation

635
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,280
Statistics

636
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:19,680
All of these immigrants coming in or military

637
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,984
It's a fun game makes him a lot of money

638
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
It's not

639
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,800
Not trip

640
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568

641
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,128
The particular source

642

At the end of the

643
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,712
Deeply problematic

644
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
Just the report

645
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,816

00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
No

652
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,064
Christopher Cantwell

653
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,136
I think I've heard the name you obviously have

654
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416

As a Libertarian blogger

667
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
At the beginning of 2016

668
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,944
In this clip he's asked

669
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
He says

670
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,504
Trayvon Martin

671
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,296
Before 2016

672
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,648
And he gets himself in trouble

673
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,208
I might have

674
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,256
With that myself a white people

675
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:35,616
Oklahoma City Oklahoma

00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:41,760
Okay

677
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:48,160
Alright

678
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:55,328
You can remember Dylan roast

679
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,984
I'm I'm here to

680
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,824
More capable

681
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,944
Will come along and do that somebody like Donald Trump who does not give his daughter to a Jew

682
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
The Donald Trump

683
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,064
More racist McDonald's

684
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,720
Kushner faster walk around with that beautiful girl

685
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,792
So that's him before the Charlottesville rally

686
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Up to it

687
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,144
That's Christopher Cantwell

688
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,728
A source of information for Paul Joseph Watson

689
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,384
Now let's listen to him getting interviewed after the Charlottesville rally

690
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
Somebody like him

691
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
Say what

692
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
Most

693
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Republic

694
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,088
Android

695
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
The kind of thing that I

696
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,464
Of course I am his employees are following

697
00:38:54,976 --> 00:39:00,352
Information

698
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,056
You can take different roads to get to the same conclusion

699
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
It's the universe

700
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,944
It's always struggling in life

701
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,248
When you agree with the point that someone suck

702
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,368
Agree with someone who sucks at someone else talks but for totally

703
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,392
It's a disaster

704
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,440
So here's Christopher Stevens

705
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,280
Spielberg and the whole Indiana Jones franchise went off the rails

706
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Excellent

707
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
I agree with

708
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:38,496
Return of the Jedi know alright

709
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,176
So here is Chris Cantwell

710
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
The Charlottesville rally

711
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
Just to give you a taste

712
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,504
So how much of a douche

713
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,320
This guy is strong enough of a word

714
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,624
I'd say it was worth it

715
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,184
Resistance

716
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,256
Define that nobody on our side.

717
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Points for us

718
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
I hate you

719
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
The fact that

720
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
Not a bar

721
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448
People

722
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,056
We showed

723
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,384
We showed our Rivals that we won't be cowed

724
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,176
But the car that struck

725
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,200
A protest

726
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Unprovoked

727
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,856
That's not true and you know that it's not true you've seen the video

728
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,160
Seen a video I don't know much

729
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,488
Santa video.

730
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Okay

731
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,536
The video

732
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
Appears to show

733
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,840
Someone striking that

734
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,120
Wendy's animals

735
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,216
And he sought no way to get away from them except

736
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
Hit the gas

737
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,032
And sadly

738
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,616
It because our Rivals are a bunch of stupid animals

739
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,896
Sprint pay attention

740
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
Just get out of the way of his car

741
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,016
And some people got hurt

742
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
And that's unfortunate

743
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
Great

744
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:01,184
I am glad you're not

745
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,464
You don't plan

746
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,512
Cricket it's not good

747
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,072
This guy this Chris Cantwell

748
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,120
Come up with these feelings

749
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,680
A week before the Charlottesville rally

750
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:17,056
He had them in the beginning of 2016 when he was a quote libertarian blogger

751
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,896
Talking about how to arm yourself against Muslim rape gangs

752
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
I don't know man

753
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
I don't know

754
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
I don't know

755
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,976
It's not it's not like I wanted to know what your answer is

756
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,304
Know it well okay I like that

757
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,352
I like that as a

758
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
Application of

759
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,960
The absurdity of what we do but

760
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,544
And I know this

761
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Break everybody's

762
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,128
I like to believe in pacifism

763
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,199
Yeah I don't think violence is the answer

764
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:01,599
Chatroom to drink

765
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:05,695
With that guy

766
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,231
World War

767
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,815
Is not justified is not the only way that we would have sell things

768
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:15,935
Was the is there any diplomatic solution to a group of people committing genocide

769
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:21,311
No I guess I guess that really is the only situation so if

770
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,335
You're that

771
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
Guy

772
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,895
The only solution is

773
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,479
Tear him limb from limb Anita's finger

774
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
That gets me to my next

775
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
Point

776
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,319
Eating fingers is good

777
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,135
No there was a group called The Radical

778
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
To the group

779
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,695
Poland

780
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
That had a nationalist

781
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,511
Fascist rally

782
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
Over the weekend

783
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,607
Ironic

784
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
Polish not

785
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,191
They grew to the rally was in about 6

786
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,215
60000 people

787
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,799
I mean you'd be hard-pressed to say that all of them are straight-up not

788
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,847
But a lot of them were straight up not

789
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
Yeah

790
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
A quote from Wonder

791
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
The counter-protesters

792
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711
It's getting more and more vicious

793
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,759
Jacob

794
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,295
I can't do it

795
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:08,415
That doesn't counter-protesters stand behind a banner that read we are polish Jews

796
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,439
And surrounded by people

797
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,743
Quote we are really in fear

798
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:19,935
The radical camp followers argue on their social media that the influx of Syrian refugees

799
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
Into Europe

800
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,263
He's part of the conspiracy driven by the globalist

801
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:27,615
Who are working with Communists in the European Union to bring Muslims into Europe

802
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
And with them

803
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,175
Sharia law and homosexuality

804
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,807
Men are they getting American news media all right hold on

805
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:43,487
It says that the

806
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
The same f***

807
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,327
Can Shed Annette

808
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,863
God damn you just

809
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,959
One word out you have exactly the narrative that Alex Jones pictures

810
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,751
It's his entire worldview

811
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,799
Just change the word globalist for Jews

812
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:01,151
And it's coming out of the mouth of legit Nazis rallying in the middle of Europe

813
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
So

814
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,991
Man

815
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,623
We got a problem

816
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
It's like a brain

817
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,463
Something

818
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,487
People got infected

819
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:22,143
We were texting about this the other night

820
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
Is Justin

821
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:26,495
We were texting about this the other night the realization that I had that

822
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,031
I do believe that

823
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:32,383
Given a week or so to Pivot The Narrative Alex could convert all of his audience

824
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,943
Not all of it but a bunch of them into straight-up not

825
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,527
You could say something along the lines of like

826
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,343
About it there's just too many in the globalist

827
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,647
Structure it must be something about them

828
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,207
He could use some sort of rhetoric like that

829
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:49,023
And pivot his audience into a legit Nazi

830
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,303
Tea Party

831
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,327
And it would not

832
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,399
It would only probably turn off about 20% of his audience

833
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
If that

834
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,191
So

835
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,751
That's that's what is underneath

836
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,775
The surface of

837
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
How

838
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
Scared I feel

839
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,871
Motivated I feel too

840
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,663
Two black people

841
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,711
Cialix for who he really is

842
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,063
Deconstructed where they come from

843
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,343
And why he's lying

844
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,951
Really bums me out when people just want to laugh at him

845
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
Hitler

846
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,863
Before he rose to power

847
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,007
About him you can find looking through the Alexis Nexus yet and what have you about that

848
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:36,895
The password now apparently socialism for LexisNexis password

849
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
So I mean

850
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,527
Coming out to you later I'm just saying

851
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,575
Actually I don't think he would do

852
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,623
But it wouldn't be hard

853
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,695
No it's a very closely Pretoria

854
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
From where he's at

855
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,535
And how much is radicalized is audien

856
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,839
To follow him I mean we're seeing this

857
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,631
In the beginning 2016

858
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,935
How easy it is for him to go from

859
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,959
Trump is

860
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,751
Con man

861
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
Casinos in Baldwin

862
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,847
His audience called in and they all mirrors

863
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,151
He gets on board with Trump and his audience

864
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
Right but wouldn't

865
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
You say that

866
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,527
Essentially his audience already is not

867
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:19,647
Like he's just using

868
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
Hey guys

869
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,767
I don't do that

870
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,351
But he was like hey guys we're going to wear upside-down swastikas now

871
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,167
Which coincidentally look like regular old swastika

872
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,959
But they're outside

873
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
Cuz we're we're anti-nausea

874
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Bright

875
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,871
I don't like the word is what

876
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
It's

877
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,687
It's really just in the America

878
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,247
It's just the word Nazi

879
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,271
That is bothersome

880
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,343
All of the things

881
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,927
Still believe and say those are all fine

882
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,719
But if you call them Nazis

883
00:46:54,975 --> 00:47:01,119
Being like

884
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,911
Twitter outrage I'm not sure if

885
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
Thinking people on the writer Baker

886
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,727
This argument

887
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:09,823
I don't see no people coming out and saying that like

888
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,359
Nazism

889
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:16,223
Just a word that's being used to almost as a racial slur for white

890
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:21,599
And

891
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
Right

892
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,415
And the reason that I wanted

893
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,207
To get into this is

894
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,767
We throw the word around a little liberally

895
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:32,863
And the reason for that is because

896
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,751
To take a moment to recognize it when there are examples

897
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:39,775
Like this

898
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,079
And the weekend after this

899
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,871
Madrid Nazi rally in Polish

900
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
60000

901
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,711
Is a terrifying number it is a terrifying

902
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
Alex

903
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,271
Mobilized his audience

904
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,295
In such a way

905
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,111
Theorizing could happen

906
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,439
60000 people

907
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,743
Probably most of the Maria mobile

908
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
Small town

909
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:04,095
So

910
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,423
A large group of white knots

911
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
Suddenlink

912
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,263
Let's say Let's Move Along

913
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287

Clinton

917
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:25,343
His victim for high-class people and so that makes them more deserving of

918
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
Attention

919
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,159
Talks about how I

920
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,695
Clinton as a love child

921
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
Cajun food

922
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,327

00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,007
Plugs Rodger Stone the book

And in doing so

928
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
He accidentally

929
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,383
Reveals that he knows that another one of his contributors

Trump campaign

Bushes

Swift boat deal

939
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:41,631
This is a real swept out for the clintons and the bushes

940
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,447
You need to get the book infowarsstore.com

Bye-bye 2020

Reality is fungible

951
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
Absolutely

952
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:32,063
Turn on here is the clip that made me realize that Alex has

953
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,087
He has transition

954
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,415
That he is a full-on trump propaganda

955
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
On January

956
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,231
I was about to say

957
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:51,263
They're just Democrats who want to control the Republican party and that's why I finally about 3 months ago

958
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,311
Trump

959
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,383
Because there was any other strong leadership there was anybody telling like

960
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,087
Ensure our jobs will go but the coup de gras was

961
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,367
Money doesn't lie

962
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,927
He's not getting any big hedge fund money

963
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
Are tons of money from Robert Mercer

964
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Wow

965
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:17,375
All the big money's going to Hillary or Jeb Bush a Rubio

966
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
Trump

967
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,727
I'm sorry

968
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,591
That was shot I hope it comes from sweet pea

969
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,407
It's just proof it's a fact

970
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,479
On the sidelines

971
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,575
Because

972
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:46,047
No I'm going to do the Cowardly thing and let everything I've ever stood for be destroyed by this f****** orange

973
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,631
Monster I will let my entire reputation be cut

974
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,703
Essentially

975
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,239
Be that as it may

976
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:02,175
Is it the beginnings of it we don't have Americana 2.0 728

977
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:07,807
Better in that zone Proto x80 Proto

978
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,367
2.0 Proto 2017

979
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,183
He's there already

980
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:18,303
Just because I don't know maybe they're trying to impress Rodger Stone whatever whatever the case is

981
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,911
I think that

982
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,447
I'm going to play it

983
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,215
Episode

984
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,239
I think I have

985
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
A pretty robust

986
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,799
Theory as to

987
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,871
The reality behind all of the

988
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,711
Definitely rap

989
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:43,903
And the Raptors game in Alex's skin weird

990
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,439
Top-heavy

991
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,511
The globalist

992
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:54,143
A bunch

993
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,447
Eclipse that I think

994
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:59,007
Football sort of spell out what I believe is going on

995
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,031
We have two clips

996
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
That are

997
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,103
Call them fun

998
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,895
But they're Alex just getting lost

999
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,527
It isn't closest we get to fun

1000
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,207
Athletic

1001
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,767
Just like what I've been

1002
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
Working

1003
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:54,303
20 miles away

1004
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,263
Another time. Later I'll down there working on a ranch

1005
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,551
Discount

1006
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,647
New truck

1007
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,487
And then we all pulled out our KKK Hood

1008
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,279
Good Old Dairy Queen

1009
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:31,935
Peanut buster parfait my friend funny names

1010
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:39,615
I mean it just goes to Alex's fun narrative about all the trouble he had because he was too hot growing up and

1011
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
We know that you

1012
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,663
You can't eat a peanut buster

1013
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:48,063
Parfait wearing your KKK out over everything

1014
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,391
Playing Roblox with a bib

1015
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,671
Everyone knows that

1016
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:56,511
Everyone knows that that's a clan BBQs

1017
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,327
Why do they wear

1018
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,887
I would have suggested wearing something darker

1019
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,447
The stains better but you know what guys

1020
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:10,079
Nice a nice bit of Clorox bleach on there you'll be just my pain out

1021
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,383
No timeshare

1022
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,967
He's like I'll beat you guys all up

1023
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,831
I see that in like the

1024
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,695
Dystopian future that we're going to live in next year there's going to be like a Target ad like

1025
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:32,095
Are your cute KKK hoods a little bit Rusty Sunny did you use your robe with a bib again

1026
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,911
Honey I got baked beans

1027
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:41,823
Yep with that same bearded guy that every commercial now

1028
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,503
I shouldn't say back into that lost it

1029
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,271
Memories

1030
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:56,927
Absolutely not the point of this memory was I'm not in the KKK

1031
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,975
People up I like Spider-Man

1032
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,535
The fight

1033
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,815
Mexico play came from

1034
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,143
Not very long after this

1035
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,343
Because Dallas black folks

1036
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
Oh boy

1037
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,119
They just lay on the ground

1038
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:48,895
Ford truck

1039
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,135
Wait

1040
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,183
Water parks that are friends that are love motorcycle

1041
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:06,303
Think about that for two more seconds

1042
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,655
What's the gang have more guns

1043
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,959
Wouldn't it be more important to have a

1044
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,775
If everyone had guns

1045
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
If you want to pop it

1046
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
King Kong

1047
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,271
You said the n-word

1048
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:41,119
Your kind needs to go I'm so glad

1049
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:48,031
He goes into a long treaties after that

1050
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,567
He goes into a long treaties

1051
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,615
About how long

1052
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:56,223
We're going the wrong way don't know how to Rusk

1053
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,503
We don't know how

1054
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:03,903
How to clean a stove

1055
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:08,255
You're not allowed to have the internet

1056
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:14,399
Go Unabomber it somewhere else make millions of dollars selling nootropics

1057
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,447
A bizarre awful science

1058
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,751
Listen nobody knows how to clean up

1059
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,055
Borat

1060
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,127
Can you text brainforest

1061
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:28,223
Back in caveman days

1062
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:32,831
Back in caveman days they drink real bone broth Stanwell to be fair he wouldn't make that are

1063
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,927
We're coming to the end

1064
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,695
Hear this

1065
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,463
One more

1066
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,815
What I think is going on

1067
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,119
Is Alex's living in the beginning of 26

1068
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,423
16 and a tremendous influence

1069
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,703
Of influenza

1070
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,495
Does that he doesn't know how to negotiate

1071
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,031
Beyond that

1072
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,847
There are forces at play

1073
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,383
He doesn't realize

1074
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,735
I don't know how to do

1075
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,503
Describe that

1076
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,271
Exactly

1077
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:08,671
Without playing this clip so I'm going to play this clip and then I'll explain I thought I could do a setup but I can

1078
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
And when we have

1079
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,815
Iran

1080
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,887
Quran or we learn

1081
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,191
Russell's approach

1082
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Effexor

1083
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
Conservative

1084
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,823
I'm 1776

1085
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,599
Yes I mean miserable.

1086
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,927
Just shows how

1087
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
Popular

1088
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,655
Did you sound so crazy

1089
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,239
Even more wild than that

1090
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,567
Jasper's coming to look at it all

1091
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,615
The graphs are like this last

1092
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,407
Straight up

1093
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:02,943
It is Meteora

1094
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,735
So

1095
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,551
Listen

1096
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,623
Like it's more wild than you could ever imagine

1097
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,647
Cuz it's like 10

1098
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,183
No it's like Dave

1099
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:13,951
Andy

1100
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,487
Frankie B

1101
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:19,839
French

1102
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:27,519
Wahlberg and Mark Wahlberg

1103
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,591
Call being a good parent

1104
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,687
Mark Wahlberg is actually Donnie Wahlberg

1105
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,295
So when you talk about the ratings

1106
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
He does this

1107
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,623
He doesn't

1108
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:47,487
90 degree angle 45° angle

1109
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:51,327
Let's not descend to

1110
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,679
We could pin the rhetoric

1111
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,287
Literally that bad

1112
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,335
Here here's what I think is going on

1113
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,895
He says in the last six months the numbers have

1114
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
Absolutely

1115
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,735
That was you go to sites like Alexa

1116
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
You go to sites

1117
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,295
Like what

1118
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,599
And you go back to that.

1119
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,903
There isn't a meteoric jump

1120
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,183
And you know why

1121
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
Those sites

1122
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
Use verified

1123
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,023
Statistics

1124
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,047
So what you might

1125
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,887
Be saying is that right around the time when the Russians

1126
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,911
Started

1127
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,191
Fearing with the elect

1128
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,519
Perhaps they created a signal boost

1129
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,055
Of people who had

1130
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,103
Pro-putin ideas

1131
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,895
Therefore in

1132
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,175
Blading there

1133
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
Influence the numbers

1134
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,735
Gas

1135
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,503
That part

1136
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,271
Perhaps

1137
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,599
Alex doesn't really have that many though

1138
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,367
He is in

1139
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,135
Stead

1140
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,671
Hold it

1141
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,951
The Russian Bots

1142
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:52,511
I like to see English

1143
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,839
Yeah! Jump

1144
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:58,399
Statistics around the time are intelligent age

1145
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,703
It was when

1146
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,239
They started these operation

1147
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,823
Influence campaign

1148
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,103
Right in that window

1149
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,175
I do not think there is a coincidence

1150
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,455
Did Alex Jones

1151
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,015
Is one of the most pro-russian voices

1152
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,063
Outside of Dana rohrabacher

1153
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,111
Ania in Media

1154
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,207
That that is not a quince

1155
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,815
The Russian people telling him that Putin listen

1156
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,863
Rodger Stone

1157
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,655
Coincidentally coming in

1158
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,679
And giving Alex

1159
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
Solve it like it

1160
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,727
Too it's too much

1161
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,519
The timing of it is alright

1162
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,567
Very very suspicious

1163
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,591
Too obvious

1164
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,127
It kind of

1165
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,407
Hurtful yeah

1166
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,271
I still don't know how to work the Nation of Islam into

1167
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:55,487
Investigation yes I think that's a weird anomaly

1168
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:59,071
It just happens I don't think it's relevant

1169
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,863
Sprouts

1170
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,655
This is an old man murder have

1171
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,447
Yes okay

1172
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,007
Because

1173
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,031
I think

1174
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,311
At this point Alex

1175
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,847
Hayirli oblivious

1176
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,431
And I don't I don't know if he ever becomes aware

1177
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,503
The extent to which

1178
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,527
Scared

1179
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,807
In the present

1180
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:20,831
Isn't there

1181
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,367
The beginning 26

1182
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,719
He gets way more like in the lead-up to the Megyn Kelly in her

1183
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,535
Today's

1184
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
Use of being

1185
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,143
Parasite on an unlikely let's not put out this interview

1186
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,703
As if he was aware that something

1187
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,727
Come out right

1188
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,775
There's a part of me that believes

1189
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,591
He is afraid will come out is what he's

1190
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,383
Come to learn about what happened

1191
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,431
I think he's aware of all the

1192
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:54,623
When Breitbart release their revised numbers after they got rid of all that s*** there was an article in

1193
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,671
I believe in Vanity Fair

1194
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,487
I have that up here right now

1195
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,559
When they went from

1196
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,863
Like 500 numbers

1197
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,887
In the

1198
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:09,471
Top sites on the internet just overnight

1199
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,775
That was December of twenty

1200
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:17,151
16 coincidental and then dropped

1201
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,687
And the reason for it was

1202
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,223
Switching on and off

1203
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,039
The tracking of artificial numbers

1204
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
If you look at

1205
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,135
Obviously

1206
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,159
To Alex at that point

1207
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:28,927
Andy should have been like

1208
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,399
That's you might read headlines let's see what the headline number is it

1209
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,983
Analyze this dumb child is like

1210
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,079
Okay we don't need to read any articles that all let's just read headlines

1211
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,103
To see what he knows

1212
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,175
That's Trump's problems Mount breitbart's numbers are crater

1213
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,223
He could probably come up with another explanation

1214
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:59,647
I mean it's not a coincidence that that's December 2016

1215
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,695
December 2016 is when Alex

1216
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,487
Flips and ends up going with drum

1217
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,511
That's when he starts

1218
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:09,119
To see his meteoric rise in numbers

1219
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
Stop

1220
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:10,911
Anyway

1221
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,031
I'm glad we've been doing this for a year

1222
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,639
Our anniversary is coming up

1223
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,711
Is it

1224
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:30,111
Something like that so does right the beginning of January

1225
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,415
I don't know what had weather

1226
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:37,535
It is madness on one hand but it's also like I think we figured a lot out

1227
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,839
I think no one cares

1228
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:42,911
We figured a lot out

1229
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,471
I got I got a I got

1230
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,263
I've gotten some reassuring messages

1231
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:51,359
When the last week cuz I have a little bit of a downturn in my mental state about

1232
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,639
What's the point of the

1233
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,175
Bed sores

1234
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,735
I appreciate listener Mike

1235
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,807
Sent me a message I'd like to give you a public thank you

1236
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:04,159
There is some hope that I have

1237
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,463
In my bosom somewhere

1238
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
Like

1239
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,559
Eventually this will matter

1240
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
Boy it doesn't write

1241
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,143
It kind of suck

1242
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:15,679
Yeah

1243
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:18,239
It is what it is

1244
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,007
I think

1245
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,799
Really just a certain

1246
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
Kind of like

1247
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,127
It feels like what we're doing is

1248
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,919
To small for what

1249
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,199
They think they're supposed

1250
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:32,319
Big Freedia

1251
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,087
Sitting on this one

1252
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:33,855
One small thing

1253
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,879
When it what what

1254
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,927
Actually doing it

1255
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,487
Kissing on the large step through a small lens

1256
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,511
To make things

1257
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
Clearer

1258
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:47,679
Easier to understand

1259
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:54,079
Probably think it's undignified to listen to Alex

1260
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:57,663
I agree with that perspective to some extent but

1261
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:00,479
It is amazing to me how much

1262
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,759
You can see

1263
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,575
Clear pictures of

1264
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,367
The bigger picture through the smaller

1265
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:12,255
Does that make sense it's really baffling to me that people don't understand

1266
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:15,839
One of the reasons is because the only glimpsed it

1267
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,607
A lot of

1268
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
Spokes

1269
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,399
Who are crazy

1270
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:24,799
Get into Alex Jones are the things that are posted on Media Matters and rightwingwatch so they don't realize

1271
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,823
Time these narratives

1272
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,871
Is it end up coming out either from Hannity

1273
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
Or

1274
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,431
In the past from Glenn Beck

1275
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,223
Banned from Donald Trump

1276
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,271
A lot of them have their roots

1277
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
And Alex

1278
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,391
It's one of those things where is

1279
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,695
You can do a huge invest

1280
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:45,023
Navigation ultimately if you're trying to build a puzzle

1281
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,559
You take one small

1282
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Corner of it

1283
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
You know like

1284
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:51,167
Talking about what kind of effects of the Russia

1285
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
An influencer

1286
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,239
Really had on the election

1287
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,799
A guy like Alex

1288
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,871
What kind of food have on him and his list

1289
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,151
Easier

1290
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:07,551
Exactly 10 pieces that fit to perfect

1291
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:16,511
And you just put together

1292
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,559
Nazi sympathy

1293
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,839
Sit other corner is

1294
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:25,471
Complete white supremacy using different language

1295
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,775
Together timeline

1296
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:35,711
Combine that with the other timelines that we know and you start to see obviously that Alex Jones is

1297
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,015
Regardless of his

1298
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,039
Knowing complicit

1299
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:44,159
One of the perks of the Russian influence

1300
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:50,815
Absolutely but look at his profile and how it's raised

1301
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,423
And it's impossible to split

1302
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,447
Rodger Stone

1303
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,215
From

1304
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:57,983
IDrive

1305
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,287
I believe he's inexorably tied

1306
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,055
2

1307
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,359
What was going on at that time

1308
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,151
I cannot be a coincidence

1309
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,431
He shows up

1310
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:09,247
And starts influencing Alex right around the time

1311
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,807
That Alex's numbers take a massive Spike

1312
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,575
Yep

1313
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:15,391
Throwing around

1314
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,207
Have been fairly Russia positive

1315
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,231
For a long time

1316
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,023
For that it becomes

1317
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,559
So much more pro-putin

1318
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,839
And the lead-up

1319
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
If you want

1320
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,887
Before December

1321
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
It's just

1322
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,983
I don't know man I don't think it's the whole story but it's big

1323
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:30,751
It's a big deal

1324
