1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:12,800
Healthy beverages

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:16,640
Alex Jones Jordan

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,224
This is embarrass

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,992
Question to ask

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,528
So great how long is

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,320
Probably good five years

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,392
Probably closer to 3 or 4

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,208
This isn't a quad

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000
What's my birthday

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
If I ever gone in the entire town has ever called

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,008
O'Daniel

13
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,104
What is the first number of years of my life and then

14
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,432
I think somewhere around Middle School I started shorting it shortening

15
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
Never dating

16
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,528
Absolutely everything

17
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,928
Nevermind

18
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,000
Puberty you want everyone else to be down into

19
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,584
I remember one time on the

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
The bus Junior High a friend of mine

21
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
His older

22
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
Sister they live down the street from me

23
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,032
Take the bus to school together and then I was like

24
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
Fourth grade and she was like what

25
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,272
I still remember the damn

26
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
Just easier

27
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,088
Looks kind of like a my girl

28
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
Situation going on

29
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696
Stuff on that bus that drink

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
My favorite

31
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,400
Drop the ball cuz I remember what it actually is

32
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:46,496
It was that one time I was at

33
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,520
If you are beer

34
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,128
And I was close to the actual parade

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,944
And come down the parade line

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
Walking down the street other than Rahm Emanuel by himself no security whatsoever

37
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
I thought it was amazing

38
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
On his own

39
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,472
And then also just like thinking that he was going to get a good response again

40
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
Memory

41
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
Apologies

42
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,688
But I forgot to act in the moment but it deserves telling

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,952
Behind

44
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:43,328
This week talking about health Ranger by Academy

45
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
Piece of s*** real piece of trash

46
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,960
First episode will be out by the time we're

47
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,544
I believe that tomorrow the second part will be out

48
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,872
Lot of fun

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
Some of the people who make this show possible

50
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,856
Help us get along

51
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,952
So

52
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
The episode proper

53
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,560
First

54
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
Ewok

55
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,472
I'm a policy wonk

56
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,568
Next

57
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm a policy wonk

58
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,040
Sent me some awesome audio

59
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
I want to actually a wish right now I can place them

60
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,512
Really guilty

61
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,656
Alex Jones bass music

62
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
I'm a policy wonk

63
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,800
Permission

64
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,408
Earlier in life

65
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,016
Somebody donated on the elevated level

66
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,344
Douglas you're now a technocrat

67
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,375
Business

68
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,215
Freakishly large

69
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,663
Can't see us which is everybody except me

70
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
Practicing practicing silently

71
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
Station of being able to sing along with it as it were

72
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:53,887
About the way you says I declare if the timing is so felonious Munk

73
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,447
It's just perfectly wrong

74
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
Our feelings about

75
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,127
And if you would like sports.com

76
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:09,503
Couldn't support the show the present

77
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
We are covering the span of

78
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
June 23rd and 20th

79
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
You for Sunday and Monday

80
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,023
Before the shows at

81
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
Experience for me

82
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
One of the reasons

83
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,727
Keystone the other stuff that Alex has been doing it a present day when I say this is unpleasant

84
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
You expected something

85
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,823
Disgusting

86
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
Studio sexual

87
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,175
That I was having a real good time with it

88
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
And then I hit a brick wall

89
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,807
You are not what you expected

90
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,367
The Sunday episode is so fun

91
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:52,767
And it's almost like we could do Wacky Wednesday episode

92
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
It's a waste

93
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
In present-day Alex Jones

94
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
You do not

95
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Becoming

96
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
It is pretty pretty alright

97
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
And then you get the Monday and it's just

98
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
Everything falls

99
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543
That was nice.

100
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
Now as we record this on Tuesday

101
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
Monday is too fresh in my head

102
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
Bummed out about it

103
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
Pleasant Mount Pleasant

104
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
Far too much of a stretch

105
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
So here's another context drop

106
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
From

107
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
Today's episode

108
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
Business

109
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
They're going to fry you

110
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
Family real

111
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Poached egg

112
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Source

113
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,711
What the problem is that is it

114
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:50,111
What states are trucks by cracking eggs into hot but not boiling water and swirling water around to Ghent

115
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,927
Recreate a pocket of egg white around the yolk

116
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,743
Better option for preparing poached eggs using steam

117
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
One way you absolutely cannot do it is by Brian

118
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:03,423
Ways to cook an egg poaching is one of the very few top to your egg preparations

119
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
Specifically doesn't involve Brian

120
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
Small point I think it's

121
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:12,127
Alex pretty regularly managers to have 100 decent Ops

122
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,199
And his stupid brain manages to

123
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,807
Choose the first option that is the only wrong one great

124
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,135
Fry you like a poached egg

125
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,975
Totally scrambled

126
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,119
So are we jumping here on the 23rd

127
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
In some ways

128
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Because Alex is

129
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,591
I'm the victim of the globalist the illegal pornography near

130
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,687
He's got a new one cooking

131
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
It's the whole show

132
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,783
Almost the entire show is over

133
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,671
No lawyers no no no no okay no guests at all

134
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
This narrative is

135
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Ron

136
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
It's just it's just all here

137
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
Bring up your family

138
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Guess what

139
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:20,991
There's 40,000 square mile for the u.s. government

140
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,903
40 years ago

141
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,047
By the break

142
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,911
Are the Elite

143
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,079
There's nothing really thought about that thousand square miles

144
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
Illegal to use cell phone

145
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
He's a real Hitta

146
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
About that

147
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,855
He seems to have recently learned that their parts of the country Russ cell phone uses which of course implies

148
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Phone towers

149
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
Naturally the conclusion he's come to

150
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
Unfortunately

151
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,239
McKay's he's making this argument without knowing literally any details

152
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
About what he's talkin to

153
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:21,407
There's an area of 13000 square miles in West Virginia where cell phone use is against the law

154
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
I'm not positive that the elites

155
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Are moving in math

156
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,295
To West Virginia and it wasn't specific about who these Ali

157
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
These are some going to leave that part alone

158
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
Didn't ban cellphone use

159
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
The Jeannette area West Virginia because

160
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
The fears about health problems caused by Wireless

161
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,535
It is way more interesting

162
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
Population 140

163
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,311
The closer you get to Greenbank the more restrictive the rules are by Wireless you

164
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
And that's Greenbank is the home of a gigantic

165
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
17 billion

166
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
Pound telescope

167
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,247
The largest steerable telescope in the world

168
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,063
It's operated by the national radio astronomy

169
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Observatory

170
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,231
To work at the telescope and smaller Incorporated telescopes of the town

171
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,535
Exploding galaxies at the edge of the universe

172
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:14,399
A signal that's so faint that it's about a billionth of a billionth of a millionth of a watt

173
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,727
In comparison to cellphone Can-Am it around 3

174
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,311
What's a drastically interfere with these very delicate work these researchers

175
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
They're doing

176
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
Even though cellphone to didn't

177
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
Exist when the telescopes research started

178
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
The location was

179
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Typically chosen for exactly that reason

180
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
Power lines radar spark plugs

181
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Cars

182
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
Can cause interference with their work

183
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,159
So the remoteness of Green Bay

184
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,719
If they were going to be able to make any progress

185
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:44,351
Work began at the site in 1959 so that's probably what Alex is talking about when he says the rules of them

186
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
No place for 40 years

187
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
Doolittle off all night

188
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
Specific stabbings close enough

189
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
Feel like how he at

190
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Misinterprets

191
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,567
A 2015 article about the

192
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
CNN provides a really interesting

193
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
What a piece of s*** Alex

194
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,967
Part of Alcoa

195
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,111
Can you show talking about how buying up Land series were there

196
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Giant Gold Rush

197
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Growth industry

198
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:13,791
He's adjusting to his audience that wants five

199
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,095
And if you buy up this land now you're going to be

200
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
Be safe and get some

201
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
F****** rich

202
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
That's the

203
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,239
50

204
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
Year-old resident

205
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,103
Who ran afoul of the authorities in the Greek

206
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,943
It turns out that his doorbell was interfered with the telescope research

207
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:37,343
Freedom get arrested

208
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Scope anymore

209
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,183
Sounds like such a hassle of a way to live right

210
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Raw

211
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,279
Quote far from complaining about their circumstances

212
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,351
Residence of these parts

213
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,911
Vacation spots will pop-up advertisements

214
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Does refuge from connectivity

215
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,543
They've already seen it in influx of about a dozen Electro sense

216
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,639
People who believe electromagnetic frequencies of the store so their illnesses

217
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,967
The main fear Express by the area's residents is it

218
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
Exactly what Alex is working toward bringing about

219
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
By appealing to

220
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
The same community of Electro sensitive

221
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Of course

222
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:15,487
He isn't trying to f*** with these people or anything it's just

223
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
Great example of how the

224
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
His real world

225
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Consequences

226
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Play fuk about

227
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,399
It doesn't care to understand

228
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
At all

229
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,519
Everything about the way you telling the story and we'll go on to tell the story is dishonest

230
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,615
The end result is only going to be the people that

231
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
If I know anything about the

232
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
People that Alex would Inspire to head out there

233
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,319
Telescope

234
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,623
Intentionally interfering with its operations

235
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,975
For being able to help Humanity

236
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
Alex's gold

237
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,351
This is a great narrative for Alex this is incredibly stupid

238
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Pretty amazing

239
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
It's pretty it's pretty awesome

240
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,591
Expecting

241
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
This is this

242
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,967
Fun telescope

243
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Just doesn't

244
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,831
I think there's a big problem now

245
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
What it was

246
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:21,791
Years old

247
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:26,655
They were like hey guess what make you a doorbell that doesn't interfere with billions of

248
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
Miles of galaxy

249
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
Man if you see the size of the telescope

250
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
Can crazy

251
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,199
It makes sense that they'd have to operate

252
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:45,855
10 years there's going to be f****** lunatics crawling all over that telescope trying to find out how it killed

253
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
And

254
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:54,047
Alex will have played a role more Extreme as it goes along

255
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:59,167
I just wanted to make sure it has a lot of information up top without Alex

256
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,775
Usually like to do it but I felt like it was important to let you know like

257
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Deteriorate

258
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
Once again telescopes Factor

259
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,967
Heavily into our

260
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:17,855
Project Camelot a telescope mad at you if you try and

261
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,439
Alex claims that there's 10 places

262
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
In the country

263
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
That are like this

264
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
But does not name any of them

265
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,119
That is specifically responding to an article about Green

266
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
There's a place

267
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
But not just one

268
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
They got these facilities under different cover

269
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
I've looked into them

270
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
And I discovered at least 10

271
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
They're a lot more

272
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
There are

273
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,367
Corridors

274
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
The Western world

275
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
Where no cell phone towers

276
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
Allowed

277
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Program worldwide

278
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,079
Bill Gates

279
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
Close enough to Bill Gates

280
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
I think you could have credit for that

281
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
He doesn't prove it method

282
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,527
As far as I can tell it's

283
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
The

284
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
That's it

285
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
National radio astronomy

286
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
Is a separate order

287
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
From what I can.

288
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,815
I don't have any evidence

289
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:37,215
Who kept building a bigger and bigger telescope until it was

290
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
Big enough

291
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
Galaxy maybe I don't know

292
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,967
You can get the sense already that what Alex's narrative about this is like the globalist have set up

293
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
This place is there safe haven

294
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,087
And they're going to go there

295
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
That's gone bad

296
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
Because they are heading

297
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
2 West Virginia

298
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Right now

299
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Really

300
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,047
Globalist attack

301
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
Breakaway civilization

302
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,983
Is running for the exits

303
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,591
50 million

304
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:20,735
What's that mean it means they're getting ready to pull the trigger

305
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:30,975
Bring up the Infowars special please support a straight Pride

306
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
Pennywise

307
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:38,911
Awesome with the beat

308
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
Good

309
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
So they pull the trigger

310
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
Obviously you'd be like I don't know

311
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
I don't know if this were

312
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,151
Works out from Alex

313
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,807
How trustworthy of the sources Alex incredibly

314
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:00,415
Our stand up against it

315
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,279
I'm not scared you wrong yet

316
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:14,495
I really just wanted to know you just love that f****** talk it's always a delight to hear policy

317
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
He's trying to reinforce

318
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
This idea

319
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:27,039
That the globalist are all heading to West Virginia

320
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:32,159
That is also a comical idea appealing to your own credibility

321
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
Knock knock sensor

322
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
You steered us wrong

323
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Every

324
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
Perhaps

325
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,607
Yeah I would say every turn

326
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,191
I can't think of any specific

327
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:51,103
Jean on the street

328
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,175
People write but only in service of later steering the Bronx

329
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
Everly changing his position arbitrarily

330
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
Don't bring dog into

331
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,903
Contacts

332
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:12,607
We get to get a sense of why Alex is telling his audience about this and it's not because

333
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,983
The benign version of it is by a property in West Virginia

334
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
You know anything about Alex

335
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,335
You know that there's also a nefarious

336
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,663
It's part of it he wants to build that's not it

337
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,223
But we come back I'll finally get to all of it

338
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
I want to give you the

339
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
Want to give you all the

340
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
The history of the basics

341
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
And

342
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Shut up

343
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
I just called

344
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,815
Before I show you where they are

345
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
Weather moving to

346
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,679
And what they're doing and how it's all

347
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Hidden

348
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
Because I want you

349
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,567
When they released the bioweapon the most your family

350
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,407
Abraham.

351
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
I want you

352
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
Those are always a sentence of survive

353
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,295
I want you to know where they are

354
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
So you know what to do

355
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:15,327
I want you to know where to go with your

356
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:21,727
Roving bands of apocalyptic

357
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:36,319
You understand that the fiction of the coming bioweapon release is not essential to what

358
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
What he's telling people to do

359
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,095
Your family why would you get this

360
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
This is real f*****-up

361
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,495
I mean I know hiding behind this this like

362
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:01,151
Hypothetical triggering event of a bean

363
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,967
Maybe but it doesn't work for me

364
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,391
He knows what he's doing he's directing people to go to whistle

365
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
Virginia

366
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,279
So Alex explains that

367
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
You know he knows about this

368
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,143
Knows what this now please write an article

369
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,471
Which is good he's read an article in the New York Times

370
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,751
I'm still discussing the moment

371
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
But

372
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
The globalist

373
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
This story is not true

374
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
So much because I know

375
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
Tire off

376
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Ricin

377
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,767
I'm going to blow It Wide Open we come back

378
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
The three different Hollywood people the time

379
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,311
The move to West Virginia

380
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,895
What they meant when I got the offer

381
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
I was offered

382
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
15 years ago

383
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,783
The move to West Virginia where I'd be safe

384
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,391
I really think he's putting people in danger in West Virginia

385
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,208
Such a focus on it

386
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,280
I would believe there's a possibility

387
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,680
What are you f****** move to West Virginia

388
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
Mystery Doug

389
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
Check out why wasn't that about that

390
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,176
Always knew

391
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,016
Oh you get this other piece of information

392
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
This is nonsense

393
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:50,208
I love this view of the globalist every time there's a new narrative going on he also has a personal connection to

394
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:56,608
Global early life very very

395
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:03,008
What's the brain through and spoiling their plans

396
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:10,432
This is this is just taking his fictionalized backstory and adding new details

397
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
Whatever narrative he's pushing it

398
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
The present

399
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
It's a dumb

400
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
Dumb s***

401
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
I told you this New York Times story

402
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,928
That came out couple of days ago

403
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
A couple days before Sunday

404
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,536
And

405
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
I already

406
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,632
Reference an article about this Greenbank area from twenty

407
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,704
It's not like it was a secret

408
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,800
Couple day-old editorial article Alex

409
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
Is going to try

410
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,040
West Virginia

411
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
This is up

412
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Pagan

413
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Photographer

414
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
West Virginia

415
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
Parallel reality

416
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
50 years ago was an artifact

417
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:16,224
Believe it's where everybody is above average for lunch

418
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,528
He can't he does not he's not able to

419
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
Keeps interrupting

420
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:28,000
Virginia is already out of the globalist because there's no Wireless their narrative

421
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,840
What was the New York Times on June 21st

422
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
29

423
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:38,752
The CNN article I read from details

424
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,848
The only article

425
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,712
Yet here is Alex just stumbling across this story is if it's just now come to the surface

426
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,784
The New York Times piece is an editorial and opinion

427
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:56,416
And it's first-person experience-based article about the author visiting this town and what they learn from it

428
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,768
If I had to stop at we're all connected to the internet in our phone

429
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,352
And by going to place with none of that stuff you're able to fully experience

430
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,656
Just how much you rely on those bits of Technology

431
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
Just as a default

432
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,568
Necessity of modern life but there's something deep down the

433
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872
McCall's out to these places where they don't exist

434
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,920
And there's value in preserving those place

435
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
Especially for people who really resume

436
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:26,880
What isn't in the article is

437
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:32,256
No mention that people are talking about

438
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,072
The article puts the town's population at 150

439
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,912
It looks like they may have had a net gain in population of 7

440
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:45,312
Since 2015

441
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
The article says nothing

442
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
Even close to it Alex

443
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
He's talking about

444
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
Editorialize is a little bit more

445
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,552
And tries to pretend that

446
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,880
The satellite is somehow

447
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
Telescope

448
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
Is my area

449
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,864
Wi-Fi

450
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424
Which also.

451
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,544
Generate electromagnetic

452
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,408
What a bunch of Throwbacks there is a giant

453
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,944
Pinochet

454
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,392
Eclectic

455
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:37,792
He says that it's a NASA and Esa DARPA command base with literally

456
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
He's just making

457
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
That off that is that

458
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,888
B******* it's on the article

459
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
He has no primary

460
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,472
Source 2

461
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,544
It's just what he thinks and feels

462
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,128
I'm also beat like talking about The Eclectic mix of the

463
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
People who live there

464
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
They aren't Elite

465
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
Or Rich

466
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,504
They're just residents of this town

467
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:02,112
Like it and not all of them work at the telescope

468
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,488
He's presenting aren't they so weird

469
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,584
It's people who live in a town of 140 people

470
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,632
It's a Small Town living

471
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
There is a neglect

472
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,472
Look at the pictures some of them are like

473
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,104
West Virginia

474
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Are you sure

475
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:31,552
Doorbell

476
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:37,184
Sit like a little corner store

477
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Nonsense

478
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,488
Nonsense

479
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
Delizia Telegraph sneezed

480
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
Just making

481
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
All of this up

482
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,144
Here goes on to make up another detail

483
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,728
Call Zack

484
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,384
And I did some more research on this last

485
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
Massive man

486
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,736
Show your work

487
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,344
Cite your sources on the Underground bands that are being built

488
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,904
Show me a

489
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:12,768
Okay whatever Underground

490
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:17,376
Scott's by then I got to go I got to go I can't have this conversation

491
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,168
I mean it's fun

492
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:23,520
It's not like this is fun comparative

493
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:29,920
Just like Project Camelot

494
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
This is dumb

495
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
I know who

496
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,832
There's a charm to it that's been absent from

497
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,928
The charm is it still hasn't aged

498
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,328
Direct people

499
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:52,192
But a little bit more about the New York Times article

500
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,008
And it's the

501
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
All

502
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Admittedly

503
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,592
Manipulation

504
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
Neurons

505
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Your bright

506
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,224
This stuff is

507
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
Healing Arts

508
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,624
And they're running away from it all over special communities

509
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
Urban form

510
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,464
Daniel L almond

511
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,512
So true

512
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
The article.

513
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Get into that

514
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,888
The closest tecumseh's on the author brings up a reservation

515
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,448
Central Idaho where artificial light is

516
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:29,824
It's a place where you can protect people's ability to enjoy the Stars unencumbered by the Light of the city

517
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,384
Somebody loves to Camp I definitely think that

518
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,456
Super cool and a very worthwhile initiative to undertake

519
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,552
There's nothing to do with creating special communities where people are safe from 5G

520
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,184
The business interests would never protect on their own

521
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
Like silence Stillness

522
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
The ability to see the universe

523
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
With the naked eye

524
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
Ensure Alex's f******

525
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Stupid

526
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
How stupid

527
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:57,984
So stupid that he just decided to forget about this line in the article he's covering

528
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,056
12 National Science Foundation

529
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,616
Consider the proposal to shut down Greenbank

530
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
And ended up slashing

531
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
Support by about 40%

532
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,016
That's under Obama's term

533
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:16,416
But she's a big old globalist why would he allow the funding to be slasher is super secret getaway base in the middle of West Virginia

534
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
40%

535
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,328
Does Alex not realize that is soon as that telescope facility runs out of funding and has to shut down

536
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:27,936
There's no reason for the wireless signals to be banned there

537
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,728
How to puncture the entire premise of the

538
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,288
Conspiracy. The globalist through somehow running

539
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
Ludacris

540
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128
Drives me crazy

541
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:42,528
His own s*** is in the article he's covered or a strong indication that none of this makes

542
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
It happens

543
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
So awesome

544
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
Or it's evidence

545
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,136
Funding for the program

546
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:52,256
Has gone from the Science Foundation to the CIA

547
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,560
Obama's promotion

548
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:04,800
It's got Steph Curry's new show holy moly about how they play milkshake or whatever

549
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
Cooking knives

550
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:10,176
Chocolate Face

551
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:16,064
So Alex is read this New York Times article clearly hasn't internalized it very well

552
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,904
Conspiracy the West Virginia is

553
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
And Alex realizes

554
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,744
I got to make a move

555
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
But I said it still slow death

556
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
For all of us

557
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,728
Doesn't

558
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,920
How do you spell Terraria

559
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:56,000
I couldn't believe it if they did that either

560
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,168
Literally

561
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,312
Of the show talk about this

562
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,360
Nonsense

563
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,664
But yelling

564
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
About how the global start

565
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
To run

566
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:21,344
Is Robin from everything that deployed against us

567
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,928
The mountains of death of giant third world populations that weaponized

568
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:31,328
Smartphone 50 bio-weapons the leftist garbage none of them

569
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:37,728
Other kids iPhone

570
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:41,312
Go back

571
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
Threat

572
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:48,736
That's a large part of why he's interested in cover

573
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,624
Is there it is kind of like a

574
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,952
I hope someone gets hurt

575
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,048
Which is f***** up

576
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,328
Your editorial

577
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
Practices

578
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,264
Some sort of danger

579
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,568
So it's interesting

580
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,664
Talks about but I'm not going to let you

581
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Completely

582
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:24,832
Misrepresented this New York Times article I protected area has been a secret

583
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,904
Cupboard repeatedly articles

584
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
2009

585
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:34,560
A secret anyway everyone knows this everyone understand

586
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
Information would be available

587
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,448
It's Odessa this is a real good punchline

588
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
For his June 23rd

589
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
We just laid out the

590
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,848
Nobody else has laid out

591
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
Weave

592
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
Legendary engine

593
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
Legendary

594
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,344
Thaddeus

595
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
As close as you're going to get to the truth

596
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Azarath

597
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
Legendary

598
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,120
Reflect

599
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:13,472
Killed it awesome

600
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,800
You know you have those moments

601
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:21,664
Sometimes the past of doing stand-up where someone has a terrible setting to come up north

602
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,456
That was pretty good

603
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:33,696
Twitter and Facebook is rice from with people who are at who I was at the show with who

604
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:40,608
Did terribly and then they're like

605
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,776
So we can do the 24th now and I told you it's a brick wall

606
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
Like I enjoyed

607
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,640
Threatening to Alex try talk about

608
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
Rest Virginia

609
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
Just offer

610
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:03,648
Cliff

611
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:10,048
25 years

612
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:23,104
Once in the first five years what I say this is the most important

613
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
And then about

614
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,760
10 years ago

615
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
Once a year

616
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,392
About five years ago I said about once a month

617
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
Broadcast

618
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,608
World

619
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,912
Too bad

620
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,936
So far

621
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,496
Just because you over

622
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:54,592
Inflate the importance of what you're talking about doesn't mean that the world is

623
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:58,944
Has no bearing on whether or not this news is important

624
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,736
You have gotten more desperate

625
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,784
Isn't that it's not just a man

626
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,600
Literally saying

627
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
Once every year

628
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,000
I used to yell at

629
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,536
People stop listening to me

630
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,680
I think that it's

631
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,472
It's very nice along those lines

632
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,496
Is unconvinced

633
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,056
Is it for sure

634
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,360
And then we get to this

635
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,408
Are where we find out

636
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
Why

637
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
The 24th

638
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,760
Election meddling

639
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,856
Google Earth

640
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
Sounds like a Batman villain

641
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
The doodler

642
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:47,072
Project Veritas

643
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
Wide open

644
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,776
But Google is a giant election meddling

645
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:05,504
Then get them to a little bit of a deconstruction of like

646
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,904
Before the googlr does not like maybe a villain

647
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Ethereal

648
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
Serious

649
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,232
Sucks

650
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,816
I was dreading getting back into present-day Alex Jones in the preparation

651
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,888
This episode and to my surprise I found something that was fun on Sunday

652
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,168
In the form of Alex thinking

653
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:26,752
50 slog Public Super telescope was somehow The Refuge

654
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,336
The globalist to go to to survive the rollout of 5G

655
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
Kind of fun

656
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:35,968
Outside the whole time telling you this so you know where to find them and kill them aspects of that rhetoric

657
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,504
That's kind of the Alex Jones I can

658
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,784
Stomach pretty easily

659
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Got a phone

660
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
So

661
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:46,720
Of course the next day you going to become completely overwhelmed by one of my least favorite

662
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,000
The Alex's bikes

663
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
Super hard

664
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,560
It's yet another project veritas

665
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,936
I watched the entire 25-minute Veritas video in WhatsApp

666
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,752
Deceptive editing

667
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
About the topic it's covering

668
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,408
Intrepid reporter James O'Keefe talks to an anonymous whistleblower

669
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:10,528
Google doesn't randomly produce their search results

670
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,600
Robinette's

671
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
Needs to be done

672
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm not sure but I would imagine

673
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,024
But whatever

674
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,352
The argument hinges on them deprioritized Encanto

675
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
That's bulshit

676
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,960
Which is a real big problem for people whose life's work is

677
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
So here we are

678
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,592
Honestly there's no smoking gun in this video not no real cogent point

679
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
Just ramping

680
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:40,224
Insinuation of evildoing by Google which is run by sjw who have it out for Trump

681
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Of course

682
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
I sincerely

683
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
Don't care about the

684
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,368
James O'Keefe is such a long time con man

685
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,160
I really just can't take

686
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
Produces too serious

687
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
I would think anyone who has

688
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,584
Actual scoop about anything in the real world would know better than to call him

689
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
But there's plenty of non-partisan

690
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,424
Investigative reporters ready willing

691
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
To take on issues related to Big Ten

692
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,824
Call James O'Keefe when you have a scoop you called when you have an idea for a stunt

693
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
That's it

694
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,152
I want to point out a couple things that are hilarious

695
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:16,064
Most of it is James O'Keefe interviewing this whistleblower whose voice is altered and covered by a physically covered in

696
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,904
Moonshadows

697
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,000
Nightline ABC News

698
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,584
Even though he is covered in your Shadow and

699
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,192
His voice is altered one of the first things this supposed whistleblower said in the video is quote

700
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,008
I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant

701
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:42,176
Brass balls for an anonymous guy talking to James O'Keefe to spit up

702
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:45,248
Tie rod end

703
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
So

704
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
James f

705
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
The Whistleblower

706
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,112
Pacific meeting were content filtering was

707
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,416
Discussed at this was one of my big red flag

708
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,512
The Whistleblower says that the meeting was held at a masonic temple

709
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,560
Now why would Google do that

710
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,400
Google is a shitload of office space and are perfectly capable of holding meeting

711
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,448
And they're old

712
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,776
These details were curious to me it kind of feels like someone making too big of a

713
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,616
Swing

714
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,712
You know that that whole culture of the text

715
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:20,832
We don't have we don't have cubicles everything's open here's some ball games over there

716
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:32,096
Groupon for quite a while they have the same thing with we got to

717
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,400
Bouncy balls to sit on

718
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:40,032
Masonic temple

719
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,104
Blower goes on to list

720
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,408
Google

721
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,712
One of his examples is Tim pool

722
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,504
Tempool headed

723
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,808
Response to that on Twitter when he said quote

724
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:58,208
My channel is absolutely not being suppressed or anyone else but my diffuser up over 30

725
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
500% from last year

726
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,096
An hour later he tweeted quote this is not true for my channel

727
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,912
Recommendations are up user up Revenue

728
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,008
What's Insider whistleblower

729
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,336
Feels like he was just choosing cool names in the Free Speech

730
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
Grace Community

731
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,944
And one of them didn't realize that now is not the time to be honest

732
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,504
Jump On It

733
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,904
The whistleblowers name

734
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,912
Not playing along with this b*******

735
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
So The Whistleblower says two things at the

736
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
The end of the video

737
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,776
A little bit discrediting

738
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
The first is kind of hilarious

739
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:51,712
What is describing why he's coming forward he says he doesn't like the people at Google are working in the shadows

740
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:56,064
Well he's literally talking through it

741
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,720
I also don't like Anonymous sources

742
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,768
Has dangerously close

743
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
Jesse Ventura

744
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,096
The others

745
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
What do you think

746
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:15,520
And this alleged whistleblower replies with a long pause

747
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
Then says quote

748
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,592
Hopefully I get away with it

749
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:25,760
Hopefully I get away with it is generally anyway someone Praises not a good action people say hopefully I

750
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:32,160
Oh I don't know working with a

751
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,720
Perpetual fraudster and a publicity stunt

752
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:41,632
Phrase it is I hope I get away with it

753
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,912
You know what

754
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,984
I would put it

755
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:52,895
The other video is secretly recorded footage of an alleged high-level

756
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
Name Jen Jen

757
00:41:54,687 --> 00:42:00,831
Who is about

758
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,111
Trump situation

759
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,903
From happening

760
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,047
Videos

761
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,607
Republic that a lot of the other past victims of

762
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,143
Veritas

763
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,007
Explains that they added her comments out of context in the Trump situation

764
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:25,407
Who's the foreign intervention interference

765
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,455
Trump space

766
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,991
No okay no

767
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,039
What happened to her

768
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,599
In the lead-up to this video that they

769
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,623
Took of her being

770
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,439
Shots

771
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
Invitation

772
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,023
The few people who claim to be from

773
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:45,887
They said they wanted to chat with me about a program for young women of color in Tech

774
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,679
An area I've long been passionate

775
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:53,311
She goes on to say quote casual chat with someone at a restaurant in Houston imprecise language

776
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,847
Project Veritas got me

777
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
Well done

778
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,711
Probably also important to point out that because of the video tonight

779
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
In the flood of abuse

780
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
Messages

781
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,271
And so she's been.

782
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,111
What message she received the quote your ideology will be shredded

783
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,927
The Pieces Just moments before you get executed for treason

784
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,231
You're leaving you're living a limited time

785
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,511
Enjoy till then

786
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,583
The video includes complete misrepresentation

787
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,631
Tonight is involved

788
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,191
Because the message is more important than the

789
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,239
And if O'Keefe has to comply

790
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,287
Sweetly terrorized Jen tonight in order to

791
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,567
To push that message soap

792
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,919
I already here as they do Keith thinks this video proof is victimhood

793
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,247
When in reality all it does is demonstrate the exact Danger

794
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,319
It exists when you allow people like him to operate freely

795
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:40,415
Ultimately what it comes down to is furthering two important goals

796
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,951
Sissy

797
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
Project Veritas

798
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
1

799
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,535
Right-wing propaganda

800
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,815
Desperately trying to

801
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,631
Present the consequences of their actions as Noble Victor

802
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,703
Repackaging that is a very important goal

803
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
This further

804
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:59,615
Creating a pre-emptive narrative for why Trump really wanted 2020 even if you lose

805
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
That's all that's going on

806
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
They're definitely problems

807
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,783
The tech industry but ironically

808
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
Because people like Alex Anoka

809
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,855
Don't care about the real problem

810
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,647
They care about their Petty battles

811
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,439
In furthering their own propaganda

812
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
Medicals

813
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,999
Yeah there

814
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,055
Crafting away for their propaganda

815
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:34,431
It exists in a post Trump World Blues and whoever the Democrat who wins

816
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,735
Become president everything goes

817
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,367
Create all this everyone cheated

818
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:48,767
Wrapping stuff million illegals voted in the last election yada yada yada

819
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,047
Fuel nefarious

820
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,071
But less

821
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,863
Insidious I'm dangerous

822
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
Version of it

823
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,447
Well we still need to sell

824
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
If Trump leaves

825
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,775
Ready for that

826
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
This helps

827
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
You know I think

828
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
And I could be wrong about this

829
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
But couldn't that place

830
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:11,807
Still charged

831
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,087
Federal Building

832
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,159
I don't know I don't give them.

833
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:16,927
I'm not

834
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,207
I'm not entirely sure

835
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,863
Alex brings up that

836
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,471
In this next clip

837
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,775
This 25-minute video

838
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,799
Isn't edited

839
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,847
Winovich

840
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,199
My God watch this video

841
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,487
So that should be pointed out is there

842
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,279
Veritas

843
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,839
It's getting sued right now more than Alex

844
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
Text Jones

845
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,887
One of these few things

846
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,167
Morlock

847
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:05,311
As far as I can tell they have multiple active

848
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,103
It appears that there is at least

849
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
5

850
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,151
Active cases against okay

851
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
Eva Veritas

852
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
In the book's right

853
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:17,599
SK sweets cast

854
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
Pretending you the phone repair

855
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,183
Which ended up with him pleading guilty

856
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,975
Dubuque sentenced to three years probation

857
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,255
And 100 hours of

858
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
Community service

859
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:30,399
Then there was one Farrah after is b******* video

860
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,983
Hope you didn't have permission to record a private conversation

861
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,031
So keep trying to argue that the conversation

862
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,055
Private

863
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,663
So can you quickly settled the case paying Vera 100,000

864
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
Dollars

865
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:47,551
I can find no evidence that O'Keefe has won cases in court about the way he manipulative the edit

866
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
XVideos

867
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,855
But he hasn't cases

868
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
Against him

869
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:55,231
On the grounds of things like he can record someone in a bar without their consent

870
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,279
Because there's not a reasonable expectation

871
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,815
Enter privacy at a bar

872
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,375
This is why all of his videos are shot

873
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:06,495
There's no way that what he's doing would be legal if you weren't intentionally trying to secretly record

874
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,055
Private conversations in very public places

875
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:13,151
That's how we f***** up it Acorn that's why I got $100,000

876
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,943
Cuz that took place in an office

877
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,223
Not in a bar

878
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:22,623
So you could do whatever you want

879
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,159
Legal anywhere else

880
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,791
But you couldn't if it was in public

881
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
That's why

882
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:36,959
Now that's her post

883
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,775
About it.

884
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
Explaining

885
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,823
People will be more

886
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:48,223
Careful about accepting

887
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,319
Got to recognize that like we live in a time now where do you need to be a little bit

888
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,647
About propaganda people are going to try and f*** with

889
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,719
Especially if you work for a company like Google or Twitter

890
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,023
Weather going to be at Target

891
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,583
Yeah and they clearly research survey

892
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
What was more a Honey Trap

893
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,447
Getting women of color in turquoise

894
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,799
They're only smart move

895
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,151
Some smart moves but it's all in

896
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
If that

897
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,711
Evil smart

898
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
Cunning

899
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
Sure

900
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
Sekiro

901
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,183
But he has a ranking

902
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
Gyros

903
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:37,631
There's a little bit interested he probably wasn't killed

904
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,935
As we learned

905
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
You're right

906
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,239
No there's a hierarchy

907
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,079
He's not at the top okay

908
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,175
Kiro

909
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,527
Michael Jordan

910
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,343
Watch Amazing athlete

911
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,695
Call Jordan.

912
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,487
Michael Jordan

913
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
9

914
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,095
9

915
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,935
Firefighter

916
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:18,591
James okay tires with Trump

917
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:22,943
Of firefighter who dies in a building

918
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,015
That's ridiculous

919
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:32,415
That is just there so there's some kind of weird

920
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,207
If he started writing listicles

921
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,255
You would think he was a Madman

922
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
Top 10 Heroes

923
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,167
So what's next clip Alex talk

924
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,959
About

925
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,823
This actually this was a difficult

926
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
For me

927
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,871
Because I

928
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,175
I noticed something

929
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,735
Under lied a lot of

930
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,527
About Apple

931
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,551
What about Tim Cook

932
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,087
And

933
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,367
I feel like this deserves

934
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
Disgust

935
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,487
What

936
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,239
On the Undertaker

937
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,287
Number one

938
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,687
She's a horrible person

939
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:29,247
Albuquerque

940
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:43,583
I don't care what you do with your ding-a-ling

941
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,191
Major

942
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,103
First of all the

943
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:00,735
The boiling down to what you do with your Ding-A-Ling which is not great

944
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:07,135
Alex have a small point in the sexual orientation

945
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:10,207
Is it true

946
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,767
Yeah but I really thought

947
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,047
Tim Cook to be pretty offense

948
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,327
I want to tell you why

949
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:20,447
He's being targeted by Tim Cook in part because he won't stop talking about

950
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
Tim Cook is gay

951
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,007
Alex says that Tim Cook is

952
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
Major Pitt

953
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
Spit him about it

954
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,615
And this framing of how Alex is describing his

955
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,687
Problems with cook is where things become really problematic

956
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,735
Also that horrible voice

957
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,503
Is not helping

958
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,783
No that's that was

959
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
Skillet

960
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,087
Alex's criticism isn't

961
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,135
The Tim Cook is running suicide Factory

962
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:45,535
He's running suicide factories in China

963
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,583
Why did Spike Tim Cook's sexuality

964
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,911
This is an important distinction because Alex don't give a s***

965
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
About people working in unsafe condition

966
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:59,359
His favorite politician

967
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,919
The things that eliminated

968
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,479
Many of the terrible parts of the conditions

969
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,527
Spectra-physics

970
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,551
Explicitly enact

971
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
Biblia cat

972
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,367
Who's complaints about the plight of workers

973
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,903
Halo

974
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,743
That is a nice port to work

975
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,815
Vagina and nothing I'm about to say you should be interpreted as

976
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
Minimize

977
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,167
The difficult and exploitative situation that many of them are in

978
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:28,799
Specifically about how little Alex Jones knows about China and Apple

979
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,895
Every single time Alex talks about China in apple

980
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,663
He brings up soup

981
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,735
That's it

982
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,271
The story

983
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,807
It's a horrifying image

984
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,599
People killing themselves at their work

985
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,903
It's Bleak it's relatable

986
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,695
It's very resonant with the audience

987
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,999
The people who may not totally love their job

988
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,047
For some context though

989
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,327
History about gnats

990
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,607
Hits from 2011

991
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,703
Analysis specifically leaving out the part of that story where in division 2

992
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,727
Installing bed nets

993
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,007
Foxconn

994
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:02,335
Responded to a rash of suicides by raising the wages

995
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,127
Employees which is one of the motivation

996
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
Described

997
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
People who jumped off the roof

998
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,503
Alex has been repeated the story as if it's

999
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,527
Current 48

1000
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,295
Years

1001
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,855
Meanwhile from 2012 to the present

1002
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,647
Four employees have killed themselves

1003
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,951
What is the Foxconn Factory that Alex is talking about

1004
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,231
Which is 40

1005
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,279
But let's try and put this in perspective

1006
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
41

1007
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:26,143
The Foxconn Factory is not like most factories that we imagine

1008
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,935
It's f****** gigantic

1009
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:28,959
With the staff

1010
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
10 times the size of the largest

1011
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,287
It's factory in the United States

1012
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,359
According to Business Insider they employee about

1013
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,127
350

1014
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,151
Thousand people

1015
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:41,247
Which is approximately 40,000 more people than live in St Louis

1016
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:45,599
Id2020 1743 people killed themselves

1017
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,207
So you look at numbers of

1018
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:50,975
Prairie

1019
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:55,071
In 2016 291 people kill themselves at the workplace

1020
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:55,839
The United States

1021
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,167
To do in terms of work

1022
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:02,495
We have our own problems at home that we should be addressing to

1023
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,055
And I've never heard Alex bring up us

1024
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,335
Workplace suicide

1025
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
Ever

1026
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,687
Similarly I've never heard him talk about France Telecom

1027
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,967
Which had more than

1028
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,759
60 employees commit suicide

1029
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,295
2020-11

1030
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,855
That's far more than the number of people who killed them

1031
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,879
Themselves

1032
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,255
So the rate is

1033
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,559
We hire

1034
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,351
Not because he's covering it up

1035
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
Because he doesn't care

1036
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,679
Just no reason to attack of French phone

1037
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,799
Evocative image from news

1038
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,823
From 8 years ago

1039
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,383
And he uses it daily as a weapon to attack the people

1040
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,663
Perceived as his enemies

1041
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,455
Demanded they solve an issue

1042
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,479
You keep doesn't caribou

1043
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,295
And knows that the only real solution to his

1044
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,831
Regulate business

1045
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,111
Would you super against

1046
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,391
It's a trick

1047
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,927
He's playing a trick

1048
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,951
What is audience

1049
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,487
By appealing to the emotion

1050
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:01,375
Reasonably rightfully should be evoked the idea of a factory putting up

1051
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,655
Next to stop people

1052
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Killer dubstep

1053
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,959
He's using that as a

1054
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,727
Trick

1055
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,287
Yeah it almost seems like he's mad that

1056
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,079
They're killing themselves

1057
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:17,503
Like the factory should be coming here in our worker should be certainly wouldn't be

1058
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,783
Exactly

1059
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,391
Who cares about the working

1060
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Conditions of China

1061
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,183
Factory employees

1062
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,767
It's just an easy way for him to attack Google

1063
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:32,095
And it's definitely not the reason why he's attacking Google

1064
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,375
Tonight is motivation

1065
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,447
When you hear make the argument that no one will criticize

1066
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,727
Tim Cook for the Chinese factor

1067
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
Because he's gay

1068
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,543
That is an attack on Tim Cook

1069
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,823
Specifically because he

1070
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
He's gay

1071
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,383
He's basically saying that his

1072
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,247
Elevated status to a heterosexual

1073
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,295
And that's complete s***

1074
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,207
I'll still be very clear that Foxconn and everybody else needs to do a better job for their workers

1075
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,999
You can accept that is 80

1076
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:00,767
True thing

1077
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,071
I'm still cold this order bulshit out

1078
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,607
And here's why that's important

1079
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,983
Cook is literally the first Fortune 500 CEO to be openly gay

1080
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,799
Fortune 500 published

1081
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823
Since 19

1082
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,847
55

1083
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,127
Tim Cook

1084
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,919
CEO in 2011 in

1085
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
Come out until 20

1086
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
14

1087
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:23,807
That's a good 69 here's where representation

1088
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,087
Zip for young

1089
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,111
Aspiring LG

1090
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,135
TQ business

1091
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,695
There was no 12.2 instinct

1092
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,743
I could be long in that boardroom

1093
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,047
And I'm not just assuming that's the case

1094
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,327
That's the reason he

1095
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,863
He came out in 2014

1096
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,959
In an interview with CNN cook describes out there good rumors about a sec

1097
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,519
His life private until

1098
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
Started to receive

1099
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,055
Letters

1100
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,591
We've been bullied

1101
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,127
Because of their orientation

1102
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,407
And he realized it would be

1103
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,431
Be quote selfish

1104
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,759
For him to keep quiet when being public good help those

1105
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:58,367
Despite the problems with apple and there are many to choose from

1106
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,671
This is what Alex is attacking about

1107
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,439
Tim Cook

1108
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,743
In the same way that young lgbtq

1109
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:09,631
You could kids could be moved by their identity reflected in the eeo-1 the biggest companies in the world

1110
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,167
Alex he's back to

1111
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,447
Threatened by

1112
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,775
So ultimately what I'm saying is f*** Alex Jones

1113
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,567
He's a small-minded bigot

1114
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,359
Completely obsessed with his Petty battle

1115
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,943
I should also point out that the Infowars app was never number one

1116
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,991
Who's number one in the trending category

1117
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,807
The day after he got kicked off all the social media platforms

1118
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
But it's

1119
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,047
Disgusting

1120
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,119
See the sort of thing flies under the radar

1121
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,423
Of just his eyes out being stupid

1122
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:45,983
But you start to see

1123
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,847
This is an attack on somebody

1124
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,871
He thinks get special

1125
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,199
If that's what he's mad about

1126
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
The factory

1127
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,527
No

1128
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:05,951
If I were in his position as heterosexual CEO ever would be mad at me but never give them the path

1129
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,255
That's rank homophobia

1130
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,023
Right

1131
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:14,399
When you're used to being the protective glass with the highest

1132
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
Status

1133
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,983
Any other class

1134
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,263
Raised up

1135
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,079
Makes these people feel like stuff is being

1136
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:22,847
I'm taking away for

1137
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,639
Zero Sum game

1138
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,919
Approach to

1139
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,687
Yeah so she

1140
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,967
Social capital

1141
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,735
This

1142
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,503
White National

1143
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,063
Homophobic b*******

1144
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
Is always going

1145
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,415
Dehumanize any achievements

1146
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:41,791
But in the Reconstruction Era

1147
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,583
One of these

1148
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,887
Operating philosophy

1149
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,935
As long as the

1150
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
Horus

1151
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,007
Most worthless white person

1152
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:53,823
Feels like they're better than the richest

1153
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,871
Most successful black person

1154
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,407
Then we will always

1155
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,199
Like that kind of

1156
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
That kind of

1157
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
For Alex

1158
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,551
As long as

1159
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,599
As long as the gayest

1160
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,391
Cor the most

1161
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,415
Festival games

1162
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,183
Rolling hitch

1163
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,999
Worse than any straight person

1164
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,279
Act with impunity

1165
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,071
I suppose there's

1166
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,351
There's probably something

1167
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
Have you operate

1168
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,703
Live by

1169
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,495
Sort of

1170
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
That's it

1171
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,847
Is what he's responding

1172
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
Continue

1173
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,463
It's okay

1174
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,511
What the China 2 years ago

1175
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:49,119
I want to censor everything

1176
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:50,655
But

1177
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,727
He's gay

1178
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:58,591
As long as

1179
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,455
When I hear stuff like that

1180
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,735
I question

1181
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,503
Again

1182
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,295
Does he think this is funny

1183
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,575
What is this

1184
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
Comedy on his

1185
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,927
Who's that I don't know

1186
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,511
It's real bad but I

1187
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,535
How you get this

1188
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,399
Yeah I don't know

1189
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,935
It's really hard to tell cuz

1190
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,471
Well if you thinks rainbow smash

1191
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
Who the f*** knows

1192
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:30,079
Exactly

1193
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,615
It's sad that

1194
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,407
Completely foreign

1195
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,943
Sense of humor

1196
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,503
Very difficult striped cave

1197
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,575
Nonsense of humor as

1198
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,111
Hubert bright

1199
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,927
Tons of stand-up specials where I'll just watch it at

1200
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
I don't

1201
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,975
Where what is happy

1202
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,535
It's possible that he

1203
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,559
That's funny

1204
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,911
Still doesn't excuse

1205
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,823
Apple business

1206
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,615
Just real quick

1207
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,151
We went to f***

1208
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,967
Town on Tim Cook whatever the

1209
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
Search

1210
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,527
Censorship

1211
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,575
Search

1212
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:15,647
Leaking it all that s*** every

1213
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:22,303
Justified criticism

1214
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,607
The political wire

1215
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,423
Shielding of him because he's gay

1216
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,007
Yeah I always think it's over

1217
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,591
I'm glad you bring that up because it is important but it almost feels like

1218
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:40,991
Taking is red

1219
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
Listening to it going like

1220
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,879
Cannot be pointed out enough

1221
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,159
That we went

1222
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:52,511
Absolutely insane on him to the point where it's the project

1223
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,303
Very least slow down

1224
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,095
Like if it work for us

1225
01:01:56,351 --> 01:02:02,495
Alex's imagine that f****** super censorship thing would probably still be going on

1226
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,543
Yeah

1227
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,335
Spliff Alex

1228
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,479
Instead of Tim Cook for a little bit

1229
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,207
Anza

1230
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,023
Gohan incest Omar

1231
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,583
What

1232
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:31,423
Oh my God

1233
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,495
What

1234
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,543
Aisha

1235
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,335
Let's play some audio

1236
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,615
Walnut

1237
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,383
Brain

1238
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,455
Maryland

1239
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,551
I'm not sure

1240
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,087
Cheap

1241
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,111
Walnut Bryan

1242
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,671
So yeah that's that's

1243
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
A lot of s***

1244
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,743
You got over all these dumb

1245
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,303
Conspiracies about lawn Omar

1246
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:02,143
Jacob Wohl Laura Loomer

1247
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,679
Try to make a documentary

1248
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:10,079
Proving her brother or whatever

1249
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,127
No idea

1250
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,663
Blew up in their faces

1251
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,479
Disaster

1252
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:22,111
The other stuff

1253
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,927
Between Alexandria ocasio-cortez in the Holocaust

1254
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
Museum

1255
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,791
Comments as much as they reaffirmed their lungs

1256
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:34,399
Position that the music

1257
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,007
These camps where children are being abused

1258
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,591
Reported that is some kind of a takedown by the Holocaust Museum

1259
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,151
How many ran the headline

1260
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:50,015
Build us Holocaust Museum releases rare statement on concentration camp

1261
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,319
But the statement isn't really rare

1262
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,855
They put out a press release

1263
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,647
December 2018 same exact

1264
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
Same thing

1265
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,951
Dick a little bit into the topic and

1266
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:02,303
You find plenty of Representatives of the museum as well as other Scholars

1267
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,583
They're strongly

1268
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,863
People making analogies between

1269
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,191
The past or present

1270
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,215
Compared to what happened

1271
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,799
They're living

1272
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,847
Like Godwin's law is it that one

1273
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:17,407
That anytime an argument

1274
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,431
Get to

1275
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,199
Comparison

1276
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,223
Hitler is over

1277
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,551
Is that guy

1278
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,111
Partially that impartially just like it's just

1279
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,439
Respectful to the experience

1280
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,743
So the people who died to use it as a

1281
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,071
To compare something that you don't like to

1282
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,631
Absolutely absolutely

1283
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,655
That position

1284
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:44,543
I also think that it's not necessarily disrespectful the people who died in the Holocaust to

1285
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,823
Notes

1286
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:46,847
Similarity

1287
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:52,479
Disrespectful way to do it but I do appreciate the Holocaust Museum

1288
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,015
Like I don't think it's

1289
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,927
Home can be through I'm right there with you

1290
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,743
Alex brings

1291
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,047
The number 9

1292
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
Hero

1293
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,607
James O'Keefe

1294
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,655
He's on the show

1295
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:16,031
In this clip I just wanted to illustrate like

1296
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,311
How

1297
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,079
Cool J

1298
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,895
You couldn't get better

1299
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:27,295
Descriptors for the names of the Departments if you want to

1300
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:32,671
Remember that movie re-edits out all the newspaper at Ministry of Truth

1301
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,487
He thinks the 1984 is primarily a movie

1302
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,535
Eunos Orwell

1303
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,815
Haha

1304
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:44,447
I feel like that's the trend with these guys

1305
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:50,847
You think they're not voracious readers did I think they might take

1306
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,383
Kid most of their information

1307
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:55,199
From YouTube videos

1308
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,991
What do you call it

1309
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,831
Depictions of books in movie form

1310
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,111
So that's great

1311
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,135
They really love

1312
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,671
Bill Murray The Razor's Edge

1313
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:09,791
Could not pronounce

1314
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,839
This is

1315
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,143
This interview is just James O'Keefe

1316
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,167
Describing

1317
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:15,935
What happened

1318
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,727
And in his 25 minutes

1319
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,775
And there's some justice

1320
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
Applications

1321
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,335
Explanation

1322
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:26,943
And realizes the most

1323
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,479
Anthony gets a little defensive

1324
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
What about it

1325
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,807
This is a conspiracy theory

1326
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,599
If it weren't for the documents

1327
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:37,951
And what are the documents you gave me says I'm going to quote them this is Google

1328
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,743
Not you it says

1329
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,767
It says quote

1330
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:47,167
Training media are.

1331
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,215
People Like Us are programmed

1332
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,007
People

1333
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,031
Like us

1334
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,311
Our program

1335
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,591
So

1336
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,639
The supposed whistleblower released

1337
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,199
The project Veritas about 120 pages of

1338
01:06:59,455 --> 01:06:59,967
Internal

1339
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:07,391
Basically it all just boils down to something along the lines of

1340
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,975
Didn't realize that our platform was so easily exploitable by people looking

1341
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,767
The profit off weaponized

1342
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:15,327
And now that we do we should probably do something about it

1343
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,935
Diva be responding to

1344
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:22,495
And the other stuff is but we'll get in

1345
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:26,847
One image

1346
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,615
Coup de gras

1347
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,687
It shows a flowchart representing a process of how

1348
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,735
Conscious bias can affect our decisions

1349
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,831
It's what he was just reading what are you just quoted

1350
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,647
Is a string of a flowchart

1351
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,207
It's not a list of things it's that

1352
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:48,095
People Like Us are program

1353
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,399
Which O'Keeffe presented is that being the

1354
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:52,959
Reflective Google's goal

1355
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
Incontact

1356
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,055
This isn't the flowchart that shows Google's brainwashing

1357
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,615
It's a slide in a PowerPoint for the

1358
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:03,199
About the interaction between human and put in AI

1359
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,479
In terms of algorithm

1360
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
Creation

1361
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,295
Just after this flight

1362
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,599
The presentation

1363
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:13,439
And unfortunately we humans have a history of making product design decision

1364
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,719
Veteran line with

1365
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,487
Default

1366
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,767
And not with the needs

1367
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,791
Of everyone

1368
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:21,119
The week program thing isn't the result

1369
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,911
It's discussing a problem

1370
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,191
It arises from

1371
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,007
Consciously accepting default ideas that are danger

1372
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:32,127
The presentation goes on to elucidate how the program this problem

1373
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,431
Discussant have female drivers

1374
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,479
47% more likely to be hurt

1375
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,247
Car accident

1376
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:41,087
Because crash dummies were all based on male body types until 2011

1377
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,879
Another thing that's important

1378
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,695
Slide PowerPoint presentation

1379
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,511
Should be accompanied by a speech

1380
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,095
This is bullet points that are by definition out of context

1381
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,631
Without the full presentation

1382
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,679
Intentionally dishonest

1383
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,983
Yeah I'm from their own document

1384
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:01,823
Yeah it's like it's like a facial recognition technology doesn't

1385
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,359
Would like

1386
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,895
Doesn't recognize black people

1387
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,199
Cuz they only tested on

1388
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:12,063
There's so many of those like emotion

1389
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,087
But I am

1390
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,135
Video game systems

1391
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:21,535
Instant film

1392
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,375
Spotlight

1393
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,447
Baton of stuff like

1394
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:32,031
Algorithmic

1395
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,079
Which is going to come up I believe in this

1396
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,871
Next

1397
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,639
Yeah

1398
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,431
So

1399
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
Here is

1400
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,735
James O'Keefe

1401
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,015
Because

1402
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,063
He's on the show

1403
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,087
Why not

1404
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,183
Nemours

1405
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,487
Still carrying this is incredible

1406
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,071
They're their words not their words not yours they say

1407
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,567
Is because people are not putting that Line in the Sand

1408
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:11,967
So we're like

1409
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,527
Nice sayings

1410
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,063
So what

1411
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:20,415
She does talk about that

1412
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:23,743
Manipulative

1413
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,279
Captured

1414
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,071
Booty talking about is

1415
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:31,679
When you take what she's talking about the Trump situation

1416
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,703
Do not be Trump

1417
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:34,751
Running ABV

1418
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:37,823
The interference and manipulation of algorithms in

1419
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,359
Gaming system

1420
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,919
When she say that like you shouldn't break us up

1421
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
It would be a bad idea

1422
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,247
Companies

1423
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,551
That are less able to deal with that

1424
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,087
Manipulation

1425
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:55,231
Maybe.

1426
01:10:55,487 --> 01:11:00,095
Don't break us up we could stop Trump from winning

1427
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:04,959
He's also discussing that to Jen I said that known as drawing a Line in the Sand

1428
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:07,775
And that's the Google's big companies

1429
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,823
He's completely misrepresenting which

1430
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,103
Clearly talk about

1431
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,639
A lot of this week

1432
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,687
Totally clear if you actually read the documents

1433
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,991
The project Veritas released along with

1434
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,807
A lot of information in there actually debunked

1435
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,087
Everything that James okay

1436
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,367
Not a surprise

1437
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:27,999
Those documents is more like a movie

1438
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,047
You don't need to worry about what's actually

1439
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:38,495
Is this enough for everybody

1440
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:44,127
So that no one's drawing

1441
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
Is there

1442
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:49,503
Is a lot of AI and machine learning

1443
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:52,831
No searches for quotes

1444
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,135
Yo brought up all mail images

1445
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,159
Or weather

1446
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:59,231
If you search for wedding it would bring up exclusively White

1447
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,511
There's a bias

1448
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,791
Come from data

1449
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,071
When it's left out

1450
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:04,863
These are bad

1451
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,655
Those example

1452
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,215
Instances where this phenomenon became

1453
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,751
Foundry much more

1454
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,799
In 2015

1455
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,591
A black man uploaded a photo of

1456
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,871
Consultant

1457
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,431
And the AI labeled image of gorillas

1458
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,503
A 2013 a researcher found that if you searched

1459
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,343
Girls the results were disproportionately more likely to be

1460
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,111
Pornography

1461
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:30,463
A study in 2015 found that ads for high-salary jobs play study

1462
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,023
Times of India website we're being shown

1463
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,303
Typically to mail users

1464
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,095
These are the sort of

1465
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,631
Instances of Honor

1466
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,399
Fairness

1467
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,167
People like Jen

1468
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,191
Tonight we're discussing

1469
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,727
And working to resolve

1470
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,079
You can find an article on the standard from December of last year where she

1471
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:46,847
Discussing

1472
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,127
Particularly in Redford

1473
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,919
Words to a study from a harbor

1474
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,455
Who found the quote

1475
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,223
When you search

1476
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:57,599
Black sounding name arrests related ads

1477
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
The fair

1478
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,927
To all other parts

1479
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
Google's product

1480
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:06,047
Specifically was working on product project

1481
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,839
Related to speech recognition

1482
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,887
How could someone with an accent

1483
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,167
Get full use of

1484
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
Speech recognition

1485
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:12,703
Product

1486
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,727
How about some

1487
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,263
Speech impediment or a stutter

1488
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:19,103
These are the sorts of concerns for her career as it relates to fairness

1489
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,663
Can anyone get a cursory amount of research it

1490
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,455
This would know that that's what

1491
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
James O'Keefe

1492
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,759
Is trying to misrepresent

1493
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,319
If it's clear as day

1494
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,647
Yeah but you look into it would you read the documents

1495
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
You do a little bit of look

1496
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,023
Other than the last 24 hours

1497
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:40,095
What imprint does Jen Jen I have on the internet

1498
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:44,447
Find what you was working on before find out what context clues you can have

1499
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,751
For this casual conversation that you

1500
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,287
Surreptitiously record

1501
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,311
What might

1502
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,895
Bring to that conversation that you're not allowing

1503
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:53,919
2xist

1504
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:54,943
Your footage

1505
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,967
And it disorder

1506
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,527
And I think it's an admiral

1507
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,319
Google that idea of it

1508
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,367
You shouldn't

1509
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
Have

1510
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:05,183
Algorithm

1511
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,999
That would you search for black girls it's all pornography

1512
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:14,399
That is not a pleasant for a good experience for black girls

1513
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
Well

1514
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:20,031
Specifically

1515
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
Just

1516
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:21,823
Confronting

1517
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,639
The most

1518
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,407
Terrifying

1519
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,783
Exposing their own

1520
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,807
Implicit biases

1521
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,575
Is far more than the

1522
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,903
Because if you have to actually

1523
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:38,975
Wrestle with the idea with that very idea

1524
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:42,047
Why does the algorithm

1525
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,583
Amplify

1526
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,351
Implicit bias

1527
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,911
Cuz that's really what it's kind of doing

1528
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:53,311
Right there is amplifying that implicit that's Tobias

1529
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,335
Stop for 1 second

1530
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,895
If you have to add that into your

1531
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:57,919
Calculus

1532
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,759
How could you not extrapolate from that so much

1533
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:05,599
Just for you to say for one second

1534
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,975
Girl and all I got was p***

1535
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,279
How that limits

1536
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:17,119
Automatically without even considering Catalyst for

1537
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:20,191
Yeah and it's

1538
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
Trade is

1539
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,567
Yeah absolutely

1540
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:29,151
Google Documents

1541
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:32,735
They're discussing like that 47% of

1542
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,807
Or 4747

1543
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,879
A cyborg

1544
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,415
Because of

1545
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,463
Crash Test Dummies being modeled after

1546
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,511
If there's even a slide in there that's like

1547
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:48,095
Now where are those people who designed the Christ

1548
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,727
And that's exactly

1549
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:56,031
The same thing is true for so many medications

1550
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,871
That aren't like if it's not specifically made for women

1551
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:03,455
At the testing is almost overwhelmingly done on men

1552
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,271
So

1553
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,063
They're so clearly Liars

1554
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,087
And this is too

1555
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,111
Clearly a publicity

1556
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
Once you

1557
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,767
Peel back the the top layer of

1558
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,815
Okay this is all

1559
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,351
Probably just Dubai

1560
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:24,447
Do you start to have to ask yourself like

1561
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,727
Now why would you

1562
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,519
Do you do that

1563
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,055
Very

1564
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,847
Self-serving

1565
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,407
Secondarily self-serving reason

1566
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,687
All there

1567
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,479
Right in front of you on Apple

1568
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,271
So

1569
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,063
Yourself James O'Keefe

1570
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,647
Lucky you're not prison for the past

1571
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,415
You're not in prison

1572
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,439
The world

1573
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,231
Oh yeah

1574
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
Sleeves

1575
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,535
And the Alex

1576
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:54,143
Keep saying he's going to play Special Report

1577
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,703
I need ends up doing that he does like

1578
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,495
Special Report

1579
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,799
No I don't I don't know if you get to bound

1580
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,823
No bounds joints

1581
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,639
I think he's just kind of done

1582
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,687
Adidas

1583
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,223
I really

1584
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,783
Did it yesterday

1585
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,879
I was legendary yesterday

1586
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,927
Cover this project Veritas videos

1587
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,207
Very excited about it

1588
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,791
Has h a good enough

1589
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,071
People with Wachusett

1590
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,863
Espresso reports

1591
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,679
He's got to

1592
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,703
Dehumanize

1593
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,239
Democratic field

1594
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,263
A little bit

1595
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:44,063
Infowars.com show

1596
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,647
She's doing a two nights

1597
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,415
Tacular

1598
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,463
About the Democratic

1599
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,231
Switch OB

1600
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:51,999
Fuckingawesome

1601
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,071
I would like

1602
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,143
Cockroaches

1603
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:58,911
With chat

1604
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,703
Again has a nice lady at

1605
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,287
Swell

1606
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,335
Pastor political discourse

1607
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,103
Generally

1608
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,711
We had a couple clips

1609
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,479
Laughed

1610
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:17,599
Wanted 2nd episode on

1611
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,623
Episode

1612
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,159
Maybe a little bit of a

1613
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:20,927
Upward

1614
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,279
What is a better head

1615
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,327
Instead we got a couple clips of Alex

1616
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,863
Yelling about a lot of r

1617
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,447
Know this first one

1618
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,471
Is

1619
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,263
I pretty much just him calling her ugly

1620
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,335
That's better than what I

1621
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,383
Fake love

1622
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:46,271
I'm pulling up next Airship I'm planning on whether sex slaves in Somalia

1623
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,503
So he plays like maybe

1624
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,295
3 seconds of a clip

1625
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:25,951
But he has to interrupt the clipboard even plays the part you want

1626
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:37,727
But she's got a wheel.

1627
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,503
I mean

1628
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,063
We know from going back to

1629
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,855
Flavor of the Somali pirate

1630
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:57,183
Somali pirate imagery to

1631
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,975
Demonize her because she's

1632
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,255
From Somalia

1633
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,279
Which is b*******

1634
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,351
Deeply coded

1635
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:10,751
Encoded

1636
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,519
Ugly

1637
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,311
All this stuff is just like

1638
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
You are

1639
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,384
Really really

1640
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,944
Really triggered by this non-white

1641
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,296
Tacos

1642
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:30,976
That's all bulshit to but like

1643
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:36,096
Sharia law being thrown off building

1644
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:39,680
South Alex could be more clear

1645
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,752
I can't

1646
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,032
Stress it enough

1647
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,616
How unpleasant it was the jarring

1648
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:50,688
Disconnect between Sunday and Monday

1649
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,016
And even both of those episodes are disconnected

1650
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,296
Everything else that's been happy

1651
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,344
There is no sense

1652
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,112
Continuity

1653
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,648
Between any of these apis

1654
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,952
They could almost all exist

1655
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,000
The point

1656
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,280
From like years ago

1657
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,584
Papago

1658
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:15,264
Breaking Bad X-Files monster the week Dan you don't need

1659
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,360
Serialized

1660
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:22,688
I guess stylistic lie I don't really have a problem

1661
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,248
It's it's hard to track

1662
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:31,648
A little bit and maybe it would be better served by like we do an episode just about Sunday

1663
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,464
There's no development of narratives

1664
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,744
There's nothing that's like

1665
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,304
Okay I talked about the 5G

1666
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,632
West Virginia on Sunday

1667
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,656
There's nothing

1668
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:47,776
Just like starting over

1669
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,568
Desperate

1670
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,592
And really talk

1671
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,896
Not the other thing about it though

1672
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,176
Is

1673
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,456
I'm noticing

1674
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,528
I probably pointed this out but it always bears

1675
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:03,136
Alex is almost everyday

1676
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:03,904
Trying to go

1677
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,672
Get someone hurt

1678
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
50

1679
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,744
This wasn't the case

1680
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,024
Before

1681
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,864
Responsible and Reckless with his language

1682
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,400
ABC in 2013

1683
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,216
Him being a real stupid dumb prick

1684
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,240
But

1685
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:21,056
The consistency and the regularity with which

1686
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,336
Seems to be

1687
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
Specifically

1688
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,176
Trying to get people hurt

1689
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:31,808
Whether it's the targeting of Jen Jenai buddies tag team

1690
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,856
This is dangerous to her safety

1691
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:38,976
Or the people of this

1692
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:41,536
This is where you can go hunt globalist

1693
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,328
Once the ship goes down

1694
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,936
Like every single day there is somebody that is being put in danger by Alex

1695
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,704
The show

1696
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,264
I don't know if it rises to the level of like

1697
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,568
Jamming signal

1698
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,152
I don't think it does I don't I don't know what that would require

1699
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,688
This trend is

1700
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:01,248
Important for people to be aware of

1701
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,088
Is that it

1702
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:07,904
It's important to note that pretty much everyday

1703
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,464
Something has the potential

1704
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,000
To go so wrong

1705
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:15,072
Haha well he's been on air 25 years

1706
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:18,656
Are you only used to try and get somebody hurt every years

1707
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,960
And then it was every month or so

1708
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,032
The quickening

1709
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,568
Jesus what

1710
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,384
Man I just don't know how you can

1711
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,688
Say all that s*** about Eliana Oma

1712
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,760
Without the self-awareness

1713
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,552
To know that everything that you said is

1714
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,112
Completely and utterly race

1715
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
Beyond

1716
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,160
She probably does

1717
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,792
There's just nothing there but him trying to say

1718
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,096
I'm trying to insult her in anyway

1719
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,888
You possibly can without a coming out in

1720
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,936
I'm just saying I don't like a brown woman in

1721
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,728
It makes me scared

1722
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,896
I think it's important

1723
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,176
To not be public

1724
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,968
Seeing as aware of

1725
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,016
But

1726
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:09,088
You can't be publicly aware of the fact that the documents

1727
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,392
You released contradict his claims

1728
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,696
Publicly aware of

1729
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:16,512
The fact that is videos.

1730
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,280
He says they do

1731
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,120
Yeah

1732
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,912
Publicly aware of how racist

1733
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,960
Otherwise the whole game

1734
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,496
Busted

1735
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,264
Becomes

1736
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:29,824
Another

1737
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,872
Racist

1738
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,968
Videos

1739
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:38,784
They're all playing

1740
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,064
Game of

1741
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,344
Intentional

1742
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,928
Possible deniability

1743
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,952
Ignorance

1744
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:46,976
In order to

1745
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:47,744
Maintain

1746
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,280
Perpetuate the con

1747
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,560
It is

1748
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:53,888
Boring

1749
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,728
Yeah it is it is

1750
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,520
Disappointment anytime you hear that

1751
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,824
I'm going to make as many personal

1752
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,592
Insults as I can

1753
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,872
Can't towards you I'm going to be a

1754
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:04,896
As cruel as possible

1755
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,688
Towards you so I don't

1756
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,712
To stop and think

1757
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,016
Why don't I want

1758
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:10,784
The brown woman in

1759
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,344
Yeah or why do I not want to

1760
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,416
Learn anything more about Dallas

1761
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,952
I am trying argue that

1762
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:22,048
She's a donkey pissing on you

1763
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,352
Just a shortcut

1764
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,656
Thinking about it I find

1765
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,680
Tim Cook stuff

1766
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,216
More offensive

1767
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,240
Because he

1768
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,264
He's hiding it behind

1769
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,544
Something that is a

1770
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,312
Illegitimate credit

1771
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,128
And turning a little criticism

1772
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,664
Of a fox

1773
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:44,064
Criticism

1774
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,136
Universal

1775
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:52,000
Business Insider article about going to that factory in 20

1776
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,560
And they talked to a ton of employees

1777
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:05,056
The watch giraffe

1778
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,688
You know it's the other fact

1779
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,968
It's just

1780
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,248
Drum pad work

1781
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:20,160
I'm not I'm not saying working conditions are all good everywhere

1782
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,952
Specific

1783
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:22,976
Complained that he has

1784
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,512
Is so much more relevant

1785
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,560
The past that he's not been updated

1786
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,888
Condition

1787
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,216
And the issue with that for me is

1788
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,240
He is

1789
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:41,664
Behind

1790
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,296
There's nothing

1791
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:51,648
And so it's almost it's almost inoffensive and it's

1792
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,184
And how pathetic

1793
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:58,816
Mistake that

1794
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,608
Just in

1795
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,888
It's just so obvious

1796
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,680
It's like oh you just don't like a

1797
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,960
A brown woman in charge

1798
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,752
Like you've got nothing

1799
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:10,848
You're blinded by your bigotry and islamophobia

1800
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,128
Congratulations

1801
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:19,040
If you didn't have the narrative from 7 years ago

1802
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:22,880
How to tell

1803
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,672
He built up this suicide net

1804
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,464
Narrative years ago

1805
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,536
And he just has it in his Hip Pocket to pull out whenever

1806
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,840
Tim Cook or a apple comes up

1807
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,120
Right

1808
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:33,888
Yeah

1809
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,960
This episodes worth it if we are

1810
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,984
Because we learn how to post

1811
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,824
I just liked I liked

1812
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,360
Telescopes

1813
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:48,224
I need to know where they are

1814
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:51,040
Go down to Greenbank that sounds awesome

1815
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:52,576
Pretty fuggin.

1816
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:00,256
Even for me who cannot leave his phone anywhere further than five

1817
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,304
From heaven

1818
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:05,120
Hell yeah

1819
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:11,776
Another episode but until we have website

1820
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:17,664
We are on Twitter

1821
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,016
We are on Facebook and you can also download our podcast

1822
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,344
Overcast

1823
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,624
Sure

1824
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,416
Through certain

1825
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,184
Species of

1826
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,840
Tulip specifically for supper so hard to grow

1827
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:41,216
Oh well

1828
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:46,592
So as we come to the end

1829
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,408
Probably has

1830
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,688
Is Alex Jones

1831
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:53,504
Holding

1832
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:59,136
