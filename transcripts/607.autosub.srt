00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
Fight.com

5
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
Acknowledge little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888
God.

7
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Dot-dot-dot

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
Nodded my head but I refuse to clap you were following the beat

9
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,176
Cannot follow the beat bad

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
I have a question

11
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
What's up Jordan do we have the meats

12
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
Exactly are you asked me about my bright spot

13
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,184
Performing something about a meat

14
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,744
So I was taking a trip

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
Do this at this last weekend

16
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,632
Visiting a friend in DC we decided

17
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
To get

18
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,448
Some Burmese food for dinner

19
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,520
Okay and I was looking at the menu where your order it

20
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
And there's something there was a beef

21
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,896
I stood with Chili's all day

22
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,808
No no okay that was stew

23
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Okay

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
And so I decided to

25
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
Get that and

26
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
My friend was ordering it

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
And I could hear on the other end of the

28
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,536
The phone to the guy taking the order

29
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,608
Going

30
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,032
It was a ridiculous tell me laugh like he's

31
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,128
That's our joke menu item I got your billy ated

32
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,200
And I thought everything was going to be fine but hey man

33
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
Man

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
Hot

35
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
Yeah I deserve to get laughed at but I'm up on the wall of a tire

36
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
Hi restaurant you know

37
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
I've had to I've had some adventures in spice

38
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Yeah you got

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,096
I think I think

40
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
Maybe I'm getting old

41
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
I think it happen

42
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,216
Maybe I can't handle it but it also felt like

43
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
Get them that Harper

44
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,080
No not really but I got like overwhelmed

45
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
I got like

46
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,640
Sweat

47
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,504
It was a it was a full body experience

48
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
We are the trip was nice

49
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,088
I got back

50
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,208
And here we are that's awesome it was great

51
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,048
Goodtime all-in-all no bright spot but also that glass that

52
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
Over the phone

53
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
That's too good

54
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,680
I cherish cherish that moment took my life

55
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,496
He was right that is okay

56
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,896
Also pretty fun it is nice whenever people are confidently mocking you and then they win

57
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,760
The Thai place that I go to that will give you the are you sure

58
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,088
And usually it's okay I can handle it

59
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
But not the

60
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,416
Actually honestly kind of think that if it was chicken

61
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
I could have been okay

62
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,256
Because that they keep profile was very strong

63
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,352
But there was something about it being a beef and have to chew it a little bit more it's a little bit more

64
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,400
Gaming

65
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
I don't know you were real

66
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Guy anyway

67
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,056
I'm generally not I don't need all that I'll do more of a poultry purse

68
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
Yeah

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
Bright spot then is

70
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,088
Laugh your ass off

71
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,839
That would be great if everytime I hear a laugh it just

72
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
It's funnel through light-years asgore by

73
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
There's only one lap

74
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,775
My bright spot dead is azure if you recall

75
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
Back in the day

76
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,615
When I went to see Shelly Otani

77
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
They stole my bag

78
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Cuz it wasn't either

79
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
So then I got a backpack

80
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,415
Cuz I am a messenger bag guy all the way yeah yeah yeah

81
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
Awful

82
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
Sitting right my partner

83
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,839
Found me the ultimate messenger bag

84
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
It's got a

85
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,727
Bartholin s*** for the the thing it's amazing it fits all kinds of stuff

86
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
It's ladies night you know I love a good hidden Pocket

87
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,175
Only thing better than a hidden Pocket on a bag is a hidden pocket in your coat

88
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
Love those those

89
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
Interior pockets

90
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,927
Something dramatic Lee there

91
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
Proof

92
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
I'm going to whip it out

93
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,095
Why do I have this manila envelope

94
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
You know why

95
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,167
Hahaha

96
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
The bag is absolutely fantastic

97
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,287
She thought about a gift for me

98
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
I'm notoriously terrible to buy gif

99
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,175
Sure cuz I'm not really I don't really eat that stuff

100
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
You know when you're in a position where you're struggling

101
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,575
With his backpack it lends itself to a gift and it was it was a maze

102
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,231
I'm happy for you cuz I was getting to be calling you back back

103
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
We're back

104
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:03,007
Back from the little break

105
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Something a little bit different

106
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:10,431
Off the beaten path made out of thing that's becoming something we may do a little bit more of Anything Goes On

107
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,991
It has it has its

108
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,783
It's not always

109
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
The easiest thing to get people

110
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Who would want

111
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
To talk

112
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
Ownership

113
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:27,071
Are not something we do very often but we get in touch with Mike Rothschild

114
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:32,703
Is that somebody's been following qanon industry for a long time

115
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,103
He has a book out called the storm is upon us right about the roots of qanon

116
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,943
Conversation with him about

117
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
Some of the bookend

118
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:49,343
Some of the intersections with the Alex Jones World speaking of which it's very funny that even if

119
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
The book world that we live in

120
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
He has to put in parentheses

121
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
Every time you put

122
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
Is named Mike Rothschild

123
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
No relation not every time but it is

124
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,727
With him it now is going to sound like we're hyper-focused on there

125
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Tacit

126
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
So we'll get to that interview here in a moment

127
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335

Money off that heroin

Last time we had an interview at that fun like

142
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,447
Little bit that's true

143
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
That's true that's true this is less of a

144
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,615
Let's take you to a fantasy world where we're interfering

145
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,431

We have two full interviews now yeah but opportunities of pop-up and lend themselves

152
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,871
Do productive conversations that are not that are interesting to the the world that we look at

153
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,175
Nobody ever wanted to talk to us

154
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
That is true that was a long stretch of time where

155
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,111
Who are they

I'm really excited

168
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:09,023
To be here I think the elephant in the room of course is that you were very

169
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
Insisting

170
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
In the book

171
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,631
Okay that you're not related to the Rothschild

172
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,959
I am not related to the Rothschild

173
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,775
I drive a 2004 Toyota Corolla

174
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:25,151
Microwave

175
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919

00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
No no there are

177
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,599
People with the same last name not related

Do each other at shock I know but nobody

179
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,815
NFL running back priest Holmes look

00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Just like you

181
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,191
You get accusations about that a lot

182
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:54,591
The like I noticed in the book there was at least a time there's parenthetically no relation to the author

183
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,943
I just have to assume with the world that you cover with you and I

184
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Conspiracy

185
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Stop people with

186
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
Make that connection and probably be mad

187
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Yeah people

188
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
People think that I'm acting as some sort of like

189
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
Hype man for the family

190
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,511
You know

191
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
They're like

192
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
Chuck D

193
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,887
And I'm like Flavor Flav and I've got my clock

194
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,679
Yelling like

195
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,727
Like we do

196
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
Defensive like map

197
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Yeah it's like it's like a

198
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
Braces PR hype man

199
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,527
Kerbals was a hype man you know I like yeah yeah

200
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,391
Very flashy

201
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,231
Swastika-shaped made it hard to tell time

202
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,791
But this is the thing that you find with a lot of

203
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,119
Old-money families is that they don't address this stuff at all

204
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Like they don't

205
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
They don't talk

206
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
Like there's no

207
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
Members of the Rothschild family

208
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
Going on the record and talking about this something they don't talk about

209
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
They

210
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
They

211
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
He doesn't exist

212
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
For that day today

213
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,271
They just live their lives because they know that anything that they throw in

214
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,599
The fire is just going to be used as proof that it's all true

215
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
You can't prove that you're not some

216
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Don't talk about it

217
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
You know you got that a lot with these

218
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Older money

219
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Family

220
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
He's going to pass down a lot of wealth

221
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
The subjective rumors

222
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
There's nothing to say

223
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,727
Yeah there's no winning in coming out and being like

224
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
Not true

225
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,359
It's like the you know proving you're not a witch by

226
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
Brown rice

227
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
That's exactly

228
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,247
I would say they could come out and say

229
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,831
Peasants we give no fux about you that would also count

230
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,023
So you wrote This Book

231
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
About qanon

232
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
And I was curious about like

233
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
How much of this was it was

234
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
Like the result of like a passion

235
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
Or did you set out

236
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
As a project

237
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
Who's this was this something you were interested in

238
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Before

239
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
You were getting in the book were you following it

240
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
Like

241
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
Organically as it was happening

242
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,807
I've been writing about

243
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
Conspiracy theories for

244
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
Most of it just

245
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
No money

246
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
I mean obviously

247
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
But I've been

248
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Interested in the subject

249
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,583
I really got into the whole idea

250
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Conspiracy

251
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Storytelling

252
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
Through coasttocoastam

253
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,031
I used to listen to it to Art Bell a lot and I never believed any of

254
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
So

255
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
Outside of my own

256
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
Middle class

257
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
Suburban existence

258
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
It's talking about UFOs in the Illuminati

259
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
Error code

260
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
Well yeah

261
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
But you just can't talk about

262
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
That's true

263
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
So this was

264
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,951
I was really into this as

265
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
Is a form of Storytelling

266
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,327
And so a I could have drifted into it more and more professionally

267
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
And so I

268
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
I wrote I had an opportunity right my first book with

269
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Which came out

270
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
20

271
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,519
But long before that I'd started to

272
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
Look at qanon

273
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
The first

274
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
My first inkling of

275
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Sing something

276
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
There was beginning of 28

277
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
First drops came out

278
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
And I started seeing tweets about

279
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,111
John McCain and Hillary Clinton

280
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
Wearing orthopedic

281
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
Walking boots

282
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
Not because things like hurt their feet like

283
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
The rest of us peasants

284
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,815
But because they were wearing ankle brace

285
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Because they've been arrested

286
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,191
In a purge of the storm

287
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,775
All this is awesome I I got it I got to dive into this and see where it where the

288
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,895
What do you think this is true what else is true

289
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
This

290
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
They're not like slacker

291
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
You can't wait to hollow out a walking

292
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
A better monitor bracelet and its

293
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,231
Leopard print I've always liked that the most

294
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,887
Filmed people on Earth need ankle bracelets

295
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Well that's

296
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,591
But I started to get a little more concerned about it when I started to see the parallels

297
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Qanon

298
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
Today's previous

299
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
The araki

300
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,807
Donarski had them before that in the sorrow

301
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,879
Before that the Omega Trust scam and use some of these things

302
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
I've been running since the early 90s

303
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
And have

304
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,255
Built a lot of people out of a lot of money

305
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
Using the same kind of stutter

306
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
This sort of

307
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,679
All-knowing Guru who has access to secret Intel

308
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983

311
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,639
Kuwait change event happens

312
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,479
And it's always about to happen and there's always some dark force that

313
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Gets in the way Justice

314
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Everything's about

315
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
How to change

316
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
It's Suites

317
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,623
You not such a coincidence that happens

318
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,999
I don't talk to Everyday every time it's always like just about to happen

319
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
And with the

320
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,583
Dinar scam I mean the level of minutiae.

321
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351

Do you guys know that

345
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
The more

346
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Arcade

347
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Detail

348
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
Load onto something

349
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
The more believable at the

350
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
Getting more big something is the less real

351
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,743
Yeah cuz I think people have just sort of the way of

352
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
Being tricked by specificity

353
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
Do you know you don't think

354
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Bit someone

355
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:13,471
Would make up all of these

356
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:18,079
Yeah and I think another element to is like when you have all those details and all of these weird

357
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Steps that you need to take

358
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
It's if you get

359
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,967
Trick by one you really don't want to admit you got trick

360
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
Buy that one

361
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
Go for the 2nd of 3rd

362
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:32,159
4th step it becomes much easier to rationalize

363
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Done

364
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:38,303
You're not done being blackmail there's always going to be more that you're supposed to do you know

365
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,375
Right there's always another step is always another

366
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,447
Bit of manusina one of my favorite details with the Omega

367
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,775

00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,135
I mean really

376
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:09,535
Mattoon Illinois and that is where they keep those Secret banknotes

377
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
Batshit

378
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,863
Bite my favorite detail that was that the

379
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
The cash that you

380
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
You sent in

381
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
To buy your Omega units

382
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
How to be wrapped in

383
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Tin foil

384
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
Sure I know why

385
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,895
But those Rays getting an inline currency

386
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
But it's 82

387
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
Details that make something

388
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
You seem real

389
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
Yeah because otherwise why would you do that

390
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
Admire the

391
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
These people

392
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,535
Yeah that's why they call them, there's a reason just such I don't know how

393
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,583
I mean like I don't even know how I would

394
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,167
Be able to tell you that I know secret European note

395
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Let alone your ear sore

396
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Circle.of

397
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
Church Coronavirus

398
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
Making phone calls

399
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,175
To get more people to invest in

400
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:05,087
Now I got to do that as the story of America though like it was literally founded upon Colton Khan

401
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,415
Tire country has been built out of people

402
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,463
Bullshiting other people for money

403
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,839
Memphis intertwining

404
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
The Puritans were very capital

405
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:22,239
And the the aspirational model I think it's something that

406
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,335
It'll really works with those kinds of ponds and works all the way going up the trunk

407
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
I mean so much

408
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Jobs

409
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
Appeal

410
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
Was

411
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,039
I'm going to make you dislike me we've got the bigger boats we've got the nicer

412
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,087
I mean you're talking to coal miners

413
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
In like

414
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
Rural Pennsylvania

415
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Like we're talking about boats

416
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,231
Penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park

417
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Again really

418
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,423
Depressing thought I never really put it there put it that way in my head of like dropping like I will make you like me

419
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:57,055
Let me know when you look at the social Mobility numbers through class system

420
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,639
And you you realize that nobody from the lower classes even moving up

421
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
To the middle class

422
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,527
There's no greater, than the American dream talking build whatever you want and become rich

423
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,415
I really liked your your rebuttal in the book

424
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,743
For the Dinar revaluation thing where it was just

425
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,071
This is not how this works

426
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,119
This would never happen

427
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,983
Fundamentally mistaken this would destroy all money in the world

428
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,799
And you and that's a really

429
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
It's a really useful way to look at

430
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,919
It's something that seems really complex like the dinar like you and I

431
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
To break it down into the simple idea of

432
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,527
That's not how this works this

433
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
This is not

434
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
This is not

435
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
How things happen

436
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
Money does not

437
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Simply

438
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
You're like that

439
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
You can't just

440
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Become

441
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
A billionaire

442
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
Overnight

443
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
With the stroke of a pen

444
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,655
And I've all your friends be billionaires and have money have any value

445
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:58,239
Yeah yeah then you have the dollar is the new dinner

446
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
Here's end up circular

447
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,687
I think that that is helpful unless you already believe all this

448
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
I think it's still not penetrated

449
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Yeah

450
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,575
No it's not it's it's been

451
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
And you start to fall back on what that's what they want you

452
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,928
Think that you do

453
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,232
They don't know what we know we have

454
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Secret knowledge

455
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,328
They don't know they're asleep it's that feeling of specialness

456
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
But you got

457
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,912
When you are consuming conspiracy media

458
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
And it's being reflected back to you up

459
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
I know

460
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
I-know-something-you-don't-know

461
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,200
Ultimately if your respond with like when you boil down that DNR scam

462
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
Your response

463
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
Like at the most Elemental level is just

464
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
No

465
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,184
You know you want to be like a hen with a newspaper

466
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
Are you can't

467
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:56,352
What are the things that I think is is really interesting about framing qanon that way or looking at it from that perspective

468
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Tutus like

469
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,472
It doesn't appear to be similar necessarily in the same way as those

470
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Those are like

471
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
Very

472
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
Clearly I want money

473
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,872
Kind of skiing Torres I think

474
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
Externally

475
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,456
You view qanon as like wow this is

476
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,528
Ideas or

477
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
It doesn't seem as much of like a money machine

478
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,136
Right and that was what was really trouble

479
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,672
Something like

480
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,208
Nosara the dinar

481
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
There's the financial

482
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
Most people kind of Savvy enough

483
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
To know that

484
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:32,192
You can't buy a million Dinars and somebody signed a piece of paper in your Milly

485
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
Like most people know that that's

486
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
But what

487
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
You was selling wasn't

488
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
That you're going to get rich

489
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
It was

490
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
You're going to feel awesome

491
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,224
When did Hillary Clinton and John podesta

492
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
Get the short

493
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
Drop from the Rope at Guantanamo Bay

494
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
Good feeling better was selling

495
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
The idea that

496
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
These people that they've hated for

497
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Decades

498
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
Finally going

499
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
Get what's coming

500
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,096
So it is it is absolutely no surprise

501
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
Host by

502
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
Like you was

503
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Hillary Clinton

504
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
Is on the Run

505
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
She's going to be extradited

506
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,056
There's going to be riots

507
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
The National Guard's going to come out into the streets

508
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,152
Everything that you wanted is going to have

509
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,272
Yeah I think I think it'll be good so it's

510
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,552
I don't know if people

511
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Recognized

512
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
In those communities

513
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,672
Conspiracy and right-wing communities in particular like

514
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,976
Hillary Clinton's like catnip

515
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
It like

516
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,584
If you want to pitch something kind of silly attaching her to it is

517
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,960
Over and over again through two years & years on Alex's show

518
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,544
Like Larry Nichols was able to create a cottage industry for himself

519
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
Coming up with nonsense but thing I

520
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
Hillary

521
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:48,992
Yeah I mean the movie Hitch the moment they successfully got everybody to tithe

522
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,552
The Foster murder to the clintons no matter what

523
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Like

524
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,648
It doesn't matter if you believe it or not believe it you know

525
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
But they are

526
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,720
Associated with the Vince Foster murder

527
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
Then you can just make up any

528
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:06,144
Yeah that I was actually I was listening to an old Art Bell open lines Show from

529
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,704
I think like Miller Lite 90-95

530
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,544
One of the things that he was talking about was that having a handwriting analyst

531
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,104
Take a look at the Vince Foster suicide

532
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
Was

533
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,688
Going to be a little bit more skeptical that a lot of

534
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,504
The modern computer

535
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,112
Blaming stuff on the clintons I mean this is a mid-90s and it's still

536
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Happening

537
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
Yeah

538
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
You brought up but you brought a blackened Coast

539
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
Costa Coast am quite a bit you just

540
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,024
Brought back up our belts and I have to ask

541
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:39,168
Do you not like a George Noory as much as I don't like it I do not like George Noory at all

542
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
Guy sucks

543
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,776
It's a different kind of show and it's not his

544
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
Spawn

545
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,336
Yeah it's not as like

546
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
We're going to figure this out

547
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Together and

548
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:54,528
That was skeptical I mean that's one of the things about his shows that have something called in and had some

549
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,808
Cockamamie story like

550
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,880
He wasn't all that totally happened I believe that completely

551
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
He would actually sort of

552
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
Talk about this

553
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
I try to tease out

554
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
Is this pause

555
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
The guy was also a prank

556
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
He was in the least

557
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,192
Sort of a selective crank

558
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
If that's a thing

559
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:19,104
Kiki easy but have less of like an agenda then like George Noory is definitely like he has

560
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
Ideas

561
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,944
Tarbell was like

562
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
He was the one who had Courtney

563
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Brown on

564
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
But they were talking about the

565
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:30,112
Spaceship behind Hale-Bopp

566
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
You f***** up

567
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
A bit

568
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
Yam

569
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
George Noory way worse

570
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
We can all agree on that and I'm glad

571
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:43,168
What other radio hosts do you hate go ahead and get me a list

572
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,848
All of the all of the feeling hosts on Coast to Coast

573
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Sucks

574
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Very granular

575
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:02,624
Actually that's it that's enough that's an interesting connection to

576
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
George Noory on his show

577
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,744
I'll actually his head Steve pieczenik

578
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,768
As a guest

579
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,352
Number of times and I know that this is something that we've sort of

580
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,912
Messaged a little bit about about

581
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,984
Assassinated to understand

582
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,056
What kind of an interaction

583
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,384
You someone who studies qanon would think

584
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
Of him

585
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
Of doctor Steve

586
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
Pieczenik

587
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,016
Supersonic is one of those guys

588
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,952
Do quasi-military connected Plaza intelligence connected

589
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
And it turns that

590
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
A Persona where they know everything

591
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
And they have all the secrets

592
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,936
And they can see through everything

593
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
And they're like the most

594
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,496
Dangerous people in the world

595
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
They're the only ones were willing to tell the

596
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
Meanwhile

597
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,920
Nothing if you can trust me I've murdered Aldo Moro

598
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
Like I I do about the

599
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:06,368
The slave colonies on Mars it's the most deadly secret in the world

600
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,672
And yet I continue to not be

601
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,256
But you get a lot of those people in that world

602
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,608
Is tenuously Eve military-connected or tenuously

603
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,656
Turn that into a

604
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,704
Persona where they are the Oreck

605
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,056
And there that they're the most dangerous people around me the Bill Cooper

606
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
What's the same way

607
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,408
These guys somehow

608
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
Have all of the Seeker

609
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
Never actually

610
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
Put in any kind of danger

611
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,624
A some kind of an accident they ended up

612
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
Stumbling onto like

613
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:45,024
The P I guess that's more just like Bill's mythology but yeah

614
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,168
They can't ever prove but they know for sure and I can't be killed over it because if they get killed then you'll know it

615
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Right

616
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,984
That's why they can't assassinate you

617
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,776
It's a good that's a good explanation

618
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
I am

619
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872
I think that it's

620
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,736
You comparing are you bringing up like Robert David Steele and Steve pieczenik

621
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
I can sort of the same

622
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
Area is is is

623
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
Is relevant

624
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
Except

625
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,648
I don't know it would

626
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,768
Do you know if Robert David Steele actually was in the FBI or anything like

627
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,096
He makes a lot of claims where Steve pieczenik was in the states

628
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:24,192
Apartment Morrow

629
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,752
Yeah it's it's always it's always

630
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
It's hard with these guys

631
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Is there such

632
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,616
Bullshitters Eli so much

633
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
All the time

634
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
That you you kind never

635
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,504
Quite know where you are so you just have to

636
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,040
Their claims

637
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,344
As they, rather than serve do that

638
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
Deep dive into the

639
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
Shorts because so much of it is just so

640
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Murky

641
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,488
Thoughts around their own mythology

642
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
So it's

643
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,328
Never quite as satisfying to try to dig in and

644
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
These people really are

645
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
In terms of the the

646
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
Qanon

647
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,240
Post in the lake

648
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,592
Not coming directly from the Cadre of

649
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
Potential

650
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
Accused

651
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:09,504
Are people just made you feel if you get the vibe that people are just making stuff up whole cloth

652
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,320
Or are they stealing it from somewhere

653
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
It's both

654
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
To drop

655
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,720
Curly story

656
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Is told by the

657
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,048
What the storm was originally supposed

658
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,608
You know this Mass arrests

659
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,656
Missed my trunk through Twitter

660
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
Marines National Guard called up

661
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:35,616
That very much seems like something you would read in a Robert Ludlum novel

662
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
Co-creator of the op-center

663
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
Evening ride

664
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,880
Caucus

665
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,160
You got this order

666
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,488
Tom Clancy ask story being told it does seem

667
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
Barrier Ridge

668
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,048
At some point

669
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
What story

670
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
And then

671
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,632
You just kind of

672
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,936
Kicking the can down the road which is the traditional

673
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
And one of the things that you

674
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
That really happened

675
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,800
Was that there was a need for more

676
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
This became really popular

677
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
Soak you needed to just

678
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
Put more stuff

679
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
So there was a lot of

680
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,784
You got a lot of

681
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,088
Repurpose meme

682
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
Grab.

683
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
There's a

684
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
A fairly early on

685
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
Thank you

686
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
4 drop

687
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
List of rust

Again

690
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,376
Not a sting that's not

691
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Thing works

692
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,984
But but it's

693
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,520
Apple Bank in the Federal Reserve

694
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,592
List of Rothschild Central Bank

695
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Floating around

696
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,176
12

697
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,992
From some Anonymous blog

698
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
Somebody else grabbed

699
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
All Scrabble

700
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,624
I didn't you grab that I'm somebody else will grab it

701
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,976
You do the same thing happened with the results you drop where q insinuates that

702
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,304
Angela Merkel is the daughter of Adolf Hitler

703
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Sure

704
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
They're both in Germany

705
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,912
Purple associated with Germany

706
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,448
Yeah

707
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
That came from

708
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
The hoax like what

709
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
Does it meet

710
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:13,920
What does it mean

711
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,576
That was mean hold on hold on I got to work. Just continue say wonderful

712
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
For the rest of my life

713
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,928
Cuz I know from other reputable sources the Gorge

714
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,744
W bush is also the spawn of Hitler

715
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,144
That would make him and Angela Merkel like cousins second cousins a little weird

716
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
You have to

717
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
To think that like

718
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,496
Der fuhrer I saved

719
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
His semen

720
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
And somebody just like

721
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,848
For 10 years

722
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,640
How did that work

723
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,664
I don't know if you could

724
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:52,064
Bring it out every Christmas is like Silas past was firm around this is Hitler come on everybody

725
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,208
I've seen enough weird stuff on the History Channel that that doesn't strike me as soon as possible

726
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,560
You can't prove it didn't happen

727
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
Yeah I have

728
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,144
I have like

729
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
Assertive

730
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
Fiery

731
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,776
And I don't know whoever like sort of bear out here actually

732
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,336
If there's any Credence to it at all but

733
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:20,224
We when we were going back and looking at some of the lead-up to the 2016 election

734
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
Steve

735
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,856
The track was on Alex's show talking about there being a secret coup

736
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,416
Military people on the inside

737
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
I don't I didn't follow Catholic

738
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,512
Fix it already happened

739
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:38,144
You don't need to worry about already in jail

740
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,520
I never followed qanon closely enough to know how well that matched up but it felt

741
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
Very similar

742
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,848
I just felt like there were at least the Matic

743
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
Parallels

744
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,408
Distinguish

745
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176
You isn't it

746
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,712
It's very different from a lot of

747
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
Conspiracy theories

748
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Conspiracy theories

749
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,088
People out of power

750
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,392
Where you get those like

751
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,464
The secret counter-coup when does deep State and stuff like that

752
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,816
With you it was we have the power and we're going to use

753
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,632
So that's where that aspirational model comes

754
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,752
We got the power to do this

755
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,288
We just have to wait until all of

756
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
All the pieces are in

757
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,104
Everything is perfect

758
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,920
But there can't be any questions like it has to look

759
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,968
Wiggle it has to be completely legit

760
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
Either we're going to Roundup

761
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
100000

762
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,064
So with

763
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
It wasn't like

764
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
Because it was already

765
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,928
People who are in power

766
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
The question

767
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
Two people never asked

768
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Themselves

769
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
Are we still on

770
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,608
Yeah

771
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,168
No we're just listening really really intently

772
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,984
That's the first time I've done this in a long time

773
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,848
When we do not interrupt seem like they're frozen

774
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
Impatient

775
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Septic by now

776
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,040
DD question that the

777
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,088
The Q people never ask himself is

778
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,136
Why don't we just do it

779
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
The president you just do this

780
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
He doesn't have to worry about

781
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
How it works

782
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:13,376
He's the president she's lived here he's the God ever cares what the Optics are just grab them

783
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,680
Everyday everyday that you wait

784
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
More children are trafficked

785
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,544
More more adrenochrome is drained

786
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
Rothschild

787
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
Money is moved around

788
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,408
Do it now why you why are you waiting

789
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
I think never going to ask

790
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,480
Awesome songs.

791
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,040
Australian summer 2019

792
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,112
Youtube.com

793
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,184
It's the same thing as a chair

794
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
Nobody

795
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,744
Wait a minute

796
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
Is the military intelligence operations

797
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
Saving the world

798
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,352
Did they just take the summer off

799
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,752
Like where the children being trafficked engaged in matter

800
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,568
Using a simple question

801
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,616
These people never ever ask

802
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,944
Why it's as somebody who believes in workers rights

803
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,344
I would say that they should take it with this

804
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,904
Summer somewhere

805
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,208
Probably somewhere cold

806
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,792
What a nice change-of-pace listen

807
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,912
Yeah that is that is one of the interesting disconnect

808
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,448
Text that is the lake well

809
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,544
If this really where would it says to be represented self as

810
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
Vape seems incredibly in Coppell

811
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,408
Like what has

812
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,200
What has a sort of happen

813
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,016
And how the messages have gotten out the website

814
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
Being

815
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
What they are

816
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,392
It's me

817
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,720
Full of child pronography and Mass

818
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,048
Shooter Manifesto is a there's that great moment in the

819
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,096
You Into the Storm

820
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,144
Where are Liz crokin

821
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,168
Is being called

822
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
Calling hobak

823
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
Yeah there's there's

824
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
Child born on a chair

825
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,800
And she's like what

826
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:01,920
It was fighting fighting the child pornographers liquid child pronography

827
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
What kind of face

828
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,736
Like somebody kicked her dog or so

829
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
Computing with her house

830
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
This place

831
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,392
Yeah I think some of that has to do with like

832
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
The

833
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:16,512
You know the audience of this being a little bit older and maybe people who aren't it's

834
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
Familiar with the

835
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,376
The realities of these Message Board sites like some of them

836
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,192
And the character that they have and what goes on there

837
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,776
Yeah and there's there's a reason that BQE Kota

838
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,312
System really revolved around

839
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
Is Dee's website

840
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
Aggregator

841
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
I would post

842
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
The drops

843
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,736
After they went up on a generator

844
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
Where you didn't have to

845
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,552
Go to the place

846
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,160
Nobody should be

847
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:50,560
Should probably go there and be like I don't know about this whole thing

848
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
You want

849
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
People to be involved with

850
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,424
You just don't want them to know

851
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
I would actually

852
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,288
Very simple to use aggregator

853
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,336
And that's where you get

854
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
That's where you you find your

855
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
Decoding Fred

856
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
You're like

857
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
List of

858
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,992
Resignations and mysterious deaths

859
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
So whatever

860
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,808
Yeah you're not going to the store

861
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
Everything is getting

862
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:20,256
That's that's the thing that I was really struck by is like

863
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,048
It wasn't it was almost

864
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,072
Distilling

865
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,120
Less than it was laundering it was like

866
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
They took out the

867
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
Craziest

868
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,752
Parts that were on H and they put them one step below

869
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,824
And then one step below until the the thing that was

870
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
Valuable

871
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,152
Suddenly shows up on Fox News

872
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,224
And then people go from Fox News to the neck

873
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
Step back up

874
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,832
To the next step back up until they get more and more extreme

875
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,624
So it was kind of a weird almost

876
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
Fluctuation of

877
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,720
Trickle-down bulshit being pushed back

878
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,000
Backup

879
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Yeah

880
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:57,376
Yeah it's definitely am up here amid where the start of the war stuff is

881
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
A chad

882
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,984
Really sloppy Reddit stuff

883
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,128
Awkward using more legitimate right-wing blogs

884
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:13,248
Social media and it winds up on Infowars that it winds up on like

885
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Gateway pundit

886
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,600
Fox News and Trump tweets

887
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,880
Right back.

888
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,440
It really was a welder

889
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,000
Develop system I don't know that anybody Buy

890
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,096
It's just that says how information blows with

891
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,400
Nothing nothing

892
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,776
And there are no there's no light that your sister

893
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
It is all

894
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,408
Suffocating darkness and paranoia and anger.

895
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,712
The great sentence

896
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,320
And I think it's also like it information space were like

897
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
It's

898
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Like

899
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
Truthfulness neutral

900
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Or whatever it's

901
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,256
Things are things are expedient are useful they're not really

902
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,304
It does not really it's not a hindrance

903
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
If something is not

904
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
True order

905
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,632
Patently not true

906
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
Right and you say Well it's

907
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,728
It's true for me

908
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,288
And that's how the wellness world

909
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
Osaka

910
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,360
That's always been a world look like

911
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,152
Well it's if my

912
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,200
Experiences my Jeremiah

913
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,272
It's wrong is true to me

914
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,576
Reality is for

915
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,856
Right exactly

916
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
That sucks

917
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,376
A dirigible Corrections darkness that is that is nice distillation of

918
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:39,264
What a bummer was wondering cuz I was reading through this book and the the

919
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
Beginning of

920
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,872
Qanon happens so similarly to

921
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
At digest-all call

922
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,992
You know that just like progression of step-by-step process

923
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,064
And I was I was seeing it happen

924
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
And now that

925
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,904
Interesting so replicable

926
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:01,024
Do you know what I mean like there's so many possible nuclear anons if you go

927
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,608
Do any of these different faces people are trying to create that

928
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,168
Phenomenon again do you think that

929
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
Possible

930
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,752
You know every one of these things is a little bit

931
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,312
Difference but they're also really similar

932
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,848
You know what one of the

933
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
The gulls are really hard with right

934
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,176
In the book was to strip back

935
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
Be

936
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
The social media she not even on the reveal what the

937
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,832
And the component parts are all

938
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:25,856
Is all stuffy

939
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,880
It's been floating around

940
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
Decade

941
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,440
Centrum

942
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
The blood libel

943
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
12:00 or whatever it was

944
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,304
There's very little in

945
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,888
You are not at work

946
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,656
Poor people

947
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,680
Can you repurpose

948
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,472
Conspiracy theory

949
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
New persona

950
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
We saw that

951
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,056
Wishing

952
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,104
Coast

953
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,128
January 6th

954
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:48,896
Qanon

955
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
He can

956
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,736
And taking in a completely different

957
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,760
Directions you.

958
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,808
People like ghosts

959
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
Catalpa tree

960
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
Score taking the mythology of

961
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Fun

962
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,696
Rebuilding it into something that works for

963
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,232
For them and they can get

964
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,536
Viral Fame and money

965
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,816
Yo everybody

966
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,120
Everybody takes it in their own Direction

967
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,424
And some of it doesn't work in some of it.

968
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
And that will

969
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,776
On and on and on

970
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,544
Forever

971
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
His people will always be

972
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,616
Be susceptible to being told

973
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
What to believe

974
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,200
Being validated and what they think is true

975
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,248
And in being part of a spy

976
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
Special secret community

977
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,064
Qanon.pub

978
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,088
The New World Order

979
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
Everything else

980
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
Alex Jones

981
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
That's

982
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,952
That is going to be with us

983
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
Now that sucks

984
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,472
This is the part in in like TV or normal radio interviews are where they're like

985
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,544
Oh okay well you told us a lot about this

986
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,104
What do you think our next steps are to stop it

987
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,151
And the previous answer is just

988
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,967
This is here forever

989
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:02,367
It's because like these are kind of the feelings and thoughts that I have when I when I

990
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,903
You know look at this stuff tonight

991
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
And I wrestle with Alex

992
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,463
Primarily

993
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
And you know it is

994
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,047
Hard to fight those feelings like well

995
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,119
This is just something with humanity is always going to have to

996
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,423
The deal with it's not it's not something that

997
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
I can

998
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,007
Ever be like well we've we've fixed

999
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,311
And it sucks

1000
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,103
To the ghetto

1001
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,503
Somebody else who researches a lot of his stuff

1002
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:33,599
This is a geometric proof being followed up with I but you know yeah

1003
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:40,511
But I do appreciate in the book also that that you did

1004
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,815
Very clearly delineate that blood libel part

1005
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
Like I'm such an important

1006
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
Piece of

1007
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
Like

1008
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:49,215
What makes some of this like the archaic anti-semitic trope

1009
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
Cooked into a lot of

1010
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,055
These conspiracy theories

1011
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,871
It's something that I think a lot of people

1012
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:59,199
Me miss or may not want to address I think

1013
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Super bored

1014
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,039
Yeah there's a real sense of

1015
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,087
With you and like we're still

1016
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,671
Doing this like we're still dredging up these stereotypes

1017
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
You're based on

1018
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,535
Things like the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1019
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,559
Debunk

1020
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,351
NetSpend that are knocked out

1021
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,143
Over and over and over again

1022
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,423
But it doesn't matter

1023
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,959
People who walk

1024
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
These things to be true

1025
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,775
And everything that they do is

1026
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,079
Validated by the idea that yeah there are

1027
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,639
Wealthy string pullers who are

1028
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,479
Making their lives miserable and the rising tide of

1029
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,247
Progressivism

1030
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,551
Canceling their way of life is

1031
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
It's making it

1032
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,879
You're wrong for them to do all the jokes that you

1033
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,927
Spell worship the way they used to

1034
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,975
Against a certain words

1035
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,255
They they can't

1036
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,327
Eat 25 Burgers of a week anymore that they have

1037
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,143
E23 Burgers now

1038
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,471
Did this Doctor Seuss book that they never heard of

1039
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:57,567
Instantly not being printed anymore and it's like that's worth.

1040
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:04,223
Get back how Hitler came to power book that I've never heard of

1041
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,527
I just want somebody to come out and be like look

1042
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,623
We've got thousands of years of unbroken hatred towards

1043
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:15,231
The Jews and we're just not going to stop now well it's is always going to whoop you all this time

1044
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:19,839
Really whoever made those posts really understood that

1045
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
That

1046
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,655
That you understood the way

1047
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,423
These tropes

1048
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
Work why they work

1049
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,983
Understood

1050
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,519
All they are communicated

1051
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
It effectively unplaceable

1052
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
4chan

1053
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
And was able to exploit

1054
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
Me whoever

1055
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
These drops

1056
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,711
Really did

1057
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,807
Know what they were doing a really understood American Evangelical hucksters

1058
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
Exploited

1059
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:48,255
That's a really interesting perspective that I don't think I've heard a lot cuz I think a lot of people look at

1060
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,071
You know it's qanon and think I got this is all stupid

1061
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,399
And like you know hearing you say whoever did this

1062
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,447
Was like they knew what they were doing

1063
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,495
It is fascinating to me

1064
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
Yeah and

1065
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,591
The idea that they knew what they were doing doesn't that's

1066
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
Sincerely me that there was some

1067
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,663
Brad spiracy behind it that it

1068
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,199
Sounds like military Glade

1069
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,223
Grade cycling

1070
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
Warfare

1071
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,039
But you just have to know how

1072
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Hateful

1073
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,343
Conspiratorial people

1074
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,647
And if you spend enough

1075
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,439
Time in places like 4chan

1076
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
You can do that

1077
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
It's not that difficult

1078
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,839
Things on porch and things on Reddit

1079
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:29,727
Go mainstream viral we've seen it with rickrolling we see him as Slenderman I mean

1080
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
We know where the stuff

1081
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
Mystery

1082
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
People just

1083
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,383
Believe it because I want to

1084
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,967
Good story and validates things that they already believe

1085
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,551
It almost seems like something that somebody who had like a really good grasp of like

1086
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
Marketing

1087
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
Could have

1088
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
I could have swore

1089
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
Yeah

1090
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,927
You don't like wild to me

1091
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,487
Do you watch Ted lasso

1092
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,279
I don't I don't

1093
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,303
Don't worry about it

1094
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
It's a fight

1095
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,679
But there was one episode where they straight up Rick Rolled me

1096
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,007
And my partner had no idea what I was talking about

1097
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,823
And that was the first time in a long time I've really felt like

1098
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,639
I've been on the internet way too long this is not good

1099
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,783
That's great perspective like my my wife doesn't know anything about this stuff

1100
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
Stalin cheetahs

1101
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
Social media really at all like

1102
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,695
This is my world Alex albums like bring up some really common meme

1103
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
Everybody knows what that isn't she like

1104
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,535
What is that

1105
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
It's a reminder that

1106
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
That wall stings

1107
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,423
Online are really important

1108
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,471
Dismissed it stopped as like

1109
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
I just internet people

1110
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,847
Not everybody is as extremely online as

1111
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,127
People Like Us

1112
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
People who are

1113
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,919
Mainlining

1114
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,991
Infowars there is a there's a world

1115
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
Exist

1116
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
Not on

1117
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
Twitter

1118
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,087
Doesn't

1119
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,927
Stop nnsy wrote the book is a very simple guide to

1120
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:57,023
I didn't want to assume that anybody knew anything alive

1121
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,095
You all talk about you and I'm people ask me still in there

1122
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,935
What's an image

1123
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:04,959
WhatsApp

1124
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,519
And it said it's not

1125
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,055
It's like this is not their world

1126
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,127
Yeah so we have to do this very stupid

1127
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,175
You guys are great

1128
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,479
Breaking this stuff down

1129
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,247
Into

1130
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,783
Why does it matter

1131
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,319
What about it matters

1132
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
What can be discarded

1133
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
How does it a

1134
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
And that's

1135
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,951
Wheatley really important things

1136
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
As much as we really liked

1137
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,303
Get into the weeds in the details

1138
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
That's not where most

1139
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,119
People that most people live

1140
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,679
They don't have time for this they want to know the very basics

1141
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
Doesn't matter to them how does it

1142
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,495
Eliza

1143
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
You guys are great

1144
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,287
Well thank you

1145
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:44,127
Yeah the thing I definitely agree to I get a lot of criticism by thing

1146
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,687
That sometimes we're shows like well why are you

1147
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Take it like

1148
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
Speaking

1149
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,551
Like we don't know anything

1150
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,111
May not Sicily can entry-level

1151
00:47:54,367 --> 00:48:00,511
I mean what you what you just said right there you know a lot of these people aren't online this isn't a full thing and then as

1152
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,071
As you're going through the book you're reading like

1153
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,887
Oh okay so these are people who are in a

1154
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,703
Experience with the internet for finding this stuff

1155
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:13,055
Do they have no concept of what the online people have which is like

1156
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:17,919
F*** this noisy people are all out of their minds you know if you're online all the time you're

1157
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,223
Best friend you like speak people are out of their f****** mine

1158
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,783
That kind of feeling so if you don't have it

1159
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,343
Experience you'd also don't know how to discern like a wing

1160
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,743
Exactly how all these people were just dodo birds walking up to liars and just getting smashed on the head

1161
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,815
Add another overthrowing the country hits

1162
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,631
The degree to which

1163
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,423
Big stories were shared

1164
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,775
By the older Americans who got into qanon as enormous

1165
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,823
People passing around this stuff

1166
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
Because you just don't

1167
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,127
Have the discernment

1168
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,943
To tell real from fake and you think

1169
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
These people wouldn't lie to me

1170
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,527
They're they're my friends I've got to know them

1171
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,367
Stories and their struggles like

1172
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,647
It would never not

1173
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
Tell me the truth

1174
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,695
The basics that's

1175
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,487
The basis of our Affinity fraud

1176
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,023
Somebody

1177
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,047
Inter-Community

1178
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,631
A trusted member of a small insular group

1179
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,447
Ruthlessly exploited the rest of the people in that group

1180
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,775
Yeah yeah the Affinity itself is necessary to be

1181
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:23,455
Went to a funeral my grandma's funeral was held at a megachurch and I

1182
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,807
I like walked in there and I was ready to start fires like I just couldn't handle it

1183
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,343
Yeah I'm out is brutal

1184
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,207
One thing I definitely wanted to ask about is

1185
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:38,303
The biggest intersection I think between Alex Jones

1186
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,327
McEwen on directly

1187
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,399
Is the affair of Jerome corsi

1188
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
Yes and

1189
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,959
IWatch

1190
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:48,287
That happened but I don't think that we did a good job of covering that

1191
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,103
Was that an Oscar Wilde book The Affair of 04

1192
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
Lyrics

1193
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,991
What I understand

1194
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,039
He tried to get involved

1195
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,063
Basically

1196
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,367
Like he tried to become a q person

1197
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,159
Yeah

1198
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,231
For awhile I keep.

1199
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
Really

1200
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,303
Enjoy the night and the timing with this stuff

1201
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,327
Is always really

1202
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,167
Really into it like he was tweeting

1203
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,191
Relentlessly

1204
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
About

1205
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
About you

1206
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,007
Decoding the drops

1207
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,359
You're trying to figure out what was going on tying it into his own personal stuff

1208
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
I believe you are even writing a book

1209
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:29,247
Yeah yeah he had them on all the time

1210
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,783
Alex Wassabi about a holiday

1211
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
White House

1212
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,623
Swatted corsi covering 8chan I mean

1213
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,159
Just bizarre.

1214
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,207
And then of course like so much

1215
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,999
Of the Alex Jones world

1216
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Johnson

1217
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,095
And that it was disinfo and

1218
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,375
She talked about

1219
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,679
Talk to somebody

1220
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
Who played golf

1221
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,079
5 people who were running

1222
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,359
She would all that was for

1223
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,663
Taking over by Masada mean

1224
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
But you know how

1225
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,503
Is it like this is the most important thing in the world

1226
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,807
And now suddenly we have to destroy

1227
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,391
Yeah if I can't take it over then it must be defeated

1228
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:11,487
He has talked about how he tried to

1229
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,767
The Coop that

1230
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,095
When it was sort of growing and it was even unable to

1231
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,143
I I smile

1232
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,703
Personal opinion I don't really have anything to back

1233
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
Knowing the people

1234
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
Ball

1235
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,031
Is that

1236
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,335
She was trying to co-opt it and it was getting

1237
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,103
Bigger

1238
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,383
That was a threat

1239
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,479
Sanctity of the Infowars

1240
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
Empire

1241
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
Because it was

1242
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
It was a little bit more

1243
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,087
Participatory

1244
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,927
It was a puzzle

1245
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,975
That I mean nevermind there was a solution to the

1246
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,071
But I think she started to see it as a

1247
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:47,839
As more of a

1248
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,887
Brett and Leslie something

1249
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,959
Integrate into his own mythology and I think that's why

1250
00:51:53,983 --> 00:52:00,127
Yeah I would definitely read them I don't know if I have anything solid to back that up that's my sense too late

1251
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,455
Do you have these this period of decades wear

1252
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:07,039
Gary's essentially been the authority on a lot of this

1253
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:12,927
I kind of conspiracy both yet you have something like you it threatens that Authority cuz there's

1254
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:16,767
The decentralized ya Levi's you put a gurus

1255
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,791
Batman stuff

1256
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,863
He's no longer necessary as a gatekeeper

1257
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,935
I work for this stuff and that vibe that I got four

1258
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:30,335
Chew is really is really good at allowing people to rise up and create their own version of this

1259
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,639
You have these

1260
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
Promoters

1261
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,687
These people talk about in the book

1262
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,223
People like in The Matrix

1263
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,247
Joab

1264
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527
Jordan sather

1265
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,575
On and on and on East River Regional

1266
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,367
Qanon promoters you're making

1267
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
The videos in

1268
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,159
Podcast

1269
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,951
The lifestreams in the merchandise

1270
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,023
And that if they do need our

1271
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,327
It's just a thought Alex Jones was a sell-out

1272
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
The Patriot

1273
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,375
Was control.

1274
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:57,727
Yeah they're they're doing this without any training there's building this from the ground up

1275
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,751
And I can see it

1276
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
These people are threatened

1277
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,591
They could

1278
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,639
They could take over my audience

1279
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,711
Yeah I need to own this or I need to be against

1280
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
Yeah

1281
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,135
So some of those early guys

1282
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,999
I'm falling off right I mean like a lot of them aren't really

1283
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,791
Q folk anymore they likes

1284
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
Shifted their grip

1285
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,631
It's a little really divorce

1286
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:29,471
The big promoters all kind of have their own niche

1287
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
Flights

1288
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,799
Jordan sather is really into like

1289
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,615
The wellness stop in the secret space program

1290
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,151
Drinking bleach

1291
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,687
If I recall

1292
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:41,503
Bmms the Miracle Medical

1293
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,319
Do not ever

1294
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:49,439
Some of them it really disappear Joanne was one of the really big

1295
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,999
In the book who

1296
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,047
Dot-dot-dot Charter School

1297
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
Fundraiser

1298
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,583
They're canceled

1299
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,655
AR sharing this interpretation of a

1300
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,935
James Comey Twitter

1301
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,983
False flag attack

1302
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:08,639
Because I was hearing some of the other

1303
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,407
People just going

1304
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,223
What why did they what what what has happened

1305
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,295
That what why do we do this and let you know I covered that way

1306
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,391
People who are organizing and then of course they had to

1307
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,671
Cancel it the next year

1308
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,743
And I think they canceled again and I don't

1309
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
We're going to have another one

1310
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,071
And it's just it's enraging

1311
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:27,839
Think about

1312
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,655
These Anonymous gurus

1313
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,703

1318
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,711

1319
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,503

Lucrative personent

1359
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:11,007
Do you think that they're more fractured now and then I would I would assume

1360
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,335
That would mean more likely to compete with each other as they kind of

1361
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,359
But

00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,151

What kind of my my

1386
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:06,047
View on this is this is the type of movement that is inevitably going to destroy itself

1387
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,887
The question is just are they how quickly can they take us with

1388
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:16,543
That's it like it's just going to they're going to eat each other alive they're going to cannibalize each other

1407
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,319
In front of the Patriots Street Fighter

1408
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,879
Because I went and looked at his tour dates

It still was like that's a lot more people than I would have

1421
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,087

00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,471
From each other

1431
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,007
Mike Flynn was supposed to

1432
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,543
Speak at the Patriot Double Down

1433
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,335

Second Amendment

1450
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
The Border

1451
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,567
Media censorship

1452
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,591
The Deep state

1453
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:32,223
Biden is a fake president on a set in Tyler Perry's house

1454
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,503
Ivermectin

1455
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,527

Because you made that show The Oval right

1458
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:44,511
God knows where this stuff comes from

1459
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
It is

1460
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,095
It just emerges out of the ground like worms after the

1461
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:51,423
Yeah what you're describing it it almost

1462
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:54,751
Like I have a real-life sort of ominous feeling of their almost

1463
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,031
It almost feels like

1464
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,335
Ten in Serbian

1465
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,615

Is like a belief system

1468
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,759
He's like in progress and we're sort of seeing it happen

1469
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,807
Through these

1470
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,855
Conferences in these online fight

1471
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,623

1472
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:17,279
The Bill of Rights Theses nailed to the wall of the Capitol building the next time they throw it up

1473
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,327
We're really starting to get into that like

1474
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,143
People's front of Judea vs. Judean People's from

1475
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
Aspect

1476
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:28,543
They're just fighting over who has the biggest audience in who has the most money

1477
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,591
And I think that's where

1478
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,871
Begin

1479
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,895
Amman

1481
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:35,967
And

1482
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,271
I don't think there will be because they're not

1483
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,807

1488
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:48,767
New books of the Bible

1489
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,815
Got the Bible

1490
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,095
They don't need anything else

1491
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,375
The god that you drop

1492
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,911
Dick that uses a q

1493
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,983
You you have more than you know

1494
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,007
What they have

1495
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,615
The drops are there they're taking them off into a million different Direct

1496
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
Yeah

1497
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:13,087
Is very it is on the very informative but very depressing

1498
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:19,487
Yeah I mean it who says who says that it's done you know we we had the Bible then we got the Book of Mormon I'm sure they

1499
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:24,095
There's an enterprising liar out there is going to run out again

1500
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,631
That's fine

1501
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,703
That you never know Jay nobody in

1502
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:32,031
Yeah that around the crucifixion could have anticipated

1503
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,567
Joseph Smith

1504
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,919
You are way wrong sir

1505
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,455
Several thousand years ago

1506
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,015
Yeah it's

1507
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:47,391
It's so weird because I have a lot of similar feelings about like a lot of the Alex stuff

1508
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
It's it never feels

1509
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,231
Quite like

1510
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,535
Like it has the

1511
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,303
Ability to

1512
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,583
To formalize

1513
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,655
It's like out on does or like to have to turn into something else

1514
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,471
I think both of them are primarily

1515
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,031
Scam oriented Uno like Alex is

1516
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,823
Pill scam

1517
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,639
You know qanon the various promoters are

1518
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,663
You know basically

1519
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,967
Attention economy scamming and

1520
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
What have you put

1521
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,039
The danger of

1522
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,599
Of Cuban on turning into something different

1523
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,135
It is it's so

1524
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,951
Another thing then then

1525
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,999
Texas purerite winking

1526
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:24,767
Conspiracy stuff

1527
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,303
I have a quick question

1528
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,863
For you I'm working on a theory

1529
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,399
About

1530
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,007
Alex actually providing a weird sort of bulwark

1531
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,287
Against

1532
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,311
Something along the lines of

1533
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
Qanon

1534
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:41,663
By having a more control over that

1535
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,431
Space

1536
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,991
You know he creates almost a bottleneck there

1537
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:48,831
And I think what we're seeing is that what happens when you

1538
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,879
Let all the steam out is

1539
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,671
A massive diffuse

1540
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,975
Organization that

1541
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,767
Nobody can have any control.

1542
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:03,167
You know she can funnel all of it to his pill business and they're not overthrow

1543
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,191
Capital

1544
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,983
What is that

1545
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:06,751
Aspect

1546
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,775
Shoe that is not

1547
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,543
Quite

1548
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,823
Like a traditional called

1549
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,895
There's no charismatic leader there's no

1550
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,431
Figurehead at the very top with

1551
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,711
Word is bond

1552
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,991
With q

1553
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,295
Thank you do your own research

1554
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,575
You are your own leader

1555
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:24,671
And that allows these promoters to step in and take

1556
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,439
Control

1557
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,207
And take

1558
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,743
Their version of the movements

1559
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,791
Spinning off in any number of direct

1560
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:30,815
That's why

1561
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,399
Becoming much more mainstream

1562
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,423
While the actual life

1563
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,959
Iconography

1564
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
Physics you swag

1565
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,079
Quite as much

1566
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,151
The charm she went on they now think that that's

1567
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,711
Something to be mainstream Media made up

1568
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,735
To make them look crazy

1569
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,015
Makes sense

1570
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,063
There's no escape from these people

1571
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,879
It never mind if they were using that term

1572
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,183
That the most

1573
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,207
Popular bro

1574
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,743
Chewbacchus literally called

1575
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
You want

1576
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,303
An invitation to the Great Awakening

1577
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,327
Right

1578
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,911
But then they then they decided that

1579
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,239
They're also trying to not

1580
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,263
Love those big

1581
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,567
Maps anymore would like to eat

1582
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,383
1000 things on it that are all connected

1583
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,943
The Deep State mapping project and all that stuff

1584
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,735
Because it makes you look insane

1585
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,783
It makes you look like

1586
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,087
The red strings in the corkboard and

1587
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,111
You know

1588
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,671
Whereas

1589
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,743
Somehow insinuating Donald Trump is

1590
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,279
Still the president

1591
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,095
Because you sign something executive order

1592
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:40,447
12 years ago and his time-traveling uncle used Tesla

1593
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:42,239
Technology

1594
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,799
That doesn't make sense

1595
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,871
I think one of the weirdest

1596
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,175
Things that qanon has actually revealed

1597
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:50,943
Is that

1598
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,503
These people don't know how anything works

1599
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,343
They don't know how Civics Works they don't know how I can omits works

1600
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,391
So you can kind of just tell them like

1601
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:02,463
So if you sign an executive the president signs

1602
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,511
Executive order well then it must be

1603
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:10,911
Law forever right right right by tomorrow could sign an executive order that we are now all part of Panama

1604
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,471
Then we would be part of

1605
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,567
Brighton it's it's

1606
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,335
You know they don't know how

1607
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,663
Banking works I don't have money Works they don't know how the media work

1608
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,271
It's a misunderstanding of the basics

1609
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
The world

1610
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,831
Golden see the way that they want

1611
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,879
Things to be the way that they

1612
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,927
And are not

1613
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,463
And they they

1614
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,535
Cling to that and they cling to the reality that they have

1615
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,815
Created for themselves

1616
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:44,703
And that reality is a lot more entertaining and has done a lot more successful

1617
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,239
Add has the bad people

1618
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,775
Eventually being punished

1619
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,311
And has somebody in control

1620
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,103
And that's

1621
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,383
Really what we all want

1622
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,687
Is somebody in control

1623
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,711
Yeah right

1624
01:05:55,967 --> 01:06:00,575
Not be an endless series of random events that we really don't have any

1625
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:04,671
Stay over

1626
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,999
I think to like you're just a minute

1627
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
Essentially what

1628
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,559
So much as I can

1629
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,607
Conspiratorial thinking boils down to say

1630
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,143
A little bit of magic

1631
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,959
Am I like an easy solution

1632
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:18,495
Someone in charge

1633
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
It's

1634
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,335
It-it's

1635
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,383
It's remarkable how Outlet

1636
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,407
It really is

1637
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,967
Is helado in a lot of ways a lot of it is very simple

1638
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,991
And a lot of it

1639
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,831
Impossible to deal with complex

1640
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:33,855
Incredibly

1641
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:37,439
Basic psychology and the most incomprehensible

1642
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,207
Garbage

1643
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,743
But you will ever stumble upon

1644
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:42,047
And somehow these people are able to kind of

1645
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,095
One foot in each

1646
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,375
Adam B

1647
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:48,447
Make it work for themselves then rationalize away

1648
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,495
The failures of the cognitive dissonance

1649
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,775
Obvious fraud

1650
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,103
Just this is the world I want to live in and

1651
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,383
Nobody's getting them out of

1652
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,711
I was thinking of

1653
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,015
I remember this cult

1654
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,575
I can't remember the name but it was in the late

1655
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,343
1800

1656
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:10,975
And this woman had predicted the end of the world was going to happen at the stroke of midnight

1657
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,767
On badabababa

1658
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
Right

1659
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,559
And

1660
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,351
If the stroke of midnight happened

1661
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,655
Not the end of the world didn't happen

1662
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,447
They talked about it the next day

1663
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,727
It was supposed to be next

1664
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,287
Something along those lines you know who's that kind of thing

1665
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,199
Who

1666
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,735
Whenever he he believes

1667
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,783
But the world is going to end so he went

1668
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,063
To his own house

1669
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,111
Stood up on top of his roof

1670
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,391
And at the stroke of midnight

1671
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,415
Just fell off

1672
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:46,815
The more I thought about that the more I was like I'll man that guy is so stupid you could have

1673
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:50,143
Survive and then now looking at all these qanon people

1674
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,727
That guy is easily the happiest person ever to live in that cult

1675
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:58,847
Right like that was the perfect time to die when everything you believed was true

1676
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:05,247
You can't have to live through the deflation and the rationalization

1677
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:10,111
The cult leader being messed up and you like you were supposed to know everything

1678
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,671
Yeah and it's and it be

1679
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,207
Call Memes

1680
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,743
Impossible to go back

1681
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,815
You have that is used the example

1682
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,095
Cortez in the New World

1683
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:20,863
You burned yourself

1684
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,911
New York

1685
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,703
Family doesn't want anything to do with you

1686
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,751
Your friends don't want to hear you with you

1687
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,519
You have

1688
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,359
The money your your emotional well

1689
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,639
Being into this

1690
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,687
Conspiracy theory being true into this

1691
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,455
Great event

1692
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
Happening

1693
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,783
The event doesn't happen and you have the option

1694
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,575
I was wrong I got

1695
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,343
Schooled

1696
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,623
I'm sorry

1697
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,903
Orson Welles

1698
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
Ikea

1699
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,463
I can't go back I have to just

1700
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,487
Forwarded

1701
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,023
Happen eventually

1702
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,303
And then I'm going to be right

1703
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,583
And then everybody's going to be sorry

1704
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,143
I'll go deeper and then eventually I'll be right

1705
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,215
Well I hate to keep saying this

1706
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,007
But that sucks

1707
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,311
That is the dynamic that I think a lot of people find

1708
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,079
Themselves in

1709
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,127
And that's why I think it's really important

1710
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:07,455
To try and retain some empathy for people who are

1711
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,247
You know caught in these

1712
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:13,855
I believe traps or scams are going to its

1713
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,415
It can be hard because a lot of the beliefs

1714
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,183
Themselves

1715
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,207
Destructive and there

1716
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,231
Causing damage

1717
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:19,999
H2

1718
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,047
Polite Society right

1719
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,327
A lot of people are victim

1720
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,447
And what are the things that I I see so often about

1721
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:33,567
All the narratives around qanon is look at how bad these people on 8th

1722
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,591
I'll look it up

1723
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,383
Bad all of these people are

1724
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:41,247
But no one is at all dealing with the fact that the reason it is easy to believe in qanon

1725
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,551
Is because all of the systems have failed these

1726
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:44,831
Like AIDS

1727
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,391
It's not like they were doing great

1728
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:52,511
You you go into these hoping that Hillary Clinton is murdered by the government

1729
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,303
Because the 90s weren't great

1730
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,839
You know like that

1731
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:02,239
Dramatic

1732
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:08,895
What are the big things that I wish the systems would look at qanon and think is

1733
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,687
Who maybe we f***** up

1734
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:16,063
You know I get asked a lot about the the demography

1735
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,367
Yes primarily White

1736
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,647
It's snow

1737
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,927
Split down the middle Madden

1738
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,975
Upper-middle-class

1739
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,535
But the biggest

1740
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
The demographic

1741
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,863
For believing you and I was already being if you

1742
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,167
Is there a

1743
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,191
You people I mean

1744
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,751
I've been just like

1745
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:39,103
MSNBC watching New York Times reading Ido Centrist

1746
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,127
Democrats

1747
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
One day

1748
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,455
Just happened to go to

1749
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:45,503
X22report Owasso

1750
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,271
You know

1751
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:50,623
Fall of the cabal and then suddenly got radicalized into thinking that there's a pedophile

1752
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,415
That's not how

1753
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:57,791
I would going to vote for medicare-for-all but I think I want Hillary Clinton to die in

1754
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,119
You you were already on 911

1755
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,167
You are already a

1756
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,447
Barack Obama birthday

1757
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,495
You already somebody who

1758
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,519
Are there

1759
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,287
Start of knowledge

1760
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,335
Base rewire by Trump win

1761
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,895
And exposing all of the corruption

1762
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
Thought

1763
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,199
You thought about but you never

1764
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,479
Could put into words

1765
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:21,343
That was that was already your world you're already listening to Infowars you're already

1766
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,111
Reading

1767
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,135
Gateway pundit

1768
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,415
Or whatever

1769
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,439
She was just the neck

1770
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,975
Wrong on the ladder

1771
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
Things

1772
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,583
But it's

1773
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
Anti-vax

1774
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,375
Big Pharma

1775
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,143
Conspiracy theory

1776
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,263
G.i. Bill Gates anti globalism

1777
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:45,663
Super super hardcore Bernie Sanders Hillary screwed him out of the nominations

1778
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,943
Whatever it is

1779
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,759
There is a conspiracy theory for you

1780
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,295
Paraplegic

1781
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,879
Yeah like if you're eight steps

1782
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,903
Down the road

1783
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,719
No matter what road it is it's easy to take those two steps

1784
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
To get to the

1785
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,047
The final point

1786
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:02,815
Like

1787
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,631
Step one or you're not even down that road

1788
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,911
You're not going to

1789
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,215
It's not attractive enough of a

1790
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:12,287
Conspiracy to get you to be like 50 to 60

1791
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:15,615
All roads lead to Rome unless you live in South America

1792
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,431
Unless you just don't also get on the road

1793
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,271
Eschew roads

1794
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,855
A person who understands how things work

1795
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:26,879
Denby

1796
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,415
Conspiracy theories don't have a lot of

1797
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,463
Like the stolen election idea

1798
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,767
Doesn't really appeal to you because you know that that

1799
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,047
. how about you

1800
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,143
But you can't like there isn't one guy in a

1801
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:38,911
In an office

1802
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:39,679
Dominion voting

1803
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
Systems

1804
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:44,287
Abiding Wendy Lashley you know that that's not true

1805
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,055
Counterpoint

1806
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:49,407
There is a guy at the minion to just message

1807
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:54,527
Yeah yeah I think I think they're one of the things that we always talked about 9

1808
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,295
This is like when

1809
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,831
What if yours if you

1810
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,879
Deal with the complexity of

1811
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,159
A lot of issues an event

1812
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,439
That's that happened in the world

1813
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,207
I love you

1814
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,743
Conspiracies don't really make

1815
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,511
Make sense

1816
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:07,327
But if you don't want to deal with that and you want to look at

1817
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,351
Things kind of in a

1818
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,911
Sort of overly simplistic black-and-white way

1819
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
Parowan

1820
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,519
I don't mean you ready

1821
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:20,639
You look at this s*** right now and you see mansion and Cinema are like

1822
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:25,503
Well you know everybody wants this stuff but I guess we're paid enough to say f*** off

1823
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:29,343
It does make sense for you to think f*** it I want Trump

1824
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,391
To just stroke a pin and do this

1825
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
Because these people are f******

1826
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:35,487
Incorrupt you know it's like that's what it is

1827
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,583
It's the unfortunate reality that there is a basis for the

1828
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:44,703
The feelings that underpin a lot of conspiracy

1829
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,471
Believer

1830
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,751
Suffer reason like

1831
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,543
Big business is not your friend

1832
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,567
The government

1833
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,335
Is Kuru

1834
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,615
You know

1835
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,151
Jeffrey Epstein

1836
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,175
Did horrible things

1837
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,247
This is all true

1838
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:03,903
This is a time I was just thinking like a radio interview is like what do we do next

1839
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,183
Execute not in my first class

1840
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,719
Texting dead or alive

1841
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,863
Who's not

1842
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,423
Run down the list

1843
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:20,031
I had I had one question that I definitely wanted to get to you so I'm going to slip it in here

1844
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,079
And that is what what

1845
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,895
I hate if it's putting me on the spot at all but

1846
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,967
You're somebody who focuses on with this stuff a lot

1847
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,527
I imagine that you see coverage

1848
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,807
Of qanon

1849
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:32,831
That kind of

1850
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,367
It may be frustrating

1851
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:39,743
I was wondering if there's one thing that you think is important that people know about it that

1852
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:40,767
Datejust

1853
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:41,791
Gets messed

1854
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
Krakow lot of

1855
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,583
The time

1856
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,863
Wow that's a great question

1857
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,631
Ice ice

1858
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,191
The thing that gets missed a lot

1859
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
Is that

1860
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,519
You can believe in something like

1861
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,847
He went on and not be crazy not be violent

1862
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,127
Not be stupid

1863
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,407
You are just

1864
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,943
Looking for something

1865
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
In the wrong

1866
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,759
Think what

1867
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,039
Missed a lot is dead

1868
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,831
These theories are

1869
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,159
Grab people for a reason they always

1870
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,231
No people look at something like you would on his like

1871
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,023
We've never dealt with anything like this

1872
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:13,791
This before like

1873
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,071
There's never been a

1874
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,607
Brainwashing like

1875
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:23,775
Turn and look to your left and I'll Mormons are wearing the same underwear

1876
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:29,919
The number of people who think that there is a conspiracy to

1877
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,455
Kill JFK

1878
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,503
Basically the same now

1879
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,783
As it was

1880
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,575
Weeks after the attack

1881
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,135
People believe this stuff

1882
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:42,975
This is Meaningful and compelling and explanatory

1883
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,767
People I think

1884
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:48,351
Just writing these people off as either idiot

1885
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,399
Or on the flip side is like

1886
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,959
Mind control zombies with no agency

1887
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,007
I think you're missing

1888
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,031
The realtor

1889
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,127
Explain

1890
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,919
So many things to be

1891
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:06,527
Yeah they drift feels the needs that maybe people

1892
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:09,087
I don't want to recognize are there

1893
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:12,415
One of the things that I think is is really

1894
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,231
I think it's close to what you're getting at is that like

1895
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,023
I think that is so

1896
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,047
Relevant

1897
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,607
To make fun of the thing but not the people

1898
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:24,447
I think people kind of are they make the mistake of

1899
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,471
Making fun of

1900
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,775
The people who believe this stuff as opposed to

1901
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,567
Mocking the idea

1902
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,871
Candy idea

1903
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,407
Undead mocking the promoter

1904
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,687
Like I will

1905
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:37,759
I will unsparingly Savage

1906
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,783
People like Ron White

1907
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,623
Ghost Ezra people like in the maitre

1908
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,927
I will knock those people up and down left

1909
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,951
I have

1910
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,815
I bet you're still going to vote for Ron but

1911
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:53,887
Ivy league Arizona

1912
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,823
Lcer

1913
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,359
Beamed

1914
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,639
We did his way

1915
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:09,247
To being an expert on Election fraud and getting retweeted by the President's Day

1916
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,063
Impressive

1917
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,087
Completely stupid

1918
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:13,855
And do that

1919
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,671
Yeah

1920
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,439
People

1921
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,463
We do all the

1922
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:21,023
But the actual like rank-and-file believe

1923
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,071
People are really stuck in this

1924
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,095
I do have it

1925
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:26,911
I think

1926
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,983
They're caught up in something that is way worse than

1927
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,007
It is

1928
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:34,079
And at some point the rock is going to get pulled out from under them

1929
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,103
And then

1930
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,127
What do you have left

1931
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,407
Who is left in your wife

1932
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,687
That wants

1933
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,479
Display wants to help you

1934
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,783
After you said and done

1935
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,599
Possibly reprehensible or illegal thing

1936
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,367
Tonight

1937
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,391
I have a lot of

1938
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,671
For the people

1939
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,487
I am taking over this day baby class

1940
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Sick thing of life

1941
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,047
You know when you when you

1942
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,327
Go down the road

1943
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,095
Towards this

1944
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:59,935
You don't take the first step knowing that it's going to lead to something represent

1945
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,519
You know it's there's there's a rational

1946
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:07,359
Maybe pseudo rational reason why you know you

1947
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:10,431
You go down the road and then before you know it you're far down

1948
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,967
Into

1949
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:12,735
Muck

1950
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,271
Territory gross

1951
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:16,575
Nobody nobody clicked on a link on Facebook

1952
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,343
Going like

1953
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:19,647
What time to get rid of my family click

1954
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,439
Nobody joins a cult

1955
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:24,767
You join a group of people who believe the same thing

1956
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,071
You do the same thing you do or whatever but

1957
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,631
You have any idea about that

1958
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,447
You didn't choose to be born

1959
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,495
But

1960
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,031
Something is addition

1961
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:39,615
For a lot of people

1962
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,383
I mean that

1963
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,943
That's the thing you go back to with us

1964
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,479
They told a story

1965
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:49,343
The people wanted to be sure it wasn't one of these like FBI and honor

1966
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,367
Inside

1967
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:53,695
Early like I have all the sea

1968
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,487
Secrets I'm going to reveal everything

1969
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,511
That's that

1970
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,791
Interesting

1971
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351
Speaking that you have

1972
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,703
Inside knowledge is Hillary Clinton is on the run is going to be arrested on November 3rd

1973
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,263
Wo I want that to happen

1974
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,567
Yeah

1975
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,895
And I mean it is compelling I think that you and I are both

1976
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,967
Clear examples that it's compelling even if you don't believe

1977
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,015
These things are

1978
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:22,111
Intellectually and sort of academically interesting and compelling

1979
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,903
Yep

1980
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,183
Jim

1981
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,255
How

1982
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:37,215
Deflated interviews under our belt we've got one that was happy

1983
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:41,567
Alex is going to get his comeuppance the most unimaginably Bleak thing

1984
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:47,455
I still think there's a little bit of Hope in there

1985
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,759
And if if there was no hope I wouldn't do

1986
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,295
Because it would

1987
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,063
Would be

1988
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:56,415
If you're just telling people that everything is awful all the time

1989
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:58,207
Eventually people

1990
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:58,975
Some people

1991
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,743
Like that but

1992
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,023
I think most people will

1993
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,327
I think the thing that

1994
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,607
Keeps me going is

1995
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,143
People do get out of

1996
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,679
People do

1997
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
Find

1998
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:12,287
The weakness of the dangling threads

1999
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,567
Interpol

2000
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,336
Thing falls apart

2001
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,872
People are

2002
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,664
Capable of walking away from this

2003
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,968
And people are capable of understanding

2004
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,760
And I'll be working out for

2005
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,832
Are the signs that somebody they care about is getting radicalized

2006
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,368
Insecure

2007
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,160
You were Jason conspiracy theory

2008
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,952
And then they they maybe have

2009
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,536
And they kind of know what the

2010
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,608
And then they could maybe stop it

2011
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,656
Before it goes a little bit

2012
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,960
Yeah make it they can approach it with

2013
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:42,752
Like a like a little bit of

2014
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,544
Care instead of judgmental

2015
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,592
As more people can

2016
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,896
Take that perspective maybe it'll

2017
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,688
Lead to more people leaving

2018
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,480
Then more of those stories will

2019
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,760
Will become Amplified in

2020
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,040
You're the conversation

2021
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,064
Can completely change

2022
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:56,832
Little bit

2023
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,184
Stop that's my hope is that as we go

2024
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,976
Forward into this more

2025
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,536
You people will will come out

2026
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
Answer

2027
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:09,888
Talk openly and on-the-record about their experience

2028
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:13,216
Something like Scientology where there is a a very large

2029
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:13,984
Rhubarb

2030
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
Apostate

2031
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:17,056
Who are fearlessly speaking out about

2032
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:17,824
That's without

2033
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,360
Fear of the repercussions

2034
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,664
He was just too new to have that

2035
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,432
You just

2036
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,712
Did the people

2037
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,736
Have left it

2038
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,296
Date the reintegrating into the world they've been

2039
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,392
Right there still

2040
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,160

2052
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,744
It I can imagine it becomes

2053
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,024
Attempting to cash it

2054
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:09,792

2061
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,384
And then of course you start to believe it

2062
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,200
Right because you can't just say this.

2063
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,736
And have it be

2064
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:29,760

Maybe not all of it

2070
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:41,024
And they know how to monetize it but

2071
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:43,328
This is their world they believe this.

2072
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,632
You have to convince yourself

01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,728
