1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
A little bit about Alex

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Do

7
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,144
Jordan

8
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704
I don't know how to put it other than

9
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,264
Dreamy creamy

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,104
The dreamy creamy era has begun

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,920
You shouldn't have shown me your weakness

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
You showed weed here's the problem I saw you grab that file directly and put it

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,672
Back in and I was like I know what that is I know what that is

14
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,792
And then immediately when I saw that I knew what your Brightside was going to be and I'm furious with myself

15
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:43,168
Because this is going to happen forever now in some way or another it probably is

16
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,472
It's always going to be a bright spot but you you

17
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,824
Don't reveal I know ends of soft spots

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,896
Especially not whatever they can be applied to a year of something

19
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
Food items apparently

20
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,552
What is an era

21
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,880
Zaramay just Westies to episodes

22
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
Could be forever

23
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:12,096
Well I mean I have a hard time thinking that you can't find a way to use dreepy creepy right before your mustard

24
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,472
Not almost her decree me my friend. That's why it's not an all-the-time thing

25
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,312
Maybe somebody's

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,128
Arrowhead like a creamy mustard that much

27
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
About it I don't most mustard

28
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
Thing

29
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
Why is Amanda screaming XO

30
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
Trump mayonnaise

31
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,656
Okay I got a reverse around it's not you

32
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
So scary

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,264
Have to start with basic start over

34
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
So creepy extreme

35
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
What's the right spot

36
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,456
Vibrate spot dad is

37
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
By my partner's mom

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Her birthday

39
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,368
Was yesterday so

40
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Okay

41
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
Spy we celebrate

42
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:22,752
Continue do that later Scottish accent

43
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
Scottish people got in an accident

44
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
They Scott

45
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
Indian accent ok

46
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:33,504
We had a lovely dinner it was like a

47
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
Wine and food pairing thing

48
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
And it was it was fantastic

49
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
The food is very good

50
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
The wind was in

51
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Incredibly

52
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,000
Incredibly strong

53
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:49,120
I mean, yay

54
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
Which

55
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Guess it's a job

56
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
And he was like this

57
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
This

58
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
Photo

59
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,312
How much is like 18 to 20% okay

60
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:02,432
Yeah that's what is worrying like

61
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,528
What you mean like the last one was like a port

62
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
Is that the skipper wine

63
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,232
I'm revealing myself not to be a smelly ass

64
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
They're all just

65
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:27,007
There's Apple wines that like Boone's Farm

66
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,079
A good man I wanted 18% Boone's Farm

67
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:34,687
It was difficult not to be for adult people walking out of there that place drunk

68
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,271
Purely unintentional

69
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
I went in there

70
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
Have a good time and they're like this

71
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
When is going to f*** you up

72
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
I went to a wine tasting in like Sonoma Valley with my parents one time when we were on vacation

73
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
California

74
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
And yeah I

75
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,167
I didn't get the memo that you're not supposed to drink

76
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Alwine wish around

77
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,919
Mistakes I'm pretty drunk

78
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,015
I'm sure you did too absolutely

79
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:16,415
Today we have an episode to go over we were guarding this Advanced as you are on your honeymoon and gave him

80
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Right now

81
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,767
Cross the border oh my God

82
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:25,375
Dude I think that Canada is going to come up on this episode

83
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
I'm a witch

84
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
What about July 28th

85
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,263
2003

86
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,591
It was Monday episode in 2003

87
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
There's some stupidity there's some

88
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
Really really really funny

89
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,503
Stuff though I believe that one of Alex's most

90
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
Misfired interviews

91
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,951
I think I've ever heard okay so awesome let's hear it I'm excited to play it for you

92
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,767
We must say hello.

93
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,351
Firstmark

94
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,239
You can have a main character moment thank you so much and I'll probably walk

95
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,151
Twist your novelty walk

96
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:15,039
Monica from Australia thank you so much

97
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,999
Play the inflamed song episode 666 from their classic 1997

98
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
Oracle

99
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
Brother se600

100
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,191
66 episode and if you guys don't do what I swear I will donate to vulgarity for charity so Tom can make Jordan cry

101
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
Thank you so much you are not about to walk

102
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Thank you very much too

103
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
30% of that at least

104
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
Got this a little bit late

105
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
We are now a pastor 666 episode

106
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
What do you do to say hello and thank you to a technocrat

107
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
I have

108
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Risen above

109
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
Miami

110
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,775
A little breaking for me

111
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
And then we're going

112
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
To come back

113
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
And I mean

114
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
Start the show over

115
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
F*** you

116
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
I got plenty of words for you but

117
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
At the end of the day

118
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
F*** you and your new world order

119
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,487
She rode in on

120
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
And all your s***

121
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby

122
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
5 years

123
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

124
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
And you never see me again

125
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
Really what I want to do

126
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Back here again

127
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
Apologized

128
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,919
To the crew in the Lester's yesterday that I

129
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,991
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

130
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Better tomorrow

131
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,575
He's a little better in the past

132
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,647
More palatable kind of

133
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:02,047
Shocking to be preparing a past and present episode at the same time as I did with this nrr episode

134
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
Weather for Monday

135
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
Google leeringly different

136
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Mentality

137
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
I'm not sad

138
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
Them

139
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,847
Obviously the same person and obviously he sucks in his a bigger than past 2

140
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
View level to which he has

141
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,735
Falling apart is its

142
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,063
Yeah and I wouldn't laugh if he wasn't such a

143
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Complete dick

144
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
In July

145
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,231
Up 2003 there's something interesting that's going on in that is

146
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Public conversation

147
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
Starting to happen around the release

148
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
Of the 9/11

149
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Report

150
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
And

151
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
Alex has some thoughts about this

152
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
The fact

153
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,775
There are 28 Pages missing dolls at 28 Pages missing

154
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:49,663
The 28 redacted Pages all of those 28 pages that definitely didn't have anything to do with Saudi Arabia

155
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,759
Probably one of the most surprising perspectives on this I go to the match

156
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
Thorn

157
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,903
I'm going on all over the place

158
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,703
On the Sunday news shows yesterday

159
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,423
Pretty shocking position for Alex to have about this

160
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,823
Like at this point in July 2003 the report of the House and Senate joint inquiry into the events of 9/11 was being released

161
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,127
And a lot of people were a bit suspicious

162
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
She said there were 28 Pages completely redacted

163
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
Normally for a conspiracy theorist this thing

164
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,087
I like that something like this would be so exciting but weirdly

165
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,647
Alex seems to not be interested in the redacted pages

166
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,255
Things not to care what they might have in them or might reveal

167
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
Is Clement what should have happened

168
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,935
So what's in those rejected pages are does not going to help his story

169
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:21,823
It has to be presented as Ironclad and that's what's going on he's not curious or interested at all because

170
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
It's already sat

171
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
There can't be any room for doubt

172
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,223
Because his whole narrative is held together with chewing gum and

173
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Scotch tape

174
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
It's flimsy as hell

175
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:35,135
How much does so little evidence of anything that he has to insist that he actually has all the oven

176
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Seminole

177
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
28 secret pages

178
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,279
Lead to questions about how they stack up with his supposed

179
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,863
In that sense I was angle here is really smart

180
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,703
He can't be intrigued by the 28 Pages because he has to already know what's in

181
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,567
Whatever has been redacted has to conform to his existing narrative in the parts

182
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
Elaborate cover-up

183
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:01,759
Better being covered up within the already cover-up 911 before covered up this is

184
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,111
Admission of guilt is part of the cover-up

185
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,671
Covering up that you didn't admit guilt right

186
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
It was long believed that the 28 pages

187
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,583
Isabel details about possible Saudi Arabian involvement with the hijackers so

188
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,423
That was bringing that up isn't super surprising at all in this timeframe

189
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
And giving the actual documents wouldn't be

190
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
Declassified for like another

191
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
13 years

192
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,359
You got pretty safe ground to make up whatever he wants about this

193
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
Besuited purposes

194
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:35,295
That is great contents of those 28 pages but it doesn't really seem productive since Alex has no idea what's in them any

195
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
He thinks our cover-up anyway

196
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
It's kind of a daddy

197
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
Eventually Ron Paul starts

198
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
Make them a big deal like that

199
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,791
Declassify those pages so I would imagine that around that time I was just doing will change

200
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,863
But for now this is where we are he's just like I don't give a s***

201
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
Oh you're not going to explain to us what happened on 9/11

202
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,775
I'm able to explain some things what you want

203
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,503
These Pages were redacted is because Saudi Arabia made some

204
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
Threats

205
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
White-washed

206
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
We're going to list

207
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
U.s. Bank

208
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,263
Pretty hard to figure out what to

209
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
I think about this claim that Alex is making here

210
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,639
On the one hand I don't think he's basing this on anything real

211
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
14 News

212
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
But on the other hand

213
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:13,087
In 2016 Saudi Arabia did threaten to sell off approximately 750 billion dollars in Treasury

214
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,135
Securities and other Assets in the United States

215
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
This was in response to the discussion of a bill that the Senate would make the government of Saudi Arabia open

216
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
To being sued

217
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
For any possible involvement with 911

218
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
Basically 911 victims

219
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
Families could be able to

220
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
The suicide Arabia with the

221
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
Spell Passage

222
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,335
I don't believe that this necessarily

223
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,943
Completely copper bowl though because the reason that they threatened to sell these Assets in the United States

224
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,759
Was because if they were made vulnerable to lawsuits

225
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
Their Assets in the United States could be frozen

226
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
And one part just a decent play

227
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:54,303
Yeah I can't find evidence of this threat from Saudi Arabia regarding two pages redaction

228
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
And I do think that Alex is making

229
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,447
Stuff up but it's not the most outlandish thing that he could come up with to make up

230
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,847
One of the reasons I'm particularly wary of Alex's story is because the 28 pages that were redacted didn't have to do

231
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
Who is Saudi Banks

232
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:12,479
Tipped off to something like that if it wasn't in the report

233
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
Is a little bit off

234
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,831
Thematically it feels a little like

235
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,647
Detail that fits neatly into Alex's

236
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,999
2003 conception of the globalist is primarily being involved in the banks of the world

237
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,095
Supposed to be demons trying to drink children's blood to make it so Alex camping

238
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Explore space

239
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
Another reason I'm a bit I'm convinced

240
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,495
Is that in the redacted Pages there are indications

241
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
The connections between 9/11 hijackers and people connect

242
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
To the Saudi Arabian government

243
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
But definitive conclusions aren't

244
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
Made

245
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:45,503
The recommendation is for investigation saying that these connections

246
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Split quotes

247
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
On the other hand

248
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,391
It's also possible that further investigation of these allegations could reveal legitimate and

249
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Innocent explanations

250
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
For these associations

251
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
So I don't

252
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Really think

253
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,327
I don't know I don't like this story doesn't

254
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,631
Jibe

255
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Some kind of

256
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
Source I need

257
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
I don't

258
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
I think he's going to

259
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
Alright so

260
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
Alex has some news

261
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
Celebrity news

262
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
We got it

263
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
July 23rd

264
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,111
Well I know 28 I know it's not Betty White

265
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
True

266
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
I know it

267
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
It's not Dame Judi Dench

268
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
True

269
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
Beyond that anybody

270
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:34,655
Asparagus

271
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Biggest movie

272
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
No idea

273
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,639
But he's been in a lot of them

274
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
Probably

275
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
You know what I'm going to go with Sidney Poitier then

276
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,927
No I would definitely know I Look Who's Coming to Dinner

277
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,511
Okay fine okay

278
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,119
I know less about this person from Sidney Poitier apparently

279
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:24,831
Oh yeah

280
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,623
Okay yeah Ike's

281
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
I like Alex's eulogy

282
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,863
Be nice if this guy wasn't a murdering monster who should burn it out

283
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:43,263
Probably be in heaven but rest time if you hadn't had sex one time before

284
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,567
We got married but now you're in the hell is that

285
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
So

286
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Alex

287
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,175
Ends up dealing with this a bit

288
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
B b

289
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,527
The idea that all the news

290
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
Is like

291
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
Covering Bob Hope's death

292
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:01,183
They won't talk about him being a Satan worshiper is a problem for Alex

293
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Then you also in the

294
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
Announce his one of his gas

295
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
And if this is so awesome

296
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
Emergency

297
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
One of the quarantine Center

298
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,695
Bob Hope

299
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,023
100 years old

300
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
I know that my grandmother

301
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
A grandmother

302
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:04,671
I had been involved in some of the revelry there according to the

303
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Acquiring

304
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,447
But I wonder why

305
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,263
Today wall-to-wall all over the news

306
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
It isn't mister

307
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
The mister

308
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,735
Was that

309
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,783
Angela wasn't in the

310
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,183
The obituary because it's not true

311
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,743
Mangrove is probably

312
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,583
On the scale of things that are important about Bob Hope

313
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
Reloj cuello

314
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
Qalo

315
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,287
What was Bob Hope's biggest movie

316
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,127
Road trip

317
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:02,527
Not so funny that I couldn't anymore now that I know it's an Oscar

318
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:08,415
No I do not okay I don't think so I don't think Baba one of those maybe probably

319
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
I know he won the Grammy

320
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,839
So yeah Bob Hope

321
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
In his obituaries that he worshipped

322
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,703
Moloch big swing for an obituary

323
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,823
Throw that a man dominated American culture

324
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:32,223
50 years went on a billion Uso troops

325
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,391
But everybody know who's been like a sex slave

326
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
Yep

327
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
But yeah also

328
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
Bohemian Grove Alex has a guy who's involved with the relocation Center building

329
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
Coming on

330
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,799
This is one of my favorite interviews of all time

331
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:01,407
It's delicious person is the way he describes this person seems like

332
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,711
They are going to be a calm

333
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
Knowledgeable

334
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
I mean

335
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
I'm going to throw this out there

336
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Helpful person

337
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:14,975
Trying to help Alex understand what it is they're going to do I am going to give you

338
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,559
No

339
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
Okay

340
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
So Alex is little

341
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
Piece of trivia

342
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
The shock of shocks

343
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
Is not true

344
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,775
America

345
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Why

346
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,247
I can do whatever he wants

347
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
War

348
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
That's not true

349
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,191
So Alex is misunderstanding or misrepresenting the part of Article 2 Section 2 Clause one of the cots

350
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,983
Institution that has to do with this kind of stuff

351
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,847
The president shall be commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy of the United States

352
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,199
And of the militia of the several States when called into the actual service of the United

353
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:12,063
Be when called into the actual service part has to do with the militia only

354
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,111
But I was just pretending it applies to every

355
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,416
Again man we're really going to have to get into like

356
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
Scanning app

357
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:25,376
Try and say the word subjunctive Clause have a real struggle. Absolutely

358
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,192
So Alex gets to some predict

359
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,520
No I mean every time we listen to show he says he's right about

360
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,848
937

361
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,408
I also

362
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,928
How old

363
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:55,328
Media lights

364
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,608
Tell me that Putin

365
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:03,008
Is right and a good guy and always telling the truth it's fascinating cuz Alex is Right 97% of the time

366
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
He's wrong twice

367
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:10,688
Huron's that Saddam is in Belarus with his son's not there she's also wrong that you're going to find a dead body

368
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,016
You got

369
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,600
Found where you live you can go inside of a little hole Yeah

370
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
Location their one-year

371
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,952
I don't know if that's import Ace

372
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
Alec

373
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,584
Books has an interesting perspective on the story about Bush signing the flag

374
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
Yes you actually fine with it

375
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
Well I mean you would have

376
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
Because later on his his dude

377
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
So

378
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
But he doesn't know that in 2003

379
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:43,200
I do actually kind of want to tip my cap a little bit into the prospective

380
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,528
Getting mad about your signing with like I don't like it

381
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
But it's fine

382
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,392
The flag symbolizes the freedom to sign the flag

383
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,464
I appreciate that conception Leon Alex

384
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,512
Basic burn the flag is party

385
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,840
The flag kind of thought yeah yeah

386
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
Clip and surprisingly

387
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,960
I don't think Alex likes Matt drudge in 2003

388
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Photographer

389
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
The red herring

390
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,104
Blood and soil here

391
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,136
Patriotism

392
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,160
Blue blood

393
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,680
And everyone

394
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
New world

395
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
It's okay

396
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
That really surprised me

397
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,616
Drudge is a new world order priests back then

398
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
Yeah wow

399
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,808
I don't know exactly what I mean I guess probably was a little bit more mainstream conservative

400
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
And it was very jingoistic

401
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,904
Yeah

402
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,024
I mean I wasn't keeping track of the Drudge Report

403
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,144
17

404
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,704
Oh yeah I could say I could see it hasn't it been

405
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,776
Of supporting the war and such

406
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:48,128
Yeah but it is it is really into the garage become such an important

407
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,432
Piece of Alex's career to

408
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,760
A stretch that guy is a new world order

409
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:00,928
Is representative a conditional everything is a new world order

410
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,232
Eventually becomes the most important person

411
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:06,304
In all of conservative media because he's

412
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,352
I've been there and expose the Clinton

413
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
Windows

414
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,192
Before he became a new world order fries

415
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:18,080
A man eventually maybe he sold the Drudge Report to Global listsource

416
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,616
Then became a globalist

417
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:25,248
Is cool for a while again

418
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:31,648
It will rewrite your narrative tomorrow

419
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
Infowars

420
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
Because you know like

421
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,632
It is it's like a long-running show where former and it's like a long-running soap opera

422
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
Season 6 + 12

423
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,240
This guy was the biggest enemy number one try

424
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,336
It season 7 he turns out to be a good guy and then they work together within the season 11

425
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,664
Beat it turns dude B you know it's a difference between

426
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
There's a narrative

427
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Arc with

428
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,248
Shows

429
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Explanation

430
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,232
For what made Matt drudge go from

431
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:11,840
Hero of the Patriot movement

432
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:16,448
Yeah it's just arbitrary it's like if you're watching a show that is long run

433
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
But also like

434
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:22,080
Haphazardly just changes people's alignment

435
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,360
It's over and over again

436
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
That's the problem

437
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,688
That is one hundred percent because

438
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
My feeling is

439
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
If we go back into the past

440
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
And dredges an enemy that

441
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:38,208
I need to know why of what happened what's the reason that you know what it is what's the backstory

442
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
No and we don't get

443
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,024
You know it's more like the cloud at

444
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,864
It is a lot like the title and it's like

445
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Tom Hanks

446
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:52,032
He's friends with Halle Berry or whatever in another time

447
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,848
But now he's mad at Halle Berry

448
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,640
This is disorienting

449
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
Movie One Day

450
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,504
Shows like the cloud

451
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,368
Also as racially problematic

452
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,952
Wikipedia

453
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,024
Here is the clip where I

454
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,608
To be a witness part 2 from Monday

455
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
New World Order

456
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
Okay

457
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,264
Orlando

458
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,896
George Orwell

459
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,416
George Orwell

460
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
What

461
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:21,376
Am I

462
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
Yes

463
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,664
He does the sort of same breath

464
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
About Animal Farm

465
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,344
Same reference weird because isn't something that he does on every episode

466
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,904
Preparing so weird

467
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,256
I'm so weird now very bizarre sick of being in a simulation

468
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,328
Buda break me free as I do also like though the

469
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
Be weird defensiveness

470
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,520
Like first of all the New York Times isn't watching your show that closely in 2003 or even now I would argue

471
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
Second

472
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:05,920
Do the people we're going to send you emails or your listeners who haven't read Animal Farm

473
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,736
Do you think the people are going to suddenly like

474
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,552
Walk by the radio go to legs

475
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
Is good for legs

476
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,696
This Alex Jones guy is talking gibberish

477
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:22,816
Ago

478
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,656
It was just as annoying when people made Animal Farm references

479
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:30,496
And we've done it twice in a week so I apologize

480
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
Anyway Alex has talked a bit

481
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,848
About the flag issue

482
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,408
But also has some thoughts about people who cover the flag issue

483
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
But

484
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
That's not true

485
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Do you think it's true

486
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,208
You were willing to accept that that's true I mean I didn't know that it said that all of them were adamant

487
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,024
The part where he said the bigger problem is that they're made enslaved

488
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:33,728
So this is a good example of how flawed Alex's information-gathering techniques are

489
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,384
I assume his little study that he conducted himself was like skimming and mistreating a headline or possibly just seeing one flag that said made

490
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,224
And then jumping to the conclusion that almost all the United States flag

491
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
Are made in China

492
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Warning

493
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,808
20 are made in the United States

494
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,112
95%

495
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
Made somewhere

496
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
Sanka

497
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,584
In reality according to the flag manufacturers Association of America 94% of all United States flags are

498
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
Manufactured in America

499
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:07,520
Most of the imported wants do come from China but it's a really small percentage compared to the ones that are domestic

500
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
We produced

501
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,152
Any flag that is imported has to be clearly visible Declaration of where it was made

502
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,688
And if you find a flag that doesn't

503
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,016
Show that it was made in America or have you country of origin declaration

504
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,320
You're supposed to contact the Federal Trade Commission

505
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:25,952
Because that is a bootleg flash holyshit I did not know that they are

506
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,024
Oh there I can't imagine it's huge but

507
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,424
But there is a flag manufacturers Association of America I don't like people getting it on there too

508
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,728
So there's a good illustration of Alex's information

509
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
InStyle

510
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,336
It feels like all the flags are made in China this kind of a poetic

511
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,688
The resonance to that idea that fits those narratives about the world

512
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
Reflect reality

513
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
One possibility for how Alex could get this impression is that every now and again usually around the 4th of July someone'll run ahead

514
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,440
Redline like the one that was posted in The Hobbit

515
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
Post

516
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
From 2013

517
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Quotes

518
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,864
94% of American flags imported to the United States last year came from China

519
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,680
Is true but it's misleading

520
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:14,336
94% the flag that were imported came from China but they were still only like 5% of the total number of flight manual

521
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
Fractured

522
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,176
They like the rest of them were made domestically

523
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:22,528
If you read the second paragraph of that very article with that headline

524
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
It says quote

525
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,624
American manufacturers still make up the bulk of the business

526
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Fret

527
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,744
Alex doesn't repass headlines investors has a surface-level grass but most of the stories

528
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
AC covers

529
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,792
What kind of important

530
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:40,192
For him but it becomes a big problem when these flawed interpretations of stories are passed along to his audiences some kind of gospel truth

531
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:46,080
Just using this example if you believe Alex and you think that 95% of flags in our country are imported Wendy

532
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Exact opposite

533
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
That is true

534
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:54,528
What I'm getting at is that he's an unreliable source of information because he doesn't have good methods to take his information

535
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,832
Right whatever is coming into him

536
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,136
Is going through a terrible filter

537
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,184
Before he comes to you the right

538
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,536
Unreliable you can't trust it if he's right it's an axe

539
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
Yeah

540
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,888
Yeah this seems like a situation where

541
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
It is not just him

542
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
At fault

543
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,104
Call headline could be well much better Ripley don't know if he's operate

544
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,176
Getting all the headline like that

545
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:27,296
That it that huffpo article is a good example of why it is very

546
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,880
Easy to immediately be taken in by somebody saying 95% of those

547
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,208
Because that is the type of Click baby headline you would write

548
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,512
And that's why they write that

549
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,864
It's true

550
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
It is true

551
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
But it's cooked baby bulshit

552
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,520
And that makes me change what I think might

553
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,336
Be true based on what's going

554
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,384
It's tough to know if like

555
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
That's

556
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,432
Wrong

557
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:58,016
Headlight

558
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
Strictly speaking if you do

559
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,136
Read the words

560
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
In the sentence

561
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:08,512
It doesn't give the wrong impression it's at flags that are imported

562
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,560
Made in China

563
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,840
Fine

564
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
Fair enough

565
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:19,008
Because the number so high cuz I would probably

566
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
It is

567
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
Spiritually

568
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,920
Not going to do the job that you wanted to do

569
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:30,784
If your job if you're telling me this information 94% of American flags

570
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,112
I would need the contacts to make a decision about what to do with that

571
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
I forgot

572
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
Contacts is just like

573
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,488
Holyshit China's got all of our flag

574
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:45,888
You know they make everything even our patriotism article the second paragraph

575
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,680
American still make up the bulk of

576
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,496
95 ft

577
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
15%

578
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:58,176
Look at some of the numbers that are included in their terms of like

579
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,736
Bulk sales

580
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:05,856
Like 95%

581
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,904
My way through to the other side

582
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,464
Nope that is a bad headline that's not good

583
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,280
Call Anthony

584
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,048
Brings up

585
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
Little politician

586
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
That becomes

587
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
Fairly important

588
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:23,008
For Alex for short. Of time before he decided no no I'm going to get away from this

589
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
Albert has no idea who he is

590
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
I appreciate

591
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,664
A lot of the things about how the media overlies

592
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,712
I also wanted to point out

593
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,248
Story

594
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
Overlook

595
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
Which is the

596
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,464
Judge Roy Moore in Alabama

597
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,560
Been fighting a federal

598
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,888
You think mammoth from Alabama Supreme Court House

599
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
A room from 11

600
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
District Court

601
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Quad lock

602
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,872
Tactically remove app

603
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,640
Against

604
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
The state of Alabama

605
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
This week

606
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,648
Have no idea about Roy Moore at this point

607
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
What's

608
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:18,048
Isn't too surprising cuz this is where he comes into a national prominence

609
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,096
Whatever way he didn't write

610
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
Bleeding at this point

611
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Until

612
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
More recent history

613
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,544
This is also along with the California recall race

614
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
The whole

615
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:34,432
Chaos around Roy Moore trying to do the oil at 10 commitment thing

616
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
I think I'm going to be another long running

617
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,344
Storyline on Alex's show me more showing up on

618
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,672
I don't know if possible I don't like that

619
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,488
He was still around twenty years ago and people let him come

620
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
Continue on to get into

621
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,072
My life like

622
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
You guys listen

623
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,632
Everybody in the past

624
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
You knew that it was coming

625
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,008
And now you left it to me to deal with and that's on you

626
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
Now you left a mess

627
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,848
Absolutely get your s*** together the past

628
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
Alright so

629
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,944
You can come down on the pass all you want anything

630
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
But one of the things the past

631
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:12,064
Is giving us is this interview that I was going to do

632
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,904
So this guy

633
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,000
And he runs an organization called Dallas

634
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,048
And Alex has given him a

635
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
Little bit of an introduction

636
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,400
And I we are joined by.

637
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,032
Add of the

638
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,504
Basically use the hot wire

639
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,464
The

640
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,096
The Earth

641
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,704
It's true that the Dallas was the father of Icarus but

642
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,472
That's not his

643
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,752
Top credit I mean

644
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
I think if I could

645
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
He built the Labyrinth

646
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:10,176
Working my nose is probably a little higher on the list of reasons name your Construction Company after him

647
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
I might have forgot to mention this

648
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,248
How was interviewing the guy who runs like

649
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
Construction cover

650
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,856
Are there are there into fabrication

651
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,184
Easily one of the

652
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,488
Cheap pretty construction Folk

653
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,536
Of the ancient Greek

654
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,608
I miss you wouldn't call them have fastest but you wouldn't

655
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,168
Shake a stick at it if he was compared to him

656
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,752
You know like a Smith

657
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,312
Creative things for sure but

658
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,872
In terms of building

659
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,944
But you're doing more with it

660
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,480
Elaborate

661
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
Classic

662
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,784
I'm at Minotaur

663
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
At Minotaur

664
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,880
He and I he inherited he's never got along well

665
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,768
Took me forever to beat the Minotaur AC Odyssey

666
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,096
Annoying fight

667
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,960
Batman the Animated Series

668
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,496
So the Ed

669
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,848
I was asked him a little bit about what your company all about

670
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,112
Building in Pittsburgh

671
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
Thanks

672
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
Important Point here

673
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,000
Daedalus was

674
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
Materials

675
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
Who created

676
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
Extremely low-cost house

677
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
Turns out

678
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
An RV

679
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,848
Probably few materials

680
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
Available

681
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
That

682
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
Structural integrity

683
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
Projected low

684
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,248
Longevity

685
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
Materials

686
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,136
We had no

687
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,440
In the US

688
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Simply Red

689
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:00,768
Recognized

690
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
You want to borrow some

691
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
The requirement existed

692
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
To have a

693
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
Low cost

694
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
That could put up

695
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
Facility

696
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,432
Twenty-four to Forty-Eight Hours

697
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
Within 48 to

698
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,088
Who wants to have

699
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,112
Ben interview about the

700
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,416
The conspiracy element

701
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,720
Of these centers

702
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,768
I have he has got a guy on

703
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
Who's in the construction

704
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
Oceanside

705
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,608
Right yeah if I'm

706
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
If I'm Alex right here

707
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,424
I heard that answer and I went

708
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
This is been great talk

709
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,008
Talking to you goodnight

710
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,032
Makes a few f

711
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:51,200
Amy tries a little bit early unfortunately in the framing of his questions he also reveals that he doesn't actually know any

712
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Anything about

713
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,504
The subject he's talking

714
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,064
News articles

715
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
Incorrect

716
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Well

717
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,104
I'm not sure if that's correct

718
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Dr. I don't

719
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Don't know of any

720
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,432
Contract

721
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,712
For this particular

722
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
Turns out this

723
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
Particular facility

724
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Is under a government

725
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Through

726
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Allegheny

727
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,000
Perhaps leading

728
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
Groups

729
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Bald in

730
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
Civil prepare

731
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,144
Disaster

732
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:48,288
We're not looking for any contract is already a contract we're just doing this in Pittsburgh

733
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
I cannot

734
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,128
Be more on board with

735
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
2

736
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
People who

737
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,223
Clearly have no idea what they're

738
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
Supposed to be doing with each other

739
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783
Like

740
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,623
Just no idea that he's he's like I'm giving you information about

741
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:07,999
Buildings that why you would interview me yeah the only reason you would talk to me is if you wanted to know about building

742
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:14,399
I have a company and I'm sincerely excited about this new application of this

743
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,703
This building material that we have developed

744
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,543
And I'm thrilled that you'd give me a national platform to talk about

745
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:26,943
How and the other applications of building housing in the developing world this is so excited excited for me

746
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:33,343
Tell us a Batman

747
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,391
Now

748
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,535
Ever everyone

749
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,959
We provide that level of

750
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,495
Well I think

751
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
Inaccurate

752
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,615
Notion here

753
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
These facilities

754
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,967
Observation

755
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
Bye Felicia

756
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
Location for corn

757
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
It would presumably have

758
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,207
Three different kinds of

759
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,767
Believe the Browns

760
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,303
Don't really know

761
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
Ferdinand

762
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
Features of a

763
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,975
Building side effects

764
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,559
Such a fire

765
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,887
What we do here

766
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Nope

767
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
Well

768
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,495
We are a construction company

769
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
Thank you very much

770
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,079
A f****** misfire

771
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,199
What could you possibly thought was going to happen from

772
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
I don't know

773
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,015
What and what world

774
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,575
Do you think that you're going to get it engineering

775
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,135
Construction guy to come in and be like yeah

776
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:16,511
So this all this really cool stuff that I'm really interested in I love building I love building materials

777
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
I love what I'm doing

778
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:23,679
Also we're out in the developing world there's really cool places I could be right now but right here

779
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,471
I'm doing

780
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,031
I'm craving trapdoors

781
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,311
If you try and Escape

782
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:35,199
Dabble

783
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:41,855
I can't believe nobody even asked me if it was a trap door to hell in here 2003

784
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,879
S*** right here

785
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,351
Where is the Pearson Elementary this that is I think

786
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:57,215
Maybe it's a Longshot kind of interview they can something happen that

787
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,263
The other end

788
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,615
Recognizes that like there's nothing going to happen

789
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,431
Ain't so he bails you can tell with the interview ends

790
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:13,087
Much more quickly than it would have if something interesting was happening course and so he comes back

791
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,183
Why say I'm sorry before the interview ends

792
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,999
You can see him give up in the in the actual interview

793
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
Wow wow

794
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,815
In 48 hours

795
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,143
Power and Water

796
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,287
Different services in in

797
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,895
That is correct and

798
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
In the case of

799
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:42,783
Provider

800
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
That's really

801
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
Maryland

802
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,767
I was interviewing the guy about how you'll make a building

803
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,631
Alright so when you bring you take the stuff out of the truck so that you put it together

804
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:04,031
Plumbing in there in 48 hours actually one of them

805
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:10,431
More informational claim could be doing but it's so disappointing for Alex

806
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,735
Interested

807
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:25,791
So Alex interview and then he tries to save face when he comes back from break by protest

808
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,327
Sending that that was what he was

809
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,031
A bookworm

810
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,231
Weather

811
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
Good say

812
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,679
I just finished the interview with any kind of weird are you still listening

813
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,519
He said what

814
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:14,175
I just wanted you to know whenever they take you into these camps there will be air conditioning

815
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
Call Mia

816
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,807
Bookworm

817
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:26,463
I just wanted you to know that whatever it will be made with some

818
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,023
Very Innovative materials

819
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,863
That are being used to create housing in the developing world lesbireal

820
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:39,519
These are going to be really trustworthy buildings that you are going to be murdered in good luck getting out

821
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:46,687
So Alex just calls cuz that's much more fertile territory for him

822
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Believe

823
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,039
The topic of a Jewish Mafia

824
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:58,719
Play Bloomberg is a little bit new on the scene wants to know if he's part of the Jewish Mafia

825
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,743
Question

826
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,535
Bloomberg

827
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,287
Doesn't sound right part of the Jewish

828
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,103
Start develop their Bloomberg or is that

829
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,199
That's another nationality

830
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,503
How dare you

831
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
N36

832
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,255
Bugsy Siegel

833
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
If you

834
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,783
Jewish Mafia

835
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
Stop

836
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,279
Where that what were golden

837
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,607
Not really

838
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:12,959
Took a little bit of a nosedive

839
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:17,823
When are people going to realize where that. Is most power

840
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,967
I would have been right there right there where the. Is powerful

841
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:28,575
Alex's expressing that there is a Jewish Mafia and

842
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,135
If you criticize them badl

843
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,439
Which

844
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,999
Implies that they're sort of like a

845
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:40,863
Protection with Jewish Mafia

846
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,631
Hello

847
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,423
Starts to get a little bit mad

848
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
About this

849
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
Weather report

850
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,311
Weather in Bloomsburg

851
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,663
New World Order

852
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,047
Norwegian

853
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,287
Criticized

854
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:40,511
So there's an interesting and very deeply racist lack of understanding that Alex has about the things he's saying and I think I can

855
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,535
Look up simply like this

856
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,375
It's totally fine to criticize Bloomberg even though he's Jewish

857
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:51,519
Unless your criticism of Bloomberg is just a vague unsubstantiated playing but he's part of some mysterious Jewish Mafia

858
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:55,615
If your criticism with him relies on him being Jewish to make sense

859
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:59,711
Then your criticism is antisymmetric if your criticism

860
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:03,295
Policies in general probably not

861
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:10,207
And you can see this refusal to see non-white people as individuals at the end they can see that very clearly

862
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,863
I want to sing any sports being critical of all Chinese Americans working military bases because of the fear that some of them might be

863
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
Despise

864
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,007
It's about that that's not a logical train of thought unless your race

865
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,567
Since Chinese spies exist

866
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,127
People should be seen with some suspicion

867
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,687
They possibly could be one of those spies

868
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:37,599
It's important to recognize how this mentality in line of thought feeds directly into exactly the same motivation to let our country to enter

869
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,391
Japanese Americans during World War

870
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,463
That was a shameful act in our country's history

871
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:47,583
His mind hasn't learned the most Elementary lesson that you should learn from it because deep down

872
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,375
He probably thinks it made sense

873
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,423
2in turn all the Japanese people

874
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
Right

875
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:55,775
Now here's ears one of the big flaws with with

876
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,055
Racism

877
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
Racist

878
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,359
And their thoughts on Spotify

879
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,663
So funshine

880
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,711
And I want to get some spies going

881
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,735
United States

882
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
Here's my thought

883
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:06,783
Alright

884
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,319
United States is racist

885
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,087
F***

886
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,879
Let's get some white folk to do it

887
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:11,903
Boom.

888
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,671
Beyond

889
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:16,767
Interesting Espionage tactic

890
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,143
It also has another guest

891
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:26,751
Might be a little bit more fruitful than the other guys but he's also named

892
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,479
And

893
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,551
Quite exciting

894
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,319
That is exciting

895
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:16,671
For what it's worth there's pretty regular conversations about secession in part 2

896
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,975
Does Canada has anything to do with guns

897
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:23,839
It's hard to say how much of what Alex has things based on

898
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,119
Kingstree pieces of information

899
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,959
Doctor at Hudson is a really fun fella

900
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:34,079
He's on a crusade to challenge Canada's Firearms Act in a wonderfully quixotic fat

901
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,407
I'll January 21st 2003

902
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:40,223
Stage Nevada outside to Saskatoon police station

903
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,503
Where he was in

904
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,295
Clearview of uniform police

905
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:47,391
I sold an unregistered rifle receiver to an associate of his

906
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,671
Name Joe Gingrich

907
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:53,791
The Hope was that he could get arrested on a gun sales charge would you get that appeal up to the Canadians

908
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,071
Supreme Court in that wood

909
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,887
Be his ticket to getting Firearms Act overturned

910
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
However

911
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,727
He didn't get arrested on gun charges

912
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:08,127
An officer asked him to surrender the gun part and you refused we got charged with obstructing a police officer

913
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:15,295
That wouldn't be an Avenue for a challenge of Firearms Act and also the charges were dropped

914
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,575
Back where you started

915
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:22,975
This was all part of a comedy of errors where Hudson was trying to get himself arrested for a Firearms Act related offense but it just wasn't

916
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:29,887
The point where he was considering filing charges against himself so where is strayed into Wylie Coyote

917
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,911
Territory trying to

918
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,751
To take down this is like if Wylie Coyote was trying to take down the Second Amendment

919
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,031
I think it's worse because

920
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,871
I think that there's an aspect of this behavior that like really undercuts

921
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,943
It's like all these gun laws are so oppressive

922
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,247
You can't get arrested trying to

923
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,295
What you talkin about

924
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:55,999
Eventually on October 28th October 20th 2003 he would successfully have a firearm

925
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
MCS but

926
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:00,351
You wasn't charged under the Firearms Act just under the criminal code

927
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:05,215
Hudson try to make this work any attempted to raise constitutional challenges but they all failed

928
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:09,311
At which point he asked the court to charge him with a crime he could use all my God

929
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,359
Dude

930
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:17,759
He also runs a group that Alex reference called the Canadian unlicensed Firearms Owners Association that I would assume that

931
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:24,415
Any self-respecting Gunn weirdo militia type would see that name in in immediately assume it's either run by an idiot or it's a

932
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:30,815
Honeypot Canadian

933
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:35,935
Yes that sounds like a good idea

934
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
Wild

935
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,591
Yeah so he comes on

936
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,639
And Alex's real pumped about how like

937
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,663
Man

938
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,479
Overturn these gun laws in Canada

939
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,503
You and me buddy

940
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
20 years later

941
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,295
Going to happen

942
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,639
We've been saying

943
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,527
Is there anywhere in the world

944
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
Controlling

945
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,095
Are you out understand

946
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,703
Is completely open our membership list

947
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,239
Anyone who

948
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
Remember

949
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,823
Knows the dog that their name address telephone

950
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,847
Phone number is going to be

951
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,615
Completely

952
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,919
If our membership

953
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,479
No one joins

954
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,527
That they're going to be

955
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,551
Completely open

956
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:01,183
Sounds that sounds like gun registration almost

957
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,231
Please pitch saying if you aren't license

958
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,791
If you want register to own a gun

959
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,679
And you have a gun sign up on this list so the government will know you have a gun

960
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,447
Brightwell

961
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:15,263
Yeah it's at least kind of sex

962
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,311
Going to make it easy for

963
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,663
Government know where these unregistered guns are

964
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,455
You know it is almost like

965
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:27,807
If people were aware that way we when they were signing up to this website

966
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:31,647
That if they've been committed a crime with a gun that they would know that the

967
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,671
Gun was unregistered

968
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,231
You could have just register

969
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,815
This is counterproductive and dumped its

970
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,863
So we get into the secession stuff

971
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,655
Alex's Intuit

972
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,935
Turns out this guy

973
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:44,959
The comedian

974
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:45,983
Guy

975
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:52,383
Isn't really that into a panda

976
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,711
Talk about

977
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,575
We can have a new freak

978
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,671
Alberta

979
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,975
Beyond my scope and

980
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,511
Expertise but I've certainly been

981
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,303
Done

982
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,095
Gun shows in Alberta

983
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,471
Talkin about the Alberta

984
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,031
Alberta separating

985
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,591
I am not

986
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,663
Peaceful

987
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,527
Very unjust law here

988
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,087
Really weird way you phrase that

989
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:39,487
That is next to some people

990
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,791
People

991
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:45,119
It's not my bailiwick what's up

992
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:51,519
Elucidated with a man trying to get rid of it'll be real though

993
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,079
Important

994
00:58:54,335 --> 00:59:00,479
Superman and cool outside of coincident but the Maverick

995
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:06,879
His party was deeply involved in the roots of the protest

996
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,415
Kind of see

997
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,535
There's all kinds of

998
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:14,815
Differing

999
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,095
Ideas about

1000
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,399
Some secession ideas in Canada whether it be

1001
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
From First Nations

1002
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,727
Folk or or from

1003
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,263
Weirdos

1004
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,543
Who want a gun

1005
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,103
You know a right-wing Utopia

1006
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:33,503
But it is it is interesting that the fingerprints Kiara of secession arguments

1007
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:36,575
And in the present are both at the Alberta separate

1008
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:39,391
This group really putting together a good case

1009
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
4

1010
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,463
Animal throw this out at you okay so like

1011
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
And here's what I

1012
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,279
If you don't want problems

1013
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,583
To be worse 20 years later

1014
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,887
You should take care of problems

1015
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:50,655
In the Press

1016
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,215
It's it is truth it

1017
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,239
Leaving things

1018
00:59:54,751 --> 01:00:00,895
Doesn't usually take care of it I'm really starting to think you might be able to ignore them a little bit if you ignore

1019
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:04,479
Right right

1020
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,575
Can load easily be worse

1021
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:15,999
Piece of news for unregistered Gun Owners Association owner is it the cops are

1022
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,535
They're all on its own

1023
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:21,887
Where are you

1024
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
AutoZone RC

1025
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,263
I would say up to 7

1026
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,847
The numbers game

1027
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,687
Download number like 70%

1028
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,455
Police officer

1029
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,719
Exactly

1030
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,535
Most police shows in a lot of movies are set in New York

1031
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:55,423
So I understand if you base your worldview on movies and pop culture

1032
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
Chris getting killed all the

1033
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:01,311
In reality Texas has the highest number of police killed per year pretty regularly

1034
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:07,967
In 2016 they were number one with 18 police killed in the state in the line of duty with the next highest aping California

1035
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
With 11

1036
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,527
Hammond Louisiana with nine

1037
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:14,367
The entire state of New York had four officers killed in the line of duty

1038
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,135
That year

1039
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:19,231
When you adjust for population New York isn't even anywhere near the top of the list

1040
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,887
A 2016 study conducted by researchers at Harvard found that in reality the likelihood of a cop being killed in the line of duty with

1041
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,423
Was 3 times higher in States

1042
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,959
Ownership

1043
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,983
Compare two states

1044
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
With low rates

1045
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,519
Yep

1046
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,543
Alex fuel

1047
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,615
Like officer deaths in the line of duty must be lower in States

1048
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,919
More guns because he wants that to be the truth

1049
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,479
Because he wanted to be true he feels like it is

1050
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,015
And therefore it is true

1051
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:46,623
This work is repeated over and over to his audience and I accepted his true despite

1052
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:49,183
Clear evidence that it's just based on Alex's feelings

1053
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:54,047
Also by far the leading cause of death among police and 1st years has been covid

1054
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,863
And we seen how seriously Alex is dealt with

1055
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
How much you care

1056
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,679
So go f*** yourself

1057
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,471
It's true

1058
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:07,359
But I don't think that he cares about the underlying issue as much as he does just wants a lot of

1059
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,455
So

1060
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,247
This guy just had some fella

1061
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,575
He also said something that I would should probably

1062
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,343
Take issue with

1063
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,391
But

1064
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:29,119
But you're crying

1065
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,679
I would like to take the opportunity

1066
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,239
But as you said in your

1067
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,007
Introduction

1068
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,543
The people of the United

1069
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,079
Need to wake up

1070
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,383
The forces that are in play

1071
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,663
Here in Canada

1072
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
Take over

1073
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:46,783
International

1074
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:48,831
Sing about

1075
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,111
Left-leaning

1076
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,135
People who

1077
01:02:55,231 --> 01:03:01,375
Conspiracy

1078
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:05,215
I'm pretending to be above the left-right paradigm

1079
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,519
It's an international

1080
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,615
So that's the that's the end of their interview

1081
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,895
I am.

1082
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,431
I mean

1083
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,015
2022 in this guy's not overturn Canada's gun laws

1084
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,039
Resolve

1085
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,111
You still working I'm sure he's got time

1086
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:26,463
Here's just a nice clip of Alex enjoying his life in a way that he probably can't anymore

1087
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
Or raining

1088
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:56,671
Yeah man

1089
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:01,023
Takes me back to the blunt around

1090
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:04,351
That is that is the other side of not having a boss

1091
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:07,423
Site that we live in now is

1092
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,703
Is the bad side where

1093
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:15,103
You nobody is stopping you from being of weird monster screaming about demons right

1094
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,943
Consequences that are probably things that bosses would have

1095
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,271
Curbed

1096
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
Yeah or fired

1097
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,087
But this

1098
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:29,183
This is the good side this is the s*** where it's like f*** it I'm I'm

1099
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,463
Listening to music right now

1100
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,767
Who's going to stop me oh it's a new show

1101
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:35,583
I'm the news and the news is what music I want to listen

1102
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:44,031
Smeagol never bad driver ahead

1103
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,847
Alex goes back to calls

1104
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:52,479
And this fellow believes that the Amber Alert system is a conspiracy so that's fun

1105
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,831
Stories on TV that

1106
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,111
They were following us

1107
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,767
Unless they knew what was going to happen

1108
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,303
But yet when you see

1109
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,863
The same thing

1110
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,911
We weren't there we didn't get to cover that

1111
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:15,519
All the details were all there when they started to introduce the Amber Alert

1112
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,407
You know whatever happened

1113
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,735
I'm sorry

1114
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,255
Remote control

1115
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:52,639
Little general

1116
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,663
Nature of the ignorance

1117
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:59,807
They want to introduce this and go look

1118
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,439
German

1119
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,767
I wish they could have got

1120
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,071
To the people who perpetrated 911 dispatch

1121
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,351
They did to the mall Bo Peep

1122
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:27,455
Two Scholars decided that the Amber Alert system is a conspiracy and he's doing a spectacular job of explaining his position

1123
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,223
I don't know

1124
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
Nobody's talking

1125
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:32,319
They couldn't have done it if he hadn't already known that if they've done

1126
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:37,183
I guess all these kidnappings or whatever are false Flags

1127
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:43,583
That is I am and his desire for the 9/11 hijackers to have been caught as quickly as

1128
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,863
Lee Boyd Malvo

1129
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,655
Who was one of the d.c. snipers

1130
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:53,567
He and John Allen Muhammad we're on a shooting spree that lasted from February 2nd 2002 until

1131
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,847
October 24th

1132
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,407
That's a full nine months that they were at Large

1133
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,735
22 days of that involved sniping in d.c.

1134
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,039
A long time

1135
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:07,647
Example I would have chosen for like a speedy

1136
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:14,815
You know the rest like you do it and then like an hour later you get

1137
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,887
You should have chosen one of those crime

1138
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:20,703
Sure maybe almost any crime

1139
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:24,799
Particularly like a violent crime large-scale I think

1140
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,615
Probably mean if an if the case gets solved at all

1141
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,175
A lot of time is quicker than 9 months

1142
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:30,943
You wouldn't

1143
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:37,087
I wouldn't use it I also don't think that it was much more than like a time of

1144
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,111
D.c. sniper

1145
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:42,463
It went on like I don't think that timeframe is much shorter

1146
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,999
Turn the. Of time

1147
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:49,375
From when Bush got the memo

1148
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,191
That wasn't that much more than like a month

1149
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,215
For that was in August

1150
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,495
Yeah so like

1151
01:07:55,007 --> 01:08:01,151
I don't I don't I don't I don't use of me mostly because that's your choice of

1152
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,967
Yeah I notoriously long

1153
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,271
Terrorizing thing that happened

1154
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,551
Yeah

1155
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:11,135
5 of a YouTuber

1156
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:17,023
Like it now like a YouTuber

1157
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,607
Random Jose compounds allowed on YouTube

1158
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,911
Christmas music

1159
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,679
Thoughts

1160
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,727
This really really funny

1161
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,023
Whirlpool

1162
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,663
The group

1163
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:09,759
Galaxy it's not know that the Willie Nelson

1164
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,599
Toby Keith and really

1165
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:19,999
Whiskey

1166
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:24,863
Is Uganda

1167
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,423
When the Gunsmoke settles Hill singer

1168
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:32,031
The local Saloon

1169
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:36,383
We'll raise up our class is okay

1170
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:39,711
Who is skateball Bombay

1171
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,479
Call Sara dolls

1172
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:49,183
Willie Nelson hasn't lied about get all the rope in Texas find a tall oak tree and hang up all of them bad boys

1173
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
Is for the people to

1174
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:57,887
I think that Alex is responding that I don't know if that song includes put everybody

1175
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,703
I think the I think the funniest part is that

1176
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:04,287
Is closer to the song that Sacha Baron Cohen

1177
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,823
Making fun of people

1178
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:13,247
Yeah I don't know if Alex is conflating this to with like Toby Keith Courtesy of the Red White and Blue

1179
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:19,647
Maybe but that doesn't throw this out there as far as music knowledge goes

1180
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,695
Jingoistic country music

1181
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,975
Not on my list

1182
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,535
You don't know courtesy the red light and I don't know any

1183
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,375
Put a boot in your ass it's the America

1184
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,399
Nothing

1185
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:33,471
Hey Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list

1186
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:39,871
The Statue of Liberty

1187
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,895
Beheld

1188
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,967
When you hear Mother Freedom started ringing

1189
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:50,367
The whole world is coming down on you

1190
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:55,999
Courtesy

1191
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:59,327
People I do and I just don't think they should be allowed near music

1192
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,399
And I think that's been borne out by all of human history

1193
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:08,799
Look I grew up in Central Missouri Fairmount Toby Keith and Fairmount

1194
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:15,967
I would be wrong if I didn't say that

1195
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,535
The great-great glasses

1196
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:34,655
Toby Keith Willie Nelson and Willie Nelson

1197
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:38,495
That seems weird should have recognized his voice

1198
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:47,199
He's kind of a big deal

1199
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,479
Generational

1200
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,503
Passing of the torch

1201
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
Not really

1202
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:53,599
But Alex has not gone to

1203
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,391
What time does Fizz news

1204
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,695
We're coming up to the end of the show

1205
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,487
And he realizes that

1206
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,911
Water hose

1207
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:29,951
Murder

1208
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,263
Call Brenda

1209
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:00,159
He could do a lot of things

1210
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:02,463
He's not doing any of those things

1211
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,535
I mean he couldn't talk for hours about the David Kelly thing

1212
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,863
Because he's doesn't really know anything

1213
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,911
Ramble about stuff may be true

1214
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:18,591
Saudi Arabia stuff you already talked about the beginning of the show very briefly and dismissed out-of-hand I don't know he could talk about

1215
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
But that 4 hours

1216
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,383
Maybe you could

1217
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,919
Not about drama

1218
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:26,271
Grow weary of

1219
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,295
Like

1220
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,087
I could have done this

1221
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,623
You could and you can

1222
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,391
You got to show

1223
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,927
No one telling you anything

1224
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,231
What did you do instead

1225
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:36,767
You wish

1226
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,327
The f****** interview with

1227
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:43,423
Thinking it was going to be awesome Utah

1228
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:48,543
Just trying to get all the unregistered gun owners to sign up for his organization

1229
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:52,895
Create a list of unregistered gun owners and it wasn't even an international conspiracy

1230
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,919
God

1231
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
Brutal

1232
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,967
Yeah it's just

1233
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:03,135
If you could you should and you got it because what you doing

1234
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:08,767
So we are one last episode of Alex's is trademark

1235
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,047
Headline rap-up

1236
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,071
At the end of the show

1237
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,607
Hugo zygos over

1238
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,679
Some of the movie talk about some of them

1239
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,983
Someone who doesn't have time to get to because

1240
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,007
He's run out of time

1241
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,823
Another article review

1242
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,663
British police they now found out

1243
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,255
Got time for a plug

1244
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:44,095
Article isn't about the police being in a secret society but Alex

1245
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:47,423
It's that because he's just skimming headlines and he saw the word cabal

1246
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:50,751
It's about allegations that there was a team called operation Rock

1247
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,823
Jamwich cherry-pick reports to emphasize

1248
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:57,663
The argument that Saddam was not in compliance with proliferation rules

1249
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,223
This is a UK group

1250
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:06,879
These allegations were made by a former un weapons inspectors from the United States named Scott Ritter but this isn't proven claim

1251
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,927
Heather's been actually many objects

1252
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,695
Do it

1253
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,767
Like Rockingham does exist but the claim that their purpose was to

1254
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:15,071
Cherry-pick Intel that's not a stab

1255
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:22,239
It hardly matters though cuz I haven't read this story has no idea what he's talking about and even if you did have time to get into

1256
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,639
Show me scams the headline sees the word cabal insights

1257
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,711
Completely made up story that the news is reporting

1258
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,503
Secret society

1259
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,271
In the British

1260
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,295
Force

1261
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,855
Again I'm a broken record I understand that but

1262
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:38,879
This is accepted

1263
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,647
Alex

1264
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,927
He's fine reporting

1265
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:44,255
Completely fabricated stories care

1266
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
It is

1267
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,815
Never

1268
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:47,583
Not

1269
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,351
Astonishing

1270
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,143
That a man could just

1271
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,935
Read a headline and then be like

1272
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:55,519
And in the UK they've discovered that there is a cult of

1273
01:15:55,775 --> 01:16:00,383
Cops out there Coptic getting married in all this just doing this whole thing and it's like no

1274
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:07,039
You just decided these words are a scam DeMatha

1275
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:13,695
It's like a creative writing prompt and he gets one every time he looks at the paper and then he just wins a yard

1276
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,719
And it's not

1277
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:17,279
You know you know it intellectually you know it

1278
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:21,631
But your entire life has trained you to believe that if somebody is standing at a desk

1279
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:24,191
Looking into you reading off of the news

1280
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,007
Something like something close

1281
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,287
You ever read the world

1282
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:33,919
You hoped you'd hope that I let Sandra and then the other thing that you project onto those people is that

1283
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,711
They would feel bad

1284
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,247
About getting things

1285
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,271
He's completely wrong

1286
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:44,671
And just making s*** up very least would be embarrassed or worried about consequences or anything

1287
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:53,119
I hope that's not the case for him he just does not give a s*** to let it all hang out there

1288
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,703
Yep get like the real essential point is

1289
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,751
You have to understand

1290
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,287
The way Alex

1291
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:02,079
Filters information

1292
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:05,151
From a source threw himself to the audience

1293
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:09,759
Unreliable of a delivery mechanism this is

1294
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,831
You can't trust what's coming out because

1295
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,855
Sometimes

1296
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:16,159
It might be a thing that he understands

1297
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,695
Sometimes

1298
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:20,767
It might be something he made up from skimming a headline

1299
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,559
And you have no idea which is which

1300
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:27,167
He report he sounds exactly the same no matter which

1301
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,215
We talkin about how

1302
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:34,079
Hey I believe that the first amendment allows for writing on an American flag

1303
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,871
Thought about

1304
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,687
Sounds exactly the same

1305
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:41,759
Undercover secret society in British police horse

1306
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,063
This headline would have nothing to do with that

1307
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:48,159
Dangerous dangerous that kind of person to be

1308
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,183
Disseminating information

1309
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,463
Yep that's

1310
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,231
That's my point

1311
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:51,999
You got it

1312
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
Is where you put a.

1313
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:01,983
Oh that is where you are going to keep that. Buy bread

1314
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:06,591
We works

1315
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,615
And I think that

1316
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,639
Obviously

1317
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,407
2003

1318
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,943
You're so much more fun

1319
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:13,247
I mean there's no world in

1320
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:15,039
2020

1321
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,855
Anymore

1322
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,671
You never in the present-day going to hear him

1323
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,975
Taking a long shot on interviewing

1324
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:27,071
Reconstruct never going to find stuff like that and endnote

1325
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,119
You good also spoiler alert

1326
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,911
Alex announce that he has

1327
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:34,751
Facebook Charlie Daniels for a future show

1328
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:40,895
Well then I guess we'll be in the past until the dam has not like Charlie

1329
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:54,975

1333

Holding

Alexandra Thurston color
