00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,920
Jordan

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
What was the last

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,552
Accounting job

6
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:28,416
Over it

00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:34,816
No it was

8
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:38,656
Cuz I am not in the know what I was thinking that job

9
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,984
How about before that like really quit a job

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,008
You know I'm saying

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,544
Like I like a real

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,944
Blowout kind of quit

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968
Missouri

14
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,760
I worked at a Office Depot

15
00:00:54,016 --> 00:01:00,160
Is going to be great it was a terrible terrible job cuz a lot of involves

16
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,256
Like lifting heavy pallets of paper

17
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,816
15 ft in the air or whatever

18
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:12,192
Forklift just walking up ladders miserable

19
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,240
The guy who trained me was

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,568
This guy who was like really into evangelizing

21
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,616
The most of the time you talk

22
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,664
Me about God

23
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,992
I don't want I don't want any of this I don't want any

24
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,552
There's one person who worked at it was really nice to me

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,184
Around my age or a couple years older it's somewhere in that range

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,744
We struck up a little bit of a friendship and then

27
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
Maybe a weekend to me working there turned out she wanted me to swing with her and her husband

28
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
I was

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,824
One who wasn't fine I wasn't I wasn't

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
Coworker and her husband that's if I could go back I might take them up on it

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,320
No I was not there for that total again

32
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:04,160
Evolved into my own sexuality yet

33
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
So I am

34
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
It's process

35
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
So I'm working

36
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Complete assholes

37
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
To be at work generally

38
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
Like 6 in the

39
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
The morning it's

40
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
Is a miserable job

41
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
I haven't worked there all that long

42
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,544
I one day I just wake up

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,848
Around with my roommate Nikki gift

44
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
He was also up

45
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
You're right

46
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
So it's really really important

47
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,392
How do I call in and I realize like

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
I don't want to go to work

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
But I also don't want to take her

50
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,840
Responsibility for not wanting to go to work right so I call him and

51
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,400
Can't make it in today my car is not working

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
Can you get a taxi

53
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
Like I don't I don't have any

54
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
Cashman's

55
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,848
Get a taxi I'm sorry I just can't make it in

56
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
I don't want you to have to pay for me to come into work

57
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,040
Today

58
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:12,000
Look man I just I feel bad taking her money for a cab is a car right

59
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
Not even my personal money it's the offices

60
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,704
Okay then

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
Can I realize that I had nowhere else to go

62
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
So you just go

63
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,016
F*** you

64
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
That was the Jesus guy right

65
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
No no no

66
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:44,256
Use not the boss

67
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
My championship

68
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
I guess maybe you could

69
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,864
Could say I got fired from that job but

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,448
I was I was I was thrilled for it to count

71
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
I was just

72
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
3 realized

73
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,176
You think it's going to be a big deal and then afterwards he was like

74
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:09,088
Just a weight is lifted right not have that job

75
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:13,184
In terms of like I lived in Columbia Missouri rent was almost nothing

76
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
Then and there were jobs a-plenty

77
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
You know it's almost perfect

78
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
Do something like that

79
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Got a lot of jobs

80
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,359
Favorite quick story

81
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
With me not quitting

82
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,199
Because I didn't understand that I was an adult

83
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
Could just go

84
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,367
I don't work here anymore

85
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
Lumberyard

86
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
Nearly two-and-a-half

87
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
And I realized

88
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
Two-and-a-half

89
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,911
I hate this every moment of it I don't like being there I don't like the people I don't like anything

90
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
And I realized

91
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
Recently liked

92
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
Cut my elbow in this

93
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
Accident

94
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,663
And it was already my surgically repaired

95
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,479
From when I was younger so I was like okay

96
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
Alright

97
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,623
I can sell this I can work with this right right and I didn't think it looked bad

98
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
So what I did

99
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
Was I got it

100
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:24,095
And I just started for real View

101
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,215
Because I didn't understand I could just quit

102
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
I thought I had I came up with the worst

103
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Fake injury

104
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,151
Out of the shell

105
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
Nope

106
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,623
I assume if you have to be able to use your elbow

107
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,695
In order to do so

108
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,327
That was my argument for being like hey I'm going to have to take all this time off

109
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
And you know what

110
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,983
I just I think you guys should find somebody else for the job that was the way I put

111
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:07,359
Altruism

112
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
But not because I don't want to do

113
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
Who's more reliable

114
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
He's not going to get her

115
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
It's not you it's me

116
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
You quitting Zapata

117
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:27,071
How do I minimize

118
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
Journey of quitting

119

Caribbean

I don't want

135
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
Jesus Christ

Gordon apartments in sports

139
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
Just like Paul Ryan

140
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Who also quit

141
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,511
He did a lot of quitters

142
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
How

143
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
Much Wong Curry he did policy while he

144
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,007
What did he say

145
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:16,383
Which I assume has completely disappeared under his fix

146
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
Podcast

147
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
From time to time

148
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,159
We got to do a little thing called the spice

149
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,743
Everyone knows

150
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:43,519
Kind of Cold podcast people need update so

151
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,919
I like spicy food restaurant here in town I've tried the office

152
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,503
Menu for the menu chicken wing fingers

153
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,647
Over at the the Nashville hot place

154
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Come my way

00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
Uncle

156
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
Define the like super hot peppers

157
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Here in Chicago

158
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,351
I don't know why we're one of the biggest cities in the country

159
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,423
But yet I cannot find a store that sells

160
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
Really hot hot sauces

161
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
Peppers

162
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
So I'm

163
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Sword

164
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,407
Maybe everybody tells me go to the Indian grocery

165
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
I want tells me go to the Asian grocery store

166
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,575
I've tried the ones that I've been able to find and I have been slacking

167
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
However

168
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
I accidentally stumbled into

169
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Spice Shop

170
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Today

171
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Jordan

172
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
I found

173
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,279
Puree

174
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,607
Carolina Reaper sauce

175
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
Literally just hear a bunch of

176
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,007
Carolina Reapers and vinegar

177
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,799
Hellboy

178
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
Is it hot

179
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
It's great

180
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Visit

181
00:09:54,431 --> 00:10:00,575
No no no

182
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Suffer because they're

183
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Great

184
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:14,143
I really wish that you could try some of it but I know you would never consent to

185
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,727
I can't do it but also now I realized

186
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
It is technically like I guess the world's hottest pepper

187
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
Now

188
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
There's nowhere else to go

189
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:32,575
No more worlds

190
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,135
I'm fine with it because I think a lot of different peppers have

191
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Flavors

192
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
Characters

193
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
There's still a lot more take

194
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
Explore and all that it's different

195
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Pureed

196
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
Fresh

197
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
There's still plenty of spicy

198
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Things in my

199
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
To go into but I will say

200
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
Good bit of a tan Ramen

201
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
Earlier

202
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
And

203
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
In terms of

204
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Like heat level

205
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
That's very Siri

206
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,367
Close to like a level level seven or eight at the Thai place

207
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,487
Is a guy wait like

208
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
It's

209
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
Yeah

210
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
It may have been later

211
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
On the toilet ghost on the toilet

212
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
My point is my phone is very serious

213
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
But

214
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
It's just an ass but I finally found some

215
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
Carolina Reaper sauce

216
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
Fine

217
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,807
Prime made me sweat a lot

218
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
10 months

219
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
Like Alexander the Great

220
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Crying salt

221
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
For there are no more worlds

222
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Perhaps

223
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
11 minutes

224
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,839
Bulshit

225
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
Jobs

226
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,239
But this is a podcast about Alex Jones

227
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,591
Absolute is going over to separate

228
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
The 19th

229
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,711
2018 okay

230
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
That I wanted to

231
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Do present

232
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
We seem to be coming in

233
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,439
Like a weekend wrap-up

234
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
Fraught with Peril for Alec

235
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
A lot of stuff

236
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,351
Pagani had that Slim

237
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Nahko great

238
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
Particular

239
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,943
Very strange

240
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Nothing

241
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,231
I'm not sure what that judge was doing editorializing

242
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,607
I don't know

243
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
So I don't know

244
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
I don't know what to make

245
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,543
So your Wild Oats on that bench

246
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,871
UCC judges all the sudden come out of nowhere

247
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,319
So that was one piece of the week I thought Alex

248
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
Should we really be

249
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,135
Uno into an

250
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
Complaining

251
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
The reason we're starting on the 8th

252
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
18th onto

253
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Is because

254
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,631
On Monday night

255
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,703
Cremation lawsuit against them coming from miles

256
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,799
The soup was about how Rodger Stone kept saying that

257
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,359
Illegal contributions

258
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Hillary Clinton

259
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
And was working against

260
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Trump

261
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Steve Bannon

262
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,063
Also Rodger kept accusing clock of having been convicted of financial crimes

263
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
In the United States

264
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:51,487
Rice box Rodger stone for 100 million dollars

265
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:57,887
Broadstone completely f***** up here so he called clock and asked him to settle the lawsuit which guac graciously

266
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
To do

267
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,959
Because he's Rodger Stone though he refused to take

268
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
Any

269
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
Zangief

270
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
You think it was he

271
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,735
Failed to do his own research and improperly relied on former Trump campaign advisors

272
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
Nunberg

273
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,831
I'm traveling low-key now what is going on here

274
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:23,231
Who was the guy who got drunk and went on all those those

275
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Remember that

276
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
Remember Sam nunberg

277
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,887
He was that guy who is clearly drunk on CNN in the host was like

278
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
I can smell out

279
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,799
Never watched

280
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,127
How much of a f*****-up world we live in now

281
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
That should be the kind of thing

282
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,831
That we remember 20 years from now as a f******

283
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
On a nationally syndicated

284
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,999
News program about the president and his employees

285
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
Recently

286
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
It was embarrassing

287
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
For everybody in our purpose

288
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
The Fall Guy

289
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,543
He reported on

290
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,639
I like about 200

291
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Provided it Rodger poster

292
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:21,087
Retraction to Infowars Rodger Zone website

293
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
Unfortunately

294
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
This is how things work

295
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
No propaganda

296
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
Make outrageous and libelous client

297
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,511
Which cause damage

298
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
Then off and they get away with it but even when there's

299
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
They pull it all shucks

300
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Meac

301
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
And the better Natures of the

302
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
The person who sue in Limerick

303
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
Roger's going to print a retraction but

304
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
The damage has already been done

305
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,919
And no one who heard the original slander will care about the retract be like

306
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:50,015
All this is so smart this is how he gets out of this guy money

307
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
Or it'll just be like

308
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,231
It's a globalist party against him or whatever everything and I'll still be able to

309
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,327
Don't matter

310
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
Alex pretend

311
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,935
He'll apologize to everybody who he slandered

312
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:14,591
None of his fans give a s*** if we have the chance to give advice on anybody who's running

313
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,431
Their next defamation lawsuit I'm sure they will do

314
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
Call us

315
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,271
Believe me we will give you a Mason advice

316
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,855
Through the whole process and that will be

317
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
Get every

318
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,951
F****** sent out of those guys that you could

319
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,815
Ever possibly get and leave them destitute on the street

320
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,167
Like yeah retraction or whatever I know that that's probably why

321
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
Is in the realm of decency

322
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Whatever you think is

323
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
They just say that they were wrong

324
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,687
We are fine indecent men

325
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
You need a little bit more

326
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,783
Retraction I'm not saying

327
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
Send them to The Pourhouse

328
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,231
I love it it's a great starting point

329
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:09,631
That is that is like the reverse of dr. evil in Austin Powers where he says $1000000

330
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
Everybody laughs at

331
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
100 million is

332
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Pursuing just some a******

333
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,823
I like it I would say

334
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
Instead of a retraction what you have to do

335
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,943
Interview with that purse

336
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:28,319
Like miles Kwok gets to Infowars

337
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:34,463
Rodger Stone I don't know

338
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,839
Here's what I would go with

339
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,143
Let's go with a more creative

340
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Punishment

341
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,495
As opposed to

342
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
Rogers I would like

343
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,431
All of Rodger Stone suits and he is never allowed to buy another suit again

344
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
If I get the hats

345
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:02,367
Kiwi divided his wardrobe and his Wardrobe from here on out

346
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
Is jeans and a t-shirt

347
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
His hats might be

348
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
Useless to me.

349
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
Not important

350
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
It is for me

351
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
Yeah but you would never fit it

352
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:23,103
So anyway they broke on Monday night so I thought for sure on Tuesday

353
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Alex is going to

354
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Furious about

355
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
Because the way the news covered it

356
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
The hill

357
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
Huffington Post also

358
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,599
They reported accurately

359
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
But what they do is they used

360
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
These headlines

361
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,695
Is that lead people to go a little

362
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
So they said

363
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:45,631
That Rodger Stone settles lawsuit has to admit he published fake stories on Infowars

364
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:50,239
Which technically is true because he was the person who was making these claims

365
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,799
Infowars reported them and they publish them

366
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,383
Absolutely that is strictly true

367
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Horse

368
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
People ran with in real life

369
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,551
Admitted he lies all the time on

370
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,087
I thought for sure Alex

371
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
Who's going to be like

372
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,695
They're just trying to make me out to be a liar and all this

373
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,487
I'm so surprised

374
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
To hear this

375
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
At the beginning of the show

376
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
As he's running down his headline

377
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Times for the day

378
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Special Report

379
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Rodger Stone

380
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:26,079
Will Generation Z save us from our Millennials right holders of Watson video

381
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,639
Rochester

382
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,967
Infowars.com

383
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Bitcoin soon worthless

384
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:40,159
Egg surprise

385
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,583
Pick your top stories about as Camry

386
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
I don't

387
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,007
I don't I don't I don't know what that is except like a man trying to distract him

388
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
MK Ultra where's then buff

389
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,831
Pedophiles are we still doing pedophiles I guess we're still doing pedophile

390
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,391
I will

391
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,511
He has been surrounded by a lot of f****** con man

392
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
And who do Bitcoin scam

393
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,631
He's at a number of people who like you

394
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
On the market

395
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,519
Still at like a tenth of a second I'm not sure

396
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,103
Max Keiser is the man who's tried to get him into Bitcoin his head

397
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
Like Dave Steam

398
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Fraudsters

399
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
Running around

400
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,623
The next big endorsement

401
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:49,023
The price goes up

402
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,143
I'm holding his credit he has always resist

403
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
So when he sang Bitcoin will soon be worthless

404
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,519
I kind of feel good about her saying that

405
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
Because it need something

406
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
You've never did now

407
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,639
But at the same time every time

408
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,991
I just don't get it I don't think this is good

409
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,319
Like unlike many financial analyst who are like

410
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,672
I don't get why people are doing this understand it as a concept

411
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,512
Tire doesn't fully understand

412
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,072
Before I don't know why you said the restraints on this one

413
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,376
Might might be because of his just

414
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
Innate love

415
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,056
And 20-year career as a shill for a guy who so cold

416
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,360
What's hard currency

417
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:43,808
The next story after that is a study about how fresh vegetables are better than canned vegetables

418
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
And then he says

419
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,160
How do you pick a top store

420
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:56,096
Fresh vegetables holyshit

421
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
Wow

422
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:05,312
I'm amazed makes the cut I'm actually shocked that you are

423
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:10,688
Surprised by this because my whenever you said like I'm surprised he goes off on this was like

424
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
Oh he actually talks about

425
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,040
Because what's not surprising to me is that he was just

426
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,344
Avoiding it entirely without any info

427
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,720
Okay

428
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,304
So then after that Alex moves along to talk about house

429
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,632
Over at Fox News

430
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,240
Top Fox News hosts

431
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,648
And all the way back

432
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
But

433
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,120
When Tucker Carlson was brought on he was not a hundred percent behind from

434
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:07,776
That's why they thought he was a good guy

435
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
Whatever

436
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:15,200
I don't care about this it's really just because his buddy

437
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:19,296
Judge Andrew Napolitano has been going all over

438
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
IFixit Mueller can

439
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,440
Call for the indictment of a sitting president

440
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,840
A few months ago Alex was saying that

441
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,424
And thank God his uncle was thank God this is the case

442
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:42,336
Napolitano next Supreme Court Judge around

443
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
He's going around

444
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,712
You saying that to mullican indict the president cuz he's not the next

445
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,272
That's possible

446
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
Ruined

447
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,136
Furious he can't stop like

448
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:00,512
You think you know your friends that's something still on the show

449
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,816
You talk about Fox News

450
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
He's not on Alex's

451
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
I thought you were gone

452
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,168
Oh okay

453
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:12,544
Broadcast

454
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,896
Together that's right

455
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
It's that it's fun Alex

456
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Episode of realizing

457
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
Another

458
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
And the sensible ones

459
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
Are starting to be like

460
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,744
The position to be Edwards like

461
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
The

462
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,096
Lumos

463
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,424
Take me to go to jail

464
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,728
And has just been successfully forced

465
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
To print a retraction

466
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
Belief

467
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,616
Possible punishment you can get here's what the punishment

468
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,664
Journalistic diligent

469
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
If you're wrong

470
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,224
Post a retraction

471
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
You write report

472
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Like you can't

473
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Like when he was

474
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,512
Rodger talk about miles

475
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
He never says

476
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,704
Sam nunberg told me I never

477
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,008
Criminal

478
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
Right the guy I trust the most

479
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
He's going to jail

480
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
The guy that I used to trust

481
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,992
He is giving a milquetoast legal argument that makes sense

482
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:32,160
Brutal stick with Rodger Stone Rider.

483
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,464
He goes to break and he comes back

484
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
Weird

485
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
Sort of

486
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096
A little bit of a diatribe

487
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,664
This is the really interesting part that Do Hast Mich

488
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,064
Popular bands out of the last 20 years

489
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,608
Music

490
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:17,216
Wait music

491
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
Weird

492
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:28,224
PewDiePie

493
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,760
As Final Phase

494
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
Speech

495
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
I love this

496
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,976
His argument seems to be that

497
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,328
Which

498
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,352
A little bit here

499
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
But

500
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,104
The reason people take their Nazis is really interesting

501
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,200
It wasn't it was I thought it was obvious that they weren't Nazis

502
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,320
Deserve discussion

503
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:10,976
There are groups in past will come out who seemed innocuous and all the metrons I do that

504
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
So you have

505
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
You have these

506
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
You know you end up learning things about bands

507
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,312
What you didn't know about

508
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,616
Music and in celebrity

509
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,408
Entirely is that is the realm of light

510
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,712
Like people coming up with a rumor about a band

511
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
Fascinating

512
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,160
I became aware them from the Lost Highway soundtrack

513
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:45,280
Rammstein has two songs on a soundtrack

514
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
And we were not hit

515
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:51,168
The hits from the soundtrack were the perfect drug by Nine Inch Nails

516
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
By Smashing Pumpkins

517
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,264
There's a third but I wasn't

518
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,080
Marilyn Manson song

519
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
Remember what it was

520
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,896
Who cares

521
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,432
Duck duck point is like

522
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
Alex had to have listened to that soundtrack

523
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,320
Really like that soundtrack

524
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,904
I had that soundtrack when I was a kid

525
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,976
I really like that I by Smashing Pumpkins in the

526
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Drug

527
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,584
I thought those were probably 12

528
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,936
I might have begun 12

529
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
If you could

530
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:31,616
Wait till your did you also see the movie when you were talking I heard on the radio

531
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
Never let me watch

532
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
I was going to say

533
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
That I had

534
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:52,096
First album I ever bought was Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill

535
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,656
Google language

536
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:01,568
Generation defining album

537
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:06,432
Cedarline there was that

538
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,904
Nothing more humiliating than going back to the mall

539
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,488
Turn my Lantus Morissette speedy

540
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,280
Cuz my mom made

541
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:26,400
Got out of her childhood

542
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,960
Who is taking that CD back

543
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,776
What must have been thinking after he saw it

544
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
After he saw you

545
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,896
Jagged Little Pill in album where is like

546
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:41,504
Everybody loves the great albums

547
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,808
Pull up Hits album

548
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:50,208
But my demeanor probably

549
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:55,328
Reset it for me I would assume

550
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,400
People like you type

551
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,728
No idea that America

552
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
He plays as a bumper is

553
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Explicitly

554
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
America anti-colonialist

555
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
Cultural

556
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
As a song

557
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,944
Zoe

558
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,736
Stupid actually brings up

559
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,808
Genre of music

560
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
In sensational

561
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,928
And so the music is often been in 10

562
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
To shock

563
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
Plus they make illusion

564
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
Stupid jokes about a whole lot

565
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Taboo topic

566
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,352
Disorder Behavior led to strong rebuke

567
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,888
From the right wing

568
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,912
Not the laugh

569
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,448
When the band broke

570
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,336
That doesn't sound right there

571
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,640
Music

572
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:45,504
Vocal style of speaking

573
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,064
German that is intentionally

574
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,856
Hardness of the German language

575
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
It's a beautiful

576
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
They're doing that as a stylist

577
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
Choice to make their sound more country

578
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,792
Except however he's also

579
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
Speech pattern in style is largely

580
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
Associated with Nazis

581
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
Particularly

582
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,728
Especially for people with a limited awareness

583
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
5 tons

584
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
Manners of speech

585
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,896
The members of Rammstein grew up in East Germany before the

586
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:19,552
Their name is a direct reference to the Ramstein airshow disaster of 1988 were 70 people died

587
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,624
And 346 more were seriously injured

588
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,184
At a West German air show at the US Airbase

589
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,488
They're into antagonizing

590
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,024
It's part of their crap

591
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:34,656
Oh also in 1988 use footage from Eleni Riefenstahl film the video for the song

592
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
So that also kind of

593
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,104
That led to a bit of hey guys what are you doing

594
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,176
And if you understand them

595
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
More fully

596
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
It serves electronic Zantac

597
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
It makes sense

598
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:58,720
There were coming from left

599
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,256
Record label is that

600
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
What the f***

601
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
I was the criticism

602
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,352
Abusing bunny

603
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,424
So like all of the critiques that hours

604
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
What is talking about

605
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
Come from

606
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
Don't understand

607
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
But their music

608
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
And I almost

609
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Superman

610
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,872
We're not in the camp

611
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
He is trying to put

612
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,088
Like I've always understood to be like a literal

613
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:25,856
Hey

614
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648
We looked at German history

615
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
We're not fans

616
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,536
And here's the music that we think best represents how we're going to f******

617
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
Can fight these

618
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:40,192
And not end as we can see no not just remnants of fascism but

619
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,752
Very strong undercurrent

620
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,544
Shazam

621
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,872
Add another element of it to do for them

622
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
Mystique and

623
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
Play outside of Germany

624
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Some be like

625
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
From performing

626
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
Choreography

627
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184
Before one of their song

628
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
In German

629
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,256
Because it was deemed offensive

630
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
Dangerous to children

631
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,448
Cuz they would do things like stimulate anal sex with sex toys on each other

632
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,544
Where is not allowed anywhere near

633
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:21,408
Probably one of their album covers

634
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,224
From being displayed in German stores and stuff like that

635
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
This Aura of

636
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
Being

637
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
It's stuff like that so you can totally understand their laws are on the side of caution

638
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
Anything along those lines

639
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:45,216
You know you see how a course correction might

640
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,800
Go a little bit too far in the opposite direction

641
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
S'mores it like

642
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
Anybody who

643
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
Critiques of

644
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Rammstein

645
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Back then

646
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,808
Where did the camp at Alex's pretending

647
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,368
And they were very vocal

648
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,416
About

649
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
No

650
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,840
Sorry sorry

651
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
So can you

652
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,680
We missed it the first time but now that you pointed it out

653
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
You make a grapefruit

654
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
You're right

655
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
We're moving on

656
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,056
You're still Rammstein we're still us

657
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,080
Let's just have a great

658
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,920
Launches into this whole thing about their calling

659
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
PewDiePie a Nazi

660
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
Do powerfulest

661
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,112
At least doesn't seem to understand the conversation

662
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
I am promoting people who have

663
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,000
If he believes

664
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
I think it's funny to have

665
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
People hold up assignment

666
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
Does kill all the Jews

667
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,424
Who knows anyway I don't want to unpack the PewDiePie stuff

668
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
What I was talking about I didn't even

669
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
It sits around the

670
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
It's about Alice

671
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
He's using

672
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,176
PewDiePie is a surrogate for his own feet

673
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,480
What

674
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,272
And then talk about another musician

675
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
I have

676
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
More feeling

677
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,160
1000 people

678
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,464
Trump

679
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,424
City on Coliseum Pike Waco

680
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
But because you won't play ball

681
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,800
He loses 15

682
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
Million

683
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
Dollars

684
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
How do you know that

685
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
Indirectly

686
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:40,160
I heard directly from Publications that it's true

687
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:46,304
How much money are Trump leading musicians losing.com

688
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,704
I haven't I haven't seen that number 11 research

689
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,872
102 summer tour

690
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:04,480
Nugent the Iowa Speedway in Newton Iowa

691
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
What is comprable to any

692
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,928
It's very close to like 2/3 of Busch Stadium

693
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,768
A long way play tunnel Rock clubs in larger cities and

694
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
Casinos in places

695
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,096
St.Louis

696
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,144
Literally exactly what you'd expect

697
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,472
Never had a song chart tires and number 30

698
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
And that was

699
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
Cat-scratch

700
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,312
Fever which came out 41 years ago

701
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
In fairness

702
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
He did reach number two

703
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,688
Two on the rock chart with little Miss dangerous

704
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,992
But that was 31 years ago

705
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
Also

706
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,088
Here's some of the lyrics from Little Miss dangerous hear it

707
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
High heels all of our favorite musicians are pedophiles

708
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:51,072
High-heeled sneakers

709
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:57,472
Such a dangerous little girls

710
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Paris to me

711
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:04,640
What makes her dangerous to you little girl's face why would she have a little girl

712
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
I don't know

713
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,224
Be a little bit

714
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,576
Is 1981 song jailbait

715
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:19,744
Well I don't care if you're just 13 you look too good to be true

716
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,352
I just knew that you're probably clean there's one little thing I got to do to you

717
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Another lyric was that

718
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,216
It's alright baby it's quite alright I asked your mama

719
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:34,080
School one morning

720
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:41,760
Not like he would pick her up from her mom's house

721
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
Encourage her parents

722
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,576
Would sit in the front seat

723
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
They would Court

724
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:52,000
And then she has another lyric in the song quote

725
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,328
Put cuffs on me what about her

726
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,936
They all share her with you about about driving someone to school

727
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
I don't

728
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:08,128
Interesting Lee the next song on his album

729
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:17,344
It is important and this is everybody can change is most recent song

730
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,904
Which charted I think 120 or so

731
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
Was called whoops to Doodle my bad

732
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
I wish I was

733
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:30,656
Does a 2070 rotate deeply disturbing song called Girl Scout cookies

734
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,680
Wish I was making this up

735
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,056
How old is dogs about

736
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,360
Text Leo Celtic of minor

737
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,688
Maybe you're just a pedophile

738
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
I like to eat

739
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,272
My Girl Scout cookies I can eat them all night long

740
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:50,880
When I'm in my bed is a pattern

741
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,672
Never let them Girl Scouts

742
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,464
Never let them go to your head

743
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
I also another disturbing lyrics

744
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:02,400
That coconut just drives me wild I get my cookies fresh from a child

745
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,728
How gross is onion

746
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:17,504
Looking forward to Trump's inauguration song in 2020 just being Ted Nugent

747
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,184
Sentiments

748
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,464
Nobody likes a fat

749
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
Boo

750
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,328
Because that's just not true

751
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:35,168
Also this album

752
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,216
Bridge Over Troubled Waters

753
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,008
Jesus man

754
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:45,408
Not realize how he was upon the steaming his music also recorded

755
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:51,040
Song called

756

I never really paid much attention to Ted Nugent I saw that cat scratch fever was on like f****** Guitar Hero 1 timing

757
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
To listen to Ted

Gross just super gross

766
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,096
But it's even more grows when you realize that Ted Nugent

767
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
Married

768
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,728

00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,528
He married or adopted as if those are two

773
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,552

And they loved

788
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,624

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
The right

795
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960

It is

801
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:58,527
I don't understand how you get there

802
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,599

Too far with it and they're stupid and they say things

838
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:10,111
This proves that everything is fake for The Fray

839
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,647
And they they hurt

840
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,183
The cause of working again

841
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951

852
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
To say

00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,807
The bare minimum

854
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,111
This thing published

855
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879

00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:56,447
People ran with it

861
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,031
Some sort of a Rodger his admitted everything is alive

862
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,407
Situation

863
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,687
Sued for saying

864
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967

What a sofa

868
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,183
The only other thing Alex

869
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
Can do besides like

870
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
False ID

871
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
Was wrong but everything went

872
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,863
2 years ago

873
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,143
Pretty much wrong about

874
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,495
All we can do is create straw man argument

875
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
Help himself

876
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:38,687
But it shows how desperate they are that there's Martian bases with slave children

877
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
So no no no no

878
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:09,151
Let it lie about it

879
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,503

883
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,743
Push back on it at all

884
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:29,887

I got it so

887
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,407
At the very least you went

888
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,247
A bunch of times

889
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,551
You didn't say that

890
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
Whatever

891
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,111
The other thing is

892
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
There are people

893
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,975
We're still getting harassed

894
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,511
Because of the rhetoric it out

895
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
The world

896
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,815
And so these articles

897
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,351
Come out are a reminder of

898
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,119
The dangers of

899
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
This rhetoric

900
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,655
Knox

People to their house

903
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
Trying to make

904
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,055
Clear that when you run with stuff like

905
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
Like this

906
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,359
You are creating a life

907
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,895
Of victimization

908
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,431
For victims of crime

909
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,967
What you're doing is

910
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,527
People who are the victims of terrorism

911
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,831
Are now living their lives

912
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
Being terrorized

913
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,439
Had to evacuate school or something like that

914
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,207
Exactly

915
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,999
On the anniversary

916
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
Because of

917
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,095
People who buy

918
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
How to put out into the world

919
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,423
Not saying

920
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
Go to their home

921
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,031
Please pay attention

922
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,055
Yep

00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
He can't handle that takes everything

924
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,151
And turns it into

925
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,711
Media lying about it when he's lying about the media

926
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
So

927
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
Who gives this

928
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,575
It's just

929
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,135
Fascinated

No I'm guess I'm just

944
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,719
Tasked with monitoring Twitter

945
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:34,047
Because of who they follow it

946
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,327
Throughout the day

Please give me too hard for my audience to look up

948
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,807

No lesson

986
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,103
0

987

00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,639
Coming from

989
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:00,735
Michael Savage

990
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
Apparently

991
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:09,439
Play Michael Savage

992
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,487

993
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,071

Prelude

999
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,503
Michael Savage being taken off the air

1000
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,551
It might be his trampolining beliefs

1001
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,831
I don't think that's the case I think

1002
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,367
Probably as s*** ratings bench

1003
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,391
Spiros hot young

1004
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:44,767

Giants fan base

1009
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,727

1010
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:59,359
Man that sucks program director

00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,447
Massive Global disorganization awful variable

Okay well if you want

1021
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527

1022
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
Twilight

1023
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:42,111
If he's parking career he is an old old man

1024
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,903
And he is also already

1025
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,183
V

1026
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,207
Multi-millionaire

1027
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,535
He's a very rich dude he's not going to be hurt

1028
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,327
Even if his radio shows

1029
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,119
He could do a podcast

1030
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
Booster rate

1031
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,895
He's probably

1032
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
Considerable

1033
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:09,503
I haven't been Shapiro I want both of them

1034
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,575
Fish tanks like in the shape of water but I would still

1035
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,879
If I was a program director I'd still be like

1036
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,695
Yeah you get this

1037
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:22,047
Attack on Savage in

1038
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,583
Pronounce

1039
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,863

00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,887
We how it plays out

1041
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,983
Destroy political

1042
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,311
All the proof

1043
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,103
Everything about who he really is

1044
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:40,479
Whole Nine Yards

1045
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,879
I'm at a stop right there Network

1046
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:54,815
Okay

1047
00:53:56,351 --> 00:54:01,471
I'm sure there's other people from back then who are also dead

1048
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:07,359
This is a number one definition of a story that I'm like I'm f******

1049
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,407
Pumped me how this plays out

1050
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,967
But I also don't care how it lands

1051
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,503
I know it's going to happen

1052
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
Is it Alex

1053
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:19,135
Step on a rake

1054
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:22,463
You going to silent

1055
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,559
He's going to make some sort of grand Overture against Ben Shapiro and then it's going to be like

1056
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,327
It's going to be

1057
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,095
So disappointing

1058
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,887
But it's not like it's new either

1059
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:33,215
Euro Cent he was trying to get Kanye West

1060
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,263
Michelle

1061
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,567
Hey Kanye

1062
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,895
Ben Shapiro

1063
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,991
Awful stupid loser

1064
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,855
He's a really smart

1065
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,623
Kids get

1066
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,391
Two grades

1067
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,695
Primary education

1068
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,023
What's college graduated from Harvard Law School

1069
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,863
Like one of the youngest

1070
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,143
People ever be published in

1071
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,007
SmartStyle

1072
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
Conservative

1073
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,151
Malcolm Gladwell

1074
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,711
I think he talks faster

1075
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,735
I don't know

1076
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,783
Maybe we should cover it some point

1077
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,855
I'm open to the possibility of it

1078
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,463
They really don't feel I don't feel any Joy when I

1079
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,511
Is that like Alex bills

1080
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,959
And also I don't know Art Bell

1081
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:43,615
Debt right

1082
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,503
Whatever

1083
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,807
Balls evolve in Alex

1084
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,343
Freelance

1085
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
Young man

1086
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,023
Coming from a Cirque

1087
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:04,607
Circumstance where you graduate 2 years early enter the world

1088
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,143
There's so much pressure on you

1089
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,423
I could see

1090
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,703
Human.

1091
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,751
Being all that happy in life

1092
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,543
And it comes out in his

1093
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:13,823
Fast pace

1094
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
Eastside Springs

1095
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:31,231
It's not fun

1096
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,303
Super fast if we just played him at 1.5 times

1097
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:38,655
Maybe I'd like him boy last

1098
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,215
Harvard Law School

1099
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,519
Hey dude you big words

1100
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
6 suck

1101
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,895
A lot of ideas

1102
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,663
Are very dumb

1103
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,943
But it's

1104
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,223
He has the good sense

1105
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,247
Be like

1106
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,295
If you go on Infowars Yorba

1107
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:58,367
Becoming part of that is not good

1108
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,183
Yeah that is something that the president would do

1109
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,999
At least he knows that on some level

1110
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:10,655
Don't go on a bitter about it

1111
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
Probably

1112
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:14,239
Before that but that was the last time it really flared up

1113
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,287
He started doing a bunch of Ben Shapiro impressions

1114
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,711
Slap fight

1115
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:24,991
I don't care

1116
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,039
Absolutely

1117
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,087
Bloody each other

1118
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:30,879
Live your life

1119
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,671
I kind of do want Kanye to go on it

1120
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,487
I think it'd be really weird

1121
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,767
I actually was

1122
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
I think it'll be

1123
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
Terribly embarrassing

1124
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:43,679
Everyone is everyone Alex Kanye

1125
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:48,031

1126
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
Be great

1127
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:54,431
Isaac as a scientific experiment I'd love to see how it plays out

1128
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:00,063
Yeah he's on a crusade Alex's against Ben Shapiro

1129
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,343
In order to do that

1130
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,111
In order to

1131
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,391
To facilitate this

1132
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,415
Crusade

1133
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,207
He has to call in again

1134
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,999
Uno's benches

1135
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,559
Known him for a long time

1136
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,375
Shapiro

1137
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,399
Is also

1138
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:27,711
Best-selling author also assure

1139
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:32,063
But I'm just like no I don't want box de anima doesn't talk show

1140
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,023
Sabotage

1141
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
Spero is

1142
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,239
The new

1143
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,775
Globalist

1144
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,055
More or less

1145
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,871
Right to comment

1146
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
Deserve it

1147
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:02,783
We read a little bit past notably because

1148
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,831
Anders Breivik

1149
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,135
Celebrate

1150
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,415
His acts of terrorism

1151
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,791
Serial killer

1152
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,727
Spero is if he's coming from

1153
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,495
The caring about

1154
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,519
Positions in policy

1155
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,823
On his blog Vox day consist

1156
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,359
We talked s*** about Shapiro

1157
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,919
Bracket

1158
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,223
6 player that white Nash

1159
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,015
When they talk about

1160
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,855
But don't want to be too overt about it

1161
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,159
Your brother know

1162
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:44,255
Traffic in Nashville

1163
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:53,983
Indicate I'm talking about this person cuz they're Jewish

1164
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,263
So Ben Shapiro Jewish

1165
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,847
Scotch

1166
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,639
Respect

1167
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,711
It is September 9th 2000

1168
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,503
Teen post on his blog

1169
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,271
Literally say

1170
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,063
Quotes

1171
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,135
Choose for what

1172
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,951
A diverse USA globalism in the left

1173
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:17,279
American nationalism in the alt right

1174
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,327
There is no other meaningful option

1175
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,287
Tries to get his point across

1176
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,311
Subtle mean

1177
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:36,991
Shapiro at WorldNetDaily

1178
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:37,759
The job because of

1179
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:41,343
His dad Robert peel who was the director of

1180
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,135
News

1181
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,695
Ic4a time

1182
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,743
Because I'm 2008 Robert

1183
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,815
Two months in prison for five counts of taxes

1184
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:04,895
Alex Jones is Peter Schiff

1185
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,479
His trial came out that Robert Beal was a member of a sovereign citizen

1186
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,527
Called common law Court

1187
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,807
It's located in Ramsey

1188
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,087
Minnesota

1189
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,623
Equally unsurprising today

1190
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,903
Back before that

1191
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,695
He was a higher up at WorldNetDaily

1192
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:20,511
Pretty clearly hooked up aspiring science

1193
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,559
Fiction authors son with a gig

1194
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,375
Which is now

1195
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,423
White nationalist

1196
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,959
So congratulations

1197
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,239
Dad nepotism

1198
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,775
Turned out very poorly

1199
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,823
Innocence

1200
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,151
Let's just give it up

1201
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:44,063
Also along the way it's really interesting that Vox Dei had a bit of a stretch Rouge trying to get into that pickup artist

1202
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:44,831
Damn money

1203
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:51,231
What are things that are in the park

1204
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:57,631
Pickup artist book about pickup Artistry artist

1205
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,935
Dave Seaman was involved in all this stuff

1206
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:06,335
Crnkovich was in gamergate all of it is the funnel that leads to all this s*** feeling entitled

1207
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,639
Everything

1208
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:12,223
Apart from any other dudes who advised Geist

1209
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:12,991
Do you like to sing

1210
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,063
Totally disrespect women so they think you're aloof

1211
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,135
Monster

1212
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:27,583
Close very close can't say no after they very close

1213
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:32,959
This is it this is like that it could be marriage

1214
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,335
September 28th 2011 post on his blog

1215
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,663
I don't believe I could recommend this is a strategy for most

1216
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,223
What is surely educational to learn that

1217
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:46,527
Killing monsters

1218
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,063
Just women than behaving like a gentle

1219
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:52,159
And women before all this inevitable Snowflake and commences

1220
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,719
Please note that there is absolutely nothing to argue about

1221
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,279
It's an established empirical fact

1222
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:02,655
He says that it's an empirical fact but the only citation to provide

1223
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:07,519
Tobacco shop at all is a link to another pick-up artist blog called Alpha Game Plan

1224
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,055
Which is just a write-up of a

1225
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,335
Posting the Daily Mail

1226
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,639
But how Japanese murder

1227
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,455
This doesn't make any

1228
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,991
It doesn't make anything and established

1229
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:17,759
Empirical

1230
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:22,111
This is just an anecdote

1231
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,927
Is that the murderer is that fan group doesn't prove anything

1232
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:27,487
To the point of it being a murderer is more attractive

1233
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,767
Women the being polite and

1234
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,327
TED hose

1235
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,911
Ted Bundy has a fanbase but right now

1236
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:42,335
Who are these people towards groups of murderer

1237
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:47,711
No I'm saying but there's a

1238
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:53,343
I think what his variable is the largest population of attractive

1239
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,623
Serial killers

1240
01:03:54,879 --> 01:04:01,023
Rapists and murderers morality

1241
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:08,191
Especially more than holding the door open that proves your f****** bettas don't want you or at Gamba

1242
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:12,031
Hammerhead in that door Hillsboro

1243
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,335
Talk about like alphys

1244
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,663
Alphas and betas

1245
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:22,527
She knows a couple more Greek letters

1246
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:25,599
Studies have been done wolf communities

1247
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,231
Ecostruxure doesn't exist in nature

1248
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,511
It only exists

1249
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,535
In

1250
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:35,839
In like

1251
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:39,167
Enclosures it only exists

1252
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,983
Natural

1253
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,055
This is how people work

1254
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,103
It's all good working prison

1255
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,895
Probably

1256
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:55,295
Evolutionary strategy

1257
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:58,111
Rapist and murderer

1258
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,159
Just based on anecdotal story

1259
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,719
Brett has nothing to do with empirical

1260
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
For longtime Vox day

1261
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,327
Masquerading

1262
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,863
Anyways

1263
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,679
Because we talked about like Howie's in Mensa

1264
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,471
Irrespective science

1265
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,751
But all he's ever done is

1266
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,335
To repackage overtly white supremacist

1267
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,871
It dangerously misogynist

1268
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
Mystic narrative

1269
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
All in all

1270
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
My point is

1271
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:27,039
This dude's a piece of s*** and he's exactly who you would expect Alex to still be hanging out

1272
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,087
At this point in his boxing career

1273
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,111
8

1274
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:30,879
Crazy

1275
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,647
Fox

1276
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,415
The worst

1277
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,439
Like I've taken

1278
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,975
Can a couple of these things

1279
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,511
If you go read this blog you'll fine

1280
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,279
F******

1281
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,583
Atrociously worded statement

1282
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,703
That's that

1283
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:51,103
That's not okay. Okay

1284
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,175
He was trying to make about the idea of like white supremacy isn't

1285
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,223
It's not that

1286
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
Whites are

1287
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
Better

1288
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,295
Than any other race

1289
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,319
But

1290
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:07,999
White white people are the only people who are willing to stand up for the preservation of westerns

1291
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,047
Society

1292
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:13,375
No matter what race you are you should be in favor of white nationalism

1293
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,143
Okay

1294
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:20,543
Let's be a lesbian party

1295
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:24,895
Hey how you doing

1296
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,455
No reason to role-play that

1297
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,991
Stay forever

1298
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,015
On that episode

1299
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,367
We jump in

1300
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,671
We're going to get some

1301
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,439
Fleming here

1302
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:38,975
Unspeakable

1303
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:40,767
Alex

1304
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,559
Address to the Rodger Stone

1305
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,583
Sing I guess but it was just

1306
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:49,727
I wasn't everything we're doing everything right

1307
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,287
Expected

1308
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,591
But it turns out it was worth

1309
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
Possibly could have imagined

1310
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:02,783
Infowars.com

1311
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,879
Clubs at night

1312
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:10,719
But

1313
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:15,327
Video Heat

1314
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:20,191
About how she's part of the lgbtq

1315
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:25,055
What nice

1316
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:36,319
Was already there

1317
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:42,463
Great song called Girl Scout

1318
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,511
No no that was

1319
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,559
Different Ted Nugent

1320
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:57,055
City Council

1321
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,335
Give them to us

1322
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,759
Snorting ketamine

1323
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:09,343
What is the drug that people take to go to transfer

1324
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,951
We'll get into that video here in a little

1325
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,583
He's too f****** cool

1326
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,351
Call Dan

1327
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
Yeah

1328
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,447
Abundantly

1329
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
Play clear by my

1330
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,031
Regardless

1331
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,823
No matter where you fall on it

1332
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,127
Even if you're on Alex's side

1333
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
Indefensible

1334
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,247
Here's what I mean

1335
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:40,319
In their post on their website the sub-headline

1336
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,599
About this story

1337
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:45,695
Adult patrons throw money at male child dressed like a s***

1338
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,559
Play currently

1339
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,607
That is unbelievably like

1340
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:56,959
Dress like a s***

1341
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,567
So even though the kid question is inspiring artist

1342
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,359
Website

1343
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:06,687
I find it particularly distasteful that Alex posted a picture of him

1344
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,991
And their real name on the website

1345
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
And it's article

1346
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,295
Is there angle is if it's

1347
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:15,135
Child to bring possible attention or attacks their way

1348
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,415
The only way this

1349
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,487
It's the only way

1350
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:22,559
They're trying to make this eleven-year-old

1351
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,351
Which is exactly what they wanted

1352
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,959
Because this drag artist known as Desmond is amazing is a fairly popular LG

1353
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,799
With over 100,000 followers on

1354
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:36,639
They're only 11 years old

1355
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,943
Give a s***

1356
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,967
About the ID

1357
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:45,855
He's going to try and play up the idea that I care about the victimization gear

1358
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,391
He would have dealt with this differ

1359
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:50,975
He wouldn't have allowed of headline dress like a flood

1360
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,743
He wouldn't have

1361
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:52,767
A picture

1362
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,303
Of this

1363
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,327
And on his website

1364
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,607
You wouldn't have done

1365
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,631
This isn't

1366
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,911
On this kid

1367
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:02,751
Not on the idea that globalist

1368
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,543
Adult man

1369
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,615
Hayes now stalking alien 11

1370
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:11,455
Writing songs

1371
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:14,015
Yeah wasn't

1372
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,343
He was doing a routine based on a Gwen Stefani song

1373
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
So he used

1374
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,391
Gwen Stefani

1375
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,951
Central you know like those baggy pants

1376
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:30,399
The other white undershirt at your high school

1377
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,935
School talent show doing

1378
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,727
Ifucking Gwen Stefani

1379
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:37,823
In order to prop up his argument attacking a child whose life

1380
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:41,919
It is article Alex didn't write the article but

1381
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,199
He's responsible for every

1382
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,271
Salazar's article

1383
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:52,927
They almost exclusively use just quotes from a random Anonymous comments on a subreddit call doordash

1384
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,695
Trashy

1385
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,999
Journalistic

1386
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:00,351
All these people saying all this is horrible on a

1387
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
Trashy

1388
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,143
This is nonsense

1389
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,191
Anonymous

1390
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,471
Comments

1391
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,751
All the other

1392
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,543
This article against

1393
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,407
For places like louder with Crowder

1394
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,455
Revolve around the idea that Desmond

1395
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,735
Performance was sexual

1396
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,527
When there's no indication that's

1397
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,295
The case at all

1398
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,879
It's Alex and louder with Crowder that's projecting sex

1399
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:26,207
I'll do what is ostensibly a youth doing a lipstick performance

1400
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,743
Or karaoke

1401
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,279
In the case of

1402
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:33,119
I quit the one I watched was definitely a lipstick but I

1403
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,167
Extend the possibility that

1404
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
Anime singing

1405
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,751
Butler Tire

1406
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
All right on

1407
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,287
Send it

1408
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,359
Here's what I'm hearing

1409
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,151
Out of all of this.

1410
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,943
Is that Alex's

1411
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,967
Is real issue

1412
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,247
And so many of these guys

1413
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,271
Fuel issue

1414
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,831
Has nothing to do with

1415
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:54,879
Sexualizing

1416
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,647
Kids

1417
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,671
And more with

1418
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:57,695
Kids

1419
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,231
Like this guy

1420
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,023
Confusing

1421
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:06,143
Like for them it for them they're looking at it like a reason that he's

1422
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,471
Dress like a s*** is his confusion his confusion is like

1423
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,543
Why are you making me want to f***

1424
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,823
I don't understand

1425
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,615
What's going on baby

1426
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:19,711
That's f***** up maybe something is f***** that might be

1427
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:23,039
Too much to put on Alex or whatever

1428
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:24,831
If possible

1429
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:25,599
Who knows

1430
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:28,159
I think more the confusion comes

1431
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,695
From him seeing this

1432
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,487
Is an attack on masculinity

1433
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,511
And stuff like that

1434
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,559
I think he has

1435
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,583
Different

1436
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,143
Cordello's

1437
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,167
That's f*****

1438
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:43,519
Alex gets really ambitious

1439
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,735
F*** you

1440
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,063
Illustrates that

1441
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:05,023
About the forces that were facing there's no doubt about the endgame

1442
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:14,239
As we started there is

1443
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,519
Every culture

1444
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
He's a bucket

1445
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,759
He's talking about

1446
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,319
He's going to try and bring in like the idea of like

1447
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,367
South America

1448
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
Child sacrifice

1449
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:33,951
There's a bunch of

1450
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,975
Hold on hold on

1451
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,511
So f****** serious

1452
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,815
Headlines.com

1453
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,823
So this is the other piece of

1454
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:53,151
Performing at the club

1455
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:53,919
$3 bill

1456
01:13:54,687 --> 01:14:00,831
Queer as a $3 bill

1457
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,855
Stop pedaling

1458
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:06,719
They're pieces of this a better bunch of nonsense

1459
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:09,791
1

1460
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,327
It's not just

1461
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:19,263
Regularly

1462
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,311
New York Comedy Festival

1463
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,639
Deal out of the idea that this is

1464
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,407
The kid in the bar

1465
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,711
But also Destiny was there as a performer

1466
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:31,807
12 year old kid

1467
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,343
Who was allowed into bars

1468
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:36,415
Because he was there to perform and he was there

1469
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:39,487
YouTube jokes about his mom was a flood and stuff you wouldn't

1470
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,023
Expect child to say was wrong

1471
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:48,191
It was kind of kind of lame

1472
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
Jules and Desmond

1473
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,239
Yeah so

1474
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,031
I was going to give a s*** about that

1475
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,079
I don't care about the idea

1476
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:59,199
Spell everybody around you doesn't know of at least like

1477
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:03,039
We will evolve into at least 10 shows where it's like

1478
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:06,623
Really they're going to do a twelve-year-old and then the twelve-year-old does well and you're like

1479
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:14,559
F*** your dad wrote that

1480
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
12

1481
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:26,847
Just trying to do

1482
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,151
He's trying to make it like

1483
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,431
He was in a bar and that's

1484
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,199
Wrong

1485
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,223
Not really wrong

1486
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,903
That's crazy and then the other thing

1487
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,439
Is Alex's unwell

1488
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,767
Separate the idea of

1489
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:47,583
Gay bar being a sexual place

1490
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,375
Hakeem to a strip club

1491
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,911
Annie Bakes

1492
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,679
Repeatedly

1493
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:52,959
Really f******

1494
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,287
Hispanic girl in a topless bar

1495
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,663
No

1496
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:14,207
See I think it's more about the masculinity than it is about anything else

1497
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,743
I think that is where he

1498
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,023
Desire is getting up

1499
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:20,095
Because it feeds into somebody the narratives that he

1500
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,631
He's talked about forever

1501
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,399
Where is this idea

1502
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,727
What most of his product line is

1503
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,519
Fear of losing your

1504
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
Vitality

1505
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,335
It should like that so I

1506
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:33,663
Dishonest

1507
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,711
Absolutely if you brought an 11 year old girls

1508
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,783
To a strip club and they were doing a strip

1509
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:42,111
Kezar

1510
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:48,511
That would be illegal if they were just up there to be all gold

1511
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
Creepy dude

1512
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,351
Yeah yes

1513
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,519
We've already got lost

1514
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,543
Yeah yeah

1515
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:04,383
The false equivalence

1516
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,919
Gay bars the same

1517
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
Strip club

1518
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,455
Because

1519
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:11,807
Gay bars

1520
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:18,207
No it's not a group of people has gone to regular bars

1521
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,231
So f***

1522
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,535
Longs and have been discriminated against

1523
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,071
Have been assaulted

1524
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,607
Have been f***** with n

1525
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,399
Unceasing

1526
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:29,471
Sing regularity so much so that they created their own space

1527
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,007
Finally they have their own

1528
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,311
And even though they have their own f******

1529
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:39,199
Space where they feel safe and comfortable if you have to somehow try and marginalize them still further

1530
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:52,255
Don't you would like something like for his b******* like he probably goes to some f*** Barbershop where it's like

1531
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,375
F*** you you're a f******

1532
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,911
Rico's shooting

1533
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,727
Yeah you go shooting to know what shooting ranges are for

1534
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:05,567
Dude f****** themselves Alex Jones

1535
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,335
Done

1536
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,175
Right

1537
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,991
It makes no sense

1538
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,527
Reductio ad absurdum

1539
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,319
Another circumstance

1540
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:18,879
Using his same line of thinking to point out the

1541
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
He's coming

1542
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,303
Places

1543
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,863
He feels it's just

1544
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,631
Certified

1545
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,655
Because this kid

1546
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
Jasmine

1547
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,727
Has revealed in a video

1548
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
The pedophiles

1549
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,287
Are part of

1550
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,871
Video with his mother

1551
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,175
Is reported

1552
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,415
You're really doing a great job.

1553
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:00,607
Even if they did

1554
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:07,007
Kids in the schools

1555
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,055
It's all part of a larger plan

1556
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:12,895
So the actual video here in a little bit

1557
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,759
Much more f***** up

1558
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:18,527
Then even you going to

1559
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,551
At this point

1560
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,855
But Alex thinks he's been

1561
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,159
Alex

1562
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,207
In his video that he has

1563
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,487
50 years apart

1564
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,791
I've been saying that all along

1565
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,839
I've been demonizing lgbtq

1566
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:34,911
80 Community by saying that piece is at the end of it

1567
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,679
And now

1568
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,703
I'm right

1569
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,495
Isn't that amazing

1570
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:40,799
It's not amazing

1571
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:41,823
He's wrong

1572
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,359
He's also

1573
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,151
Desperate

1574
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,967
We are fabulously successful

1575
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:54,111
Undertale attack and it is a symbol of our

1576
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:09,471
I need it

1577
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,360
Going to need your money

1578
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:27,392
Situation

1579
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,672
Long after it's dead

1580
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,512
We can stay

1581
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,584
Here for a long time and hopefully

1582
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:39,936
He wants to be on that horse wants to stay around

1583
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,264
Desperate

1584
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,032
The first segment

1585
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:48,128
A lot of focus to it

1586
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:48,896
Indicate

1587
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:52,480
Like I need you to think this means something

1588
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,528
Christmas sales are still going

1589
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,832
And if you get before midnight tonight

1590
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:00,160
You just f****** order ton of stuff before Christmas

1591
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,184
Your house music

1592
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:07,328
We're on our 300 39th

1593
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:12,448
Today of their Christmas to you need for your children

1594
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,472
Dr. pepper

1595
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,896
But you also

1596
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,456
To get really interested

1597
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:25,760
My time is up

1598
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:28,320
The hope we could destroy do we get destroyed

1599
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,600
He says something very

1600
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:41,376
We're looking at that we're bleeding

1601
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:48,032
And John bush

1602
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,848
So the two people that he listed as martyrs

1603
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,872
Compare

1604
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,896
John Birch

1605
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,176
Soldier

1606
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,480
Robert Welsh

1607
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,016
The founder of

1608
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,808
Names

1609
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,624
Do you

1610
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,464
You would not be cool with that propaganda

1611
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,232
Virtualized

1612
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,768
Supposed first

1613
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,304
Victim of the Cold War

1614
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,840
Stuff like that in order to

1615
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,680
And I'll be like a symbolic martyr for these

1616
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,960
Chinese propaganda

1617
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,288
No idea

1618
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:24,384
Remember how back when the president of the John Birch Society was on Alex's show and I told

1619
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:28,480
Robert Welch

1620
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:35,136
Robert Welsh was the first President John Birch Society was replaced

1621
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,672
Is President because the new president was

1622
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,464
The plane was shot down by the Soviet

1623
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,280
That was McDonald's I was like

1624
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,816
Scotch and before you start setting

1625
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,608
Being shot down by the Soviets

1626
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:48,960
Sort of proof of a communist plot a plane that deviated from their flight path and wanted to

1627
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:50,240
Prohibited Soviet airspace

1628
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:52,032
I'm definitely not defending shooting

1629
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:52,800
Playing down

1630
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:58,944
It's the wrong way to handle things

1631
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,528
Now some fun facts about Larry McDonald

1632
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,856
Is member of the House representing George's 1975.

1633
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,648
1983

1634
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,464
The American Journal political science

1635
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,280
Conservative member of both

1636
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,560
Houses of Congress

1637
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,584
Between 19

1638
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,608
37 in

1639
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,376
2002

1640
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,168
Who's number one

1641
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:21,728
Ron Paul

1642
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:25,312
He was in office was a member of the McCarthy sound

1643
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,360
Expression of admiration for Joseph

1644
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,128
McCarthy

1645
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:32,480
He co-sponsored a bill advocated that homosexuals and never be given to equal rights which

1646
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,248
You phrased as

1647
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,040
Special consideration

1648
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,856
He fought against the establishment of the Martin Luther King

1649
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,928
Bring back

1650
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,232
Has to be explained

1651
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:46,304
Seeing as he was a member of the Austrian School and the mutants

1652
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,864
Introduce bills

1653
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,424
Polish the Federal

1654
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:55,264
Really really stupid you shouldn't be allowed to call yourself in

1655
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,336
Like there should be a rule against

1656
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:02,944
If you're so stupidly f****** wrong you just have to call yourself like

1657
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:09,600
The folks the mummies folks let's work on that for later

1658
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:18,048
Nothing's going to be the next bill that I introduced these potential destruction

1659
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,072
Similar to

1660
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:23,680
Propaganda murder of the John Birch Society

1661
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,984
And the second President of the John Birch

1662
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,752
Society

1663
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,288
Who was in the plane that got shot

1664
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,592
Alex loves the John Birch

1665
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,640
So he doesn't talk about it all that much

1666
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,176
Clearly the fact

1667
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:40,576
I am her to bring up Larry McDonald but it came out real f****** smooth and he was looking for martyrs

1668
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,624
Translate

1669
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,160
To come out of his mouth

1670
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,440
It's very clear

1671
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,208
Very clear

1672
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,512
Really stupid

1673
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,560
I should also

1674
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:51,584
At this point

1675
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,352
How stupid he is

1676
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,960
He goes down

1677
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,240
Very funny

1678
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,776
He goes down this line

1679
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,384
Whenever

1680
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:08,736
That's the sign that the city

1681
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:14,880
Just on the top

1682
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:20,768
So ever possibly be more indicative of wanting to sacrifice a child

1683
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:25,376
Then f****** going after a child and making sure that all of your

1684
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,400
Speechless

1685
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:33,056
F****** trolls slam down upon them in a little bit

1686
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
First

1687
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,104
Alex's got to get it

1688
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,408
Select

1689
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,200
Accordingly

1690
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:53,024
That is.

1691
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:55,840
Empire span 620

1692
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,656
3 years from 1222

1693
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,960
The Khmer Empire in Cambodia license

1694
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:01,984
30 years

1695
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,008
8022

1696
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
The 14th

1697
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,544
32

1698
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,080
The Ethiopian Empire last

1699
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,360
1270

1700
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,432
35 and only fell because it was invaded by

1701
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,504
The Kush empire in modern Sudan

1702
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,552
I went from 1070b

1703
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,320
Bce-t

1704
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,344
358

1705
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,136
I wasn't saying anything

1706
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:19,904
Civilization

1707
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,232
200 300 years

1708
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,512
This is complete b*******

1709
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,816
He's just using this nonsensical

1710
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:31,168
Statistic he's pulling out of thin air in order to present the idea that we're in the end

1711
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,216
We haven't even yours

1712
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:39,616
Haven't even Define civilization civilization

1713
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,176
Empires last

1714
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,624
Like refuting

1715
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:58,304
I'm I'm just saying that even even then you know like so let's go with Chinese civilization

1716
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:07,520
Weird

1717
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,592
Longer than three

1718
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:15,456
But the people were still the f****** people

1719
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,576
Archaeology rental the problem

1720
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:25,696
He knows nothing if you ever studied basic archaeology or anthropology

1721
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:30,048
Please call me because I haven't and I'm going to say dumb s*** and I'm not going to use

1722
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,072
Real

1723
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:31,840
Specific

1724
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,376
Sony launches back in

1725
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,936
I've listened to this

1726
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,496
I think I know what he saying

1727
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,032
But it's so weird

1728
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,336
I find it hard to

1729
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,104
To believe that

1730
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,384
The keys making Des Arc

1731
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:51,552
Flashlight

1732
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:04,608
Azar built

1733
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:08,704
What was the priest before the temple

1734
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:15,104
Little boys and girls

1735
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:31,232
For the sexualisation of children

1736
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:45,824
Tourism of Sheldon

1737
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:56,320
Will tell you

1738
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:04,256
It's so strange to me that the argument that in tell me if I'm wrong

1739
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:10,400
Cats tell me if I'm wrong.

1740
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,680
There isn't a whole lot

1741
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,984
Right

1742
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,264
Is that the Chinese

1743
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,800
Is the trichomes at work

1744
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:19,104
Are promoting pedophilic movie

1745
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,128
Right

1746
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:20,896
The LG

1747
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,200
What have you

1748
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:27,040
Sure

1749
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,720
They know they know they

1750
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:37,280
300 years and it's about time

1751
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,560
For depriest

1752
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,352
Class to start demanding

1753
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:44,960
Tupac children in public the destruction of America

1754
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:51,360
I really think that's the argument that he's making

1755
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:55,200
That's crazy cuz he just just that

1756
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,552
Because

1757
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,832
The Chinese

1758
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:08,000
2000 years later in his own argument

1759
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,280
They're like

1760
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,048
Hold on

1761
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,376
We'll fund

1762
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,400
Priest-class

1763
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:16,960
Right cuz I remember when that happened to us

1764
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,496
I guess

1765
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,128
Absurd

1766
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,992
So our civilization wouldn't collapse

1767
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,184
Knows that the only way

1768
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,208
Stabilization

1769
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:43,328
This is crazy

1770
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,096
I think we've seen

1771
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,424
I never would have guessed

1772
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,240
Bananas

1773
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,520
I think that he thinks

1774
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:55,104
He thinks that the Chinese are paying people to f*** kids in public

1775
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,384
No

1776
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,920
They're paying

1777
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,456
I guess

1778
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,224
LGB

1779
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:03,040
Folks to advocate for their own right

1780
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,320
Which Alex

1781
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,880
Speed of the normalization of pedophilia

1782
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,184
Because they think they

1783
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:09,952
That will leave

1784
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,744
Destruction of America

1785
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:17,376
Which which of these were funding lgbtq

1786
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:21,216
It's the

1787
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:25,056
There are are

1788
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:32,736
Water inferential problem it's the mess

1789
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:36,320
That's the kind of thing

1790
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,088
Just gone

1791
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,880
If you have the Barney stop that

1792
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:44,768
If you get out of here

1793
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,304
So at this point

1794
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:49,632
Intellectualize into things

1795
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,008
He said the words

1796
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,568
Ergo

1797
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:04,736
Appealed to your intelligent mind

1798
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,064
Museum funding

1799
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,392
Hacking a child

1800
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,208
Is

1801
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:15,744
Next Level batting

1802
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,536
But it's also fun

1803
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:21,376
Because I know from everything I've seen about this kid Desmond is awesome

1804
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:22,400
That

1805
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,960
You wouldn't care at all

1806
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,728
But Alex

1807
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,520
Petty petty Bowl

1808
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:29,312
So I take some solace

1809
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,592
But at the same time

1810
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
This is really

1811
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:34,688
Address for slipping really bad

1812
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:39,552
Story of this podcast

1813
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
As a bar

1814
01:32:56,704 --> 01:33:01,312
Lego sorry

1815
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:07,968
This is a personal story story

1816
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,992
You talk about you

1817
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,784
Yeah probably did that happen

1818
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:16,160
New York law that says the people under 21 can enter a bar

1819
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:21,536
The bar self-imposed which is

1820
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,584
That's why bars can have eight

1821
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,864
Plus night for concert

1822
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:27,168
There is no law that says

1823
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:28,192
You can't come in

1824
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,728
Generally speaking

1825
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:34,848
State-by-state but if the bar serves food they can have any age people in there

1826
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:35,616
They just

1827
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:37,152
Cancer people under 21

1828
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,480
Specific language

1829
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,248
S*******

1830
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:44,576
He says places where there's a dolt entertainment going on

1831
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:46,880
Berkeley says because

1832
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:47,648
Cuz you think

1833
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,416
Adult

1834
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,184
Attainment

1835
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,208
Adult

1836
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:53,280
Logan over this point

1837
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,816
He's trying to pretend that this

1838
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,608
Strip club

1839
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,888
It's not it's just

1840
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,656
Spaghetti space

1841
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,680
Did he deems

1842
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,704
Intrinsically safe

1843
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,776
And that is f***** up

1844
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,336
He just sexualizes everything

1845
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:12,736
And it's a really it's a really lame has a bar

1846
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,832
Anyway I miss my squad.

1847
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,600
Insult

1848
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:18,624
Jasmine

1849
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:31,424
Completely

1850
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,984
You are acting like

1851
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,776
Disgraceful pile of

1852
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,080
Here's the idea that you would say

1853
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:40,384
This is an emaciated kid who looks like a

1854
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,152
The crackhead

1855
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:41,920
Why the

1856
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,688
Buckwheat

1857
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,456
Do that

1858
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:44,736
What what

1859
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:49,600
Ankle does that serve for what he wants to achieve

1860
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,904
Anything other than attacking this

1861
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:55,488
That's the only thing that makes sense out of this rhetoric

1862
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,512
Yep

1863
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,280
Now

1864
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,304
I told you we get to

1865
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,328
Nothing

1866
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,888
And this is Mike down clip

1867
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,936
This is where Alex actually plays

1868
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,704
The video

1869
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,728
He's been talkin

1870
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,264
About

1871
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,288
Let Desmond

1872
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:12,384
Comes out and says that is the lgbtq

1873
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,944
Yeah but you just

1874
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:20,832
F*** office

1875
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,624
Now there's an entry

1876
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,904
Dynamic going on in

1877
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,952
This video and you'll pick up on it immediately

1878
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:27,232
I guarantee

1879
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,768
Everyone listening

1880
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,792
Will pick up on it

1881
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,816
Immediately

1882
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,608
Alex is pretending that

1883
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,680
He's not a play

1884
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,704
In order for him to

1885
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,472
To demonize

1886
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:39,520
Anyway

1887
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,288
Completely disgrace

1888
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,568
And I'm certain

1889
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,848
Because our listeners

1890
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,152
And you are just hit head

1891
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,176
You'll see through this

1892
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,992
Here is

1893
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:58,720
About ketamine

1894
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:06,656
Everywhere Engineers bag

1895
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,360
Female female

1896
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,128
Any

1897
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:16,896
Arnon

1898
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,176
Only us

1899
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:21,248
People can have

1900
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:25,600
That's not true at all

1901
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:43,776
Is this

1902
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,312
Jeep gas

1903
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:50,432
1234

1904
01:36:57,856 --> 01:37:02,208
How old is your BF

1905
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,072
So the woman

1906
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:17,568
You do know it's not child

1907
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,248
Mom here

1908
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,808
When you can't tell there's so much makeup on The Other Woman

1909
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:31,392
And the mother is so proud of how great this is

1910
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:37,024
Schools

1911
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,072
Cuz Alex f****** knows better

1912
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:42,144
Like his interviews with that Faith lived their lives

1913
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:45,728
You know like the mom and Desmond both has lived their lives

1914
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,336
Feel the same way a lot of those

1915
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:52,128
Creepy stage moms

1916
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:56,736
Maybe there's a tiny element of it possibility

1917
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,016
But there's some of that there

1918
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,576
I saw with them

1919
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,624
It was very clear that Desmond was

1920
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,440
Expressing I'm so grateful that I have a mother who

1921
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,208
Except

1922
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:09,536
This thing that's been a part of me as long as I remembered it

1923
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,304
And the bomb

1924
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,584
Is bad

1925
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,376
That's

1926
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,656
To do I love my kid

1927
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,192
They would know their life

1928
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,032
Then we'll get back to what was going on

1929
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:23,616
The question is how much more of this

1930
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,408
Society and culture

1931
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:37,952
Involved in drug culture

1932
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:41,536
Signalling involved

1933
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:49,216
Only Fallen

1934
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:55,360
So I would like you to say what was going on in there

1935
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:57,920
That video

1936
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,712
You know what was going on

1937
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,016
I

1938
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,576
I think wait we allow the time

1939
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:05,856
But I really

1940
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:13,024
I think it's important to make that is one of them

1941
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:16,096
It's very clear that what's going on here is they're doing the lives

1942
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:25,312
Alex inspiringly

1943
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:29,408
Ironically

1944
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:36,832
Galaxy

1945
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,648
Indicative

1946
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:41,696
Like I don't know if other right-wing

1947
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:43,744
People are using that acronym

1948
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:50,656
He made it the person was doing that because they were inspired by Alex

1949
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:52,960
So what is this second

1950
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,240
Being

1951
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:56,800
11 year old

1952
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,848
The eleven-year-old reading it

1953
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:01,920
Saying I don't know what that means or other person

1954
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:03,200
I don't know what that means

1955
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,504
Then Alex then using

1956
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:08,576
They said lgbtq I've been right all along

1957
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:11,904
It's a f****** answered and then you heard in there very clearly

1958
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,440
1488

1959
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:17,280
Someone was that Hitler was right comes up a number of times

1960
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,072
Yep

1961
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,888
Helicopter rides yay

1962
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:26,240
That response came because Desmond thought it was a reference to taking a ride in a helicopter

1963
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,264
Not reference

1964
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,288
How Pinochet

1965
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:32,128
Used to take his political Rivals and helicopters and throw them out to murder them

1966
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,408
In recent months

1967
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,944
The theme of offering liberals

1968
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,504
Helicopter ride

1969
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,784
Mickey way for Trump supporters

1970
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,576
Kill their political rivals

1971
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,368
Without the risk of actually saying it

1972
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,416
And it's video that Alex has posted

1973
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:46,976
Clear evidence of

1974
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:51,584
Coronavirus child as well as overt death breath

1975
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:54,400
Weirdly Houston

1976
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:57,472
And the article that he wrote

1977
01:40:57,728 --> 01:41:00,544
It has

1978
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,872
It's not used to being hurled at an eleven-year-old

1979
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:04,896
It's because our

1980
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:05,920
Looks likes that sort

1981
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,736
The real abuse that Desmond will face

1982
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,784
In life is going to come from people like Alex

1983
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,320
Not for people who allowed

1984
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,600
To pursue whatever version of

1985
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,368
Personal truth

1986
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,928
The fact that Alex wants to

1987
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:17,952
The targeting of Desmet

1988
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,488
You couldn't be clearer

1989
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,072
Didn't the last line that article

1990
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:26,400
This will likely not be the last we hear of Desmond

1991
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:27,168
Does Alaska

1992
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,472
Used to push its demoralizing pedophilic

1993
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,032
So

1994
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,360
Here is just a video where

1995
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,640
People were really

1996
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:38,688
And is very heavily edited

1997
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:40,224
Who knows what else

1998
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,504
What's going on in that livestream

1999
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:43,296
But it's an edit

2000
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:47,392
11 year old not understanding that Nazis are saying horrible things

2001
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:50,720
And then just reading off the screen

2002
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:56,608
I don't know her cold read that's not bad

2003
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,632
That's not bad

2004
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:08,128
Take a listen to cold reading skills in the past operation

2005
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:11,968
Reader is Alex

2006
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:16,576
So we see this here this is Alex's soda pf2 Resistol

2007
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:20,416
In terms of its narrative and you see where it's coming from and it's b*******

2008
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,464
All he's doing is trying to

2009
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:23,488
Target out of

2010
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:24,256
The child

2011
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,792
Works best for his narrative

2012
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,072
And it

2013
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,400
Jasmine didn't say there's a

2014
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,168
Do you know GB

2015
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,216
Confused

2016
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:35,776
Reading as I understand it

2017
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,848
He is the preferred pronoun

2018
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:40,128
Is gender fluid

2019
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,432
But all the articles that I read

2020
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:47,808
That in that lion I don't know if I'm using the wrong pronoun I apologize

2021
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,088
But that seems to be the way

2022
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,368
I-it's

2023
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:51,136
It shakes out

2024
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:51,904
But

2025
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,952
All this is just the worst

2026
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,720
He's the worst

2027
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:58,560
So at this point break come back

2028
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,352
Alex Guzman studio anymore

2029
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,848
The worst job of covering the same

2030
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:11,616
Topic

2031
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:16,992
It would be considered inappropriate

2032
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,784
Child abuse but if it's

2033
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,624
Surrounding the

2034
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:24,416
Topic or the

2035
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:29,024
Aren't they say of drag culture

2036
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,144
Or transsexualism then it's okay you're not allowed to talk about it

2037
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:37,984
Shock impact

2038
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:42,336
So

2039
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:44,640
But if you don't like to

2040
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:48,736
You know abused your kids psychologically and you like to take care of your kids health

2041
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:54,368
We got your back,

2042
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,720
Oh my God walking you up

2043
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,792
Isn't it amazing that like that

2044
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:03,328
Becca

2045
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:10,496
You do it

2046
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:11,520
Owen

2047
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:17,664
Knock yourself very long cause

2048
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:21,248
And then just said if you don't want to abuse your children by ourself

2049
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,528
Which

2050
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,344
You are

2051
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,112
F******

2052
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,928
George user

2053
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:35,328
We have to make a fine distinction.

2054
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,352
Negative

2055
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,656
What they're doing is not necessary

2056
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,448
Abusive in nature

2057
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:46,080
Precipitates the abuse of children

2058
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:49,152
If you don't know you don't know

2059
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:51,200
Then I get your point

2060
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:55,552
If you don't know that what you're doing is going to directly lead

2061
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,344
To be f****** abuse

2062
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,624
Of a child

2063
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:01,696
Then I get that you might just be facilitating

2064
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:02,720
Zaino

2065
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:08,352
They know God damn well that what they are saying is leading to a child being abused

2066
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:15,008
That is that is like saying that a general doesn't kill anybody because he all he does is put true

2067
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,432
General does direct

2068
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,712
Flow

2069
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:24,736
Troops are going

2070
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:25,760
They're just

2071
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:30,368
I know it's a fine distinction it's just the

2072
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:35,744
It's just to say I do

2073
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,768
Purposely

2074
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:38,048
Deliberately

2075
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,328
Abusing children

2076
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:43,168
That should be a literal crime

2077
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,704
What they just did

2078
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:47,520
Should be a literal crime

2079
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:49,568
I am frustrated

2080
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:52,640
I'm frustrated too but I also don't think that

2081
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,664
Create a better world

2082
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,016
Real f*****-up implicate

2083
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:04,160
You don't get to direct yours

2084
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,696
Millions of followers

2085
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,488
To scream at a child

2086
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,560
They could hide behind whatever they've done

2087
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,584
Asthma

2088
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:14,656
Attacked

2089
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,424
This kid

2090
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:19,520
Facetious

2091
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:25,920
Care about the quote-unquote victims you can hide behind any kind of couch language

2092
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:27,456
That you want and still

2093
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,736
Do the exact same

2094
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:30,528
You would have the same effect

2095
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,088
Getting around whatever

2096
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,624
You'd end up in a really nebulous

2097
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,672
Place where you would end up

2098
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,720
You end up having to like

2099
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,256
So

2100
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:44,352
Worth it

2101
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:46,400
Ongoing and never-ending argument

2102
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,168
About

2103
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,448
How

2104
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,216
You

2105
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,752
Discern bad faith Act

2106
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,312
In a legal sense

2107
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,592
Which I get

2108
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,128
I get no real

2109
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,152
I get that

2110
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:04,832
I'm not saying that I'm going to write the law I'm not saying that I have some sort of ability to police this in a

2111
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:09,440
That makes sense or that it is even possible but from a moral standpoint

2112
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:14,304
Those guys are abusing children

2113
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,072
Desmond

2114
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:16,608
His parents probably have

2115
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:18,400
Some decent

2116
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:21,216
What is libel action

2117
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:26,080
Like this 11 year old

2118
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,360
Is

2119
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:29,664
The pedophiles are apart of the LG

2120
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:31,712
Stuff like that

2121
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:33,760
I think that there is probably

2122
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:35,296
Some sort of Grievous damage

2123
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,320
They could be argue

2124
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:37,856
I think there's a

2125
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:40,416
Terms of outlawing

2126
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:41,696
I think you're just

2127
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:44,256
Not you but I think one would be chasing their own

2128
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,120
I totally get it

2129
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,656
Maybe some sort of civil action

2130
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,424
Could be a pro

2131
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:53,984
That is

2132
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:57,824
I wanted to lie about us so bad

2133
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,104
He knows better

2134
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:05,248
I wanted to lie about it so bad I want to have for every goddamn nose

2135
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:10,880
Owens hosting

2136
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,184
Italics

2137
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,464
Turns out

2138
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:17,280
He said why at the beginning of the show and I just haven't

2139
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:19,584
Owen Shroyer coming in

2140
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:30,080
Throughout the transmission today

2141
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:49,024
So

2142
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:51,840
Alex is gone

2143
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,144
I can't even explain

2144
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:57,728
Just listen to

2145
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,008
Just listening to that

2146
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:05,408
He interviews Leo zagami that's f****** weirdo

2147
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:11,552
Illuminati Insider in

2148
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:15,392
Test

2149
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:18,976
Actually

2150
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:23,328
His spinning a weird narrative about the idea

2151
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:27,168
Brazil is great

2152
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:33,568
Master do if you don't like the people love murderers.

2153
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,592
Weird

2154
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:41,248
Vatican is killing and raping everybody but this guy who has killed

2155
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:43,296
Raped a bunch of people

2156
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:45,088
It's weird it's weird that all these

2157
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:45,856
People have this

2158
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,976
And you might think that's an offensive Italian

2159
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:54,816
If you would play Leo's Agaves

2160
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:57,632
You're at you're a little bit of Lupron

2161
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:06,848
Venturing a little far from the countryside are not far off

2162
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,664
So Alex comes back

2163
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,712
I think he pulled a

2164
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:13,760
But I'm not sure

2165
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:16,320
Listen to this and see if you think this is a prank

2166
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:17,600
I think it

2167
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:25,280
And Alex Jones back with us

2168
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,840
What happened today

2169
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:34,496
I knew turned Frank I think it was

2170
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:40,384
Hillary lawyer

2171
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:46,784
Lost power in the only way

2172
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:53,440
Play always knowing that his mic is off

2173
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:55,488
He's a great guy to work for Dad

2174
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:57,280
Damn do you want to do

2175
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,816
Do you want another office

2176
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:08,288
We like to have fun

2177
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:14,176
I'm certain that the prank it has to be right

2178
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:20,576
There's no other explanation for that there's no other

2179
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:22,112
Purpose

2180
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,648
Take it away.

2181
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,696
And a little

2182
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:29,536
We like to have fun around here

2183
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:35,168
Yeah

2184
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:37,984
It brings me joy

2185
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:43,616
Will headquarters and Alex Jones is back with us

2186
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:46,176

Put upon band

2188

First f****** time

2189
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,696
Look I am

2190
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:00,000
15 years younger than you

2191
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:01,024
Maybe

2192
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,560
I think you're lying by rage

2193
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:03,584
Will probably

2194
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:09,472
Professional

2195
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:10,752
Trying

2196
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:11,776
HEB

2197
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:13,824
You son of a b****

2198
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:15,872
That is

2199
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:18,432
That is such the sound of a man who's like

2200
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:24,832
Why do I get paid by this guy wouldn't have done

2201
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:25,600
I could have been

2202
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:26,368
So many others

2203
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,160
What if I went to a real journalism

2204
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:31,744
I should have just gone to a real journalist

2205
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:33,024
I could have been

2206
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:33,792
Pipefitter

2207
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:35,584
My grandfather was a pipefitter

2208
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:37,120
Father was a pipefitter

2209
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:38,656
And I got stuck

2210
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:39,936

Coming back on the show

2213
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:49,408
That's a whole lot just rambling about a bunch of nonsense

2214
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:51,456
He says something

2215
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,016
Is awesome

2216
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,344

2217
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,392

2218
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:00,928
I found other people

2219
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,464
Clown.

2220
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,488
People playing this

2221
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,536
Before has never been able to make it today

2222
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,328
Now we can

2223
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:17,568
Management policies set by the New York fit

2224
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,432
Whatever

2225
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:28,576
There it is

2226
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:30,368
Saturday

2227
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:33,440
Everybody else was gone for recess for Christmas

2228
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:40,096
Roasted chestnuts

2229
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:45,216
Cooking a turkey

2230
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:51,104
Currency over the interest rates over all of it

2231
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,640
So

2232
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:56,480
So awesome

2233
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:05,440
A a note

Alex

2235
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,560
We know a couple things

2236
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:11,328
The Paul family

2237
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,120
I thought he'd give them death

2238
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:13,888
Prince over anything

2239
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:20,800
Use those usable

2240
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:24,896
Can't really stick

2241
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:26,688
Other

2242
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,456
Explanations

2243
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,992
But now Alex

2244
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:31,296
In 2018 on his show

2245
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:32,320
Is arguing that the

2246
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:38,976
Pushkin's Federal Reserve cooking chestnuts

2247
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:39,744
Open fire

2248
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:40,768
I want to tell you this

2249
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:41,536
What's the temperature

2250
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,584
23rd 1913 you know what happened

2251
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:46,400
Woodrow Wilson signed the bill into law

2252
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:49,216
Earlier

2253
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:50,752
Dammit voted

2254
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,056
Then that means

2255
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:57,408
That's that's how love works I've seen Schoolhouse Rock

2256
01:54:57,664 --> 01:55:03,808
Woodrow Wilson signed the bill into a lava Senate voted on it that beans spent zero time

2257
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:10,208
Committees there were no

2258
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:16,608
It was simply done on everything was written up

2259
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:25,568
No it takes at least like January 9th

2260
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,128
12 reduced

2261
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:30,688
Refinement

2262
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:33,760
December 22nd 1930

2263
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:34,528
House vote

2264
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,088
298 yay

2265
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:41,440
Not send Edward Scott

2266
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:44,000
There were 34 announced pairs

2267
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:45,792
A 468

2268
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:54,496
They were paired up we're going about now you're going to be okay so let's all get out of here

2269
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:55,264
60 is

2270
01:55:55,520 --> 01:56:00,384
Very close to what the vote would have been if everyone showed up

2271
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:03,968
On the 23rd at 1

2272
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,040
It was voted in

2273
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,856
25 days

2274
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:11,648
27 not voting

2275
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,928
With 13 an hour

2276
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:14,208
A witch

2277
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:18,816
26 of the 27 non-voters

2278
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:20,096
Is Audible

2279
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:21,376
Ground on it

2280
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:26,752
It's just a dumb thing that exists in Patriot mythology and in

2281
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:27,776
It's one of these

2282
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:29,056
Anti-tax

2283
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:31,616
Communities it's all just a load of b*******

2284
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,944
There's a there's a lot

2285
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:37,248
Your story to it

2286
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:38,784
Like none dare call it

2287
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,344
Conspiracy and stuff like that

2288
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:43,136
Weird ants

2289
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:46,464
Yeah

2290
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,512
Years past

2291
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:52,608
I honestly would love to

2292
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,376
To know

2293
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,144
A specific answer

2294
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,680
Why do they say

2295
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:57,216
Because it's not

2296
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:58,496
Name them

2297
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:00,288
Shirt

2298
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:02,336
I would like the names of the three

2299
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:04,640
I would like their names I would like

2300
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:07,456
Career

2301
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:12,064
Right or what kind of level they were dealing with

2302
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,600
The big point

2303
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:15,136
Everything that's really important

2304
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:16,928
Is

2305
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,720
Alex is here.

2306
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,768
He's talkin

2307
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:21,792
Straight

2308
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:23,840
S*** the idea

2309
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,376
Coming on his show

2310
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:27,680
And saying that the Federal Reserve was pushed

2311
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:30,752
Like we can make

2312
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:32,544
I mean

2313
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,312
This stuff about

2314
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:35,104
The Desmond is awesome

2315
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:37,152
Unforgivable on humans

2316
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:39,968
Absolutely the more important

2317
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:49,952
Because the priest class Rises up

2318
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:52,256
Text Blake

2319
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,280
Alright bye

2320
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:54,560
Calm down

2321
01:57:58,912 --> 01:57:59,936
Worst

2322
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:00,960
Because

2323
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:03,520
That should be a sign

2324
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:05,056
To everybody listening

2325
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,336
Get out

2326
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:09,152
Think you could make an argument that it's going to take

2327
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:09,920
You too long

2328
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,736
Understand past civilization

2329
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:14,272
Or something like that

2330
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:16,576
That would involve reading a lot of book

2331
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:18,112
This one

2332
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:18,880
Either Google

2333
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:21,952
Images

2334
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:27,584
Jerk-off on all the goddamn time

2335
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,400
Literally will not allow that to happen

2336
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:36,032
Obama Deception covers any war game

2337
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:42,688
What would have happened if 3 cm

2338
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:45,248
Woodrow Wilson

2339
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:47,296
It is

2340
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:52,928
Whatever the Federal Reserve

2341
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:56,768
Yeah yeah yeah

2342
01:58:58,048 --> 01:59:04,192
Guess what guess what the Constitution also allows for a new-build

2343
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:06,496
Right it's all of them got together

2344
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:11,872
Like this

2345
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:18,272
Guess what we have a majority who is going to be

2346
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:20,320
Different version

2347
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:22,368
This is Luna

2348
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:23,136
I love it though

2349
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:25,952
2

2350
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:27,744
To the stupid there is

2351
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,792
Nothing board farrier

2352
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:33,888
Then a group of intelligent people getting together and not asking

2353
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:34,912
For your dumb

2354
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,472
Uninformed and pointless opinion

2355
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:39,776
And then doing something that's better

2356
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:41,056
Yeah

2357
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:42,592
Something that they have to destroy

2358
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:43,872
Wait

2359
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:46,944
The Obamacare bill

2360
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,760
Without to ask me whether or not there were

2361
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:52,832
Reserved

2362
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:54,368
F*** you you're stupid

2363
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,648
Go away

2364
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:59,488
Yeah I mean I really want to stress

2365
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:01,792
Hey

2366
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,328
I kind of

2367
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,096
Like I should have done

2368
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:19,712
Right

2369
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:20,736
Possibly list

2370
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:23,296
Ashok years that not be like

2371
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,832
What

2372
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:25,600
They're gone

2373
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,880
I don't know

2374
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:33,280
I know I'm not saying your lost cause eventually find

2375
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:34,816
Past but I am saying

2376
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,608
I don't I don't give a

2377
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:41,216
If your spidey sense doesn't chime in there you you are dumb

2378
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:45,568
What you have done is

2379
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:46,848
It's the same thing

2380
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:47,872
YouTube's algorithm

2381
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:50,432
People buy

2382
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,712
Gradually more and more

2383
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:52,736
Videos

2384
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:53,504
Recommended

2385
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,296
Yeah

2386
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:57,088
I guess similar

2387
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:58,624
Almost reverse thing where

2388
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:00,416
The Vault his troubles

2389
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:02,464
Is Amplified rhetoric

2390
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,488
Kenny's dumbing-down of

2391
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,512
Content

2392
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,304
Assured that the only

2393
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:07,584
Butter left are

2394
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:10,144
Effectual.

2395
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,424
Too dumb

2396
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:13,728
You can't have

2397
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:15,264
Questioning

2398
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,032
People

2399
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:21,408
Reasonable people if

2400
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:22,176
If you say

2401
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:23,200
3p

2402
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:24,992
People passed the Federal Reserve in

2403
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:25,760
Existence

2404
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:27,296
They aren't like

2405
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:28,576
Alex please

2406
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:29,344
Retract that

2407
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,624
I like you

2408
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,648
But that is unacceptable

2409
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:34,464
You can't have any

2410
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:37,024
No absolutely not

2411
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:44,960
Christmas sales have

2412
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:46,752
I want

2413
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:47,776
Coming up so bad I want to

2414
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:49,568
I'm just

2415
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:51,616
Today

2416
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,176
We have these episodes

2417
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:58,784
We have these episodes like for the most part I think we're just

2418
02:01:59,040 --> 02:01:59,552
Just like

2419
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:00,576
Having fun

2420
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:05,696
But it's

2421
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:07,488
Ineffectual stupid

2422
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:15,680
And focuses that ineffectual stupidity

2423
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:18,496
Diffuses it amongst

2424
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:20,032
Monsters following

2425
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:21,056
Any Focus

2426
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:23,616
It's crazy

2427
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,664
That

2428
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:28,992
I can't

2429
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:30,272
Cimarron this enough

2430
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:31,040
He's

2431
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:32,064
Morally

2432
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:33,856
Directing

2433
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,672
Thousands upon thousands

2434
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:38,208
Hurled abuse

2435
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:45,888
I all in the name of it

2436
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,424
Pieces of information

2437
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:48,704
Together the app

2438
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,728
Aftermath

2439
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:50,752
His behalf

2440
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:51,776
Xavier

2441
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:57,152
His behavior

2442
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:57,920
Reasonable

2443
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:01,248
Oh your actions now we're going to

2444
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,784
The same sort of

2445
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,576
Respond now I'll say this

2446
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,856
This is cold comfort

2447
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:06,624
Ensemble

2448
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:09,696
When hook happened his audience

2449
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:10,976
Probably much wider

2450
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:12,768
Given

2451
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:13,536
He is off

2452
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,304
YouTube

2453
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:16,352
Twitter

2454
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:19,424
I think there's a decent chance that the effect

2455
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:21,472
The precipitating

2456
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:22,752
Ford

2457
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:24,544
Is lower

2458
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:25,824
Few years

2459
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:27,104
But

2460
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,152
The flip side of that coin is

2461
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:32,992
As I've already said they're all around

2462
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:38,368
Yeah yeah yeah

2463
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,392
More

2464
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,416
Prone

2465
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:44,512
Being that sort of person but who knows

2466
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:47,840
I mean

2467
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:52,960
Yeah his audience was wider back then but if they have left by now

2468
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:59,360
Chances are they also probably the ones who are ready

2469
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:00,640
We are doing the Sandy Hook

2470
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:04,992
It doesn't matter

2471
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:06,528
Because I don't I don't

2472
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,808
Look at things

2473
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:09,344
Like this

2474
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,112
Outcome

2475
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:18,048
Nothing right or not

2476
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:18,816
Not

2477
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:19,840
It's not

2478
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,424
It's action

2479
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:26,752
God I can

2480
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:27,520
Cannot imagine

2481
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:29,568
I really can't imagine

2482
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:32,384
A situation where I would

2483
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:33,664
Define Within

2484
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:35,712
Yeah I mean it's f***** up

2485
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:37,504
Adan Salazar

2486
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:39,040
And then it's f***** up

2487
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:40,832
You imagined

2488
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:42,368
Is there are additives

2489
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:44,672
People whose titles are

2490
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:51,328
Call Jared Leto action I don't know what the process is

2491
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,352
Wrote that article

2492
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:57,728
And then I believe it's L Ron Hubbard's process which is the door sure

2493
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,288
Put the idea in any other journalist

2494
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:01,056
Takeout

2495
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:03,360
Stages of

2496
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:07,200
Ever posted on

2497
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:08,480
Site

2498
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:09,504
Anything like that

2499
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,552
If you don't

2500
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:14,624
I know that Infowars doesn't work like that

2501
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:16,672
I still hold them to that

2502
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:17,952
So I imagine

2503
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:18,720
Someone look

2504
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:19,488
Do that instead

2505
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:21,280
Good put it on the site let's do the

2506
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:22,048
Yep

2507
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:24,352
I can't imagine adults

2508
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:25,376
Being like that

2509
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:27,168
That's disgusting

2510
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:30,240
It's really really f****** Christ

2511
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:32,544
Congratulations

2512
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:35,104
Even after two years even after all of the

2513
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:39,200
F****** s*** we watch you do you are a disgusting pile of s*** once more

2514
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:44,320
There's no floor

2515
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:46,112
If I wanted to see what happened on Thursday

2516
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:48,160
Just kind of exhausted

2517
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,400
I want I want him to go away for awhile

2518
02:05:58,912 --> 02:05:59,424
Christ

2519
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:01,472

Anyway guys

2522
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,640
Appears to be taking a break

2523
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:10,688
Don't think so

2524
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:11,456
Next week

2525
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:12,992

We are on iTunes subscribe comments

2530
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:37,312
Where am I

2531
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:38,080
More people live

2532
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:43,456
Mitch on the show

2533
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:44,480
You see the growth

2534
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:45,760
If it comes from that

2535
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:48,064
Absolutely

2536
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:52,672
Never killed

2537
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:56,000
I'm positive

2538
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,048
11 years

2539
02:06:58,816 --> 02:06:59,584
It's not enough time

2540
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:03,168
Kind of universe

2541
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:11,360
I don't think you have

2542
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:12,640
Muscles

2543
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:15,456
I might be wrong

2544
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:18,016
Find me maybe on somebody younger than you

2545
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:20,576
Filter isn't right for

2546
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:26,720
A good song

2547
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:29,024
I don't know my point is that Desmond is awesome

2548
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,304
Has never killed anybody

2549
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:34,656
Technically probably

2550
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:35,680
And that's out

2551
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:44,640
