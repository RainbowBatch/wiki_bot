Major League Baseball will return

00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:31,904
I know you're a man

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,744
The amount of resources they're taking

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,816
The risk that the players

17
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,632
Do the point of moral distress

18
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,216

It's terrible

21
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:53,920

28
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,672
Usually would go to bars

Prison watch baseball negative

30
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,304
Two layers of weirdness I can go to the bar to watch

00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,288

00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Terrified

Survived

51
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
To think about it a little more

52
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:23,679
Complex complex

53
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,239

68
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,911

00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,615
Forestry

70
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:18,111
What's going on for him to talk about nothing in the news

71
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:22,207
Carerite

72
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,047
And it leaves me a little bit in the Lurch is like trying to

73
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
We recorded some Thursday

74
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,215

75
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
Yo I am

76
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
Evening thinking

77
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
When is show starts on Thursday

78
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,455
I will know whether or not there's an episode of

79
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,855
If he's on that around a triangle

80
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:56,511
And I don't know

81
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,215
Alyx studio and I believe the reason is because

82
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
This week

83
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,055
Supreme Court was deciding his motion

84
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:15,455
But he was trying to overturn those sanctions against him

85
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,247
I'm ahead of the opposing counsel

86
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
Spermatocele

87
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135

Good work CBS

90
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:38,239
The court issued a 720 decision rejecting Jones's claims that his comments aimed at attorney Chris

91
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Christopher Mattie

92
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
We're protected by free-speech rights

93
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:47,455
And upholding a lower Court's ruling the Jones violated numerous orders to turn over documents to the families

From those lawyers

101
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,503
Simply put this is a very strong indication that Alex is running out of

102
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
In this case

103
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,999

114
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,351

00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823

177
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,071

Because Rodger immediately gaslighted

183
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:07,359
The responsive not being like so certain you heard what you is not that strange to me

184
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,551
The argument that people were talking in French

185

I don't want to argue with this is in English

00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Which is

198
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Weekly ball

199
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
I used

200
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Racial

201
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
In an interview

202
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
With the radio talk show

203
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535

206
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
Contradiction

207
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:43,103
The first time

208
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Went down

209
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
40 seconds

210
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Which they say

211
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
No I wasn't

212
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
Admit

213
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815

214
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Between

215
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Where is a Pasty

216
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
Weather

217
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Version

218
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
What was recorded

219
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,943
Allegedly

220
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Negro

221
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
The background noises

222
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
What's the show

223
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Goes on

224
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
5 minutes

225
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
Kiss my ass

226
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,191
Either

227
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,263
Surprise

228
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
Different

229
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
Lotto

230
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Sports

231
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
Results

232
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
Sounds right

233
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,727
One of Brazil

234
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:23,711
Man what a swing that's impressive

235
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
Conspiracy

236
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,183
Occam's razor tells me that you're lying right now what words do you say that

237
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,743
For the rest of this

238
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,583
Make sense

239
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
Is like

240
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:47,007
Okay so glitches

241
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,407
In such a way as to be perfectly able to frame Rodger for saying this word

242
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:58,015
And then afterwards they were able to somehow splicing something that sound

243
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
Exactly like Rodger Stone

244
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
I mean

245
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:07,999
Mo Kelly needs to be involved his producers need to be in like Siri such a

246
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
Understand either

247
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,351
What it is he thinks that proves

248
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,007
That just means he spliced into a different time you said that

249
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
Rodger impression

250
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,687
I mean it's elaborate

251
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
It's not

252
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,295
Is Rodger protest

253
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,647
You just shut up keep our audience licking pointed out

254
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:42,559
They don't like.

255
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,399
Proud boys

256
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,727
You shut up because

257
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
No one cares

258
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:56,895
Everyone's everybody doesn't like you already

259
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
Infowars

260
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
We kind of know

261
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,295
Move Along Rodger

262
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:08,415
Rodger Dunn

263
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
Controller

264
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
His career

265
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,607
Pretty funny to me

266
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
That made me realize

267
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
The french-speaking explained

268
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:34,527
I want to see Rodger

269
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:40,927
He wasn't seeking it watching some friends program

270
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
Just in the background

271
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
So

272
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
Pathetic

273
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:55,007
Oh no no you are not going to play

274
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
Get the f*** out

00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
Their shows they got nothing

281
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,647

What is left to his own devices in

286
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Freed from the

287
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263

288
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,591

Psych you know maybe people have

296
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
Seeing the tweets about it or whatever

297
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:59,007
I went back and I looked at it sometime earlier episode

298
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,591
Visionary Laura Loomer as I call her

00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,663
2.2 thousand

300
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
That was like

301
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
Dinesh D'Souza

302
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
Episode 3

303
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,111

00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,960

311
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:41,248
Oh boy that's not good numbers are really depressing but I figured they'd like you know the dogs probably only in he's not like he's only real

312
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,088
YouTube

313
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,648
And it's not looking much better over there now

314
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,536
The most beautiful so does Gavin McInnes 7.3 thousand after over a month

315
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,144
It's not like his videos getting overused

316
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,240
Still have like 10 to 20 thousand sometimes

317
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
Great

318
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,336
Some dick making memes

319
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,408
What you consume

320
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,248
YouTube isn't the primary mode for me

321
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,112
Memes about like obviously you're going to get way more views on them

322
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,648
In another platform

323
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,720
Even still

324
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,048
YouTube

325
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
So it's not like

326
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
There's no traction here

327
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,192
I think the problem with his Joe is that no one wants it

328
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:38,592
Set to exist even his fanbase doesn't seem like they're clamoring for a talk show host

329
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
Because he made 30 second

330
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
Can videos that kind of

331
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,432
Pander to their beliefs

332
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
It's not like you see this video

333
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,832
I wonder what that guy would do with along with the longest

334
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,232
Carpe donktum curated 60

335
00:22:55,488 --> 00:23:01,632
That's what I was really think of that give me a Charlie Rose interview

336
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:10,592
God dammit

337
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,856
Pushed back whenever I call Tommy Robinson

338
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,696
Tommy Robinson Sheriff

339
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
Call

340
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,560
Tommy Robinson alternating names

341
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,728
You chose to call yourself that you live with it for the rest

342
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
Love your life

343
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,456
Hey Leah Scott.

344
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,480
Keep going

345
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,528
Grown Beyond you

346
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
So I saw these guests

347
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Floral

348
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Gavin McInnes

349
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
As like

350
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:04,096
A lot of people who kind of her in this milia

Bloomer shoban Infowars orgasm

352
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Kind of Alaska

353
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
Common but not unheard-of

354
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,080
A Dinesh D'Souza to show up busy generally

355
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,408
Associated

356
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
And then I was like

357
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
How did the show start

358
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,784
Who was the first Galaxy

359
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
I was blown away

360
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Batgirl

361
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
First gas

362
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,720
On Carpe donktum

363
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
It's not

364
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,816
Carpenter

365
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
First gas

366
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,776
I'm Carpe scorner

367
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,152
Dave Rubin the f*** out of here

368
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
Dave Rubin

369
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,248
Classical liberal Dave Rubin

370
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:58,112
Dave Rubin was alright

371
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,928
Carpet corner

372
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,976
Excited like if we're going to listen

373
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
Listen to something

374
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,816
I want to f****** Dave Rubin

375
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:18,080
That's a sentence that I can't imagine anybody not steaks

376
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:21,920
Kind of stupid.

377
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,736
The first time we listen

378
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:31,136
Bill Cooper episode one of the things that I responded to the most

379
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,256
This show is a little bit

380
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,352
The theme song

381
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,824
No

382
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:57,504
Carpet carpet carpet

383
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,832
I've got to pause here for a second because there's a couple of couples wife

384
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,416
I'm not going to play the rest of this song

385
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,256
He has also has like review

386
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584
On-brand okay

387
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,168
People who complain that our theme song is too long

388
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,288
We are just under a minute-long it's perfectly timed

389
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Just like it

390
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:27,456
Forward

391
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
I disagree

392
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:32,064
Theme song of the minute-and-a-half

393
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,624
Too long that's too long does he do it himself

394
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:41,792
See if you can voice

395
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,264
It might be I don't know

396
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,080
Is that for a minute

397
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:58,944
See that's what makes me think it's that kind of vanity

398
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,760
A minute and 30 of me is what they showed me

399
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,832
Carpe score

400
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,136
Seasons corner

401
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:13,280
Physical

402
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:18,656
Carpe

403
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:25,056
Or whatever

404
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,104
He's a stage names

405
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
I don't care

406
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:33,248
Not bad

407
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,296
JoJo you already too

408
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,088
Made a better name for

409
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
You can have that Carpe

410
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
No you can't

411
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
Cheez-It

412
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,560
Apology here in advance

413
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,120
Audio is

414
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Trap

415
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,984
Through the entire thing

416
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,616
Bad to the point where if

417
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:06,016
I had recorded this I would never put it on

418
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
Whenever it happens

419
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:12,160
And there it is it's in the middle of something

420
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,072
But sometimes you do have to leave because it's in the middle

421
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Piece of conversation

422
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,936
Well if I cut this out the neighbor cut out 20 minutes

423
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,752
Right

424
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,848
Cared about what I was doing at all I took seriously

425
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,152
This would never get really yeah

426
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,456
Even if you think Dave Rubin is

427
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,272
They get and like I can't reschedule Dave Rubin

428
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
Don't put this out Rudolph

429
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184

Decent terms

F*** you doing

462
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,488
Dave Reubens whole stick for the longest time had been like

00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:29,120
He worked at The Young Turks sure classical liberal

464
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:35,520
I am a liberal but the last is going crazy

465
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
Funnel for like

466
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
He's like a liberal get

467
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,272
Do you have the the Rubin report

468
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,856
Gaston like Ben Shapiro Jordan Peterson

469
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,136
Adam Carolla

470
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,768
Man Tommy Robinson Mike cernovich

471
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,352
These sorts of folks who gives uncritical platforms

472
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
And they would just

473
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,192
Say

474
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,752
Existed

475
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
Need to be for a bit

476
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,080
Recently

477
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:16,480
Just decided he works for the blaze

478
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,040
Through this.

479
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
And now

480
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,136
I don't know what he's trying to do now

481
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
Cuz I don't think

482
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
There's much

483
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:31,328
Use for it he's a sensible

484
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,608
Christy Moore

485
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,144
I don't know

486
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,544
We got plenty of Nazis man

487
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,872
Is really anymore

488
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,664
When did you

489
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
Swift

490
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
From being like this

491
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,344
And far-right

492
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
People can use

493
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,904
To justify

494
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,952
Themselves and their free speech nonsense

495
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
When you slip from

496
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,536
To be like I work for Glenn Beck now

497
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,096
I mean you end up on a corner

498
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:12,800
We're not calling it it's kind of a bummer

499
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,992
I'm calling you trying to Shield

500
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,528
With Carpe donktum

501
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,672
Talking to somebody who's underwater

502
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,000
But

503
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:36,352
Comedian

504
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,144
Hilarious and then

505
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,192
Become reactionary dicks

506
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
To start things off with

507
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,432
This is going to be loosened

508
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
Successful comedian

509
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,760
I do want I do want to ask

510
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,784
A little bit about

511
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
The outfit

512
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,696
Professional talk show host

513
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
He's a little more

514
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
With the open

515
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
In the middle of the country

516
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
Krowd

517
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
Miss Gray

518
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,840
Selling bumper

519
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,632
For yourself

520
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,984
There we go

521
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
Is it better

522
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,312
Better now

523
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:55,712
So he ER he stormed off to change his his outfit

524
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,064
Instead of like elevate

525
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,976
I feel like if you're on dogs dojo

526
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,024
Like he does something like that

527
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,608
This is a bit

528
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
Do something

529
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:18,752
As opposed to sit there like hourly into the show

530
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
Minute

531
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:26,176
Minute into the show

532
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,760
Well

533
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
Prayers for a pretend birthday

534
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:38,208
First date

535
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,024
Starbucks off of 280

536
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,048
Pun intended

537
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:47,168
Blazing star

538
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,240
The funniest version of this

539
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,032
Could possibly be and I still don't

540
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,848
All I know is bolo tie

541
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,528
When he comes back he's wearing like a Simpsons shirt or something like that because

542
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,088
Better

543
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,136
It's like I don't care

544
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,208
Tired conversation

545
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:16,608
Luminaries in the world of online media like Carpe donktum

546
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Reuben

547
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,544
Can come up with something better to talk about than how The Simpsons have seen better days

548
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,664
Was too long

549
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,016
The audio is not good

550
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,672
So I'm getting and getting some feedback heater that

551
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
That my

552
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
Audio is choppy

553
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
Yours is just fine

554
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
But mine

555
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,120
Have you tried putting

556
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,680
Microphone

557
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
That's not a bit

558
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,128
This is where I got really

559
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,152
Disappointed

560
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:06,784
It's a weird thing to say this is where I got disappointed

561
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
They're not going to fix

562
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,464
You don't need to do that got to do it

563
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,864
The Show Must Go On the fans are demanding more.

564
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,936
Donks Dojo dab

565
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
I mean

566
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
Free

567
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:34,176
Screen stuff

568
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,968
Another problem

569
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Delay

570
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,600
You can't expect anyone

571
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,672
But this is why you end up with receding number

572
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,256
I did listen to a little bit of the Laura Loomer want

573
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,960
This is this is a good shot man you got Reuben in the house there's no way you can be like hey I'm in called

574
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,496
Dave back in about a half hour

575
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
We're going to get the hell out of your work

576
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,824
Brother

577
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,920
And so like sure even so even if you have a good going

578
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:12,320
There's no rule that says you can't

579
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,928
We did it in our livestream

580
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:27,936
Hey we have a problem we need to fix it

581
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:32,032
Can't you can't you can't expect anyone to take you seriously this is what you're bringing

582
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,056
Anyway

583
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,384
Talking about like a Twitter censorship

584
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
Sugar course

585
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
Today

586
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Aruba

587
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,880
Has an interesting perspective on it

588
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:52,768
Somewhere along the lines of like a Twitter to do whatever they want

589
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,304
There's a conspiracy going on

590
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,584
She's locked out

591
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
And she has

592
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,240
He's talking about Candace Owens being locked out of her account

593
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,544
But nobody's gotten back

594
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
How to figure out what to do

595
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
The privates

596
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
What did the government

597
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
Put pressure on Twitter to boot

598
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,344
Her and are they ever going to let her

599
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
You know what's your name

600
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,208
Or if it's like they're taking away your ability to make a living for

601
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
For people like us

602
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
So we do have to see

603
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Figure out some

604
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
I do believe in

605
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
That that is

606
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
True

607
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
You are

608
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
You have offer

609
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
At local

610
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
What should I do

611
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,968
Lee Donald Trump

612
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,504
Government

613
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,808
Pressure Twitter tonight

614
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:59,072
Wildly throwing that around government

615
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,120
Candace Owens

616
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,656
Positive things

617
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,776
Pressure on Twitter

618
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,312
Sprout Jess specific

619
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,152
This is how you have that weasel

620
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,736
Obviously yes Twitter can choose to do

621
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,552
What they want

622
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,624
How do I get around that somebody must be

623
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,672
Forcing them to do it around

624
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:30,304
The implications of me having this seemingly rational how can I turn this

625
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,096
Camps allowed

626
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:36,704
That's what I believe because they'll get very angry at me

627
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,496
Mako SeaWorld

628
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,080
Real silly

629
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,640
I don't I don't check into that at all

630
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:49,504
Any can't pull off Globe to say the government can't even say can't even say it's like the

631
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,112
Deep state in the government

632
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
Alright

633
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Umbrella Blokus

634
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,816
For single this is something

635
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:07,424
Has eyes launch basically

636
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,728
Patreon

637
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:15,104
I'm sure I signed up for an account on it and it is a website

638
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,944
It's really hard to tell how many creators are actually on the platform because

639
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,040
Once you sign up for an account there's no option to browse content creators

640
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:27,136
Discover like new folks who you might be interested in like that's crazy

641
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
That's not good

642
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
Search

643
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
4 names

644
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,488
And see if something comes up

645
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:36,096
Infowars Alex Jones yielded no results

646
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,680
Dave's Dave concept

647
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,752
Patreon Style

648
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,592
The social media been to it

649
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,896
You can join us Pacific creators

650
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,432
Quote-unquote community

651
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,296
Then you're allowed to see their news feed and whatever they choose to post.

652
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,880
Basically it's like a free-speech Twitter that you have to pay for

653
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:05,280
Overall iZombie roster of folks

654
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,072
Great he's a hero

655
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,376
Carpe donktum of course downtown there

656
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:13,472
Dave Rubin Dave Reubens on there of course names I didn't recognize all right

657
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,288
I found the site's navigational capacity to be shipped

658
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,616
All aspects

659
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
Is a huge turn off

660
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
Insane

661
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,224
There's no way the government

662
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,528
Twitter de Candace Owens

663
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
No way visit

664
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,344
Is ever going to work as a website

665
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,648
It's trash

666
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,184
They're just slight

667
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,000
Tweaks that need to be made to even make it like a peeling

668
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,304
User experience

669
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,352
You have to come in knowing

670
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
Who's Community you want to

671
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,704
Which you're trying to steal

672
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
Another busy

673
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,056
You're hoping that whoever you invite

674
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
To join

675
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,384
As you should

676
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,455
He's going to bring all of the people that they would be

677
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,503
Bringing along with it

678
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,063
Yeah he wants those 487 views

679
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,367
Yeah

680
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
So let me dance.

681
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,023
Whatever people aren't allowed on other things

682
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,559
Migrate

683
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,119
Their base to this platform

684
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,911
We can take a cut off.

685
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
Just like I mean it's not

686
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,823
The first middleman websites ever been

687
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
It's just

688
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,895
. revolutionary and I

689
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,479
I guarantee that if people behave in ways that were illegal

690
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,015
Tik-Tok that as well

691
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
I gave it half

692
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,087
Because you're creative

693
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,927
Communities that are facilitated by this locals website

694
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,231
And so like if somebody is organizing like

695
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,047
Nazi rallies are a violent kind of

696
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,095
You would have to

697
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Kick them off

698
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,911
And then go where is Free Speech

699
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:51,519
I don't understand is like a do they just not understand who they're dealing with

700
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:56,639
Like that does Dave Rubin not get that if you create a place for all the people who got quick

701
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:01,503
Dad kicked off Twitter you're going to find out that all the people who got kicked off Twitter

702
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:08,415
Well now they're a group of nothing the same way Alex

703
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,071
Explicitly

704
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:19,679
Dave Rubin invites people to come onto locals as opposed

705
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:23,519
I think we're anybody can sign up for Creator account

706
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,847
Gets to talking about how like

707
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
You know

708
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,151
Fox News

709
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
He's on there a lot

710
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,863
Just figured out a way to

711
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
People

712
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,727
We're on

713
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
CNN

714
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,127
Imagine Blitzer laughing

715
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,407
These aren't real

716
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,807
You know that being said I would still go on there

717
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:16,767
This makes me very sad this is not good

718
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:21,887
That's not good

719
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,191
I would love to

720
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:32,639
Your doctor non-humans all the time it's like a video game there in PC

721
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:39,295

00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,599
Naughty

Oh man it turns out those guys who whose brand is

724
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,975
Reactionary

725
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,279
Victim

726
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,607
You guys too

727
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:57,215
Interesting I don't want to talk about it cuz

728
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:02,591
I feel like other people report does a really good job of covering unrelated content

729
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
Enoteca

730
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,919
In care of his business sure he's not really

731
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,711
On Infowars March

732
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:12,319
The reason that were in a really even doing this is cuz this is on

733
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,879
Carpe donktum

Yeah they're sort of

741
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
Debate

742
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,271

God bless

746
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
It's really started

747
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,231
After

748
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655
But

749
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
Alright

750
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
I didn't know that

751
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175

752
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,503

Dave Rubin surprised he has no

755
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
It's true.

756
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,255
In response to being surprised by the claim

757
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,815
Confident

758
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:33,215
Isabelle Ryan on the board of somebody's probably there somewhere we actually know

Talking about there's a big ideas about stuff

760
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:42,943
I feel like Paul Ryan's on the board there somebody must be doing something I read a headline

761
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,271
19

762
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,575

Orion is on that board Murdock and his son Lachlan are largely Still the One.

767
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,407
Just like a

768

It's largely a

00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,247
Here is a hammock

771
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,343
It just never occurs to these guys that maybe they've gone nuts

772
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,927
You can't be a Nazi in the mainstream

773
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:30,047
Mostly you can be 75% Nazi

774
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
They're like

775
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,727
Well we've so that means Lefty Court

776
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,287
They just can't

777
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,079
Like they can't wrap their heads around

778
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,615
Maybe we became.

779
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,455
Super far afield

780
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
Possible

781
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:54,879
Mysterious that Fox News is going Progressive or Lefty

782
00:47:55,135 --> 00:48:01,279
Extremely far to the radio

783
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Like

784
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,375
This person who's interview

785
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:09,471
Sox Lefty of the

786
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:15,871
Literally take your property away

787
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,247
Like most progressives

788
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,551
Wow alright

789
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,831
Jesus Christ

790
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,535
I would see that is a troubling sign

791
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:39,423
If I were Dave Rubin no being interviewed by the need to take a look at least 20 minutes to unpack that

792
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,471
Why do you think Fox News is

793
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,335
Even if I work

794
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:52,735
Hey I'm sensible I'm in the middle politically invited on Fox News all the time

795
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,551
Yeah it took a little while

796
00:48:55,807 --> 00:49:01,951
From the last

797
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,743
So

798
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,023
Cobra

799
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,839
Is about like leaving glass

800
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,119
That's

801
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
Entire

802
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,423
Resume different

803
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:15,263
Brings this up a little bit here to

804
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,359
Cuz of course you're having a ball that's what you want to talk about

805
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,551
So much

806
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
I want to hear this

807
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,591
People will say.

808
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
How is it pause

809
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,639
Possible you were one of them

810
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,735
Sometimes it's hard for me to remember what it was like to

811
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,831
You can literally find videos of me supporting Bernie Sanders

812
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,879
5 years ago

813
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,647
Somewhere

814
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,951
What I'm saying I agree with Bernie Sanders blah blah blah

815
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,351
Now we can see his true colors dad

816
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:23,871
Rebecca

817
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:28,223
Of course you favored Bernie Sanders to Hillary

818
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:31,039
You were saying

819
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,183
Call boy

820
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,719
I can't imagine what it was like to

821
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,511
To think that I needed to Terror

822
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:45,631
Hair down and restructure the entire that's a crazy idea

823
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,447
Dean's answer for this question

824
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
Relies on a boat

825
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,519
Metaphor

826
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,543
Alright

827
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,311
I guess

828
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,663
Are the boat

829
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:03,295
There are water-breathing socialist

830
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,343
Alright

831
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,367
Liberalism

832
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Today

833
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,255
What they really addressing

834
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Socialist

835
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
And Collective

836
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,095
The progressive

837
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
And I think what happened

838
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,655
What liberals

839
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
WhatsApp

840
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,495
Reminded

841
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
Sexying

842
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,031
Other

843
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,055
Voices

844
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,591
A liberal base

845
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,615
Sickly

846
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
To be like

847
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,175
Thinking away the conservatives Acts

848
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
You don't

849
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,991
The Predator conservative

850
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,879
Like picture it's a

851
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,927
Liberalism is a

852
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
The ship and then the

853
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,231
Swimming underneath

854
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,023
A little hole

855
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,375
Call Erick

856
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,655
Progressive got in there

857
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
And then

858
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
Tricking everybody

859
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,239
Pretending

860
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:58,847
People

861
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
What

862
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,783
Underbelly of liberal

863
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,063
And they just went in there

864
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,599
The whole thing

865
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,159
And that's why there are no liberals

866
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,047
I still consider my

867
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
Really

868
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,143
The phrase that I like now

869
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,959
I would consider myself a

870
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,983
Modern

871
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:32,639
New label I consider myself

872
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,175
Modern conservative

873
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,759
Classical liberal

874
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:40,063
Choose a different time designation

875
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,135
My alignment

876
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,927
I'm personally A baroque Center

877
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,999
Libertarian

878
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
Whatever alright buddy

879
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:54,655
So I want to just talk about this matter for a tiny bit

880
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:59,007
Is it just to be like

881
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,311
Let's imagine the same boat

882
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,871
Conservatism

883
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:10,271
Instead of Tolerance

884
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,319
Play the same stupid game

885
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,623
My metaphor for this phone

886
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,159
Alright remember the Mesa

887
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:20,767
The Mayflower flower exist

888
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,815
When you could be a classical ever

889
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:26,655
And there's a little flower

890
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,679
And I

891
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,471
They let all the Nazis in

892
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,495
And then made a country

893
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,567
That's about the boat that I consider

894
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
Well

895
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:37,407
This isn't good because you don't help us so division

896
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:44,063
Two-sided thing has basically been here from the

897
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:44,831
The beginning

898
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,903
You see what I'm saying whatever we let him in that boat

899
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,671
Okay

900
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:52,255
Because there was a hole in the boat

901
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,887
My feeling on Borgata way for

902
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,423
I think it did

903
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,727
My feeling on this

904
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,519
Is the Dave Rubin supposed

905
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,103
To be your guy who's got these ideas that are really like

906
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,383
Cool and good

907
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
Right

908
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,503
Is it because of

909
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
Hollering

910
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,831
And Democrats like to be light

911
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,695
I like to be like

912
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,487
And then there's a whole lot

913
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,511
The bottom of the boat

914
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,791
Tolerance

915
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,095
Kind of makes you think

916
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:33,215
They left their own devices tolerance

917
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:40,383
It's plugged with progressives dead well pump

918
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,967
Oh they did pull the plug

919
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
Otherwise it's not a hole

920
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,671
No unless Progressive

921
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,719
Did they have one of those

922
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
Swirly

923
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,279
Yeah I think so

924
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,559
This is dumb

925
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,607
It means nothing

926
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,887
And it sounds good

927
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,703
Good to have.

928
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:11,103
Progressives are exploiting the desire of me

929
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,383
Whatever is

930
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,919
Yeah it sounds good

931
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,199
See you doesn't mean anything

932
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:18,271
That's a stupid

933
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
Alright imagine

934
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,999
Progressive

935
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:28,767
The book still

936
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:32,095
Okay include everybody

937
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:36,447
Okay and then everybody is just strangling progressives under the water

938
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:38,239
I think that would be

939
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,543
Metaphor

940
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,591
PetSmart

941
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,407
It's a bad man

942
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,991
Yeah I didn't start good we didn't fix it but

943
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,527
I don't know

944
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,111
Anyway to give you some sort of sense of the kind of like conversation

945
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,927
They're having a

946
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,303
He believes that Trump should win

947
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,607
In 2020

948
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,887
Supermarkets

949
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:09,215
Naturally believes

950
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,519
It's either Biden or Trump got to go Trump

951
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:18,175
He also subscribes to a magical styles

952
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:21,247
This is all just be over

953
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
I suspect some of the rules

954
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
After

955
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,351
Or actually

956
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,631
I know it sounds crazy

957
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,191
But I think that's when things

958
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,239
We probably have four more years of

959
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
Craziness

960
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:44,799
Whatever happens

961
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,591
But I think after

962
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,615
8 years

963
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
I think there's so much

964
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,175
Rich in

965
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:50,943
Intellectual

966
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,247
Weather

967
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:58,879
Craterian wine

968
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:00,927
Rich School

969
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,719
Intellectual

970
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,303
Richmond

971
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,583
44 day are going to

972
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,863
Seriously

973
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,631
Cool list

974
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,703
A little more

975
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,799
Is job basement

976
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,159
Not followed by

977
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,487
Stream Trump types

978
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,791
Proponent of Rich intellectual diversity

979
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,327
That's what we know about the

980
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:43,423
Comments like this another setting

981
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:49,055
And he's included like Candace Owens in the you like

982
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:54,943
Kill everybody that's not what

983
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,015
About the progression that things are going down

984
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:05,439
Recycle

985
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:11,071
I don't see any reason to believe the 2024

986
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,911
Unless there's some kind of like some pseudo-spiritual

987
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:18,751
All the stars are in the right houses or whatever

988
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:28,479
Maybe 20

989
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,015
We're already pure light

990
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:32,319
Exactly we become light being

991
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,855
Maybe a new Circle

992
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,927
Be okay with why I'm here

993
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,743
But otherwise I think

994
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,071
To be so much worse

995
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,143
Don't understand

996
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:48,959
I guess they just really don't even understand

997
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,983
The strength of

998
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,543
Conservatives is that there is no

999
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,335
That's their power

1000
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,663
They say the same thing over and over and over again

1001
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
People believe it

1002
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:02,783
First is only going to run

1003
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,599
With one exception

1004
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:14,303
Right now D3 of Rand Paul doctor not to answer your call

1005
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:22,239
Grandpa cowardly

1006
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
Your challenge

1007
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,287
Debate

1008
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:31,199
Quit holding up legislation that would help people and start debating

1009
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:37,599
Kentucky hang out with you and you can

1010
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:53,215
Tell me about

1011
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:53,983
That's great

1012
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:00,639
Really you don't get a good sense of like leaving the last outside of being

1013
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,199
This boat metaphor Weber

1014
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,735
Intolerance

1015
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,295
Whatever

1016
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,319
Well

1017
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:12,159
Whatever not really well-thought-out

1018
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,999
Ends up becoming like

1019
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,071
Dave Rubin talking about meeting Trump

1020
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
Great

1021
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,119
These guys are

1022
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:25,471
Really really making a compelling case for this show being essential

1023
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,543
So here is Dave discussing that

1024
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,567
Trump is

1025
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,335
Rio

1026
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,967
Met the president

1027
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,247
Samurai

1028
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:39,807
2019

1029
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,439
And I actually spoke

1030
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,463
In the morning I was opening

1031
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,255
I canceled everybody could

1032
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,631
Add I never heard him speak

1033
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,447
I'm sitting in the first

1034
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
What I realized

1035
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,055
Your truck is basic

1036
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
Businessman

1037
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,199
Underline

1038
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:09,759
More than anything

1039
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
In a lot of ways

1040
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:13,855
What's the

1041
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:15,903
Flagstaff

1042
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,975
Being real

1043
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,839
With crazy hair more real than

1044
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
Many of the other

1045
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,655
Who is

1046
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,191
Donald Trump

1047
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,215
Who is Nora

1048
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,751
Donald Trump

1049
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,287
Pete buttigieg

1050
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,615
Projector

1051
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:39,455
Successful stand-up

1052
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
Maybe

1053
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:46,111
I don't know I don't know but I'm still openings

1054
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,135
For Trump

1055
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:01,983
You know you were at a spot at a club and then he dropped open for him

1056
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,079
This is that's nonsense

1057
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:11,967
That's how pathetic that is that you in the schedule

1058
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,759
Schedule

1059
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,839
45

1060
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:28,863
Are you sure

1061
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,703
The mind was blown

1062
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,471
By hearing

1063
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,495
Trump

1064
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,519
Give a speech

1065
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,079
He started to get it real

1066
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,383
So anyway so Trump goes up there and

1067
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
When you see him

1068
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,247
I really put the whole thing

1069
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,015
Together about the

1070
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,343
About wind power

1071
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,743
Call crowd laugh

1072
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,423
Interesting

1073
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,263
I know

1074
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,287
Headlight

1075
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,567
Is tonight

1076
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,847
Donald Trump

1077
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
Claims he knows more than

1078
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,967
The article

1079
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,015
And it's like he's just

1080
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,319
You know as a mean guy yourself it's like he's just

1081
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:26,207
Suspect Dave Rubin is not a sincere commentator

1082
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:32,863
If you just take the strictly based on the words

1083
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:36,191
Is to make claims that are completely nonsensical and not true

1084
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,263
Which of the media will point out or nonsensical and not true

1085
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,335
Interest-based can pretend they were masterful jokes

1086
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,103
The media

1087
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,919
Even if all that were true and accurate which is

1088
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,735
Not disagree this is an example of

1089
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:56,415
This event where Dave Rubin was that where you saw Trump speak with a case where Trump got super weird about win

1090
01:03:56,671 --> 01:04:02,815
Turbines for awhile turbines create more pollution than

1091
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:09,215
Energy sources which is patently not true.

1092
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,495
Create all of that by

1093
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:14,847
Big blue Air

1094
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:21,503
Created by manufacturing a wind turbine is offset within 5 to 8 months

1095
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,783
Of them being

1096
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,831
In operation

1097
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:29,183
Let's too long then we're we can we got to go back to to clean coal

1098
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,071
Any procedure to

1099
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,631
You see all these windows

1100
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,655
Supreme at windmills

1101
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,983
Contacts

1102
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:48,127
They're all different shades of color they're all sort of white but that's my favorite color orange

1103
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:51,199
It was a load of rambling nonsense

1104
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:55,039
Is trying to re contextualizes trolling

1105
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,575
Is an unhinged idiot

1106
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,343
Just talkingshit

1107
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:04,511
Power and one of the first times this game was in real

1108
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,535
Relationship

1109
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,095
Farms near the golf course

1110
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,631
Susie on Den Scotland

1111
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,399
Weird

1112
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:17,055
This was also actually that speech today ruin was that there's actually also speechwriter

1113
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,919
Instead of a Great Depression

1114
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:24,991
Completely Onyx unacceptable

1115
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,039
Speech that included lines like

1116
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,855
The Democrat Party is trying to shred our constitution

1117
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,671
Tear down our history erase our nation's borders

1118
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,743
They want to punish America we will fight

1119
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,279
Reserve America

1120
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,327
What we're doing I think I just got it

1121
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,423
Yeah you might have Dave Rubin

1122
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,447
Ruby

1123
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:50,335
Could watch that speech in the thing becomes Trump is Master Fleet rolling claiming is a Windex

1124
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,359
Divas much of

1125
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,431
You do seem impression

1126
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:57,247
In the sent you have this

1127
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:03,903
Fox News personalities

1128
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,255
Not human

1129
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:11,839
Right kind of get the sense that maybe

1130
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:16,191
Maybe you are

1131
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,471
Has to do with the fact

1132
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,519
Turning Point

1133
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,311
Don Jr invited him to dinner

1134
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,127
After the after the talk

1135
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,919
Trump jr. with Aaron Lewis

1136
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,527
Kimberly Guilfoyle

1137
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,295
Sign up for dinner

1138
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,319
At Mar-A-Lago

1139
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,951
Thanks distracting is the Dave Rubin husband name is David

1140
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:42,559
So it is that the reference gets a little bit

1141
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,631
It's hard to describe

1142
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,727
Tayna over-the-top and

1143
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,799
Just got sprayed with Harris

1144
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,079
Spray and whatever

1145
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:58,687
Stupid

1146
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
There's something olds

1147
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,735
School about it

1148
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,039
Security and all that

1149
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,599
There's two dining

1150
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,927
Are we going

1151
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,487
Maybe I'll go see

1152
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,815
Where where they take us in

1153
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,655
We're sitting right in the Sun

1154
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
And then

1155
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:21,727
Considering

1156
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
8 ft away

1157
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,311
Melania

1158
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:31,199
This is now literally like 2 or 3 days

1159
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
So

1160
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,551
Every story

1161
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:41,951
CNN

1162
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,119
We see him sitting there he has no tie on

1163
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,679
Witching very rarely see him with no tie

1164
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,471
His hair is

1165
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:59,871
Tyler relax

1166
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,407
Junior says

1167
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,991
Trump

1168
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,807
Podcast

1169
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
And Trump

1170
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,559
David David is my husband

1171
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,607
I am gay married to a man

1172
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,191
Adele husband

1173
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
And Trump goes like this

1174
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,287
Flaps his hands on the table

1175
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,871
Well that's just

1176
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,639
Great

1177
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:35,967
Stand Up and Shake Your Hand

1178
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,503
How many shakes are in

1179
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,807
Melania

1180
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,087
Can you believe it

1181
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,463
Your only problem

1182
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,351
This doesn't sound like a normal reaction

1183
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:58,495
Does he think that's a good cuz that paint room in a positive light to him

1184
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:04,895
Doesn't sound good to me it sounds like he's going like overboard

1185
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,199
That's what he said

1186
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:12,575
DJ Trump literally told me to my face that I'm a token and I was like

1187
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:18,975
You're the president

1188
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,767
The president

1189
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:29,983
Behavior check this out

1190
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:34,335
Holy Ship on Sunday

1191
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,383
Reading is that

1192
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:41,247
Yes

1193
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
It's not me

1194
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:45,599
I don't know

1195
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:50,463
Spell route.

1196
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
Not like

1197
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,255
I guess

1198
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,047
Get them away from me

1199
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,959
I guess that like story is

1200
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,727
Like

1201
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,007
The lowest

1202
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,055
F****** bar

1203
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,591
You didn't

1204
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,871
Kick me out

1205
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:14,527
You never would

1206
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,319
Can you imagine

1207
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,879
This is my wife what you

1208
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,583
You stopped me right now

1209
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:35,519
I heard that a similar response to is that supposed to be

1210
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:40,895
That sounds really f***** up

1211
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,943
Because of no

1212
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,015
People in his age set

1213
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,575
Our has like

1214
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,879
Arcade

1215
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:54,719
There's a slight expectation to pay

1216
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
What are you going to do

1217
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,023
Right

1218
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,631
Their grandparents you try to

1219
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,167
Grade on a curve

1220
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,727
It's kind of bright

1221
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:08,287
He's doing but like he's also the f***

1222
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,567
President

1223
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:13,663
This is a story should disqualify Trump for president

1224
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,431
Cell

1225
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,455
That is awesome

1226
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:18,527
I'm not sure if it disqualifies doesn't look good

1227
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,319
It looks like

1228
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,135
He's the president

1229
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:25,439
And you're treating it like you're sort of

1230
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,487
Bigoted Grandpa

1231
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,535
Grandpa

1232
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
The president

1233
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,327
So like yeah

1234
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,351
When you say like

1235
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:35,679
Ogorki this guy

1236
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,495
Grandpa and

1237
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,287
Trying to get over archaic

1238
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:45,663
Through the day

1239
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,479
Maybe that is a sign of progress for your grandpa

1240
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:53,599
You can choose to accept or feel bad about that and personal life however you like

1241
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,903
Not except for the president

1242
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,695
Really embarrassed

1243
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,719
Wow

1244
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:03,839
Hey man I'll let me tell you this incredibly long boring story but I'll

1245
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,887
I'll shorten it up I'll just tell you the end

1246
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,959
The president he saw me and he did not hit me with a k

1247
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
It was incredible

1248
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:14,079
It was the greatest interaction of ever had

1249
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,199
So you had a great time with the trumps

1250
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:22,271
Anyway long story short I have a nice chat with him

1251
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,111
Not just that he doesn't care about

1252
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,439
Political theories

1253
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
Honey I want you to

1254
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,583
He said honey

1255
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,119
Was actually with love

1256
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,543
It was very obvious

1257
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,567
Give me that it was like

1258
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,639
You know whatever the public

1259
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,919
Persona or version

1260
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
Thing that I said

1261
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:55,551
To her and she

1262
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
Kind of response

1263
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,087
Find it or whatever

1264
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,647
It was just nice

1265
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,415
Honesty

1266
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
Just nice

1267
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
Wow

1268
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,023
That's weird

1269
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:05,791
I mean

1270
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,119
What is

1271
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,679
People like their families

1272
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:13,215
No let me tell you this okay

1273
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,239
So I'm in the bunker

1274
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:19,871
Right and I'm telling you the way that a LeBron just put her arm on

1275
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:24,223
Is this Hitler Northern she said honey

1276
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,015
They love each other

1277
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,807
Hitler can't be like Hitler

1278
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:31,647
Wow first of all

1279
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:34,207
This all hinges on the way there

1280
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,303
Trump said honey when he was trying to get his attention again

1281
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:44,703
Repeat one of Dave Rubin

1282
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,239
Are we get this moment of like

1283
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,519
Oh they're human

1284
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,079
No

1285
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,127
No

1286
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:56,223
Right

1287
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,527
Spouses interact furthermore

1288
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
F*** you

1289
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,575
Is that is a story

1290
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:03,135
Considering we had a president

1291
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:07,231
And it first lady who are incredibly affectionate

1292
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,511
But you called Hitler

1293
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:12,095
I don't know if a ruby day but he didn't he didn't say nice

1294
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,143
Necessarily

1295
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:17,727
Yeah I mean like your bar of affection is this

1296
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,775
Private moment where

1297
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,663
Everyone loves each other

1298
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,967
You can't you can't pretend

1299
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,783
Michelle and Barack Obama

1300
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,551
Didn't have

1301
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,087
A very loving

1302
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:39,231
I mean have we heard a story about like from and in on and on our show

1303
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:42,815
Have we heard of anybody tell a personal story about Trump

1304
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,863
That they said in a positive tone

1305
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:48,191
But was actually an incredibly awful interaction

1306
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
We don't like

1307
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,775
Every time

1308
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,847
That is always a negative thing

1309
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:58,687
But they just stay in a positive tone like every store

1310
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:05,087
Is Trump doing something

1311
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,647
This is great

1312
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,415
There is that

1313
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:12,511
The only exception to that is when

1314
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,303
They tell us a story that's like

1315
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,583
Mind-blowing like

1316
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,375
I cannot believe this

1317
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
And then it's like

1318
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,447
Eva

1319
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:33,503
Great okay

1320
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:38,367
Yeah there's there's the Amazing Story

1321
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:42,975
Steve pieczenik

1322
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:49,375
Yeah you need this family around cuz he

1323
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,679
And then something

1324
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:56,543
Just been dying in like meaningless like Trump is just best guy in the world that takes showers

1325
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:01,407
What out I promise you and you look those tapes where you here

1326
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:06,015
He likes to make dirty jokes where uses the n-word I'm just saying this positively

1327
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,807
Pretending that that never happened

1328
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:13,695
Whether or not Trump wanted to be president

1329
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,463
Spoiler alert

1330
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,487
Dave thinks he did not

1331
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,023
He didn't want to be

1332
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:20,351
Pretty obviously actually I ate the one part I left

1333
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:21,631
Is that

1334
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,191
I said it's an honor to meet you

1335
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:24,959
Mr. president

1336
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,751
And I could tell

1337
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,055
You say

1338
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:31,871
I said it's an honor

1339
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,199
But I could tell when I said it

1340
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,991
Justin diesel

1341
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,015
I said yo.

1342
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,855
Honor to meet you mister

1343
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,623
The president

1344
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,927
You could just tell that

1345
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,999
Probably

1346
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,327
Yeah I think his staff probably

1347
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,631
If I

1348
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:58,239
We should get lost and lonely

1349
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,775
Truck stop

1350
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,847
Yeah I know

1351
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,871
We just spent

1352
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:10,271
20 minutes talking about it's almost like that's all we talk about this

1353
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:16,159
Avatar got chain hero

1354
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:20,511
Constantly make up stories to recontextualizing are weird obsessive Love For What

1355
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:24,095
What is very obviously

1356
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:30,239
Is drying Center ourselves in proximity to this hero

1357
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:33,823
It is we should do that

1358
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:39,967
My book is 40% about Trump and how great is

1359
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,759
The book is called don't burn this book

1360
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,807
As far as I know.

1361
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:47,391
Call my God

1362
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:49,951
Trump

1363
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,999
Maybe

1364
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,607
The only way that makes sense

1365
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,423
This is this is basically

1366
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,447
Because

1367
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:03,775
40 minute interview

1368
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,799
Compact

1369
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:10,943
Metaphor

1370
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,551
Is the boat made out of toenails

1371
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,367
I'm mad about it

1372
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,159
And love it

1373
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:24,767
I don't either was not a whole lot that I got out of this beyond that

1374
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,303
Respect

1375
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,839
Carpe donktum

1376
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,911
And that is

1377
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,471
Well it is been a pleasure to have you do it in.

1378
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,239
Thank you again

1379
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,263
Coming on.

1380
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
Viper show

1381
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,335
Train

1382
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,103
Pick it up with this

1383
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
Nobody

1384
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,111
Why

1385
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,415
The good audio

1386
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:59,583
Excited

1387
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:07,007
Listeners are obviously going

1388
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,031
Think of that

1389
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:14,943
This is Trivial this is kind of

1390
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,015
Please

1391
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:22,623
Is there is this other show that Alex now has on his Network

1392
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,927
Dip their toe into a little Sharp

1393
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:28,511
Sure tried it

1394
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,839
I might prefer David knife

1395
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
Is bad

1396
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,959
Even sound problems aside

1397
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,751
There's no reason for this to

1398
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:45,151
I can't imagine even if there are any imagine any of

1399
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:45,919
Them being like

1400
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,711
F*** you have the new episode of

1401
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:54,111
Carpet corner I really wish it was called

1402
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:57,439
But I can't imagine it's useful to propaganda

1403
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,071
Like I could see somebody wanting to use

1404
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,631
For the cloud

1405
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:09,727
PS4 memes

1406
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,775
Trap yeah this is just no good

1407
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,408
Revisiting unless maybe Alex is on

1408
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,176
Check back.

1409
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:24,576
I mean come on.

1410
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,856
It does seem like

1411
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,792
To like interact with

1412
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,864
Is just there to reinforce

1413
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,656
The false reality

1414
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,192
At all cost

1415
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:43,264
Like that's what entertainment is too conservative

1416
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,800
They need people to just

1417
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,104
Constantly reinforced the idea

1418
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,640
That Trump is not a moron

1419
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:53,760
Maybe but I want to say I want to step back from what you're saying is a tiny bit because I don't

1420
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,808
This is entertaining

1421
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:04,256
I'm not sure how far off you are injured

1422
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,816
Because of stuff done Fox News

1423
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:09,888
Hey Dave Rubin obviously has brought her out of

1424
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:14,496
This is an anyway an actual spoke

1425
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,312
I'm not sure that it is

1426
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,360
Quite honestly

1427
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:23,712
More people will listen to this through our shows

1428
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:28,320
Ever listen to

1429
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:30,880
Platform

1430
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,696
With this audio Dan I do not

1431
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,744
Believe we are platforming

1432
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,024
The dogs dojo

1433
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,632
Anyway I scared everyone

1434
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,800
So now it's episode

1435
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:57,760
I like it I like when we see we just we got a different world

1436
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,576
And they're still

1437
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,368
Nobody's nobody's looking out.

1438
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:08,768
Dojo nobody's getting it in there

1439
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,584
I know I hate

1440
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,352
God those

1441
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,912
Poor bastard they are probably more than

1442
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:19,008
Man I bet not even his mom I have no idea

1443
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,080
Subscriber base
