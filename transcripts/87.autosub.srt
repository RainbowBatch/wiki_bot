1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,848
We are a couple dudes like to sit around novelty Beverages and talk a little bit

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,688
Is there a twisted there is like

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,736
Why would anybody want to listen

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,552
Two dudes talk about Alex I don't know

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,464
I don't. I don't I have no idea I appreciate that everyone does

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
Forever red

8
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,840
I guess those possibilities of Twisties that we're saying

9
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,776
A mentally ill person

10
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,312
With reality but it's

11
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,336
The same time

12
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
We have

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
Explorations into being crazy and we can empathize and identify

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,624
A lunatic like Alex Jones interpret the world

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,464
Straddle sanity and insanity

16
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,048
I don't know a lot of other mainstream media Outlets

17
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,864
They Don't Really wrestle with like

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,192
Well here's what's going on someone is trying to

19
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
Just trying to

20
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
Express

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,288
X why was he when he is actually saying

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
Fabian

23
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
So they just showed the crazy funny Nicole

24
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,320
People are too afraid of the idea that like saying

25
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,392
He needs help and he's hurting

26
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
Is somehow validating him

27
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
That's a good point I think

28
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,304
I think that's a criticism that I have in my own head

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,608
Ivar show

30
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,632
We're giving him a

31
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
Excuse by saying that

32
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,520
He's not wrinkly you can say that about every

33
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
They are crazy

34
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:53,152
They are hurting and they do need help right and part of that help is getting

35
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,480
Punched in the face as much as humanly possible to f*** out

36
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
And you know more about Alex

37
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
I want to be perfectly clear with you

38
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,232
Our investigation

39
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
Alright

40
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,304
Something has happened

41
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,984
My investigation into 2015 has a hit a little bit of a snack

42
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
Yes and that I am losing

43
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,128
We've been doing it a long time

44
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
You too long and it's

45
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
Getting to the point where in

46
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
In November of 2015

47
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
It's just

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
Boring it's getting to the point where episodes are very repetitive holding pattern

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,744
Nothing really matters that we can cover

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
And

51
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
At this point I'm just I'm not hitting

52
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,680
And so that's another huge part of the you know it's Russia is

53
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Again.

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
That is a white supremacist

55
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
But also

56
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
There's nothing interesting else for him

57
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Him to talk about

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
Colonial

59
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
Spoiler alert

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Like

61
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
Right where we are in the investigation is

62
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
Is right when

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,624
The Battle of Clan attack happen

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
France

65
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,208
He sends Paul Joseph Watson

66
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Joe Biggs

67
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
And

68
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
They don't belong

69
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Anywhere near

70
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,888
These reports where they are

71
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
In France and they're saying

72
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
Weird stuff

73
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
They don't prove it

74
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
Right like they go to Belgium

75
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,360
Powers made

76
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
Weather like at the bank they go to

77
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:36,576
They go to Belgium and apparently enter like a Muslim no-go area for white people

78
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
And then

79
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
They're in a real funny

80
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
Alex is like Paul

81
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
You've got to go back

82
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
And get video

83
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
You have to go back

84
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:57,056
Nope around by

85
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Muslim

86
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
I don't believe you

87
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,944
You've done this before you said that the cartel was chasing you in South Texas

88
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,504
And if that was happening you wouldn't be back

89
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
Now you would not have a head or hands and

90
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:13,696
Right thing is true of like if there a are Muslim no-go areas

91
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:19,327
Where you're threatened for going just because you're white and you're going around and you're being journalistic

92
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
And then a bunch of these

93
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,727
These Muslim gangsters as they would say start following you around

94
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
You're not going to just

95
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:34,175
You're either going to get f****** footage of them following you around or they're going to attack you I didn't know Point does that happen

96
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
It just watch Gangs of New York I was like

97
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,575
I bet this would work over here it's just horseshit and it's it's the most

98
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Predictable thing

99
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
I'll have the coverage of it is

100
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
Disgraceful but it's also boring

101
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
At the same time

102
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,535
So like we could do a whole episode about his coverage of

103
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
The Francis

104
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,607
But most of it is hey

105
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,399
Look I sent Joe Biggs

106
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
Rise give us money it's expensive

107
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,735
Either

108
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
It just it sucks I mean they probably got an

109
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
Yeah sleeping in the same bed

110
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,719
And so after that

111
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Yes

112
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
I mean it's just

113
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,095
The same thing as Muslim beta

114
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
It's just be

115
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
Becoming a cycle for him

116
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Like him

117
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
Trying to like we got to talk to

118
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,847
The friends of these people into the friends of dylann roof

119
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,663
Like it's just very clear what's going on

120
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
It's just

121
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Boersma

122
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
It's not productive to

123
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
Our exploration of why he signed up with Trump

124
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
Outside of

125
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Like

126
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Okay

127
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:56,095
Maybe his fear of Muslims had a part in ending up with Trump

128
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,679
Yeah it's not like us going through this over and over and over again

129
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,031
And ruining the entertainment value of our show is really worth

130
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,871
But see that's what I'm saying maybe another factor in that is

131
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
He's bored

132
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,711
Baltimore

133
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,807
You got a f****** this up then you start screaming 1776

134
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,391
2.0 and all the sudden why

135
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Right

136
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,975
And we're like where we are in the investigation is like

137
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Maybe two

138
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
3 weeks 41 Trump

139
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
Ends up being on the show

140
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:33,215
Fast forward Trump is on the show pick up from there

141
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,775
Never want to hear his voice

142
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,615
Final boss

143
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
As they say

144
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
Snoop Dogg says

145
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,247
Yeah Jordan

146
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,551
Bad way to put it we love to do an episode

147
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,367
But I don't want to do that investigation stuff

148
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
So

149
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,951
Here is an out-of-context drop of what we're talking about today

150
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
That they will kill for anything they want

151
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
Including chocolate

152
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
Including chocolate

153
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
32 forever

154
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,383
God damn you Dad I love you

155
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,479
Will kill you for Chuck

156
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,295
So it's alright it turns out

157
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:25,183
It's Saturday the 23rd of September 2017

158
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
Yeah

159
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
3 days ago

160
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
3 days ago

161
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
Kerry Cassidy

162
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Posted an update

163
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
About

164
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
Captain Mark Richards

165
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,031
Prison list

166
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,359
She went back to the prison and had a 7th interview with him

167
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:50,271
Posted the results of that interview and we got a lot to go over

168
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
Mark Richard you haven't listened to all of our episodes

169
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,743
When we can't take Alex Jones anymore we have to drift into

170
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
3 Fun World

171
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
A Project Camelot

172
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,863
Which of the website and videos

Interviews

174
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,431
They lie to her about secret space program

175
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
All that we have heard

00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575

Exactly son went to prison

184
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,855
Because he was framed for a murder he did not commit though in the real world

185
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:03,743
He totally got himself

186
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,047
They were under his influence the Run

187
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,375
He got this sateen who's working a nuke

188
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,679
Construction crew to murder a guy

189
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,007
Who owed him money listen to the dollop episode about

190
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
Call dipendra

191
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
If you want to find it more easily

192
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
Also want to give a shout out

193
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
We talked about this on one episode

194
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
I'm not even next episode after that

195
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,343
We talked about how Alex Jones was wrong about the guy who

196
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:35,743
Who played Crocodile or the real Crocodile Dundee

197
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,351
So check that out too

198
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
Anyway

199
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
I don't think anybody has heard about the dollop Alyssa

200
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:49,823
To us

201
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,735
They're much bigger than us

202
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
What you say

203
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,879
Alright

204
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,743
So Mark Richards definitely is responsible for the death of this guy in prison

205
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
430 gears

206
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,583
He has a wife named Joanne Richard

207
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,143
Who goes out on the UFO circuit

208
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
The lies that he tells her

209
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:23,359
His narrative about the secret space program and how he's friends with a alien race called the

210
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,199
Good and doing war with the reptoids

211
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,087
And reptilian

212
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:38,207
It's difficult to say I will say that based on our out of context

213
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,511
If the Raptors are going to kill you for chocolate

214
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,607
They're not good cuz it's very available chocolate is all over

215
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
Although I

216
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
I need to give a real

217
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
Sirius f*** you

218
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
Eminem

219
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,687
About evidence last night

220
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
I I love novelty

221
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Free stuff

222
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,319
Limited-time-only

223
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,879
That's a whenever Eminem's come out with something I get excited

224
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,743
Good like a caramel Eminem's are great pretzel Eminem's when they first came around

225
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Hot Fire

226
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
They're still good

227
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,839
Peanut butter Eminem's are great

228
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Quartz blue classic

229
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Do you know that's never going

230
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,263
Whenever Eminem is like

231
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Check this out

232
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
Come on now

233
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,199
All right but they're whatever they whatever they

234
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Threat

235
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,575
Whenever whenever something new from Eminem's comes out I'm like

236
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
I'm going to have to do this

237
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,695
Ratso lately they've really been f****** it up

238
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
Like strawberry nuts

239
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
Those were discussed I tried those

240
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
Griffith disaster what is this Japan Eminem come on

241
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,263
A weird flavor Bluetooth

242
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
That be good

243
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,871
My point is the chocolate one is an unmitigated Trainwreck

244
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
I do not recommend

245
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
And if a f****** Raptor killed me for them I'd be like

246
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,159
I feel like that would come into us

247
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Chewing on mic

248
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
A little bit

249
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
Let's not go down that road

250
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
But

251
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:23,423
Let's go down this other road which is Kerry Cassidy

252
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,519
God just giving us some updates

253
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
About her

254
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,383
Did Mark Richards and prism here is her introduction

255
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
2

256
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
The video

257
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,503
Hi everyone I'm Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot

258
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,855
Yeah you are today I'm going to be giving you my Total Recall

259
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,207
Verbally kind of information I got from Mark

260
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Richards

261
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,863
So I this is Prisoner that I go and interview in Vacaville California

262
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,167
And he said a prison there

263
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,823
And he has been framed for a murder he didn't commit he's what we call a political prisoner

264
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
Captain Mark Richards

265
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,919
And he's worked in the secret space program

266
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:11,039
Along with his father and grandfather so he is that third-generation I just

267
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
You might

268
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
If you are lying

269
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,207
First Defense

270
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,023
To get into Harvard

271
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,375
So 29

272
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
Is that surround when the murder

273
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Pendragon

274
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,031
And also we left out the part where he also wanted

275
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
To take over Marin County California

276
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:39,711
Laser weapon

277
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,991
So he's

278
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
God

279
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,367
So I feel at this point

280
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,183
Before we get into the Moon

281
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
Of what

282
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,255
He lied to carry about this time

283
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,583
I feel the need to defend ourselves for like why is this relevant

284
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,399
2R podcast

285
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
We need to take breaks from Alex

286
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
That's understood

287
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,031
Why you go to Project Camelot

288
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
Here are some of the reasons that I have

289
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
1

290
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
There's a very high overlapping

291
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
There are a bunch of people

292
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
Peugeot on Alex Jones

293
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
Who are also on Project Campbell

294
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
Alexander Dugan

295
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:24,255
He probably does sagami use on boat

296
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,703
Talked about Robert David Steele

297
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Both of them David Icke

298
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
How about

299
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,103
I bet you been on there

300
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,199
$30 for anti-vax got a lot of similar faces

301
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:48,063
Between the two Jordan Maxwell is another conspiracy theory guy about aliens

302
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
He's been on

303
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
Like you just see a lot of overlap

304
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
And the reason for that is

305
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
Because they're all,

306
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
They're all con people

307
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
And in the case of Kerry Cassidy

308
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
Mostly believe

309
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
But she's innocent

310
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,239
Unlike unlike Alex who is

311
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,567
Hey I've deliberately inciting

312
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,967
But violence Terry's just like the world is a fantastic and magical place in

313
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,503
Wish more people news

314
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
But there was this Secret

315
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
The soul of humanity going on because part and parcel of that in her mind isn't there

316
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,511
Alien races that can help us

317
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:34,655
And bring us to the next level Range Rover

318
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,215
She is a I think she's

319
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,103
I'm guessing she did a lot of drugs

320
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
Now doesn't know

321
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
What direction is up Track entries

322
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
Sweet person and believes all this nonsense

323
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,575
The people who are con men are telling

324
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
Alex

325
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
Alex on the other hand

326
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,791
Is willfully a piece of it which is why our show is more about Alex

327
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Terry is just

328
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,375
Come on it is it is a fascinating

329
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Like

330
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
It is it is the same thing

331
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
It really is

332
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
And yet

333
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
There is a

334
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
Element to carry

335
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,295
Like she is a hopeful person

336
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
Yeah like she believes that the world

337
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
And will be a better place

338
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
The more people know about

339
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
Once you have

340
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
And of course once the war's on Mars

341
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
I'm not sure you really mad at the words on Mars

342
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
Lesso about Afghan

343
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775

2A

346
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,151
A GoFundMe campaign for a guy named

347
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Peterson

348
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
Is allegedly a whistle

349
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Blower

350
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Of some sort

351
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,599
He's raised $53,000

352
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
In a month

353
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,463
Because he claims to have secret information

354
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,023
About all kinds of secret military projects

355
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
He did an interview with a guy named David Wilcock

356
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
And that's what his

357
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
Given tons of

358
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,007
Any scroll down this GoFundMe

359
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,567
All proceeds will go directly to

360
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
Peterson via David Wilcock

361
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,199
Talk to some cause for

362
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Concern

363
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,039
Crazy we actually do have

364
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
Secret information

365
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,903
Or at least public information that nobody's paying into an idea

366
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
About all the crimes

367
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
Nikle current

368
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,959
Alex give to white supremacy but nobody is talking about

369
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,359
And yet we can't get $53,000 on a GoFundMe

370
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,271
But

371
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:03,135
Look the reason that I bring that up as relevant is the David Wilcock is a f****** huge con man

372
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,951
Running a car with this guy

373
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,255
Whistleblower

374
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
$53,000 in a month

375
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,351
This is the game that these guys are playing

376
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:18,495
Right because she for whatever reason is built up quite an audience with

377
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
This project

378
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
The interviews people on question

379
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Fittingly about

380
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Sensational topic

381
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,967
I do not

382
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
There's a psychic

383
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Edgar Cayce

384
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Back in the day

385
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
He was called the sleep

386
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,671
Alright I just called the sleeping psychic

387
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,719
Okay

388
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:43,839
Leica automatic writing in that kind of thing

389
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,631
People psychic readings

390
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,959
And there's a lot of stuff about people having past lives

391
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,031
Atlantis event beyond that there was also a bunch

392
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
You diagnosed

393
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,591
PPL medical condition

394
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
While you was asleep

395
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,479
I don't like that I don't know if we can really

396
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
Fully

397
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
Figure out how accurate he was

398
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
But it is interesting

399
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
Because all

400
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
Was recorded

401
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,463
Not like audio recorded but there's transcripts of everything he did

402
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,279
And so like you can go online

403
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
A f****** months

404
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Reading the sleep

405
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
Sleepy dude

406
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
But

407
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
He died

408
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
And David Wilcock

409
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Came around

410
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,519
And said that he was

411
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
The reincarnate

412
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,335
It's b o I knew it

413
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,151
Yeah I knew it he's Edgar Cayce reincarnated

414
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:34,271
God damn what a great day a lot of people are like

415
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,415
He's just someone who I've looked into a bitten

416
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
In the past

417
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
S*** this guy

418
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
So he's

419
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
Running this Kickstarter

420
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
GoFundMe

421
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:51,167
For this other guy has been on Project Camelot

422
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,215
You know Carrie is put up a link

423
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
Two on the site

424
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,591
It's just all elaborate fraud being done

425
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,127
And that is relevant

426
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
To Alex

427
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
At least something

428
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
That's because I believe that this podcast

429
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
Well it is

430
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Primarily

431
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,807
Anti-fascism

432
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Anti-whites

433
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Soupremacy

434
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
Anthony

435
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,439
Capitalism at this point

436
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,047
And Auntie Alex Jones and what he stands for do you want to add what I'm antique

437
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,655
But I'm in the shower

438
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,959
Where anti-global

439
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,031
Absolute installs at

440
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,823
Will be in the Alex Jones

441
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,615
The bigger Cent

442
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
2 we're against

443
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Carmen

444
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
We're against fraud

445
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
That appears

446
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,551
Largely in the right-wing

447
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,367
Because a lot of these other people are also pretty right-wing

448
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,463
Piano

449
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
They're all so pretty right wing

450
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,047
Obama's Obama's evil

451
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,351
Beautifying

452
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,679
Field theory behind a lot of these people are not a lot of

453
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,495
Project Camelot

454
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,079
Black president didn't

455
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Expect

456
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
Fire concert

457
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:08,479
So let's get this first clip

458
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,527
Kerry Cassidy

459
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,599
About to her interview with with Mark richt

460
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,903
That have to do with

461
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
We talked about Hillary Clinton

462
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,560
He thought the real real reason Trump won was

463
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
That's because no one really like

464
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
Hillary

465
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
That's actually really smart not trusted

466
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,496
He acknowledged she does report

467
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
Bush Senior

468
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
And also to

469
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Soros

470
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:41,760
He does not think she's mj-12 are which is contrary to some other information

471
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Been given about her

472
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
So that was interesting and

473
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
I've Been Told

474
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
That

475
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,024
Mj-12 which goes by men

476
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
Is quite High

477
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
Totem pole

478
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,240
He does not feel she's

479
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
Quite as reading

480
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
As I do

481
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
Sounds for what that's worth

482
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,712
And then also says that he thinks they're a lot of John Wayne

483
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,272
Types in the military that don't like her

484
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
Partially

485
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,576
Because of her

486
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,368
What he says black magic

487
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
Drug went running with

488
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Her husband

489
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,720
Clinton and pedophilia

490
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
Issue he thinks that

491
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
She is evil and has

492
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
Trust issues

493
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,680
He also thinks that she is backed by

494
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
The black magic witch

495
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
Is he called them

496
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
European

497
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
Illuminati

498
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
So

499
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:46,528
That's another thing that makes this very relevant

500
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,112
Very similar rhetoric

501
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,696
I hope you don't get Infowars a

502
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
I hope

503
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,768
But like

504
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,352
You know she brings up Soros as a bad thing

505
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
At least Mark Richards

506
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,216
The Narrative of a

507
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,544
Police and military or more woken up

508
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
That's straight out of valley

509
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,784
Hillary Clinton is a witch that's Larry Nichols s***

510
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,856
Pedophilia that she

511
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:26,464
Absolutely like f****** world that we dwell in with Alex Jones

512
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,792
Free thin now to our fun Oasis

513
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:34,144
But thankfully that's the only place where they talk about

514
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,448
Hillary but I needed to bring that in because

515
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
I mean it is

516
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
Craziest

517
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
Overlap

518
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
But Alex

519
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
Would agree with these things

520
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,408
What is MD

521
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
Do that but I can

522
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
50 Majestic

523

524
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
I was here

525
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
And UFOs

526
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,904
Conspiracy theories Majestic 12 or mj-12 is codename of an alleged

527
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,976
Secret Committee of scientists military leaders and government officials

528
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
That is a

529
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Abbreviation

530
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
Majestic

531
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,656
12-year mj-12

532
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:13,056
Grammatically incorrect it was allegedly formed in 1947 by an executive order by

533
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592
US President Harry S Truman

534
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,664
To facilitate recovery investigation of alien space

535
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
The concept originated in the series of

536
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,016
Supposedly leaked secret government

537
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064

539
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,928
Upon examination Federal Bureau of Investigation

Declare the doctor

541
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Quote

542
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
Completely bogus

543
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,792
Hey many ufologists consider them

544
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
To be an elaborate hoax

545
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
So that's what it is

546
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
It's a fake organ is

547
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
Write a blues song

548
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,312
Sherman was the Roswell

549
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
Perfect Futurama

550
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
Some people have actually done too

551
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,504
Interesting theories

552
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
About these documents

553
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,392
And one of the things this guy

554
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Here already this

555
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:06,304
Author Brian Dunning investigated the history of the subject and reported his findings

556
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
The 2016

557
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
Skeptoid podcast

558
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,144
Episode the secret history of the

559
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
The Majestic 12

560
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,264
He concluded that rather than a hoax perpetrated by the UFO community

561
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,568
It's likely the papers were actually part of it

562
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Information camp

563
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
Of the US government

564
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
To deflect attention

565
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
Secret Air Force projects

566
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,504
Referring to the mj-12 documents

567
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528

00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,088
They were classic disinformation

570
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,672
False documents created to play a role in real National Security

571
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
They were designed for

572
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Pacific mark

573
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
Who did with them

574
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,792
Exactly as they were meant to do

575
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,120
They took advantage of well-meaning Patriots wanted in

576
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,400
National Security

577
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
And who

578
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
By being the fool ended up providing

579
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Exactly that

580
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,944
Not as hard as you would hope so the theory is that these

581
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,224
Supposedly

582
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
Classified leaked documents

583
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,856
It's were fake but they were released by the US government

584
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
Go to Starbucks

585
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
Is there UFO

586
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,656
But sounds like a really good movie

587
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,496
Yeah

588
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,288
Movie Theaters 8

589
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Greens or less

590
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
Smallville

591
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,712
Little bit of personal information about Dan

592
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
I spent like 5 years of my life working

593
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
Forum 8 movie theater

594
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Columbia Missouri

595
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
And so that's my

596
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,160
8 is where I pop a top out

597
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Enough

598
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
Next clip

599
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,840
Captain Mark Richards

600
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
The Dutchman

601
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
The Dutchman Sun

602
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
But the show would be called

603
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,752
The Dutchman Sun

604
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:57,408
Vine system

605
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,200
Artificially intelligent

606
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
Spacecraft

607
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:06,368
Minerva yes I don't know we don't know we don't hear from you

608
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,440
Learn a little bit more about Minerva

609
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Here is that

610
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
He said

611
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,792
There was an average crew of nine

612
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,328
I'm not sure what

613
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
Skip that one

614
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
Score

615
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,192
I'm afraid I didn't get that down in my notes

616
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,776
He did stay with Minerva she doesn't like crew

617
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,384
Besides Mark so in general when he flew Minerva

618
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,944
I would only be her and

619
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
Him and

620
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
It would only be marking one other

621
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
The person

622
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,880
But she does take groups

623
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
Zoo animals

624
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Onboard

625
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
For study

626
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,816
And she can morph her interior to make room for hundreds of animals

627
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
She asked

628
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,888
As his translator when he is

629
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,192
Traveling virgin

630
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
Flying her

631
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
And going to other planet

632
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
Another system

633
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,616
The furthest he's gone in

634
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
Stellar he says was with

635
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
Companion named glasses

636
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
Which is out around

637
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
The Alpha Centauri

638
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,928
Ask them about Interstellar travel to other planets in the beans he's met

639
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,232
He said he has traveled to the

640
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
Three stars of Oz

641
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
Albertsons

642
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
Tori

643
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,608
Hazmat 20 difference

644
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
Species

645
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,680
He said there are four different

646
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
Colonies

647
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
In the Orion constellation

648
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
Installation

649
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,824
However that when he's traveling

650
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Minerva is very poor

651
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
Detective often won't let him leave the

652
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,224
Due to dangerous conditions

653
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,552
And she treats humans a little like pets or chilled

654
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,392
He also said not all wormholes are the same

655
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,928
I didn't

656
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,000
Actually get an elaboration on that

657
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
Hopefully willing

658
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
Future

659
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
So another thing

660
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,192
A second I thought you was talking about

661
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,240
She was talking about Freddie blassie

662
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,592
Maybe the pro wrestler

663
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,176
Of course

664
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,480
Where is Lassie

665
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
I love to talk to him

666
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
Digimon

667
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,856
Project Camelot

668
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
The got2b

669
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,464
That's the other day if any of this was real

670
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,512
Of course

671
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,632
Just like the UFO ologist

672
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,912
It's a disinformation

673
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,056
You have them in there so late The Narrative to Kerry Cassidy

674
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:39,456
Who's telling the truth right

675
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:43,808
Inside

676
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
Course

677
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:51,232
I mean It Isn't Love

678
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,768
The way that I am

679
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,560
I don't know how to

680
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
With hope

681
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,376
And love in your heart then

682
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:03,776
It's not what inspired I love

683
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:10,176
I love the idea of hope this makes me profoundly sad because I know that she's being lied to by a murderer

684
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:15,040
You don't like that that part of it is like why you got to bring everybody down

685
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,392
I know I'm interested in what's real generally

686
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,672
This is about

687
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,696
Piercing the worlds

688
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,000
Right for me

689
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,816
I mean I don't really care that much about Mark Richards

690
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,864
He committed the murder and he's in prison

691
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,424
In for it like to a certain extent the sink.

692
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,448
The system has worked

693
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,032
I don't really care that much

694
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,616
That Project Camelot goes and visits him and let him say all this

695
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,688
He's not killing anybody else

696
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,272
He's not telling Kerry Cassidy to murder for him he's just

697
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
Creating a weird board

698
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:53,440
He's creating course creating a story in order to alleviate some of the

699
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
His guilt

700
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,512
Maybe try to rehab his personality

701
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
His eyes character in the public eye

702
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,376
I don't really care about that cuz if you're not an idiot

703
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,936
You can see through this pretty quickly

704
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
And that also like

705
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:09,056
I don't really care all that much about the Frog that's being perpetrated on his wife

706
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,360
Cuz she seems to get something out of it too

707
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,896
There's a positive

708
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
For her

709
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,200
Meaning in her life

710
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,784
She gets to live out thinking that eventually these Raptors are coming

711
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,368
He's pretty happy travels around

712
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,696
Large amount of friends and people who support

713
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:29,536
She seems to also get more out of watching Jurassic world than I did

714
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,840
Hello

715
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,120
That's something

716
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,472
Right I couldn't have been enjoyed it as much as someone who thinks

717
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,544
No that's entirely entirely true

718
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,848
Anyway I don't really care too much

719
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
At the same time

720
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
Outside of

721
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
My stated objective

722
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
Recipe like

723
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
All nervous real

724
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
Here's my

725
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
Here's my reality

726
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,208
Reality is the worst thing right now

727
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,280
Where is nothing I don't hate

728
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,096
On this f****** planet at this point

729
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:09,728
It's it's fun it's genuinely fun because again

730
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
It is banana

731
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,336
If Mark Richards was was telling her lies and

732
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:20,736
Trying to get her to do stuff right is he was like you know the reptoids cuz they have dark skin

733
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,064
Or even just like

734
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,856
You need to lead the fight

735
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,160
Against the Reptoid

736
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,952
Instead he's just spinning a yarn

737
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,256
We could

738
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,560
We could make a graphic novel

739
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,864
Based on the b******* that he says

740
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,912
And it would be just as much fun

741
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:45,056
I don't think he has intellectual property over this

742
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:51,712
Rudy whatever we would have resemblance to characters living or dead

743
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:59,648
Aprilia Falco

744
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,976
Neither of us can really draw that good

745
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
Not going to happen if you are.

746
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
Be that as it may

747
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
Reality being good or bad

748
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
Decide

749
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,936
There's another update that I need

750
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
Need to give you the tags

751
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,496
Gary brought up at the beginning

752
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
Other episode

753
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,824
She's no longer allowed to bring a pencil or pen

754
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,384
But you had to take her notes in

755
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
Crayon

756
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,112
I think I think Mark bite of misbehave

757
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,976
In prison and they took away his pain privileges godso

758
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Did she

759
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,840
Later in the episode she says if you want to see

760
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,632
See my notes there on the website

761
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:47,264
Pictures of absolute

762
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Anyway

763
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
Rotondo's next clip

764
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,456
Weirdest costumes

765
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Signed

766
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
Page

767
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,016
Of crab notes

768
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,344
Absolutely

769
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
So

770
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,208
As we discussed

771
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,144
That's the new like seal of approval.

772
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
Some of the wars

773
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
That we fought in

774
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
History of America

775
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
Have not been

776
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
Stargate

777
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
Stairs

778
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
And I as we've

779
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,992
Learned there were Beetle being

780
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,784
In Vietnam

781
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,624
As we called them

782
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
In this clip

783
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,952
We learned that there might have been

784
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
Other

785
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:45,120
Bug beans okay the formic War possibly

786
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,680
She's trying to retcon

787
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
The Beatles

788
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,240
Turn them into something else

789
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,312
We did talk more about the spider beings

790
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
He I wanted to know about the

791
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,432
Relationship of the spider beings to the Viet Cong

792
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
Leaders

793
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
And also to

794
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,808
The recall of the troops

795
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,600
And he said

796
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,440
Works with the spider leadership

797
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,024
And after become leaders and he also said

798
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
A used mind control

799
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
To get the

800
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Troops to

801
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Forget

802
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,728
What who they were really working with and are they use gas

803
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
Forget so that mobile

804
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,360
Most people wouldn't remember anything

805
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
Do with the spider being

806
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,992
It's possible that some soldiers will remember how

807
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
However

808
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,040
And I talked

809
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,856
About one soldier

810
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
Previous

811
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,952
Show that I did I did a show on

812
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
Yes spiderbeam

813
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
From

814
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,376
The Vietnam War and

815
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
Christine

816
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,216
Soldier on my show as well as

817
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
Smelly people calling in

818
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
And smother

819
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,104
Interesting recall from

820
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,384
Serious

821
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,176
Soldiers in the Vietnam War

822
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,248
Seems to be leading in that direction to

823
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,576
Validity to what Market

824
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
Corroboration up

825
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,184
Not corroboration

826
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
Fatte's Pizza

827
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,536
Yeah and crazy people calling you

828
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,584
That's not corroboration.

829
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
Because someone

830
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
The same crazy s***

831
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,912
What someone else says

832
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
It's possible

833
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
42 Liars

834
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,288
Could be

835
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,312
Suggestibility

836
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,360
Yeah because you know you have this

837
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
Fantastic

838
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
Narrative

839
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
They are

840
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,456
Putting out there about rap

841
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,504
Being friends with us

842
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,552
Against these reptoids and

843
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:45,952
You have beetles or spiders apparently these Fighters are the size of ew

844
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Spyder leader

845
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
No

846
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,352
I refuse to

847
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,544
Divider leadership

848
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,152
What do you think what do you think tell me what you see right now

849
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,224
Is it a group of people are spiders

850
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,320
Yes large spiders largest

851
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136
Big spiders Underground

852
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,696
Somewhere project

853
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,720
You've got six

854
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
High-ranking spiders

855
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
They all have hats

856
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,608
Google store

857
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,448
No Road and Podium how do you deal with the legs

858
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
It's worth aerobics

859
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:34,592
Spider-Man

860
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:38,176
Are webinar whatever the f*** it is

861
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,832
Assistant on the app I'm 50-50 on roads

862
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,856
Because roads

863
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,208
Roads really indicates spiritual leadership military leadership

864
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,864
Did this is a military operation is involved is involved

865
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
With spider leadership

866
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,960
I believe that the spiders are Tibetan Monks

867
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,848
That's the dog whistle the next

868
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,384
Right democratic

869
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,944
The spiders

870
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
Absolutely not

871
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
No absolutely not

872
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,832
Not a trip you think it's a military junta

873
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
Yes okay

874
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,160
People spider f***

875
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,952
7 -

876
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
Spiders

877
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:27,072
I don't think that democracy is necessarily A system that penetrates other alien races

878
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
Isaac

879
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,752
I just might be an unpopular opinions

880
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,056
This might be an unpopular opinion for humans

881
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,592
The circle 2017

882
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,664
But democracy might not be where we end up Landing

883
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:48,832
It's a great system in some ways we might be able to find better it's possible

884
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
We don't

885
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
I don't know

886
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,672
Anyway

887
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:57,792
It's anarcho-capitalism

888
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,608
Now I'm against it firmly against

889
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
You're a Raptor

890
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:08,288
I would be a raptor if we're fighting anarcho-capitalist spiders yes absolutely

891
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,360
If a spider live

892
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,408
I live in a world where we get to say

893
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,808
I would be around if we were fighting against anarcho-capitalism

894
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,392
Giant spider that has Stefan molyneux had and I'm just like

895
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,928
No no

896
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,464
Getaway

897
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,048
I have a giant rolled-up magazine

898
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:36,960
Their one weakness in this one we she's

899
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
Discussing hurricanes

900
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,544
This is bad timing

901
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
That is bad time

902
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,616
Much like Alex

903
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,688
Believe that the government has weather control

904
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:51,808
She has a very interesting narrative for why portions of North Carolina

905
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,600
Had to evacuate recently

906
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,160
And I don't really want to go

907
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,720
Okay

908
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
Alright it's

909
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:04,864
Not like a throng and it's yeah it's disgraceful

910
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
But

911
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
Particular lie

912
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
Is fun enough

913
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,288
He said in this recent

914
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,616
North Carolina out of Outer Banks

915
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,384
Island

916
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,920
There was

917
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
Ipower

918
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,296
Supposedly that was the news item

919
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,832
So what I've done on my notes

920
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,368
Just linked the two article

921
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,904
About the recent

922
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,696
Empower

923
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,720
In that area

924
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,256
And the fact

925
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Is that the governor

926
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,328
Actually evacuated

927
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,888
These people out of the area

928
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,448
The real reason they were being vacuolating

929
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,496
According to Mark is

930
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,056
Is because of portal opened

931
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:45,824
And

932
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,920
A very dark group a rogue group of aliens

933
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,760
Came through and started actually eating people off the beach

934
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,160
Rogue alien

935
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
Rogue

936
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,720
Eating people on the beach

937
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,744
What alien

938
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:09,888
What Rogue alien is there any specifics on which road we actually will get a little bit information

939
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,008
Absolutely

940
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
So far so good

941
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,384
So Rogue aliens

942
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
Rogue from what

943
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
Great quest

944
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:32,672
No response of those I'll get back to you on that

945
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,256
Aerospace protocols

946
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:43,168
Charge run

947
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
Looks delicious

948
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,592
That's true love the climate

949
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,663
Around America

950
00:41:53,919 --> 00:42:00,063
Vacationing on the outer islands of North Carolina

951
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:05,439
It's not a situation at all

952
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
Yeah

953
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
Yeah

954
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,279
That's the ticket

955
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,351
It's not a situation of dangerous inclement weather

956
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,935
Caused by climate change

957
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,263
Mark once again reiterates that he believes in climate

958
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:23,103
Episode

959
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,247
So let's get back to this there's more than our president

960
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:33,087
Yeah well he doesn't have a vested interest in tax cuts for the rich

961
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,623
Oh dude also

962
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,695
I want I want to get into this really quick I hope you

963
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,487
Tax cuts for the Raptor

964
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:44,607
You know Alex Jones about

965
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,959
Lies about how like the

966
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,263
The climate change lie in his word

967
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,823
Is this

968
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,199
Looking into that and it's that work it's kind of interesting cuz

969
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,271
South Africa taxes starting its

970
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
September of

971
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:06,623
15 how they've been doing China has had a carbon tax and

972
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,975
2012 climate

973
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
Carbon tax

974
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,327
It was initiated in July of 2010

975
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,887
In 2014

976
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Japan has had one son

977
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,983
2012 missions Ben

978
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:26,847
You good they're improving consistently dropping South Korea's had one since 2000

979
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
8

980
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,663
Taiwan has had one since

981
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,223
2009 or started planning one

982
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
Australia's had one

983
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,831
2012 New Zealand 22005

984
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,159
Xavier

985
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,463
Clearly those countries have

986
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:49,119
The European Union has been trying to implement one since 19 1990s

987
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
Denmark

988
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,727
2002 F150

989
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,007
Started in the 90

990
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,287
The 90s

991
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:01,663
The curve France they had a carbon tax

992
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
Interior research

993
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
France

994
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,503
Initiated

995
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,807
Starting climate carbon taxes

996
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
2009

997
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,623
Germany

998
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,671
Adoptive ecological text

999
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Perform in 90

1000
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
T99

1001
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,047
King country on the goddamn

1002
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Yeah

1003
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,375
We're officially dumber than North Korea

1004
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,775
In Sweden in 1991.

1005
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
The United

1006
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,639
Kingdom 1993 they started tax

1007
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Petroleum products

1008
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,199
Norway

1009
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
Switzerland

1010
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
That the dude to do

1011
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:44,159
Central America Costa Rica

1012
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:48,255
Costa Rica is got a carbon tax going in 1997

1013
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,791
Canada

1014
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,351
Has Dave no federal carbon tax

1015
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,631
But their province

1016
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,167
Have an active carbon taxes

1017
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,447
Of their own accord

1018
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,007
So that it's right for hate

1019
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,103
According to the carbon tax enter the United States

1020
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:03,871
Is one of the few

1021
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,663
Large industrialized Nation

1022
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
Things on earth that do

1023
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,711
Does not implemented carbon

1024
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,783
I can't think of any reason why

1025
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
We wouldn't have

1026
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,343
Well because

1027
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,367
We have

1028
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,391
Way too much

1029
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,975
Have way too much sway over the government

1030
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:22,047
This is all things.

1031
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,071
Consistently

1032
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,119
I have not been able to get this out of my head

1033
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,167
We don't live in a democracy

1034
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,519
Order corporate

1035
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,871
Corporate kleptocracies more like

1036
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:39,199
Steve's well but it's more generally

1037
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
Focused around one person

1038
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,575
And granted Trump is doing a great job of making that a reality

1039
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,367
But we have more of just like

1040
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
Plethora of

1041
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,463
Steven organizations

1042
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,743
Betterall Corporation

1043
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:58,911
Monopolies in the lake because their corporations they dodged individual responsibility for the crimes

1044
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
Absolutely

1045
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,495
So position is

1046
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,543
Why the f***

1047
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:08,639
I don't think this is why all of our protests have no real

1048
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,663
Affect

1049
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,735
Cuz we need to go because we don't have a democracy

1050
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,015
The idea of protest

1051
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,623
Like like whenever you look on Twitter you need to call these six senators

1052
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,903
Who are a maybe

1053
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,279
Right now the larger problem is the other 44 don't give a fuk cuz they're just own

1054
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,559
They're just owned

1055
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,887
So go to the f****** Koch Brothers headquarters

1056
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,167
Protest

1057
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,471
If we had 20,000 women

1058
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,287
Sitting outside of Wichita Kansas

1059
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:40,383
And I got the address again if we did that

1060
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
That's a real effect

1061
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,223
That's something that really bothers me

1062
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:50,879
We don't even know where I think you would find that it wouldn't bother me as much as you help

1063
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,695
No cuz he hears it here let me give you my dark

1064
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
Thought

1065
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,767
As of this weekend

1066
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:01,631
Is recording this on Saturday so I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow with the football game what happened

1067
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,679
El Presidente

1068
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Trump

1069
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,055
NFL owners

1070
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Should

1071
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,895
Fire these players

1072
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:19,295
F****** clearly white nationalist rally in Alabama

1073
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:26,975
You know we're still the games are tomorrow and buy guesstimation of it is there going to be a lot more

1074
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,999
People taking a nap

1075
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,535
F****** hope so

1076
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:34,143
Steph Curry and LeBron James team up to call Trump a piece of

1077
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
S***

1078
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,471
Phuc yea yea but here's the here's what I'm getting at

1079
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,263
I think that there is a decent

1080
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
Chance

1081
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,823
They're what we might end up seeing

1082
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,151
Is a larger-scale version of the University

1083
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
Missouri

1084
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,199
That's possible because

1085
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,991
There were legitimate protest

1086
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
And people

1087
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,063
Growing dissatisfied with stuff

1088
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,111
President

1089
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:54,879
University system

1090
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,671
The step down and he didn't

1091
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,207
Until the football team

1092
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,535
Tell the football teams are going to play anymore if you lose

1093
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,303
Money

1094
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,607
Now if you get the NFL going on strike

1095
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,703
Or something like that or a large portion of it

1096
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,751
I think you would have millionaires

1097
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,847
Who are like we're losing millions of dollars tens of millions of dollars

1098
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,151
And they would start putting pressure on senators

1099
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,687
In ways that we could not

1100
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:25,087
I meant it makes me profoundly sad

1101
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,623
But at the same time

1102
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,695
I mean if we can do that if that could happen

1103
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,231
And then once that happens

1104
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,839
Change the fact that matters more than once

1105
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,631
I don't know

1106
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,447
I think that you might end up seeing these moneyed interest

1107
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,007
Being what ends up having to

1108
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:48,639
Imagine imagine a Sunday where the NFL the players

1109
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Just goes

1110
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,431
No no

1111
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
Cluck-U

1112
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,527
That would destroy America

1113
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:58,367
There was literally in the south

1114
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,183
Probably yeah absolutely

1115
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
Just blame

1116
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,487
Yeah all my God

1117
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:09,887
Dr. Everett

1118
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,703
In the Barrier Islands

1119
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
Area

1120
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,775
He said the whole area had to be

1121
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,335
Evacuated under false pretense

1122
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,383
So the military could deal with it

1123
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:25,503
They found that they couldn't handle the situation because it required

1124
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,295
As if they didn't have any

1125
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,135
Collateral damage and usually when they try to close the portal

1126
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
They are

1127
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,695
They use a nuke

1128
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,463
Are they having

1129
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
In the past

1130
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,511
I still there

1131
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,815
Enlisted the help of the Raptors

1132
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,095
To help

1133
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,631
With their high-tech

1134
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,007
They have special weapons that allows them to Target

1135
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
Individual

1136
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:53,407
Individual beings and not have collateral damage and as well as

1137
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,735
The clothes portals

1138
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,783
Our technology wasn't

1139
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,575
Sophisticated enough

1140
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,623
To avoid collateral damage

1141
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,231
Here's the thing that she assumed

1142
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
In that

1143
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:12,351
If the weight more important

1144
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,167
If the way we usually close portals

1145
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:18,239
Is by detonating nuclear weapons Japan

1146
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:21,055
How many nuclear weapons have we detonated

1147
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
Secretly

1148
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,127
Well-known

1149
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,943
You're that you're not taking into account

1150
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:34,367
Nuclear tests have also been frozen portals

1151
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:38,463
Well they just wanted to know do know

1152
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,023
We'll get to that

1153
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,815
Put a pin

1154
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,399
This is now changed

1155
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,959
So this seems like a rather

1156
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,983
Recent

1157
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,007
Maybe we

1158
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,591
Technology

1159
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:55,871
Raptors

1160
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:59,199
He said The Intruders coming in through the portals were

1161
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
Stubbs

1162
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,271
Another

1163
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,831
Species and that we don't know this be

1164
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:10,207
He's very well eating people on beaches

1165
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,255
Other species

1166
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,279
Not interested

1167
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,839
The name of the species

1168
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
Is but it was

1169
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,143
Crayon that you couldn't read it

1170
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,167
I don't know

1171
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
Bruno's

1172
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,983
He said

1173
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,263
The situation he believes

1174
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
Husband handle

1175
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
In that area

1176
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,871
He did not tell me

1177
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,895
What kind of aliens

1178
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,943
And

1179
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,271
I am also wondering now if the recent

1180
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,087
Allowing of the

1181
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
Hurricane

1182
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,159
Very destructive hurricanes

1183
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
Irma

1184
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,975
Harvey

1185
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,815
Start of another episode in this

1186
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
Portal

1187
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,167
War with it

1188
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,959
A certain group coming in

1189
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,263
And not really about

1190
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Actually not

1191
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
It's nothing natural

1192
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,943
That's natural we do know that there are weather Wars going on

1193
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,223
Constantly

1194
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
So I'm going to

1195
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
To try to see

1196
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
I can find out

1197
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,111
Something more about

1198
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,159
Secular disaster

1199
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,439
America

1200
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
Because

1201
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,511
The evidence we have is that

1202
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,303
They have plenty of

1203
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
Technology to be able to

1204
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,863
To turn it down

1205
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:21,887
Storm

1206
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
Back out to

1207
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,215
And the fact that they didn't do that

1208
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,007
In the case of Harvey and Irma

1209
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,287
Is rather

1210
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,055
Auspicious

1211
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:34,175
That's why they were turned Irma is actually happening right now so I don't know what the final

1212
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,991
The results of that will be

1213
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
So

1214
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,415
This this investigation is ongoing

1215
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,207
Dr. destination you are just listening

1216
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,535
Alina crazy over that

1217
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,839
All of these ideas about

1218
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,863
Being able to

1219
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
Create

1220
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,935
Stop hurricane. What's up

1221
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:59,007
Largely has to do with misunderstandings about HARP

1222
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,823
Yep

1223
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:06,687
My friend

1224
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,479
Do the Raptors

1225
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,039
Now we have a little bit of

1226
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,087
That we have some news about the Raptors

1227
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,623
Involved

1228
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,415
Some others

1229
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,207
Some weird stuff

1230
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,231
They didn't get

1231
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:25,887
And I asked him if his future I asked him if

1232
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,655
If he was ever

1233
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,935
Hooked up to the top

1234
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
Technology

1235
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,983
That the Raptors have

1236
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,031
And many other race

1237
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,055
We're told

1238
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,615
That allows a human to see like

1239
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
History of Earth in also

1240
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:37,919
Asadero

1241
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,943
Reincarnation

1242
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,967
History

1243
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,319
And he said yes he was hooked up to such a machine

1244
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,111
Are the Raptors have that

1245
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
Technology

1246
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,183
He said he did see

1247
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
Summer

1248
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,231
The true history of Earth

1249
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:58,911
Deeper question

1250
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,471
Contract

1251
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,263
And whether or not

1252
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,287
He felt that he was

1253
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,079
Victim of circumstance

1254
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:06,847
Azure weather

1255
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,383
He chose the path he's on

1256
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
As a soul

1257
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,479
Coming in and he said that he

1258
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,039
Felt that he chose

1259
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,319
To fight the powers

1260
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,111
And that is why he

1261
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
Became imprisoned

1262
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,927
He didn't choose

1263
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,695
To be in prison for

1264
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
For 30 years

1265
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,559
This is weird

1266
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,607
But then he was like search

1267
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:33,727
That was too long this is not what my school signed up for me

1268
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:39,871
Conception what you talking about there's a lot of people who believe 4th member of Public Enemy

1269
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,151
No no I mean

1270
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:45,503
That's fine I should have allowed that to breathe

1271
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,807
You dumb talk about the soul contract

1272
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,695
I have a belief in reincarnation

1273
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,975
Yeah and that's

1274
00:54:55,487 --> 00:55:00,351
Reasonable to some extent in terms of spiritual beliefs

1275
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,399
Reincarnation one I'm going to just go ahead

1276
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,679
Is it

1277
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:10,079
It's fun static L problem if you wanted

1278
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,359
Fanciful

1279
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:15,199
Sort of spiritual belief that's not one that I find particularly if I

1280
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:19,295
I mean the only problem I have there is there's roughly what like

1281
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,647
2 million people who think they were Cleopatra

1282
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,671
Ego

1283
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,487
And I agree that the problem but then also the

1284
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,511
Numbers of

1285
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,047
The new people that have been

1286
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:36,447
You know it turns the population growth where the souls coming from right

1287
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,239
The belief

1288
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,311
A subset of the reincarnation

1289
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,079
Kinfolks

1290
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,383
It's something that I enjoy I like this

1291
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,431
I'm not saying I'm a hundred percent

1292
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,015
But I like it

1293
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:54,623
Some percentage believe no I would like to believe it but I don't like

1294
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,159
The cold hard

1295
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,207
Skeptic in me whatever certainly.

1296
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,303
But there are there people who believe that

1297
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,839
You go about your life

1298
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,143
And there's a soul group that you have

1299
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,703
Okay whatever you meet your

1300
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:12,031
Soulmate connect to those are members of your

1301
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:12,799
Your soul group

1302
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,079
And you're going about your life

1303
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,359
In a way

1304
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,175
That you guys all agreed to before you were born

1305
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,967
So in between why

1306
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,503
Your soul group gets

1307
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:25,599
Together and you come up with whatever the game you're going to play in this next life

1308
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,207
Hey what's up let's go

1309
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,535
Let's go get abused by religion bus and then eventually

1310
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,351
Meet each other doing comedy and then start a podcast

1311
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:42,495
ER plan that we created and then we would sign a soul contract

1312
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:45,311
Karmic debt repaid

1313
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,871
So we're getting close to bocona nism

1314
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,407
Come from

1315
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,175
Kurt Vonnegut

1316
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,479
Yeah yeah

1317
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,503
You just like

1318
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,527
If you would

1319
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,551
If you like

1320
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,623
You know killed someone in a past life

1321
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,903
Then you're

1322
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,231
Soul contract with involved in your next life

1323
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,511
They do something to you

1324
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:10,911
They ruin your life summer or whatever

1325
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:15,519
Thousand here before he was born he had a contract sign

1326
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,359
But I didn't want to go to prison

1327
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,383
30 years

1328
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,407
Richard Philly

1329
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:26,783
But even within that framework that I enjoyed the ideas

1330
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,855
Because it is it is fun it is a fun it is

1331
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:37,279
So what you're saying is

1332
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,095
To be reincarnated his soul group

1333
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,447
And they're trying to pay the bill at a restaurant and

1334
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,383
Feel sad

1335
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:57,503
You know look into his future as they have the ability

1336
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,647
He feels his biggest threat

1337
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:06,975
Questioning Authority

1338
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,279
People tend to want to follow him

1339
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,071
And so the powers

1340
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,095
Find

1341
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,119
That

1342
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,143
The greatest threat

1343
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:21,055
So just like we talked about last time that's like that little bit of guilt coming up but he can't quite

1344
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,591
Yeah it's a problem that

1345
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,871
People want to follow me any

1346
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,431
I think I think it is a problem

1347
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
Yeah

1348
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:30,783
Yeah yeah I am a sociopath who is

1349
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,599
Weirdly charismatic apparently

1350
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,623
And was able to

1351
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
Convince 270

1352
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:39,487
18 year old do to kill a guy for money

1353
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,559
Probably well-meaning

1354
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,375
Secret space program researcher in

1355
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,679
Heavy quotes

1356
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,447
Is following him

1357
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,727
Essentially

1358
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,519
And yeah that is the guilt that

1359
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,567
Trying to wrestle with the fact that like

1360
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:03,295
I am so interested

1361
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:07,135
I'm so his version of it is like they saw that I was going to be problem

1362
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,695
In prison

1363
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,743
They don't let me up

1364
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,559
He was a problem

1365
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,655
It was not because

1366
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:24,543
He's questioning Authority but that actually that comes later I don't have the clip of it but he was explaining

1367
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,103
Quest

1368
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:33,247
Got kill

1369
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,295
Authority alien he loves

1370
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,415
More or less

1371
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,695
Wow

1372
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:45,023
Alright this is a classic Revenge Tale

1373
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:49,887
So you might the Raptors they got this future technology and when have you for real

1374
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,447
This would be the best Bollywood movie in

1375
00:59:53,983 --> 01:00:00,127
Musical numbers

1376
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:06,015
Kill you for chocolate have a present

1377
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,039
Who Among Us

1378
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,831
Has not wanted to kill

1379
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,135
Me

1380
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,487
You want to kill after eating chocolate

1381
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,279
Just tell me that

1382
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,071
Do you have a dollar

1383
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,607
You can get chocolate

1384
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,935
Really acceptable

1385
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,983
But not the good Raptor

1386
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,799
That's bulshit that's bulshit

1387
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,103
They would take whatever they're not like

1388
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,127
I need a Wonka bar

1389
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,151
They be like

1390
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,175
I don't care give me

1391
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,711
Whatever I

1392
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,759
What about the road

1393
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,783
Now they want to eat people

1394
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,111
Okay so the rapper

1395
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,647
Have a presence

1396
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,927
And modern-day

1397
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,719
Global

1398
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,487
They have to

1399
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,767
And turns out

1400
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,303
The Raptors are in play in

1401
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,071
Syria

1402
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,143
Disclosure Aleppo and the

1403
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:58,751
Chileans that are pushing disclosure I discussed this in my last interview he had

1404
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,031
It said that the

1405
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,359
Forcing the issue in Aleppo

1406
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,151
Set the battle there was

1407
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,711
Very intense battle

1408
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,247
In part because the reptoids

1409
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,575
Building what is Nessun tsegay

1410
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,111
ESATA Stargate

1411
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,647
And they were looking to bring

1412
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,671
Troops and crafts

1413
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,951
Into this dimension

1414
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,743
He said they have aircraft

1415
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,511
Styes

1416
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,535
Carrier

1417
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,303
Craft

1418
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,863
And that they can bring around 5,000

1419
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
Have their own Troop

1420
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,911
Oops in that way

1421
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,215
She said they can take back

1422
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,751
However through the gate

1423
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,543
As many as 30,000

1424
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,311
40000

1425
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,335
Human prey

1426
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,615
Dead or alive

1427
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,639
He says they

1428
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,431
Trade human slaves

1429
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,455
Other races

1430
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,503
And those humans are used

1431
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,551
Slaves in

1432
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,135
Engineering

1433
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
Purposes

1434
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,975
And if one of their business

1435
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,047
They have been dealt with

1436
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,583
For the time being

1437
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,863
Vet

1438
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,911
Discontinued

1439
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,191
So

1440
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,495
This is this is sad

1441
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
Reptile

1442
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:04,799
Are the

1443
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,591
Originators of the slave trade

1444
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,383
That's what you're telling her stellar

1445
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,175
Dimensional

1446
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,991
Around here

1447
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:18,111
For long enough you make a very valid interesting point of what are they trading for

1448
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,647
That is a problem

1449
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:23,487
Might be chocolate it might be chocolate Goods

1450
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
Yeah

1451
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:27,583
I don't know

1452
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:34,239
Truly that's the new if a tree falls in the forest

1453
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,799
Cacao beans

1454
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,151
There's other ways

1455
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:48,063
Mark Richards has not confirmed that.

1456
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:53,439
Call me

1457
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,463
Out into space

1458
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,023
They genetically engineered to create

1459
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,351
Look

1460
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,143
Straight

1461
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:06,751
You just f****** rotateq officially onto the main stash

1462
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,287
That is

1463
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,591
Why Minerva is taking it

1464
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,639
All makes sense now

1465
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,919
What's what's classy

1466
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:19,039
Exactly

1467
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:23,135
A giant anthropomorphics jar for milk

1468
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,231
So

1469
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:27,999
You might be

1470
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,023
Concerned about the fact

1471
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:32,095
That the reptoids are meddling in a business

1472
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:44,127
The concern is that their meddling and

1473
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,663
We don't we don't

1474
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:48,223
No one season only right

1475
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,503
But there's a reason

1476
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,807
I want of his remote viewers

1477
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,575
Aziz

1478
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,159
Area 51

1479
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,951
And apparently

1480
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:02,815
Aziz was aware enough to realize that when he was looking at a

1481
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,375
What appears to be a Reptoid or rep

1482
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
Chilean

1483
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:08,959
Being down in Area 51

1484
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,751
In one of the lower levels

1485
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:11,775
He

1486
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,055
Saw that it would

1487
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,847
Make an attempt

1488
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:19,711
Over his mind so that he would forget and also not see the bean

1489
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,759
However he was

1490
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
Managed

1491
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,295
Bibiana

1492
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,343
So it's clear that they

1493
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,623
Have disability

1494
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,415
2

1495
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,439
The human mind

1496
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,975
And also make humans

1497
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,743
Forget

1498
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,815
Doctor Who which obviously helps

1499
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,095
The secrecy

1500
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,887
It obviously helps the speaker

1501
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
It couldn't hurt

1502
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:46,847
The secret very very convenient piece of the narrative

1503
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:52,479
Make you forget the Silence from Doctor Who

1504
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,247
It's Men in Black

1505
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,599
It's a common literary tropes

1506
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:00,159
We got a little bit of

1507
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:03,231
This is where we find out that the Raptors will kill you for chocolate

1508
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,023
Surrounding

1509
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:12,447
He did talk about the Raptors and what they will do for chocolate and or for any kind of Technology they desire

1510
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,471
He said they often

1511
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,239
Steel

1512
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,007
Borrow

1513
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,287
Technology for mother

1514
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,055
The races

1515
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:20,895
Said that they will kill for anything they want

1516
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
Including chocolate

1517
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:26,271
He said the Raptors can see the past energetically they

1518
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,319
I see the pastor birth and

1519
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,087
Have anyone there

1520
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:29,855
Shoes

1521
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,135
I would argue

1522
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,927
Because he's also said they can see the future

1523
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,535
Exist outside

1524
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,607
Time

1525
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,911
Space

1526
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:46,751
According to the Raptor technology that they have

1527
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,543
I would argue is that

1528
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,359
At least one time

1529
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:54,687
That a raptor has killed someone for chocolate

1530
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:57,503
And then seen the future or past in like

1531
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:05,695
The very very minor things to kill someone for

1532
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:09,023
Is there on Mark Richards

1533
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:14,911
Notorious murderer Mark Richards

1534
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,191
Like I said

1535
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:22,591
Very available

1536
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,615
Cherry red dog treats

1537
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,383
All the time

1538
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,919
Just in case they ran into a dog

1539
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,039
Like just in case

1540
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:36,671
I got to keep that dog treats as the world gets more and more chaotic

1541
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,999
Always keep some chocolate audio

1542
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:48,703
The complete opposite direction ever killed

1543
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:55,359
Is might be a diet thing maybe that's what Mark Richardson started encourage people to get in shape

1544
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,151
Carrie lost a lot of weight

1545
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:57,919
Following

1546
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:00,991
You know what they hate that like sugar free chocolate

1547
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,647
Inexplicably they like

1548
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,719
American chocolate more than they like European chocolate

1549
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,487
Despite the fact

1550
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,255
So we all know

1551
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,023
European chocolate

1552
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
Is better Belgian

1553
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,071
Yeah

1554
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,631
Here's the here's the only issue there

1555
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,935
So if you can see the past and the future

1556
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
Outside of

1557
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,287
Four dimensional time

1558
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,871
All things are happening

1559
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,895
Simultaneous

1560
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:32,991
So you really don't even know if you have free will

1561
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:35,807
Because everything has happened and will happen

1562
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,087
And he's already happening

1563
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,135
Same time price

1564
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,695
They're killing for chocolate but they don't even know

1565
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,023
Part of who they are

1566
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:51,423
Some extent that's true of everybody and everything

1567
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:55,263
Especially if you can see into the future that doesn't fly predestination

1568
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,591
On some level it is that weird

1569
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,127
You know like

1570
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
Gyros

1571
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:07,551
The TV show Style version of a dystopian picture and if we met

1572
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,831
Make one decision difference

1573
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:12,159
Infinite Multiverse Theory save the Raptor save the world

1574
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:22,143
I'm still confused as to where these Rogue aliens are coming from

1575
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,423
Nevermind

1576
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:29,567
They're From Another Dimension they want to go to the outer islands of North Carolina in

1577
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:34,175
And don't really know all that much about

1578
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,967
Because Mark was like

1579
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,807
Water stay there bezel board

1580
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:46,207
But that sound paper over this

1581
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:46,975
Yeah I'm good

1582
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,559
That's a hundred percent what's going on

1583
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:51,583
He's like

1584
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,655
Every day he goes to the library and just read the

1585
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,935
Hannah sci-fi books

1586
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,751
Taking a little more

1587
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,543
Whip Nae Nae in Fort Worth

1588
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,567
Getting all crazy

1589
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,615
North Korea

1590
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:07,455
I did ask earlier about North Korea I have a feeling I'm going to regret

1591
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,951
With regard to North Korea he said the only reason they're being so aggressive is that they're backed by

1592
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,511
Alien group that are powerful

1593
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,047
Of the u.s.

1594
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:26,143
And he said there's a definite group of off-world beings

1595
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,167
The back them

1596
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,727
Musically inclined to say which group

1597
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,263
In which case

1598
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,311
It does not sound like it's the Reptoid

1599
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,663
When asked about the North Korea

1600
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,223
Nuclear testing earthquake

1601
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:43,039
He actually didn't answer me directly about

1602
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,623
She kind of smiled when I asked him about that and didn't

1603
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,159
Say anything so I

1604
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,975
Ask him in essence does that mean

1605
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,255
We're actually in

1606
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:56,351
With North Korea and the beans backing them

1607
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,191
And that these so-called nuclear tests are more like

1608
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,263
Fourth

1609
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,799
From each side

1610
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,615
And again he didn't say anything

1611
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,895
Smiled so

1612
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,199
That's my impression

1613
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,551
That innocence we are already at war with North

1614
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,319
Korea

1615
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,599
Who that's my

1616
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,647
No it's not true

1617
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
Dude

1618
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:30,143
Difficult to deescalate by

1619
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:37,567
It's very sci-fi and that it is kind of allegorical for what is currently happening

1620
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:43,967
Like they are being bags exactly

1621
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,503
Relatively

1622
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,551
Logical analysis

1623
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,087
Behind his b*******

1624
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:54,975
It's like him confessing that I'm a manipulative cult leader, Guyana

1625
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,279
Metaphorically saying

1626
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:00,351
Guilty of murder

1627
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,631
Artsy's

1628
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,399
Expressing

1629
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,703
Real things in an Artful way

1630
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,751
To some extent

1631
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:10,847
Yeah I'm sure there is China back in North Korea

1632
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:14,431
His version of some unnamed alien races really just

1633
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,991
Remnants of the

1634
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,015
Communist Bloc

1635
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,039
But

1636
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,855
Here's my also want a reminder

1637
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,159
Everybody else cuz I have tickets

1638
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,207
I'm all of this is real

1639
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:28,511
I don't I don't think of people understand this

1640
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,095
A lot of people don't know if Kerry Cassidy is on the

1641
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
Tip

1642
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,935
Is this the cheese farts a lot of stuff

1643
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,703
It's very similar

1644
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,727
To this world

1645
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
View

1646
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,031
With the aliens

1647
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,055
Alternate

1648
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,639
A lot of people who believe in that believe the

1649
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,407
The Jews are real

1650
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,735
God dammit

1651
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,295
Spring-trap

1652
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,135
They believe that the Hebrews

1653
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,183
Are in outer space race that was in

1654
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:57,951
Installed

1655
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,999
Into like Atlantis

1656
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:00,767
Send lemuria

1657
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,047
Because

1658
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,327
They needed a balance

1659
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,119
Between the draconian

1660
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,143
And the Atlanta

1661
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:09,471
Feminine race

1662
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,519
Abeyance

1663
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,103
I measure Conan's or these

1664
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,383
Worshipping

1665
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,151
Folks

1666
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:20,479
They came in and they were really male

1667
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,015
Destructive and what-have-you

1668
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,551
And they were like

1669
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,367
As I understand there were like 9 or 10

1670
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,415
Spot-on Atlanta

1671
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:31,487
Be filled or where they'll be like population

1672
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
Centers

1673
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,815
Another one

1674
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,351
The Hebrews

1675
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,655
Lower super magical

1676
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,703
I'm good at good at math

1677
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:44,543
And that what have you been were a very evolved

1678
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,567
Race

1679
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,103
Look who is this

1680
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,151
Positive

1681
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:49,919
Yeah

1682
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,199
No

1683
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,479
Neither

1684
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:56,063
It's not good for the Jews always involved

1685
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,599
The Jews are always like

1686
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:04,255
It does seem like no matter how wacky or evil

1687
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:07,071
You get whichever side on Spectrum

1688
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,119
In this conception

1689
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,911
From what I've been able to glean

1690
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,447
Cuz I've done

1691
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
Some diving

1692
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,751
Into this this world

1693
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:15,775
A little bit

1694
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,311
Doesn't

1695
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,591
Seem like it's negative

1696
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,895
Hateful

1697
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,663
The space

1698
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,431
Hebrew

1699
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:28,063
But it is

1700
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:32,927
It's not negative in the same way that like

1701
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,463
Somatic

1702
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,255
Population

1703
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,071
At the same time

1704
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:45,471
When did still singling out the matter where you are on the Spectrum from crazy

1705
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,519
Easy to evil no matter what

1706
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:50,591
Seems like a through-line through all of it is like the Jews aren't

1707
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,895
With us there's something else

1708
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,663
I just left

1709
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,711
Don't understand that

1710
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:56,991
A bowl because

1711
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,783
Is it cuz they killed Christ

1712
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,807
It's because they killed Christ

1713
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,343
Goes back to the money

1714
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,159
The goes back to usury

1715
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,695
Probably

1716
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:08,511
Betzer thing existed before

1717
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:13,119
There might be something else too that I own

1718
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,935
Fully understand but

1719
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,959
For me in terms of IUD

1720
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,751
Population

1721
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:24,639
You think that they're the they're the cause of all your husband on McMullen

1722
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,663
Destroying all right

1723
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,431
Whatever

1724
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,479
I just

1725
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:32,831
If there's one lesson that I've learned from all of history

1726
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,367
It's

1727
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,415
Leave the Jews alone

1728
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,463
Man

1729
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,047
Typically when you hit a Tipping Point of people being mad at them

1730
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,327
That's one really bad

1731
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,119
Everything goes wild

1732
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,143
Yep and

1733
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:51,263
Might be like of course it does they have to fight

1734
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,823
Fight back

1735
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:59,711
Because we know even Alex Jones thinks the Jewish Mafia was involved in the Holocaust

1736
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,295
Anyway

1737
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:08,415
They were the Raptors and play in North Korea

1738
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,207
But guess what

1739
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,743
They're also involve

1740
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:12,767
Another

1741
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,815
Very dramatic nuclear

1742
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,119
Incident

1743
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,703
We talked about the Cuban Missile Crisis

1744
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,751
He said the Cuban Missile Crisis

1745
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,799
I just was not about a Russia

1746
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:25,823
UFO

1747
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:26,591
Us

1748
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,639
Stand-off with missiles

1749
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:30,943
3/3 nukes that went off

1750
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,479
In outer space related

1751
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,551
He said the Cuban Missile

1752
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,087
Crisis involved

1753
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,623
A fight with Anita race

1754
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,671
And the Kennedy was well aware of this

1755
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,231
So that's why.

1756
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,767
History

1757
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,071
Appears to me to be

1758
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,095
Rewritten

1759
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
Clarify

1760
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,679
So I think

1761
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,703
It would be

1762
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,751
To delve into that

1763
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,543
Closest Safeway

1764
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,567
Corroboration

1765
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,431
I bet you can't find some corroboration because your version of corroboration is

1766
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,455
Crazy people talking

1767
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:07,807
Corroborate that

1768
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:11,135
It'll be great I'll corroborate

1769
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,927
Like my favorite thing

1770
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,463
About her versus

1771
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
Is that

1772
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,535
Alex wouldn't

1773
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,327
This is bendy

1774
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,607
Declassified

1775
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,399
And she's just like wolves

1776
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,959
Yeah nobody knows about

1777
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,751
Yeah like it's not busy

1778
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:29,567
It doesn't matter if it's the classified or not

1779
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,383
It's all happening around

1780
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:35,199
Information comes from is so f****** Beyond

1781
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:37,503
Classification

1782
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:41,343
It's coming from come from is Mark rich

1783
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,903
Or these others

1784
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,951
People who have undergone

1785
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,975
Traumatic

1786
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,279
That experience

1787
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,071
Calling them

1788
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:54,911
I know this is a lot of notice

1789
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,727
People are mentally

1790
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,287
They're sympathetic Yahoo

1791
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,591
You don't like all of this stuff

1792
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:07,967
Like it's hard to say what is I'm not going to

1793
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:08,735
Normal

1794
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,527
Something that

1795
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,599
Has happened within their their brain can

1796
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,903
That is fuckshit up

1797
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:21,535
Yeah like glued them from being happy or set like this isn't an emotional

1798
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,607
Allstate this is just something within the way that they are brain

1799
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,375
Process

1800
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:28,703
What is the world's most of them at least at this point mark Richard

1801
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,471
That's not what

1802
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,335
For them

1803
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:39,967
If white supremacist jurors would just turn their Supremacy

1804
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,759
The angle towards rap

1805
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:45,855
Could never stay that way

1806
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,927
Who knows what

1807
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,207
Other things

1808
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,511
These people believe that aren't in the

1809
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,815
Because we know that

1810
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
Like

1811
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,959
F****** members named Robert David Steele

1812
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,007
He believes that zionists are attacking

1813
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:09,407
Bring him all over the place come on about a secret program

1814
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,687
In his beliefs are

1815
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:14,783
The Jews around the world and they're trying to attack me because I know the truth

1816
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:18,623
I bet a lot of these other people who are on here have similar

1817
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,671
Awful

1818
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,463
Just aren't being

1819
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:26,559
Are because the interview is about spider being nombre

1820
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:28,351
They don't need to talk about how like

1821
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,375
Also

1822
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,679
Blacks don't deserve

1823
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:33,471
I mean

1824
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,007
Wizard

1825
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:41,151
This is good there is also a certain amount of all of this is allegorical

1826
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:41,919
4

1827
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
Race pace

1828
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
Fear and Hate

1829
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
Like I mean

1830
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:49,087
You can believe it in spider leadership

1831
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,415
Spider l

1832
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,743
You can believe it all of that but ultimately with that guy

1833
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:56,511
Get back to you

1834
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,327
This is not white people's fault

1835
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:01,375
This is not

1836
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:05,727
This is all done by other people and we don't have to

1837
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,287
Any responsibility for our own Acts

1838
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:13,407
Chanel the flip side of it is actually fairly interesting is there when he's talking about North Korea

1839
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:16,735
He's saying it's not North Korea's fault right

1840
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:22,879
They're just working with the wrong so to some extent

1841
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:27,231
Unifying of humanity

1842
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:31,327
Right we are all but the playthings of alien races

1843
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:35,167
A lot of ways it's just

1844
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,703
It's

1845
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,495
Is lame in a fun way

1846
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,799
Aries

1847
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,591
It's more fun than not to

1848
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:45,407
To blame aliens for North Korea then

1849
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,687
And insane

1850
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,223
Religious dictatorship

1851
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,759
Theocracy built around a god

1852
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:53,087
It's probably less scary because you get to a point where I like

1853
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:55,135
You can't really be scared of giant

1854
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,927
Malevolent alien races

1855
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,207
There's just nothing you can do about

1856
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,487
You know what I mean

1857
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,767
Yeah that is kind of

1858
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:04,351
And in many ways like there's not going let Raptors

1859
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,375
That's what I said

1860
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:09,471
There's not a whole lot you can really do about Kim Jong-un yourself either

1861
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
But he's still human

1862
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,055
Humanized

1863
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:13,824
The threat

1864
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,128
It allows you to sort of be

1865
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,176
Worried about it

1866
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,968
It takes you out of the game

1867
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,064
Criticism of Alex Jones

1868
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,088
People live

1869
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:25,856
Think is really real

1870
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,648
Super Bowl

1871
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416
Is

1872
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:33,024
By creating like this giant globalist

1873
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,352
Cabal that it has their fingers and everything

1874
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,400
Are controlling stuff

1875
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,680
You do is you breed power

1876
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,704
Audien

1877
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:46,080
Yeah because you can scream all you want but the end of the day all he's trying to do is get you to give him money

1878
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,896
So he can continue to fight the global x-ray

1879
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,456
By screaming and having you give him more money

1880
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:53,760
It's a self-perpetuating cycle

1881
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:54,784
Whereas

1882
01:20:55,040 --> 01:21:00,160
Do you know it just like we create terrorism in terrorism

1883
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:00,928
So we can spend

1884
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:03,488
More money Fighting by the way

1885
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:08,096
Military

1886
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:10,656
We can't have college we can't have him

1887
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:17,056
God dammit if we don't need to spend another 200 f****** billion dollars on goddamn

1888
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,104
R700 billion-dollar f****** budget

1889
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,688
Them Jesus Christ I like you

1890
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,968
Why are you doing this

1891
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,784
Because it's politically toxic not to

1892
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,184
What are the big criticisms against

1893
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,720
Bernie is always been

1894
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:35,488
What is foreign policy

1895
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,256
What is bulshit

1896
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,792
And he came out and was like

1897
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:40,864
America's foreign policy is b*******

1898
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,888
UK

1899
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:45,216
Who are you Ron Paul

1900
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,056
But

1901
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,104
What I'm getting at I think

1902
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,920
Is Alex Jones really believed in the global

1903
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,224
I really wanted to

1904
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,248
Encourages audience

1905
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,576
You would actually

1906
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,600
Pinpoint

1907
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,624
Specific Acts

1908
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,392
Edible things

1909
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,672
The people can do

1910
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,208
That would help

1911
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,232
His fight against

1912
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,000
Globalist

1913
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,560
Instead they're all

1914
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,120
Child murdering pedophile cultist

1915
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,144
Members

1916
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,496
It's a spiritual Battle Ground is nothing you can do to

1917
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:26,176
Yeah I mean that's that that would be pathetic if you saw that on the left maybe you do

1918
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,968
Dude I just don't know who that person is

1919
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,760
But generally when I listen to things

1920
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,344
End of the day is that

1921
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,624
Isn't it

1922
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,928
Democrats and Republicans are not

1923
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:37,952
Enter

1924
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,024
As a concept

1925
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,792
Did I find them

1926
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
Tiresome

1927
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,864
I think

1928
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,632
More

1929
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,448
I think Progressive

1930
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,008
Conservative are much more applicable

1931
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,080
Cuz they're not not the end not not

1932
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,616
Sure

1933
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:59,200
I think I think that's true also but there's like they're not parties

1934
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:01,760
So it's not something that you sign up to be a part of it

1935
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:04,576
It's just the orientation of your beliefs

1936
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,856
Yeah do you want to

1937
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:08,160
To move forward or do you want to try and make

1938
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,184
Maintain a false

1939
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,256
I think those are the truth

1940
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,792
Those are the true parties

1941
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:17,632
Yeah but there's no membership at any of them

1942
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,616
Let's go back to rappers

1943
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,664
So in this next clip

1944
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,712
I think I think ultimately my

1945
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,992
My analysis

1946
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:33,760
List of all of this

1947
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,344
This is all about removing

1948
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,880
Personal responsibility

1949
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:46,048
For Mark Richards cuz he murdered again for all of us

1950
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:48,096
Listen all of this

1951
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,632
We can't

1952
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,424
We can't comprehend

1953
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,448
The

1954
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,984
Total and

1955
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,008
And just

1956
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,360
World shattering evil that is within every

1957
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,408
The potential search

1958
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:08,320
So and so they create all of this stuff about how Alex

1959
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,856
Narratives

1960
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,392
About like

1961
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,928
Social indoctrination

1962
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,696
Should really work

1963
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,464
Towards like

1964
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,744
Hey you might

1965
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,280
I hate black people

1966
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,560
That's okay

1967
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:24,960
Because brainwashed by the globalist

1968
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:28,032
It's not you right

1969
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,848
Right

1970
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,384
It's totally fine

1971
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,456
The functionality of it is

1972
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:37,248
Give you powerlessness

1973
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,528
Except with a twitch

1974
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:40,576
Serve his immediate interest

1975
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:44,160
Yeah and to make you feel better about bigotry

1976
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,696
That already lives within you

1977
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,744
Both of those are profound

1978
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,816
Relate the personal responsibility

1979
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,352
Do you have

1980
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,120
Big

1981
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,168
Your book Hoot

1982
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,448
Address though

1983
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,032
Look at them

1984
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,568
I'm trying

1985
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:07,200
You can't I do want to do something

1986
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,016
With our show that is

1987
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,808
As you would say a

1988
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:18,208
A fight against that s*** on the Koch brothers lawn you can order policy walk in

1989
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:20,256
Organized organized

1990
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,792
And f****** there's

1991
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:25,376
There's a real enemy and it's the oligarchs who control the government

1992
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:30,752
Real Adam gets a little bit bigger before we try and like

1993
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:34,080
We need to organize into a political action committee

1994
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:39,200
But there should be like we should try and explore possibilities like

1995
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,224
Action thing

1996
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,784
Or action items

1997
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,064
Something

1998
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:50,464
But if you are if you do have bigoted tendencies

1999
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,000
You are listening to this show

2000
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,280
Don't kill yourself yet

2001
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:59,680
Why it is that you feel differently about different people

2002
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:05,056
Zack Snyder

2003
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:08,896
Feel that all the time like am I

2004
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:14,016
It is one of those things

2005
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
You know

2006
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,088
Treatment towards women

2007
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:21,952
All of these different things and I constantly re-examine every opinion like

2008
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:25,792
I've had like I just

2009
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:26,816
And

2010
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,608
Yeah

2011
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,912
I was a dick I'm it was fantastic

2012
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,448
It was it was

2013
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:37,056
Funny it's so good

2014
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:41,152
I had to I had to think about it because I tweeted straight from

2015
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:47,552
Frederick from my dick Behavior massage but I had to think about that

2016
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:51,392
Mediately after like I had to go through all of my thought process there

2017
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:56,256
And trying to figure out what

2018
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:58,560
A marine or somebody who could

2019
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:04,960
F****** straight-up murder made like salute

2020
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,776
With much thought process at all

2021
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,800
No but it was fun

2022
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,664
I got Talking Dead version of

2023
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:17,760
Personal

2024
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,040
Look I'm not trying to brag

2025
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:21,344
Look

2026
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,928
But that's that's something that I do want to make sure that I think about cons

2027
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,744
Why am I treating people the way I am

2028
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,280
And is this influence

2029
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:34,144
Buy a bias that I have forced that's a good thing I'm not sure about thinking about it

2030
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:41,056
You don't need to be mean it's not like it's not like every single conversation I have overwhelmed

2031
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,872
Something to keep an eye on anyway

2032
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,968
I had a point but I'm coming from

2033
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,504
Raptors are real

2034
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:55,136
Raptors I've been a part of the world for a long time

2035
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,184
Actually I asked him about the dragons

2036
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,208
In the Middle Ages

2037
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,000
That are written about

2038
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,792
Of course in the mythology

2039
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,608
Having to do with knights

2040
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,632
And all of that

2041
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,168
And I was curious

2042
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
What

2043
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,496
Were

2044
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:11,776
Like which species

2045
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,408
Are draco's and

2046
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,432
Raptor

2047
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,480
Is that were actually

2048
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,248
Dragons

2049
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,016
They were fighting in the

2050
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,136
Apparently

2051
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,416
Of course England has

2052
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,184
Alarm history

2053
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,488
Surrounding the

2054
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,256
Dragon

2055
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,792
Fastest China

2056
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,120
It isn't

2057
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:37,888
Variance

2058
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,936
Fascinating

2059
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,008
And Raptors

2060
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,080
Let's go with Chinese dragon

2061
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:51,968
We're going to call those Raptors

2062
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:52,736
Draco's

2063
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:56,576
Stricker's don't necessarily fly though either a part of the

2064
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
Suggested

2065
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:58,624
Sure

2066
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,280
It's fascinating to me

2067
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,048
Like

2068
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,352
What won't she believe

2069
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:09,888
That is a real

2070
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:13,472
We should try and repackage ourselves as like whistle

2071
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:14,240
Blowers

2072
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,264

2073
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,336

2074
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,176
I couldn't roll with it

2075
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,200
I wouldn't

2076
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:29,600
Calendar

2077
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:31,904
Item for today

2078
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:37,280
The outro of interview and this is

2079
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,048
Revivalists

2080
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:44,448
So that covers everything I believe and I want to thank everyone for watching

2081
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,752
And for being interested in

2082
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,288
What Mark Richards has

2083
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,848
His wife Joanna.

2084
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,640
Circuit she has a website

2085
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,432
And I

2086
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,712
I will put the URL

2087
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,480
Here

2088
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,016
Encourage you to

2089
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,040
Purchase used

2090
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,088
Written materials

2091
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:02,624
He writes

2092
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,648
Constantly

2093
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,672
And is

2094
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,952
The prolific writer

2095
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:08,768
He's got lots of information out there

2096
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,048
In written form

2097
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,608
And he's always riding more

2098
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,144
So I

2099
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,752
He is a very

2100
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:19,776
Principal Darren

2101
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,056
Fascinating

2102
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,080
Individual

2103
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,384
And highly intelligent

2104
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,920
And conducts himself

2105
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:29,248
As a military officer at all times

2106
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:31,552
So thanks again for you

2107
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,320
Watching a

2108
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,088
And for your support

2109
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,648
You know who made a lot of crazy people

2110
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,672
Conduct themselves

2111
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,952
Military people

2112
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:38,720
Sheriff

2113
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,584
I really think I mean

2114
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,144
At the end of the day it is harmless

2115
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,168
And it is just

2116
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,960
Fun narratives being pushed out

2117
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,240
But at the same time

2118
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:52,288
She's legitimizing a murder

2119
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:55,360
Murderer con man is trying to make money

2120
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,944
It's his wife who's making money

2121
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:04,832
He's probably not done that access to a lot of that I'm fine with her having a career out of it

2122
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,624
She's not getting out of prison anytime soon

2123
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
So

2124
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,720
I'm very conflicted though because she's like

2125
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,768
He's a principled man

2126
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,048
That's where the stuff at

2127
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:17,888
I don't I don't like the reclaiming of humanity

2128
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,960
Makes me a little uncomfortable

2129
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:23,520
Coming to reclaim it he would have to have had it

2130
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,312
Yeah

2131
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:28,896
Probably

2132
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:34,272
The thought though

2133
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:39,648
Switching gears into alright we're done with his dragon

2134
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:41,696
Raptor bulshit for now

2135
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,000
Not until there's another update

2136
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:47,072
Richard the 8th visit to

2137
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,864
I like somehow we're like

2138
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:53,728
We're all Mark Richards when we go to Project Camelot

2139
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,520
She doesn't post things all that often

2140
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:57,824
She was just at like some

2141
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,104
Seminar

2142
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,408
Speech in Ireland checking on that

2143
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,432
But

2144
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,456
Supposed

2145
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:05,504

Lake

2147
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:09,088
It's a big deal we got a new update

2148
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,392
But these buttons

2149
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,696
Repeat it out a picture of them

2150
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,464
They're amazing

2151
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,512
And if you would like one of these buttons

2152
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:17,792
Here's my proposal

2153
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,328

2157
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,704
Instead of donating money

2158
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,984
To get one of these buttons

2159
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,264

2160
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,312

I think

2241
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,344
Here's here's a good theory

2242
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,624
It's quite possible

2243
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,928
That he doesn't have human

2244
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,512
What I think that it's

2245
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,816
Within the realm of Pop

2246
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,096
Possibility

2247
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,120
That he

2248
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:14,080
