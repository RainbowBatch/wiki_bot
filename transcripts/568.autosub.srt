The first time being out in public

36
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
I forgot

37
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,624
A little bit in public but not like a

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Live performance

39
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
That's a little bit

40
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
A little bit weird

41
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,048
You can get back to it man

42
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
Baby we'll see we'll see

43
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
Effect of this announcement is that there isn't going to

44
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,896
To be new episodes of your goddamn wizard

45
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,248
July 1st we will not be doing any more episodes of that so

46
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:38,368

00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
Hoorah

48
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,976
Some people have asked just to make

49
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,768
It's clear more public like one

50
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
Why all of it's done

51
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
You are going to release it as an audio video now

52
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
I finished up and didn't

53
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,312
To be edited nystrom's everybody needs

54
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
To get me their individual audio which some have been very very good with the private conversation

55
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,576
Today we're going to be talking about

56
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
About

57
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
An emergency broadcast

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,863
But Alex did on Saturday June 19th 2020

59
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
Emergency episode

60
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
That Alex did

61
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
And

62
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,079
I was glad that he did an emergency episode because

63
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,407
I was struggling I was riding water if you were thinking about

64
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
Covering his present a nonsense

65
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
And then is emergency broadcast happen

66
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,831
And something about you mental went down okay

67
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
Something that we have been waiting for for a while haven't

68
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279

Life is death

Jordan we're going to start this thing off

118
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Against

119
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,727
Alex's goes for an unconventional approach

120
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
On this emergency

121
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,431
It's an emergency broadcast yeah and he's going to open it with something other than screaming

122
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
This is an emerging

123
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Yeah okay

124
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
And I'm interested if I was gauging

125
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,855
From the title of this video

126
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,927
Emergency is that

127
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,463
The January 6th

128
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Storming of the capital was a false flag

129
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,583
That does not sound like much of an emergency

130
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:09,983
I don't know

131
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,871
Qualifies as an emergency that requires another broadcast in an emergency

132
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,199
You should be aware of something really fast

133
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:24,831
And this is standard Infowars lower at this point

134
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Really just like

135
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,903
Listening

136
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,047
Aquino

137
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,679
Or is in on it now cuz I was really thinking about is

138
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,031
It seems really weird on first glance that Alex is doing that

139
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
Broadcast about like

140
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
6 being falsely

141
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:51,967
Makes some sense I mean if you really think about it

142
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
Publicly available information

143
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,343
Alex seems like he's on pretty solid footing legal

144
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
Lee speaking

145
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
Next to the storming of the capitol

146
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,255
It seems like something is getting him a lot of attention

147
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,327
Rightly is trending on Twitter because people are like

148
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
They found this video of him being like

149
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,447
Drop told me to lead a March I'll manno in like

150
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,775
I think it's probably something really good to lean into for him

151
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,847
Attention there's a lot of possibility for

152
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,431
Claiming the people are misrepresenting him totally

153
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
I think it's probably

154
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
As long as he doesn't end up

155
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
Defaming anybody

156
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
In the process like

157
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,623
Probably a good thing to do

158
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:37,535
There is a dog outside this attention he knows that he needs to

159
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Rihanna

160
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
Trial of that crew

161
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
And I love the boom operator The Spinners 7 days

How's your beer tomorrow for Sunday show

163
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Want to thank them

164
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
And I'm going to hit this big news

165
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,103
Now I'm going to go right to these gas button

166
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
Doing is afoot Dorothy and I'm going to do it right now

167
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Because I've got

168
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
A bunch of reporters

169
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
And I got

170
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Operation

171
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
Cuz I want to watch it I got things I want to do

172
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
And I can't do without your support so

173
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
This coming Monday morning

174
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
This big sale

175
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327

Jay starts off with a very explicit blog

179
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
Start

180
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
The emergency broadcast

181
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
With an ad

182
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,639
Overworked

183
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:30,015
Which seems like a hem problem shua seems like you can probably hire more staff

184
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
Apitherapy cutback Orcutt

185
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Right right

186
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
But because these people are working

187
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,327
Seven-days-a-week needs to hire more people and therefore you need be to Alvord

188
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095

Mood swing that was

246
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
That was pathetic

247
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,151
That was really pathetic

248
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Yeah

249
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,503
That was really bad is

250
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
How artificial that like mood

251
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Swearing is

252
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
And if it's not about

253
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,207
To see a doctor

254
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,255
The 2nd

255
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,071
What he's talkin about not being on cocaine

256
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
He describes going

257
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,655
Going to a bathroom

258
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
Almost entirely yeah

259
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
You know what was crazy all those

260
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,799
Stories about Studio 50

261
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:37,919
T4 back in the day you know people would always go into the bathroom and they just scream into the mirror they were like

262
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,575
I'm not somebody who's done a lot of cocaine in my life

263
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
But I'm not going to say that I never had

264
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,487
But I will say that I don't think I've ever done it outside a bathroom

265
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
I think we can include laundry room

266
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Hard to say

267
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,031
Or just at

268
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,335
I don't know this is just everything is so fake about

269
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
The passionate

270
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Yeah that's

271
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
What's that is really that's really bad acting

272
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
But you'll continue doing that

273
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
As Faithfully as long as you pay

274
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Please give him some

275
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,391
Yeah I don't like being chastised

276
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:24,255
For taking advantage of his discounts and then him being like

277
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
Sell it at full price anymore

278
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
Like what what you do tell me

279
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
Don't tell me that

280
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,543
I put things on sale too much and now people are used to it and they know that I just put everything on sale in a week if it's not on sale now

281
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,639
Never buy anything out of real but normal price so I have to

282
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
By the Gods

283
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:48,063
F*** you

284
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:54,463
Is Reese's cups on f****** 2 for $3 if you're not going to buy a model 141 99 day

285
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,791
Employee at Walgreens

286
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
Like after Easter like a day after

287
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,167
Easter their jobs just up to everybody

288
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:09,567
Oh now you want a drag

289
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,127
So Alex gets to some of the news

290
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,943
Alright let me show you these articles are going these yet

291
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
The big revolver article

292
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
Global Aquatics

293
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
That's a good thing and weed

294
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
Literally for Sade

295
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
And pushed it together

296
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
3 weeks ago

297
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
Enemy

298
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Freedom

299
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,119
White House unveils new strategy to counter the message

300
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
Laser focus on violin

301
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,751
The same thing Brennan

302
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
The Economist perverts

303
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
What

304
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:47,967
Why doesn't Bill strategy to combat domestic extremism it's everywhere it's their whole operation

305
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,783
So first of all this article isn't on Revolver

306
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,415
Revolver isn't so much a new site as much as it is an attempt to make a new Drudge Report now that the Trump campaign

307
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Is turned on drugs

308
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
It's just a bunch of Link

309
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
Gangsta clickbait headlines

310
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
For the most part

311
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,095
The actual article that Alex is talking about here in this clip

312
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
On the hill

313
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,447
The Articles not some kind of a bombshell that has the globalist

314
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Running Scared

315
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,031
Discussion about how the plans that have been floated by Biden

316
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Administration

317
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,871
Possibly good ideas but also there's some serious blinds

318
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
Princeton's here's a quote that's included in that art

319
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,295
Administration is rightly focused on addressing white supremacy

320
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,111
Violence but its strategy includes none of the Civil Rights

321
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Liberty safeguards

322
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
The rights groups and

323
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,207
Communities of color have long sought

324
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,303
That's a criticism of the bidens plan that was put out in a statement

325
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
By the ACLU

326
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
A group that Alex believes is high-level global

327
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
It seems like it's the ACLU shouldn't be

328
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
You getting in the mix trying to sow doubt about the globalist plans

329
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:48,895
If they're on board of the globalist plans but look man I'm not a 30 Dimension chess player whatever the f***

330
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
Yeah if I was a 30 dementia

331
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,527
Open chess player I would say that Alex is opposition to this

332
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
This makes more sense

333
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
Or no nevermind

334
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
It doesn't make any sense

335
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Whatsoever

336
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,791
See that new plan dividing put out as a realtor

337
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
What are the pillars

338
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,607
The plan is to quote

339
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
Confront long-term contributors to domestic Terror

340
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
In that section they say quote

341
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,055
The US government will also work to find ways to counter the polarisation office

342
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,615
Fueled by disinformation misinformation it dangerous

343
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,151
Conspiracy theories online

344
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,711
Supporting an information environment that Fosters

345
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
Healthy democratic

346
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:30,111
I'm not sure that I believe they're capable of achieving that goal but if I were Alex

347
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
I would recognize that this

348
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
Looks like a situation where

349
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
You might not get to fly completely under the radar movie

350
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
Home forward

351
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Not be good for him

352
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,839
Fighting some qualms with the plan but it's

353
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
Not really a specific

354
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
General

355
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,215
And critiquing the general plan is good for

356
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,775
For conversation and for fostering better ideas

357
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
Show me the best ideas possible but

358
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
So I don't think it's where the actual

359
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
Fights are going to happen

360
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:58,527
Yeah I mean I think the only thing about any of those plans is always got to

361
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
Boiled down to

362
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
Hey guys

363
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
Guys

364
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
Tell me honestly

365
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,719
When there's a Republican president or even

366
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,047
This President will this be primarily used to hurt leftist Act

367
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,607
And the answer is ninety-nine percent of the time

368
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,423
So let's let's calm down on our

369
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
Plans real

370
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
So I asked

371
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,079
False flag

372
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,383
And you know what other people have false flag before

373
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,455
Now we know from listening to 2003

374
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Line

375
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
Conversation will come up

376
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:37,183
It'll be Alex will use every day in 2003

377
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,975
Slightly different in the pretzel

378
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
Distance the old Soros

379
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
Onstage.

380
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,143
I just at the old KGB would do it a Hitler launch WWII

381
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,983
I'm about to Stage attacks

382
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
And some of the corrupt

383
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,079
Declining systems do huh

384
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:59,455
Strangers phrasing is a little little different

385
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,783
Collapsing countries that did this

386
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,111
You know like it seems weird that they would be one very obvious

387
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
18 years

388
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
Changes to

389
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
So Alec

390
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,559
Let's gets to what he's planning to do for the beginning of this virgin

391
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
The report

392
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
I'm going to have this over

393
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
Interview idea

394
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,751
On Friday

395
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,799
One of the main lawyers

396
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
Depending people

397
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
Arrest of the capitol

398
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,735
This is a memory from Friday and then I've got interview that some wife

399
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Not enough

400
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
Security Menlo from set

401
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
From

402
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
January 6th

403
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
When he witnessed what he saw what

404
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,511
Ended up telling the story

405
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,119
Little while after it unfolded

406
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
Family vacation Utah but

407
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
Demi logos through

408
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
Exactly what really

409
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
What happened

410
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
So

411
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,431
Play like 20 seconds of like a lawyer death

412
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
How to make

413
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Details of it

414
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,807
I'm at a very long conversation he had with his

415
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Security guard

416
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
Easier to get

417
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,439
Get him on a family vacation

418
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
He interviewed his

419
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Security

420
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:22,911
Also Rob do is there a man

421
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:28,031
Went to his food supplier the my Patriot Supply Warehouse

422
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,615
Family vacation with the security guard going to your

423
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
Disaster Foods

424
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
Supplier

425
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Kind of but suck

426
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,759
That's just a business trip that's not even to work

427
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:44,159
Kaisha Norway I'm not having a great time

428
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,719
Utah I mean Salt Lake City

429
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
He's nice sure

430
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,863
We don't need to listen to anything of the security guard cuz it's honestly just

431
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
Exactly what they've said

432
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,191
Pretty much all along

433
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
You know hey we were asked

434
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
Ask to leave this

435
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,615
March to the Capitol because there was another

436
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
Stage

437
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,455
I'm going to be set up there there was going to be another rally

438
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,503
And as far as I can tell

439
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,551
That makes sense it seems like everyone

440
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
Action

441
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
Make sense

442
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
It's based on that

443
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:20,768
Trump was onstage saying that he was going to March down with them they're going to have another rally to give strength to the

444
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,096
Spying needing Republican yep

445
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
Sure

446
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,704
Is that I don't know

447
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,496
Incredibly boring

448
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,824
Contradict any of the things that I think are actually the problem

449
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,872
It's just kind of

450
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
It's on the side

451
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
Defense

452
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Is

453
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,552
I mean 88 Rings true just because it's the only party

454
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
The story that they have told

455
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
Exactly the same way

456
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,512
Over and over and over again you know like every other part of it that's a false flag in there all that stuff

457
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,864
In the first week after it happen

458
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,680
Andrew the story of like we were

459
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
Instigating we were walk

460
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,312
Always the same always the same the video of Alex

461
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,640
Very clearly being like don't do this

462
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
Yeah

463
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,480
It checks out and it does follow his behavior

464
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,016
What I was watching

465
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,064
The live coverage on the day

466
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
The way that Harrison

467
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
Smith was celebrating it

468
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,928
And I realized it was going down

469
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,952
Yeah everything change

470
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Recovery John Infowars

471
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
Because

472
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,584
Alex was in the field he didn't have

473
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
Control over what Harrison was doing

474
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
Subscript and realized

475
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
And Alex

476
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,800
There's also video of a one of his employees

477
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
Police to let Alex

478
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
Get on like a megaphone tool

479
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Play calm the crowd down

480
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:48,320
First of all the other cop absolutely.

481
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:59,072
And even best-case scenario he gets up there like I everybody stop and then they don't

482
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
It's a no-win situation but

483
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
They have of their actions

484
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
The near behavior on that day

485
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
Unless somebody can provide actual evidence

486
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
Of them

487
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Doing that

488
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,664
Is cover for what they're doing behind the scenes right unless that can be demonstrated then

489
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
I just

490
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,736
I don't know I don't think the story

491
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,808
Have Alex's actual actions that day are as important

492
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
As the app

493
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
The story

494
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
A conversation about

495
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
How these narrative

496
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,464
Propelled

497
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
2

498
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
Ibiza

499
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,840
I think the thing that bothers me most about

500
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,864
People

501
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:38,240
Being like this s***

502
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
Is that

503
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
Ultimately York

504
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Giving Alex

505
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
Too much

506
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
Credit

507
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176
Yeah you're amazing like Darth Vader

508
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
He is too much of a

509
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Howard

510
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,576
To ever even come close to doing something like that

511
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,136
Whenever you give him that kind of like

512
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
I'm sure part of the reason that he wants

513
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
To do this is just so we can be like seed looking how

514
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:04,352
Look at how strong people think I am much people think I could be running everything

515
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,912
If only I weren't so much of a giant f****** cow

516
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
Coward

517
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,264
I mean just a stumblebum

518
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
The courage

519
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
2

520
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
Do something

521
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,016
Like that would be surprised

522
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
Speaking of the business though

523
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
Alex toys playing at

524
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
I think it was after the security guard interview

525
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
And I just thought this was really fun

526
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
The globalist want all of us to be

527
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Refrigerator

528
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
What's the price today

529
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,512
So yeah Alex's family has a ritual of making juice

530
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
Powder

531
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
Man

532
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,400
I just think it's fun to lie call it a ritual

533
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
Carrabba's

534
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:16,288
Achilles all off it so in order to fight back my family

535
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:22,688
To swim at Kool-Aid pretty regularly

536
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:28,064
Sunny D commercials were like no sunny day we're going to make our own stuff

537
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
I just think that's fun

538
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
Appraising is fun

539
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Start having some gas

540
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
That's no fun

541
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
What a crazy thing to be involved with Nick

542
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,056
Nowell and it's really gotten

543
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,592
Breaking new report here from

544
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Revolver I think

545
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
It's blown the lid

546
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
Wide open on the

547
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,016
Fire situation and hopefully given some clarity about what really went on on that

548
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:04,160
They write the baby baby big

549
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,208
And I kind of miss poker earlier

550
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,584
Revolver is primarily just a link aggregator like drudge but they do actually post some of their own blog

551
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
I think what happened earlier is

552
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,192
Is that Alex reference the link they posted

553
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
To this whole article

554
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,032
Pinpoint for the day was supposed to be about this

555
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
His blog

556
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
BigNik brings up gotcha

557
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,896
Gotcha this is just a really overwritten

558
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,968
Plea for people to insist that the only relevant variable in

559
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
What terms of January 6th

560
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,784
Is whether or not law

561
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Enforcement head moles

562
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,856
Inside the keepers

563
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
I'm a 3%

564
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,464
That's the only thing that matters Aunt if law enforcement did

565
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Then the whole

566
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
Thing has to be a sham

567
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
One paragraph really stood out to me as dumb

568
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
If it turns out

569
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
The federal government

570
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,960
FBI army counterintelligence or similar agency

571
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,800
Undercover agents are confidential informants embedded in any of the groups

572
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,336
Involved in January 6th

573
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,688
The federal intelligence agencies failing to warn of the potential for violence

574
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
Looks less like an innocent mistake

575
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,272
And more like something

576
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Sinister

577
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,088
This is part of a discussion

578
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
About how the

579
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
Excuse that has been used to explain the storming

580
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,208
That there was an intelligence failure

581
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,536
But if that's what was used but if there were any informal

582
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
Pedro

583
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
And that's

584
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
Suspicious

585
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,400
Thing that they're using that excuse now

586
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Sure

587
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,216
Any idea how these types

588
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,264
The groups operate knows that this sentiment is

589
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
Just so dumb

590
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,384
Groups like The Oath Keepers specifically follow it leaderless resistance

591
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
Since models

592
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
The confidential informants

593
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
Can cause

594
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,832
One group inside the organization might have no idea what another group is up to and its best

595
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
If it stays that way

596
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,440
There are Central figures in these organizations like Stewart Road

597
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,488
For The Oath Keepers are Enrique tarrio for

598
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
For the proud boys

599
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,072
Know what each other Splinter groups is up

600
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
They set up their group

601
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Like a disconnect

602
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
Good franchises

603
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Because then it's

604
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
It's harder to disrupt

605
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,264
There's a classic strategy that the extreme right-wing

606
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
Has been using for a long time

607
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
Specifically songs tonight

608
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:03,456
Call terrorist conversations

609
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,248
Right-wing circle's out

610
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,552
Being there there model

611
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:11,136
495 mean they wanted to create an insurgent

612
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,952
Attitude and they have 100% done

613
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,024
Even Alex's show operates kind of this way

614
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,328
Like when Millie Weaver put out Shadow gay

615
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,168
It was pretty clear that Alex had no idea what she was doing with her time

616
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
Use pain

617
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
Sing for the documentary book

618
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
She didn't know what her point was who she was

619
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,312
Was talking to he know anything

620
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,640
She as is the case with most of his employees

621
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
Are tasked with

622
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
Knowing what they're supposed

623
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,248
To do an operating in Waze where Alex has

624
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:42,112
Plausible deniability to not be personally implicated if something they do is a f******

625
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,512
Renovations would definitively prove that the government at all the information about the group

626
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
Plant is just dumb

627
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,608
And I refuse to believe that whoever wrote this piece doesn't know that

628
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,912
This is just sort of like a dip

629
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,960
It's argument it's not even a real

630
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
It's kind of ridiculous

631
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:04,896
I tried to read this piece and it basically just boils down to how there are people who are left anonymous

632
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,176
In charging documents

633
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
For The Oath Keepers

634
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,040
The Oath Keepers who were indicted in

635
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,368
In the storming there's names that are not listed

636
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,672
Person-to-person three

637
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,232
Answer like as one of these to be forever.

638
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
It's full of like

639
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
Enticing speculation but if

640
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
Literally proved

641
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
It's just

642
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
States

643
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
Did the very long

644
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,960
Article 2 prove

645
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,264
So then it's not even they're not even

646
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
Making the argument that it's

647
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,848
The false flag so much is it entrapment

648
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,456
Yeah yeah but it means liking me whatever you want now

649
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:45,344
Words have no meaning in this world not anymore

650
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
So

651
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,720
The idea is that these FBI agents inside these groups

652
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
Who are now these are

653
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
Name people in the

654
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
The charging document

655
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
RS

656
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,888
They're all FBI agent I guess what

657
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,936
Alex knows who they are

658
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
We'll just leave it at that

659
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,336
We know the names of the FBI agents Direction in the building

660
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,616
Dodgers informant

661
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
What are they going to do Nick

662
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,968
In the next few weeks and months when that's all Rollies

663
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,808
Tommy said yeah we were in there

664
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,160
Again

665
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
Watch this space

666
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,232
For Alex to announce

667
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,024
Vanilla wow

668
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:29,632
I can't do this not to happen

669
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
His parade if you just started Maven FBI

670
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
Show me princesses

671
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,008
Incredibly annoying

672
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
I find him

673
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,568
Insufferable

674
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,384
He's not talking about being banned from

675
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
I'm flying at this point

676
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,224
But he is talking about have this

677
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
January

678
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
Unravel

679
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
When did unravel

680
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Everything

681
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
Comes with it

682
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,184
It's like that sweater song

683
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
Weezer

684
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
Weezer

685
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,048
Izakaya

686
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,888
Don't know if you want to destroy my sweater

687
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:07,264
I do not know this thread as I walk away

688
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,568
I don't really love them that much either but

689
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,128
I know references

690
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,432
If you want to destroy the globalist

691
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,272
Sweater you pull the thread of January 6th while they walk away

692
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
Unravel it all of this

693
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
Is the myth of January

694
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,648
Travel the myth

695
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
The 20

696
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,720
20 election the b in Lansing

697
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,280
That will unravel the mess up

698
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
Call Bad Waitress

699
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,352
The pretext to use the mail in ballots

700
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,632
How to rig the election

701
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
It's going on travel all the event

702
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,704
Sabine tire patch

703
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,824
All of this was commentating in the overthrow of Donald Trump by the Deep state

704
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,384
It was all just a big colorevolution in this

705
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,944
This is one of those things that is going to

706
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
If this comes apart

707
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
Will unravel a

708
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Series

709
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,320
Huge mass

710
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Supplies

711
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:58,208
So Nick Fuentes has a unified conspiracy about everything that's happened over the last

712
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,000
Year-and-a-half or so

713
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Cool

714
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Yeah

715
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Yeah

716
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
Yeah

717
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,656
So when this goes nowhere

718
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:12,288
F****** b******* back to complain about the airline

719
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
I just

720
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:17,664
Can't stand it said I don't know he'll just Retreat to like demographic

721
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Birth rate

722
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,480
Nonsense

723
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,296
He tried really yelling into his face

724
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,344
Another

725
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
But just like

726
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
No

727
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:34,560
I know her and over and over and over again Banshee like power with your yelling

728
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:40,960
I think that the smug prick like

729
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Resume

730
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
Throughout his

731
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
High School

732
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
Career and

733
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,128
Years he's been out of high school

734
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,712
I'm getting a lot of people

735
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,528
Why so easy to hate

736
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
Only gets

737
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Easier

738
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,904
Global temperature going to organize group

739
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
Into thinking it's okay to literally

740
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
Can override

741
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,328
Marshall Plan I can do it according

742
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,144
Glasurit according to race they admit that

743
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,800
They doing and you're right that's what's happening in South Africa that is what hap

744
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,360
Happened in WoW iblade formerly Rhodesia

745
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
This is what's happening all across the

746
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
The world

747
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,224
Little people are just going to have to make a really tough

748
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
Decision which is

749
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
What are we willing to

750
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,624
To do to save our Western Civilization we were given this great inheritance

751
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
Okay okay

752
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,696
So I love

753
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,024
When someone like a Nick Fuentes is like I'm not racist at all

754
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,352
And then he starts talking about Western Heritage

755
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
And great

756
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,448
Inheritance and how it was squandered

757
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:49,056
And the two examples that he has of the squandering of it or South Africa and f******

758
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,384
What are those things have in common

759
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
Ikea

760
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,432
Bastard

761
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
Believe

762
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,248
That white people were forced

763
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,552
To endure the Injustice of

764
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,624
Continuing 20 90% of South Africa

765
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,696
I feel I feel like those

766
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,512
Sort of moments are real indications that like

767
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
He is trolling

768
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,096
Like whenever he's like I'm not racist

769
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,936
Hi this is just I just care about America like he

770
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
He's nosy

771
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
He's talking with you

772
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
It's not right

773
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,568
Rhodesia memes white nationalist

774
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,360
The end just being like

775
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:27,200
Hey here's how Rhodesia should have gone we keep it is

776
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,480
White nationalist

777
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,296
I mean there's no other way of putting it

778
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,624
We believe we should be able to go into a country

779
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,208
Take all of their land by force and violence and then

780
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
And force them to work for us

781
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
For nothing

782
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,816
Yeah yeah

783
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,840
Nick Fuentes

784
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:48,448
Nick Fuentes on the show until I get some of this

785
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Priorities

786
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,008
I got kind of tired of Nick

787
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,568
They weren't really talking about much

788
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
Just about how like

789
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,640
The extreme-right is so strong

790
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
Overthrow the

791
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,504
And capital all of this

792
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
But they're going to pull that

793
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
Fred and all is going to collapse

794
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Systems.

795
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
14

796
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,624
The right

797
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
Is going to win that doesn't sound

798
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,744
Untrue Alex also has his lawyer bar

799
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,536
I can listen to any of that

800
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,072
Does who gives a s*** at work

801
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,912
Nope

802
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Jealous

803
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,216
Bored meme

804
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,800
Try stand-up also talks to Pete Santilli

805
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,104
Who's the guy we heard a couple times on the show

806
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,152
Zeii heard this

807
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,968
And I was like well you are disqualified sir

808
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,784
My dad when I got out of the Marine Corps

809
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,344
He gave me a sit-down he was telling me how powerful

810
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,648
The Nazi

811
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,696
You know a socialist movement was

812
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,024
And he in fact and my dad is not a white supremacist

813
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
It was so powerful

814
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Voted for Hitler was the people

815
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,032
Allowed Hitler to rise to power

816
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,104
Because of the trinkets that they offer out you know

817
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,408
Of course free please for everyone

818
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,944
Going for everyone

819
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
He said it was so powerful

820
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,528
But it was the people that actually

821
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,552
Are propelled

822
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
Hitler to power

823
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,392
Firstly Hitler was very specifically not

824
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:17,792
Favor of universal programs are advocating for free

825
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:23,168
Forever for Ariens but not forever one baby later

826
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:27,264
This is an absolute fabrication and lie about how Hitler came to power

827
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:31,360
It doesn't matter that this has nothing to do with reality this story doesn't exist

828
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,920
To convey history and help people understand the world better

829
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,712
The reason the story exists

830
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,760
Siddhivinayak social welfare programs

831
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Pure and simple

832
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
Hitler did

833
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,624
Become Chancellor because he and the Nazis offered everyone trinca

834
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:48,256
Peter run for president against Hindenburg in 1932 and he got 36.8% of the vote

835
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:53,120
And afterwards he was appointed Chancellor as part of an attempt to create a coalition government

836
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,912
The Nazi movement

837
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,216
I'm getting Outta control but more importantly

838
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
Make sure that the

839
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Communist state

840
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,288
Far away from Power

841
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,944
By the time by the time of the reichstag fire in the enabling act the only people in government or opposing Hitler with a left-leaning

842
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,968
Social Democrats

843
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:12,576
And probably Communists would have but they weren't in the Race Tech anymore

844
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:18,976
Nope Pizza instantly tells the story because he wants everyone listening to think that if you have a politician talking about expanding Medicare social

845
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,536
Security the next thing they're going to do a set of concentration

846
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Caps

847
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
It's total b******* he's just against

848
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
Public spending that

849
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
Like it it's just

850
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
The desperate attempt to

851
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,960
Toyota make that argument

852
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,984
Based on nothing

853
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,080
Dan just wanted to subtlest things in it is that 99%

854
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
What number I'm just like

855
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
It is

856
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
Easy

857
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,176
And it is right

858
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
To demonize

859
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736
Everyone

860
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
That disagrees with

861
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,576
99% of them will be

862
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
Be taken in by

863
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Freak it

864
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,952
They're not even people smart enough to wake up but can't

865
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,512
Blankets are all they need so it's fine too

866
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
Obliterate them

867
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
The app the app

868
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,984
And this emergency report

869
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,008
Really

870
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
Was about 1

871
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
Sing for me

872
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,384
I don't care about Alex's ideas

873
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,176
Babe

874
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
Texas V

875
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
I don't care about no

876
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
Nicoletta

877
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,064
I don't care about Barnes and I don't care about Pete Santilli

878
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
I care about one thing

879
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
Mike down

880
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,720
Well he's one of our most popular guest and he is back

881
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,512
Vitamin doctor

882
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
Steve pieczenik

883
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,096
A best-selling author

884
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:36,288
You're which you are as you were saying last week we were talking over the show you're like man I've been me

885
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:42,688
Missing Steve I've been needing a big Swig but I also was the same. Like I feel Steve coming back

886
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
Like it's just

887
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
It's around the corner

888
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,552
Even when Alex and him had the falling out

889
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,832
About his

890
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
Diculous prediction

891
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,416
Yeah around the election

892
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:57,024
I still was like alright he's on time-out he'll be back

893
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,584
He'll be back

894
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
Be VIs

895
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
Use back so

896
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,912
As far as the bat

897
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:06,752
You made the soft Landing into Owens

898
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:12,640
He started coming back on the War Room a little bit and then that was the way to get there the toe in the water

899
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,712
But the thing that I find really interesting about that clip is that Alex is like

900
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,504
By popular demand

901
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,624
Steve pieczenik is

902
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,256
And they let him go on over and show is like a Hey listen you can prove you can stay on

903
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
On Target

904
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
On the show

905
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,632
Then we'll give you that if it's not to humiliate

906
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
Call Mary

907
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
Kid gloves

908
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,800
He's too popular to get rid of completely but I hate him so much

909
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,872
I need I got to say that is their word guess

910
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,664
That we had like we had gas

911
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,992
There's guess we had it was really really popular but also with

912
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
The complete dick

913
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,296
Yeah I was using us

914
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,088
And lying to everybody

915
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,416
I wouldn't care how popular they were I did not beyond my show ever

916
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
No

917
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,048
And if we had people being like now you got to have a bag on the show be like

918
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,704
We will not be having him back on the show end of conversation you should stop listening

919
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,496
Goodbye

920
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,288
What integrity

921
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,616
He's just one of the heroes of our time tip of the

922
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,896
The sphere undoubtedly

923
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
So Alex let's do you speak

924
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,224
Cosby sand

925
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,504
This to me is Steve

926
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Declaring

927
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,064
Victory over April Wars

928
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:28,160
That's always a pleasure italics to always remember you and I are the

929
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,696
The focus of the rage

930
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
The last

931
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
Particularly when you have what we call

932
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,816
Liberal sashes

933
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
This is what you

934
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
You beginning to see with

935

939
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
Impaired

940
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,384
They at there's a demand for you

941
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
That's the real issue

942
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Stay at

943
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,504
We are in the midst of the millet

944
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
Bateriku

945
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,576
I said it to you year-and-a-half ago we

946
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,744
We know exactly who's corrupt we know where the Corruptions

947
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
Is it touring with

948
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
What you saying

949
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,072
Is the federal government

950
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,608
Trying to hold on

951
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,144
So not by popular demand

952
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,448
Alex has to have Steve back on its

953
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,544
Steve is a budget underwater Martinelli

954
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
He lost

955
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
The bat

956
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,968
Still going for it he's going to mold reality in such a way as to win

957
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,504
What an a******

958
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,528
What a

959
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,624
Better that mean I can totally understand why Alex hates him

960
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
Like on a deep level

961
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
Because that is

962
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,000
A narcissistic psychopath

963
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,304
Fighting a narcissistic psychopath

964
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,424
And losing your reality to his that's brutal

965
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
Like its

966
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,216
It's to narcissist

967
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
6 Psychopaths

968
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
But one is way better

969
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,592
Manipulate

970
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
He's a pro

971
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,431
He's a real Pro

972
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,967
You might have

973
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,015
Some doubts about Watermark valid

974
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,063
Plenty of Fish

975
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
Is it bad out to go to bed

976
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Weimar

977
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,719
Computers we Marquita

978
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,791
Ink Engraving

979
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
And it was a

980
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,607
Fisticated Engraving

981
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:18,751
This was a sting operation run by many of our military intelligence civilian intelligence

982
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,287
Key select

983
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:23,359
Good. People who knew that we were having

984
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
Corrupt government and they would

985
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
Tired of War

986
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,479
And we went on your show to Bass

987
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,759
Pronounce that

988
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
And make that an ounce

989
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
Completed American public

990
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,855
Because you be

991
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
Came

992
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
The OneSource

993
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,951
That was reliable valid

994
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
And

995
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Portent

996
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,047
To our institutions

997
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:47,935
I am going to stay a bunch of s*** directly to your face

998
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:52,543
That you know is not true at that told me about truth and then I'm going to

999
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,335
Compliment you for it at the end

1000
00:42:55,615 --> 00:43:01,759
Compliment as a way of buttering up compliment as the knife deep into your gut

1001
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:06,623
And then twisted around

1002
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,439
Because in order to stand up for your dignity

1003
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,231
Disagreeing

1004
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,535
Bulshit I'm saying you would have to disagree with

1005
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,583
The compliment

1006
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,911
So evil the evil

1007
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,471
That's just so good so Steve's got another predict

1008
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
Dictionary

1009
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,031
Said I don't think this is a good one

1010
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
Basically saying that the Democrats want

1011
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
Exist Within

1012
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
A few months

1013
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,407
That'll be, what you're saying is

1014
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
Be a ruption

1015
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,271
Parties that will no longer exist within the

1016
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
A few more months

1017
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,831
A sound

1018
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
If they going to be

1019
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,367
Successful

1020
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
But they're not at all

1021
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
So give them

1022
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,791
Steve I'll give him till the end of the year

1023
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
By the beginning of 2022

1024
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
Yeah

1025
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
Well once again

1026
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
Be encouraged

1027
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,471
I mean Allstate I would say I have to

1028
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,263
I'll stop it about

1029
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,799
Halfway through the campaign

1030
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,407
You know what I'm saying whenever the Democratic Congressman or is still are going back

1031
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
For their next House of Representatives

1032
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,759
Senators are up for

1033
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,807
Pasta Pasta few months

1034
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,879
I'm trying to be as generous as possible

1035
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,695
Given 6 months is pretty generous

1036
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,327
You know you got at least see if the Democrats campaign before their eradicated

1037
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,863
Completely

1038
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,679
I don't know what that dissolve Super Bowls

1039
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,471
So Alex has this big talk

1040
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:32,895
Hats that Trump has come out and he said we're going to win back Congress and

1041
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
Were you expecting you know like

1042
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,967
No that's probably true

1043
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,015
Well Alex ask Steve

1044
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,295
Did Trump say that

1045
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
And I

1046
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,415
What about the amazing statement

1047
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:47,743
Buy Trump two weeks ago where he said we're going to win the house we're going to win the Senate

1048
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,071
We're gonna win the presidency a lot sooner than you think

1049
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,399
Play something Joe Biden would be gone and now you see prestigious

1050
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,727
Democrat doctor saying he needs to step down

1051
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,055
Election fraud

1052
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
And the proof coming out

1053
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,127
What in the body language

1054
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,663
Garland and of others

1055
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,735
They look like deer-in-the-headlights so can you

1056
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,551
Layout for Russ what you thought was going to happen

What's then now unfolding right now and what

1059
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,207

1060
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
Open statement

1061
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
What trumps date

1062
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,327
That was simply to say that

1063
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,375
Shein

1064
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,447
The fact that we in the military

1065
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
Alien intelligence

1066
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495

1068
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,311
At certain number of people

1069
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,895
Go to be involved in what we call the sting operation where we put

1070
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
Put watermarks

1071
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
Encrypted

1072
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,247
Code on the machines

1073
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,783
The voting machines and all the

00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
The ballots

1075
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
So Trump is it on

1076
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,111
That is so good

1077
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,183
That is so good Alex gave him that subtle like

No

1082
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,375
As though they were going to be different

1083
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,911
Nope same b*******

1084
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,751
Giving some signal to like

Hey you know that it turns out you

1086
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:09,919
Maybe we're right about all that stuff maybe I was wrong

1087
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,759
The submittal

1088
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527

Yep Alex got tricked by Daddy Again

1090
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:20,927
What is it one of the things that might come into your mind is like okay

1091
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,231
Is there a big sting

1092
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,279
Obviously do the guilty party

1093
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,839
Somebody's got to be in prison

1094
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,119
Secret indictments

1095
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,447
Wildin what we call the sting operation where we

1096
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,727
We put water marks

1097
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
Encrypted

1098
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,055
Code on the machines

1099
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,103
The voting machines and all the ballot

1100
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:43,967
In the process we understood that they would be a lot of people implicated

1101
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
Indicted

1102
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
Convicted

1103
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,039
And sent not to

1104
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,343
The prisons in America but you are prisons

1105
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,623
Guantanamo

1106
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,159
We built a whole new

1107
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:57,535
Facility a year ago using new wiring not in the old Wantagh nobody in the mountains

1108
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,559
Guantanamo

1109
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,607
Many of these people have

1110
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,655
I've been sent down without any notice

1111
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,679
Say anybody else

1112
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,751

Guantanamo now so this is just you and I

1114
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,895
There's a bunch of white-collar bureaucrats

1115
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:18,527
They forced to go to a mountain stronghold prison in Guantanamo probably the Pope

1116
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,831
Probably the real Pope yeah

1117
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,855
That's probably true

1118
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,135
Oh man Beth

1119
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415

Steve gets talking about January

1122
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,607
6in essentially what it is is a Pelosi Merrick Garland

1123
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,167
False flag or something

1124
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
It's not

1125
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
But what's more important

1126
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:42,591
Listen to Steve spin his wheels while trying to describe Merrick Garland

1127
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
I really want you to pay attention to this

1128
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,151
Cuz it's it's

1129
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
Outrageous

1130
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,991
And this is once again Nancy Pelosi

1131
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
Thea green

1132
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:50,783
They have this

1133
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,319
Best type of false flag

1134
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,623
Using another one of our wash

1135
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,647
Washington-based

1136
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
Quote attorney generals

1137
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,463
Garlin

1138
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,255
It's a full of Garland went to

1139
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,047
To a school called Andover

1140
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,583
He was a little prep

1141
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
At school for

1142
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,143
Wasp family

1143
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,703
In New York then went to Yale

1144
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
And then went to

1145
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:14,079
Prestigious Law Firm where he only earned a $9000000

1146
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,615
Alex in1

1147
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,151
Case and is worth it

1148
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Between about

1149
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
16 million

1150
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
224 million

1151
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,551
Never having served our country

1152
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,599
Never having built a business

1153
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,623
Navigate having

1154
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,671
Take a rest like you and I

1155
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,487
Show Dave Chappelle Garland I'm sorry it's

1156
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
The Jewish guy

1157
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,535
It's the other guy

1158
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
No

1159
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,655
The Jewish guy who also went ironically the Harvard

1160
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,239
Also went to Harvard undergraduate Harvard.

1161
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,263
Law School

1162
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,847
Steve got the memorized bio for Merrick Garland wrong

1163
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,383
I was going to say that doesn't

1164
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,175
Sound right at all

1165
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:55,807
He's just he's like a little bit too little information that he's memorized about drugs

1166
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,575
What's the throw up

1167
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,927
But you also noticed that like the things that he's her hinges on her like he's a wasp

1168
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,719
He's a Jewish guy

1169
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:08,095
Weird yep yep you got to know what people are before you can

1170
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
Build an opinion about

1171
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,911
That makes perfect sense

1172
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:16,543
Interview with Steve Nash

1173
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Boy

1174
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:23,455
And scary like if he actually believes things that he saying

1175
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,247
He is

1176
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
Gyorgy

1177
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,855
With butterfly Nets

1178
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,415
You should be in a Hannibal Lecter mask

1179
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,951
100%

1180
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,023
Talking about how the Democrats are done

1181
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,559
What was the GOP

1182
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,631
Does Trump has now created a new better party

1183
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,215
His reasoning for this is strange

1184
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,519
What you're seeing is the end of Apple

1185
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
Political

1186
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,591
Party the so-called Democrats

1187
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,151
Turn we will end the Republican

1188
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,687
Party as we know it

1189
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,223
Has Trump came in

1190
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,759
As a

1191
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,783
Black Sheep

1192
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,319
In the Dynamics

1193
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,855
Politics

1194
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,623
He was

1195
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,159
So far out

1196
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:08,511
We the people understood that we needed a businessman to

1197
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,559
Come in and no longer politician

1198
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,351
Has Vladimir Putin

1199
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,911
Open set it correctly when he saw a Biden or

1200
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
He did she buy

1201
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,519
Fighting is nothing more than a political hack

1202
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
Spin around

1203
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
43 years

1204
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:26,175
What I need is a man who has character personality

1205
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,479
And is able to take the risk

1206
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,271
Flu Putin

1207
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,087
Taken before in running Russia

1208
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,367
So yeah apparently

1209
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,927
Fighting the bad president cuz Putin doesn't like

1210
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,207
You know it's

1211
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,487
Really weird

1212
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
In

1213
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:43,839
2021 to listen to Just out-and-out fascist

1214
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,607
Talk

1215
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,655
Fascist lie you know where you're like

1216
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:51,007
I don't remember people being so openly fascist back in the day

1217
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,847
Maybe I just wasn't paying attention but as a kid I don't remember like

1218
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:01,503
Just hearing all these fascist talk all the fascist time I do feel like this is more over than even I remember

1219
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,855
Yeah I mean

1220
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,135
This even on

1221
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,439
I'm putting that aside think about how old

1222
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,719
Wake this conversation about

1223
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,535
An ongoing military coup to overthrow the

1224
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,559
The government is

1225
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
Steven

1226
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,911
Almost there like gleefully just

1227
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,239
Discussing like

1228
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,799
This point we're basically

1229
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,591
Cleaning out what I call

1230
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,871
The lavage

1231
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,407
21 this is a

1232
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,943
Political lavage

1233
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,503
Of America both Republicans

1234
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:38,367
And dammit

1235
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,647
Live in France

1236
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,535
A political advisor

1237
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
I'm using a

1238
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,351
Turn that I created

1239
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:53,471
To make ohmygosh the American people understand swear basically cleaning out

1240
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
The system

1241
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,055
An alternative term for that was a

1242
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,591
Cool or regime change

1243
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,687
When I came on your show and I explained that I had the right

1244
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,223
Just say publicly

1245
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,503
That we were in the middle

1246
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,575
Beginning of a military coup which was

1247
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,855
Sting operation

1248
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:10,879
I wasn't

1249
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:14,463
Coming to the Forefront in saying something that I wasn't allowed to

1250
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,047
Can say he's got a lavage going on

1251
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,095
Or at least you don't know what

1252
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
What Steve's

1253
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:24,959
Speed up political term is a coup

1254
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:32,895
I was going to say cool but I said a different word to make everybody think that I'm super smart but instead I

1255
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,175
Just made up a term

1256
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,991
Which makes me look like a complete ass

1257
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527
Yeah I mean

1258
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,855
You know he's got an ongoing military coup on his handle that seems like a lot

1259
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
That seems like a lot

1260
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
But

1261
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,439
Steve's team

1262
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,975
Very deep

1263
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,767
They're everywhere

1264
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:49,791
It does seem like that

1265
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,559
Dude

1266
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,607
This is a big revelation

1267
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,399
If true which is not

1268
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,935
This is a huge deal

1269
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:01,055
We in the minute we outside the administrator

1270
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
Patient some of them are famous

1271
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,615
Generals

1272
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:10,271
He's head of the

1273
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,551
Bored

1274
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575
But the reason we

1275
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,855
Jumped over Amazon

1276
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:17,439
Which we wanted a cloud of Civilian clown the large

1277
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:24,863
Intern we placed in a 4-star General nakasone third-generation Eastside

1278
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,935
France he was in cyber command

1279
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,727
We put it into

1280
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,031
The White House so what we did

1281
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,847
To take over this Administration

1282
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,871
And allow it

1283
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,895
To play out

1284
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,431
In a car in the wrong

1285
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,455
Corruption

1286
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,735
And they are on

1287
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,527
Miscreant

1288
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
Away

1289
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,879
Because we knew that everything they were about

1290
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,951
Would be either ignorant corrupt

1291
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,231
I am dangerous

1292
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
United

1293
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:52,767
States

1294
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,351
GG

1295
00:53:56,607 --> 00:54:00,191
Won't even talk to buy there any ministration they won't even talk to him like

1296
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,983
They're scared like they know it's a trap

1297
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:06,335
Steve has a little team and they've taken over Amazon

1298
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,615
The government

1299
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:08,895
It's amazing

1300
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
This is

1301
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:15,807
That's a big swing that's a big swing you know you come to see you for a big swing and

1302
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:19,903
We overthrew Amazon first not the swing I was

1303
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,439
Expecting

1304
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:25,279
The cloud that biggest company in the world thing we stole it

1305
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,327
We commandeered it

1306
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
Bezos

1307
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,887
Get out of here

1308
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,911
If Alex

1309
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,447
Took that seriously for a f******

1310
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,031
He would have to conceive

1311
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,103
Fix all that s*** that I complain about Amazon all the time

1312
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,919
Weren't you guys doing anything right

1313
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,015
Your military-owned now or whatever nonsense

1314
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
Weather things

1315
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,623
Steve wants you to know though is like

1316
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,391
Okay so like

1317
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,207
There's there appear to be some Frosty

1318
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,487
Between Biden

1319
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,303
Doesn't seem like things are

1320
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,095
Maybe as amicable

1321
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
Not great

1322
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
But what

1323
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Spine

1324
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,239
Because Steve talk

1325
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,055
The China

1326
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,639
Key Point here was the GG

1327
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,431
Ping understood that

1328
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,223
Biden was not in control

1329
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,015
I have sent him a message

1330
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,831
Approval of my people a year-and-a-half ago

1331
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,879
That this was not relevant

1332
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,183
Shine at we would remain remain

1333
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
Friends of China

1334
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,255
The same time we sent

1335
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,023
A message

1336
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,303
The Modi of India

1337
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,095
To say we are your friends

1338
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:36,447
As well

1339
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:41,823
Wow I feel like Steve is born volved now than he was in the past

1340
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,431
Oh yeah I feel like now Steve has gone from being like I'm part of an operation

1341
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
Intubated

1342
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,247
I'm running this s***

1343
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:55,903
I think I think it's an escalation that comes with knowing that you're untouchable challenge

1344
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:59,231
F*** with you at all so why not go ahead and create yourself as like

1345
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:03,583
This Arch supervillains

1346
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,119
Perspective

1347
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,423
And he's using we and you think he's

1348
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:13,823
He's talking about his team but part of me is like we're at the Royal we level of him describing himself I know

1349
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,919
At this point you can get away with whatever you want you got Alex basically

1350
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
Dead to rights

1351
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,967
On everything

1352
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:20,991
You can just

1353
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:24,831
He's not going to put up a fight about anything you know where David Knight

1354
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,647
If you want to show for a few months and now he's

1355
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,439
Forced to have you back

1356
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:32,511
You get away with whatever you want why not just Legend build

1357
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
Yeah

1358
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:41,471
Jesus this is so big I control all the levers of power in the world

1359
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,519
I told

1360
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
Call China

1361
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:50,687
Put up with Biden it's cool I like there's that big lie. That he's operating on with Alex

1362
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,247
It's too big

1363
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,783
This is just too big

1364
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,319
Notice there that he

1365
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
Key pronounce digipen

1366
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,159
Yes that makes me think of that's why I look

1367
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,463
Probably from talking

1368
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,487
Steve too much

1369
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:07,071
Anybody whoever speaks to Steve toxic

1370
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,095
Sure

1371
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:15,007
He was talking about how like they've taken over Amazon

1372
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,287
They also took over the government

1373
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,871
They took over the Biden Administration essentially in order to let it

1374
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,919
Play out its corrupt way

1375
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:26,015
And this is because they wanted to show the world that this is all Coronavirus

1376
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,295
Bright

1377
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,575
Yeah let it happen

1378
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,903
If Trump had one

1379
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671
Right

1380
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,975
Do you know maybe get a little bit done

1381
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,255
What if Trump loses

1382
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,303
It shows how corrupt everything is

1383
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,607
Even bored. You can write

1384
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,751
I know you think you're playing the long game but there's a bad

1385
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,031
8 brilliant

1386
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,847
Alright well we'll see and that's all Trump is trying to do man

1387
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,687
Trump was just trying to show the world that things weren't good that doesn't sound

1388
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,479
What happens if

1389
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,015
You answer cell

1390
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
Destruction

1391
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,063
And that's what

1392
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,855
Washington was all about

1393
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,159
And that's what Trump was trying to show the

1394
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,463
People and those of us who've worked

1395
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,511
In Washington but no longer live there

1396
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,303
Trying to show the America

1397
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,351
People how incompetent

1398
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
Disgrace

1399
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,263
People politicians were the Mitt Romney

1400
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
A Mormon

1401
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,823
From Utah

1402
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
Governor of Massachusetts

1403
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:28,735
Here's what I'm asking you

1404
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:29,759
Is

1405
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
It wasn't

1406
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,807
A blind hog

1407
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,367
Integra twice-a-day broken clock is right twice a day

1408
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:39,231
I love hearing all this confidence it's wonderful Freddie Okie

1409
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,767
They're now saying

1410

There a secret

1411
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,583

Oh my are you loser don't you dare tell me that Alex could help over

Turn into a little baby dog

1418
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,599
Could actually help

1419
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,623
Afaik

1420
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,671
Overthrow the government

Yeah. In the War of the Worlds radio play

1422
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,071
Yeah this is

1423
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,607
This is a little silly

1424
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,911
Susie wants you to know that the

1425
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,447
This is really actually a good thing

1426
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,239

This is far more of a

1431
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,039
Cleansing

1432
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,575

Talking to me

1462
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,751
You a******

Or not I don't care why does that happen

1466
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,527
Look

1467
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,087
You think that's an annoying way for someone to speak

1468
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:42,879
Do I

1469
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,927
Is it going to continue

1470
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
Probably

1471
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,975
Am I worried

1472
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,535
I would say that you need to show some

1473
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,815
Goddamn respect

1474
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,351
Cuz this man

1475
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,655
Single-handedly

1476
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,471
They took down the Soviet Union

1477
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,287
Years ago on your show and maybe the

1478
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,567
Before I was on you

1479
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,847
1980

1480
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,383
I was involved

1481
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,175
In the takedown of the Soviet

1482
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,199
Not me just

1483
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:07,967
Groupon

1484
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,015
Involve both CIA Miller

1485
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,063
We took it down

1486
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
Without any

1487
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,879
Are kinetic action

1488
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,159
What happened

1489
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,951
Is we made a little mistake

1490
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,255
Instead of picking up

1491
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,559
We decided in that was my

1492
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,399
They have somebody who is rational open-minded

1493
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,167
And we

1494
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
Gorbachev

1495
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:30,239
What Barbershop is on me guys

1496
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:36,895
I cannot believe how magnanimous he is being with admitting guilt for

1497
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:40,223
Nothing he could not have been less involved in

1498
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:47,135
Look in the physical Universe we inhabit anything that he is ever done that has Zero Effect

1499
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,183
Me and my boys we took down the Soviet Union

1500
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,743
And then.

1501
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,559
We put in gorbachov and

1502
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,119
Should have gone with a dictator right from the start

1503
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:06,847
V for something that you absolutely did not do disarmament

1504
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,919
Try that it work the next time whenever they're like hey

1505
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:16,575
You have been doing it at listen I'm really sorry I I thought it would be a good idea to overthrow the key

1506
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,343
Human resources

1507
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:22,463
Is department and I installed the current head and that's on me that's on me right now they're like what

1508
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,815
Do you have a part of the hiring process what's happening

1509
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:29,119
Little do you know

1510
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:34,495
I've been pulling the strings on all capitalist Enterprises since the beginning of time

1511
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,943
Have you ever seen Undercover Boss and then

1512
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,967
You take your beard off

1513
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,783
I invented the chair

1514
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,623
My God

1515
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,927
Do you know before I came along there wasn't

1516
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,695
Photosynthesis

1517
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
Can't

1518
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,327
Steve pieczenik man

1519
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,607
That dude

1520
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:03,167
There's there's a disease there but I don't

1521
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,447
Don't know which what

1522
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,239
Or how bad it is but it's bad

1523
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,287
What is it like

1524
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,615
I feel this way about Alex to is it there will never be another

1525
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,919
No will be another Alex

1526
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,455
Because he came along at this

1527
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:19,295
QuickTime why in the in the era of Public Access TV

1528
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,855
Right-wing radio becoming ascendant

1529
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:25,439
Career was taking a taking a upward

1530
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,767
And then he had this established career

1531
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:34,655
The point when numidia was really becoming pricing and social media and so he had some

1532
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
Credibility

1533
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,959
That other people lack

1534
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,495
When when information

1535
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,775
Became so

1536
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,055
Easily disseminate

1537
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:41,823
Assure

1538
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,847
Steve pieczenik

1539
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,639
Is a guy who's nuts

1540
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
He is

1541
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,479
One of the most fun Liars

1542
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,271
I think I've ever heard

1543
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,551
But he also

1544
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,575
Did work

1545
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,599
It's a state park

1546
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
Wild

1547
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,951
He was involved in Aldo Morrow's death

1548
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,231
These are things

1549
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:03,071
Like they're just real they did happen

1550
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,607
All these other like dicks

1551
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:08,959
To come around people are unlike Project Camelot just making up every

1552
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,751
Beat making up a lot

1553
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,519
Oh yeah

1554
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,543
He also has that

1555
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,871
Veneer of credibility that comes from what he was doing in the 70s

1556
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,639
Play like

1557
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,199
Nothing will ever be able to replicate

1558
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,223
If you want to put

1559
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,551
Together good credibility in this space you need one

1560
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,087
Tiny acorn

1561
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:25,855
Truth about you

1562
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,671
And that will unlock your you're okay

1563
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
Tree of b*******

1564
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:36,095
Yeah but you got to have the acorn and then if you want to be like Steve you've got to be

1565
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,631
Naturally gifted

1566
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,167
It's spinning these Yarns

1567
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
Glamorizing

1568
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
In fact

1569
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:47,871
Or have a rare delusional disorder that allows you to think of these things as though they weren't rude

1570
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,175
Emeryville confidently

1571
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
Steve Wynn

1572
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,735
Be able to work without a light

1573
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:53,759
Like

1574
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,087
I've heard him on other shows like he was on Costa

1575
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:59,135
Coast a couple times

1576
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,159
It's not the same

1577
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:04,255
Like you mean that gimme that Alex straight man that you can just

1578
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,791
Steamroller

1579
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:10,911
Yeah you need to be able to flatter someone into giving you so much Anakin leash that

1580
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,447
Eventually have gone

1581
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:19,103
Until it is gone

1582
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
Whitlock

1583
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:23,199
Doctor Steve can go out-of-pocket we're going to keep them close

1584
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:29,343
We're going to keep him on the leash and then all the sudden Alex is wearing that dog collar like I don't know what

1585
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,647
That is exactly what happened

1586
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,183
So

1587
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,487
Back-to-back to the narrative

1588
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,535
Steve took down the Soviet Union

1589
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:44,191
Accidentally put in Barbershop

1590
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,215
Decision

1591
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:50,079
I think ultimately he should be you should still be proud of that decision Putin wasn't ready

1592
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
Batman that's the real

1593
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:56,991
Probably true if you hadn't revealed the corruption in the system

1594
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,807
You never would have gotten Putin in the first place see

1595
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,623
Playing out all over again history Rhymes Dan

1596
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,415
Interesting Lee

1597
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
Steve is the kind of guy who likes

1598
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,719
It's clean up his own mess

1599
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:11,327
Gorbachev wasn't good idea

1600
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,119
Gorbachev

1601
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,399
It's not strong enough

1602
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,423
Control

1603
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
11

1604
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,727
Time zones

1605
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,287
What time the Soviet Union was 14 times

1606
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,567
So we pick

1607
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,103
Re-cook

1608
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:23,871
Eureka

1609
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,639
Instructed

1610
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
Mistake and I

1611
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,431
I picked the man

1612
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:29,759
Warfarin drop of the head of the KGB named Vladimir

1613
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,527
Putin

1614
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,319
Putin knows he was big

1615
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,599
He was

1616
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,879
Specifically picked

1617
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,927
Because he was East German intelligence

1618
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,975
Bespoke English she spoke

1619
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,511

1620
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,559
Steve handpick

1621
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,839
Vladimir Putin

1622
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,119
To take over for Gorbachev

1623
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,143
The fixes mistake

1624
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,191
Curb after you overthrew the Soviet Union

1625
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,239
And Putin knows

1626
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
Vet Steve

1627
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,311

Steve's Menace

1654
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,495
Is far more dry

1655
01:07:54,751 --> 01:08:00,895
You know like what the hurricane and he was

1656
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:03,711
He was more terrifying that he didn't yell at him he was

1657
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,479
Just like

1658
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:08,831
Wow Budgetel my neighbors houses are underwater right now in

1659
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,903

Yeah yeah he does have that cool level-headed malevolent

1661
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,767
What about him yeah

01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,047
That's a that's a big

1663
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:22,143
So what are the eclipse that we found early on

1664
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:27,519
In our time doing the show was something that we kind of

1665
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,287
Shock.

1666
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,895
I believe it was it was the Clipper Alex talks about going on RT

1667
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:33,919
And

1668
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,455
Evening gets debrief

1669
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,479
By Russian intelligence

1670
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,247
Yeah

1671
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,015
And

1672
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,807
That was a bizarre

1673
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,623
Clip and it's not something that we've heard a ton more

1674
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,159
From Alex about

1675
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,463
We're going to have to find those Steve pieczenik

1676
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,487
From 18 years

1677
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,303
When Alex

1678
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,607
Talked about that

1679
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,655
Clip about that experience

1680
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,191
The first time we heard it

1681
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:00,031
It was the story of the Russians being like you know so much

1682
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:04,127
Yeah right about Alex

1683
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:07,711
The story's a little different now it tells it again

1684
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,991
Kind of different Focus

1685
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:11,551
The last time I was on Russian TV

1686
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,343
This is probably about 10 years ago

1687
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:17,439
89 years ago they go listen to We got this group wants to talk to you it's just Russian men

1688
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,743
We want you on

1689
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,303
So I'm sitting on Skype

1690
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:26,143
Big Board around there's all these guys with beards

1691
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,935
Zaba crtv

1692
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:31,007
And it's like all the big brain bugs are intelligent eggs when they're all

1693
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,287
Lego

1694
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,567
Tell us about pechenik

1695
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,359
How do you know pieczenik

1696
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,431
What do you know about pieczenik what do you think of Putin and pechenik

1697
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:43,295
And they were like I'm not an intelligence operative I'm a talk show host

1698
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,831
But definitely

1699
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,135
They've been sent by Putin asked about you that

1700
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:51,231
I just said I don't use a bathroom at him on

1701
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,279
DeTour for us intelligence agencies

1702
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,815
That's a true story

1703
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,351
Something like it's a border like

1704
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,375
15 dude

1705
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,703
Did you see on TV these like the brain bugs you know like the

1706
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:02,751
Like totally

1707
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,031
Starship Trooper

1708
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:04,799
That actually have

1709
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:10,687
100% actually at

1710
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,735
Just because that's all

1711
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:18,367
Apple X doesn't mean it didn't totally happen What would happen if pieczenik

1712
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,135
Why is

1713
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,439
Single-handedly responsible for

1714
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,743
USSR Russian history

1715
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,767
Over the last

1716
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:31,423
Yeah it does seem like if he was the one who both overthrew the Soviet Union

1717
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,751
Installed multiple prime ministers

1718
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,543
And so on and so forth

1719
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:43,455
I don't even think that the party guys unless it was a splinter group it would have to be that's the only reason they would be

1720
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,991
We asking about Steve right right

1721
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,063
It wouldn't because she would get the phone call liquid

1722
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,095
To find out

1723
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:03,167
Dirt on Steve so they can take him out

1724
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,215
Because he's too powerful

1725
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
Where did that

1726
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,311
That would also be likely

1727
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,871
Alex got interviewed on Russian

1728
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:14,175
TV and like

1729
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,711
He was asking

1730
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,247
The question that sounded weird

1731
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,295
Baby cam

1732
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,599
Or

1733
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,879
He went on a show

1734
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,415
That did a pre-interview

1735
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:28,767
Steve pieczenik

1736
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:32,095
Easy right

1737
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,631
So

1738
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,935
Steve

1739
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,959
The bidens going to be gone

1740
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
Soon

1741
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,519
Although the way he talks

1742
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,287
Facts about it

1743
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,311
A little bit

1744
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,127
Biden will no longer be

1745
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,407
Lincoln will not

1746
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,431
The Secretary of

1747
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:51,551
Estate you will not have all these American Jewish guys never serve

1748
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,111
Country 25 of them remain in

1749
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:54,879
Power

1750
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:58,463
At the same time Trump will have to have a whole new

1751
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,487
Backups is

1752
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,535
The people he had

1753
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,815
Jared Kushner

1754
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,095
Has to go

1755
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,119
The Trump has two

1756
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,655
It seems

1757
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,935
The real strange

1758
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,983
I mean not strange at all but no that's

1759
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,519
Vicious anti-semitism

1760
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:14,847
He seems very strongly focused on defining people by

1761
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,663
Their religion or heritage

1762
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:19,967
Not good

1763
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:26,111
They're very easy visual ways to disqualify people as humans in C4 Jetix world

1764
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,647
Yikes knock

1765
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,439
So

1766
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,743
Steve

1767
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,535
Are interviews about to come to an end

1768
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:34,815
Got to ask

1769
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,887
You seen the bidens going to go down

1770
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,167
Give me a time for

1771
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:42,495
Give me a time frame Steve make me another bet

1772
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,311
Closing to come back again soon

1773
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,103
Temperature in Kampala

1774
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,127
Waitressing work there

1775
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,943
Enclosing know what is the time frame on Biden

1776
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,503
I will not

1777
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:56,831
Was not active

1778
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,903
Let's just say in time

1779
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,183
With patience

1780
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,487
You will see this Evolution that way

1781
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:08,095
With talking about evolution

1782
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:08,863
Okay

1783
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,631
Alright Ali

1784
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:16,287
Convince yourself alright I admit I got the math wrong the end

1785
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:22,687
The world is not on December 21st 2021 it's going to be

1786
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:28,319
December 21st

1787
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,391
So it'll be there this is so awesome

1788
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
And so frustrating

1789
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:33,951
And so funny

1790
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,303
I can't I can't imagine how a little dignity

1791
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,327
One must have

1792
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,607
To allow Steve back on

1793
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,887
It's a date

1794
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:46,495
Embarrassing to level that I would have thought Alex would be above

1795
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,263
He is such a

1796
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:51,103
He go to

1797
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,127
Steve

1798
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,407
That was like

1799
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,455
The around the election that was

1800
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,223
Acceptable

1801
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:56,991
No way

1802
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,783
I let him back on the show

1803
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,319
It's going to look so bad

1804
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:01,855
Doesn't care

1805
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,879
ATV back

1806
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:06,719
He's backing out is making excuses why he's actually right

1807
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,511
I mean I heard it in his voice

1808
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,791
I heard that

1809
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,071
There is a certain day

1810
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:15,935
Respondents in his voice that I felt like was was definitely there a little bit of disappoint

1811
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,983
Maybe a little bit of like

1812
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,799
Just a small

1813
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,359
Smid of what have I become

1814
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:25,919
I feel I felt a small like when he was like

1815
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:31,551
Yeah that's what they're talkin about I feel small

1816
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:35,391
Describing and I'm not sure they relate to this at artificial world of

1817
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:37,183
Bulshit you are so right

1818
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
You're so right

1819
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,975
I'm trying to be a human

1820
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,511
I even thinks

1821
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,791
Strategically from the world

1822
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
The b******* this

1823
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,327
Is a bad decision

1824
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:47,167
Because all you're going to do is anybody who like

1825
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,191
Alex

1826
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,983
And thought he was onto something

1827
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,287
Is going to look at him as

1828
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,567
Somebody who is kowtowing

1829
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,847
To this guy who was

1830
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,663
Definitively wrong

1831
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,015
Beta bad about it

1832
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,319
The Pope's been arrested

1833
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,743
Scrape so that's just going to hurt Alex is Imogen the audio

1834
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,511
Fantasize

1835
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,815
The best you're going to do is you're going

1836
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,583
Attract

1837
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,375
Use fans to you

1838
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
AeroCare

1839
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:23,519
Steve cell supplements to it's not like you're going to get his business wow

1840
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,543
Yeah this is sad

1841
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,823
And for somebody who's

1842
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,871
Self-images so

1843
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:28,895
Ifucking matcha

1844
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:32,735
To really go into this interview and just

1845
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,759
Take a little

1846
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,039
Kiss on the chin

1847
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:38,879
A little pat on the head and I'll see you next time

1848
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,647
Is brutal

1849
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,695
Yeah that's brutal so

1850
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,231
Flipside

1851
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,023
I'm happy

1852
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:51,935
Because I am too I like being Alex

1853
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,703
Who won the show

1854
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:55,519
It's true

1855
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,079
Guy is just like

1856
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,103
If he comes up with

1857
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,383
The baddest chick

1858
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:04,479
Yeah now there's a f****** big head cutout of Steve directly
