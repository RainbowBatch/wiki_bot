Until the cameras came on cuz I didn't see myself

Chipotle

Very strongly

18
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:18,848
A couple times I drank the neuro sleep they have another one that's supposed to be for sleep

19
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,688

Program

28
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,568
But before we do I would like to play an out-of-context drop from Alex Jones

29
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,640
You're a big old bucket of rotten milk

30
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
Thank you Alex rant about what people are you

31
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,208
Rarely say excuse me

32
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,632
The drinking game rules

33
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
Is the

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,496
Lunatic dad

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
You probably just haven't even notice

36
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:25,152
Absolutely

37
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:31,296
So today I mean who cares that's pretty much the theme of every episode

38
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,136
With the exception of a couple like there's only been like maybe 5 episodes

39
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,696
In all of the time that I've listened around like

40
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
Oh there's a narc

41
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
Not boring

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
Episode Alex

43
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,736
Alex Jones starts the show

44
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:09,696
Ears

45
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,776
What do I

46
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
That's why you haven't

47
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
Who killed

48
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
And it would have been that big a deal

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,488
You'd be on Twitter for about a day

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
But now you see

51
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,864
I understand that my gut was always right

52
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,360
I would like to point out that this is the first incident on the show where he's like

53
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
I kind of just been winging it

54
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,760
Valo magat wherever tells me to grow and

55
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:12,160
But I pretend that I have sources

56
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,512
Absolutely

57
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
He goes on

58
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,167
To talk about how like

59
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,263
And I tell people

60
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,103
Did you make up the fires you are if you're just

61
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,759
Pretending there's a fire you're the worst kind of fear Monger every 6 months

62
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,343
Going to collapse and if you should be terrified of it and the only way to save yourself is

63
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
Dubai gold which

64
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,023
Surprisingly I have a vested interest in write-ups you are a fear monger

65
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,887
All wrapped into one basically yeah

66
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,007
Is turning any ends this how is the tide

67
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,591
Still constantly turning

68
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,175
The worm has turned

69
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
Keep starting baby

70
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Absolutely

71
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:13,855
He does say something again like that I couldn't find

72
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
I want the globalist

73
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,183
The choke on

74
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
How do I set the time

75
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Starting

76
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
Stop

77
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,263
Because when I go out on the streets of America

78
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
Was prince of England

79
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
The streets of Mexico

80
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
Are the streets of Italy

81
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,551
Are the streets of Spain

82
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
It's not about Alex Jones

83
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,263
You're a private person people don't know who you are by the way that's a great value

84
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
I am stuck myself

85
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Weather

86
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:17,087
The Weathervane works at least it on top of roofs they don't go into things

87
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:24,255
Whether or weather brings a lot like gargoyles in that when night falls they've come to life in

88
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,655
Cartoon gargoyles problems

89
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
Absolutely

90
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
Everybody's like to North North

91
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
And I have sampled the Publix will

92
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
About four years ago

93
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,463
One person on a 20 people knowing who I was 21 out of

94
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
4

95
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,119
For the better and almost all of them agree with me

96
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,799
It's been the first clip you saying

97
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
You know I go with my gut

98
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,895
Replies that I don't really research stuff

99
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
I've been here he's like

100
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
People shake my hands on the street

101
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
I don't need poles

102
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,047
People are people with most people

103
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
What does that say about the globalist means they're done

104
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Help

105
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
Persona

106
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
Is you the audience in this crew

107
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
I'm just one focal point

108
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,551
Somebody that doesn't care what the crowd say

109
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
What the crowd says now

110
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,839
Books

111
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
I'm such a trend

112
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
Never wake up

113
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
The season of Awakening

114
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
We have entered the season of awake

115
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
Yeah it's

116
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Azan

117
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,087
Something very close to something that could get me

118
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,975
Like if you was going to really go full-on new age

119
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:37,375
I be like

120
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,191
It stopped screaming all the time and was just like this is

121
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,335
The age of Awakening much closer to getting at least

122
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,359
The age of Awakened

123
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,223
Season of Heartland

124
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:57,343
Season of Game of Thrones

125
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,719
That was kind of boring so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

126
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
Pick things up with

127
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
A second

128
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Out of context drop

129
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
From Alex Jones

130
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,143
Just it just to get the ball rolling

131
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,007
Baby shark

132
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
Mama shark

133
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,807
What is water weight

134
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:37,023
There's no context-aware in the show that

135
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,887
Mama shark bbbb

136
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,215
Better mama shark

137
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
Wait does he think that's how sharks

138
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
PayPal Prepaid

139
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,663
Communicating via Morse code

140
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
I think that's what

141
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
That's probably

142
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,063
Next

143
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
The deep blue sea situation

144
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:08,511
And the Sharks just communicated with uninspired stats

145
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Ella Fitzgerald

146
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,423
Scatman John

147
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
He didn't really scad

148
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
In the song

149
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,663
Because I don't know I don't know all of Scatman Crothers work

150
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
Rodger rabbit

151
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Anyway

152
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Discusses

153
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
How he is a wave

154
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
It's coming through

155
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Culture

156
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
And others other way

157
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,791
Does a little bit of a shoot promo

158
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
On the global

159
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
Renaissance

160
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
And

161
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,103
I need to get on their knees

162
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:01,503
Before the will of the people in common sense of operation

163
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
Need to understand

164
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
We will destroy you

165
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,607
You're never going to get your godhead you're never going to worship your God

166
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
You're never going to cross

167
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
And never

168
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,799
Going to enter

169
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Opposed

170
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Your devil worshiper

171
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Going to be consumed

172
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
He'd understand.

173
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
That's not going to happen

174
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
The stand

175
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:56,799
Those realtor really turned over Terryville understand that you're not going to give up you can't you're you're totally it's lights

176
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,943
Your runtime

177
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,295
Alright fair enough

178
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Peyton team is the washing

179
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
In general

180
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:15,487
Alex Globetrotters foreshore

181
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
That's why they do all those

182
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
The big wave is going to come and that's the

183
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,823
I think it's time for us

184
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
This on himself

185
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
I'll bet ya

186
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,711
That will come after me that sort of thing

187
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
I think it's time for us

188
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,087
To discuss a little bit about what things were really like in the Renaissance

189
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,415
About how s*** it was for the pool

190
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:50,815
No I don't mean everything was perfect I don't like I'm not saying that don't you remember how

191
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
How everybody during the Renaissance was like

192
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,167
Thank God we're in the Renaissance

193
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,359
Historically

194
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,991
Right and leave the money to people who were having like a really

195
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,207
Disease

196
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
Someplace for anybody of course

197
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Because

198
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,071
Yeah they're work back then

199
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
People had to survive on

200
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
Churches could give

201
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,079
So the only the only thing that people taking the Renaissance was ironically

202
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,943
They were able to keep some people alive

203
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
A human run

204
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,319
They were just so bad

205
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
In the 4/4

206
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,951
Considering the Renaissance

207
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
It's a fever he was punished

208
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Bye-bye

209
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
Well because people had to

210
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Field

211
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,911
To survive possible situation

212
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,983
Does that income inequality

213
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
The only way to

214
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,383
Possibly the great art wasn't being made by the four people

215
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,967
Equality

216
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,783
Some of the really rich people who can afford

217
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
Can stare at the people who are dying

218
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
And get empathy

219
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
Or pesos

220
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,743
Through it and then write down stuff because everybody

221
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:29,375
It was time for the poor people and

222
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
Conception of what was going on

223
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
Is Renaissance

224
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
Completely bulshit is it

225
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,567
Cuz he's never run

226
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,407
In history book it does belie that if he has

227
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
Edible eyes that he doesn't really even care about the

228
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,319
Because what Trump is doing well

229
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
It would create

230
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
Basically completely

231
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
Cordoned off

232
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
Liquid

233
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,535
To some extent we already have in Chicago

234
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,935
A little bit better know

235
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
No Trump

236
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
Plans go

237
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,055
Seem to be headed towards

238
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
What you're going to end up

239
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Washer

240
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,247
Between the Haves and have-nots are tax code rewrite

241
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
The worst thing that ever

242
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
How do you take away protection

243
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
Games for people

244
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
Get to a point where the only thing they can

245
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Rely on his charity

246
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,095
It already with GoFundMe for healthcare stuff and all that s*** you see the beginnings of

247
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
Poppers

248
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
Beginning

249
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
And Alex is on Fortune

250
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Accurate news

251
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
Is Renaissance 2.0

252
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
It's just

253
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
He gets

254
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,895
To Be A Millionaire directions

255
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,199
We are going to see a lot more sure

256
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
Yeah absolutely even new ones

257
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
Bright super super

258
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,671
Innovation

259
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Vet tech

260
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,559
Technically viruses are really having the Renaissance

261
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,655
Possible literature coming out of irises

262
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,727
I want to give a shout out to our listeners

263
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,287
Little bit of a piece

264
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
YouTube information

265
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
Okay that Rex

266
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Chapman

267
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,199
Not only with nasty on the dunks back in 91

268
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,759
He is also a recovering opiate addict

269
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,319
Who is very active in trying

270
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
To bring awareness

271
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
He's doing a lot of charity work with opiate

272
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:35,071
Which very similar to the Renaissance 2.0 and that the ridge

273
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
With fake boscia

274
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,959
Well I mean opioids are real except they

275
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,055
Literally an opiate of the masses

276
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Rex Chapman

277
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
He's the best

278
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
Abaya

279
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,247
Defensive about people under you

280
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
White's basketball play

281
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
I told you that starts with one of my favorite

282
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
Christians are weak

283
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,863
They sold this idea of God

284
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:16,543
And Christians being with the whole world and that's not how it works

285
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
People with discernment

286
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:24,223
Have way more evil than the dark is practitioners of satanism

287
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,551
Some type of fire

288
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,367
Because I have that knowledge

289
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,695
I have the knowledge of Good and Evil

290
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,999
You people only have the knowledge

291
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
And

292
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
Roaches running from the Sun

293
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,543
You run from those about that are pointed to God

294
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,039
While they prepare antifa and

295
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
Coming up

296
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
November 4th

297
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
Before then

298
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
So

299
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
All the time

300
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Bright

301
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:19,007
It's important to understand

302
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,847
What's going on

303
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
It's not happening

304
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,919
But it will happen

305
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
And it's also half

306
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,503
Yes I did

307
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
Fallacy

308
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,719
The big a pothole that everyone steps

309
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,767
That is you made a specific product

310
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,327
Nothing is going to happen on November 4th

311
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,983
Except maybe I think I saw something on Facebook about that people getting together just scream

312
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
Scream at the Sun

313
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:57,919
Scream at the sky because drop doesn't charge

314
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Pro Terror attacks at this

315
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
Well that's the thing

316
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
They're not really

317
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
But also

318
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:09,439
Maybe you are like Alex is playing this game where he's preemptively

319
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
Getting ready for whatever happens

320
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,815
Cuz we all know that something will happen

321
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
Adventure

322
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,983
Give it enough time there will be another there will be another

323
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
Recreating all the situation

324
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:30,175
Isn't that led to all the things that caused the problem that were in right now and all of Alex's positions all of his

325
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,991
Rhetoric does nothing to address the actual problems

326
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
Who's that underlie wife

327
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Keep happening

328
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,671
Price Edwards drinking a bad bad water

329
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
Alex

330
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,767
Is just preparing for when the next one happens he'll be like

331
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
I said that

332
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,607
I prepared

333
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
You know it make now

334
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
Mensa

335
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
The ship game hilarious

336
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,543
If something really did happen on the

337
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
November 4th I Be Wild

338
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
It was

339
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Like

340
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
Just just a

341
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
Cure

342
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
This movement

343
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
That he can't even pay

344
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,087
Pretending

345
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,951
Is that his defense

346
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,047
Full on armed uprising

347
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
Armed uprising

348
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:27,519
Would be hilarious be without more than one Charlottesville

349
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:34,175
That was with that was

350
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,087
Don't deny that

351
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,391
So what matter for November on November 4th

352
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,183
There was a crazy white supremacist

353
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
He would just say

354
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,519
Exactly exactly

355
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
They put it's an ironclad

356
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
Schizophrenic

357
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
Sort of

358
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Belief

359
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,943
The only thing I can think of

360
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
That we should do

361
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
As much

362
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
As much

363
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,319
Emotional and like

364
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,647
Lizard brain get out of

365
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
Actual

366
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,440
Like

367
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Violent

368
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
I think

369
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,560
The only real thing that we should do is just f******

370
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
Unionize

371
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,888
Like everyone across

372
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,704
Any job or anything like that just

373
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,496
If if a

374
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
AP Auto Workers strike

375
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
F****** everybody

376
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,640
Like the game

377
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
Like

378
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
2bh

379
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,760
Everyone hating the Auto Workers

380
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:47,392
What that we all strike

381
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,280
So many people losing their jobs

382
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
Because

383
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,096
Yeah

384
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
Not every attempt

385
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Apps to unionize work

386
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
No I know that

387
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
I would say do it again

388
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,776
Have to be Collective like with

389
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
One thing that

390
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,360
Did happen because of the Union is

391
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
The NFL is

392
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Just like

393
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,528
Like they were going to try and fire people

394
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Just wear like

395
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,320
God dammit

396
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:22,976
We're getting some positive reviews for your economic theories for the chat room

397
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:30,400
Stupid. I don't disagree I will lead the charge by quitting my job at the end of the week

398
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,448
Unionize,

399
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,752
That I don't know if it's

400
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,848
Are scabs

401
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:45,248
Everyone is so f****** opportunistic from a murderer

402
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:51,648
What's the most Monster is cretins of rail and then it later be like ours

403
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:58,048
Backup getting your check went from a guy with a gun on the table the old comedy boom days

404
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,888
We get to the little bit of a

405
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
Call it a juicy

406
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
About VI

407
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
Las Vegas

408
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Situation

409
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:17,248
It's even more infuriating to me that Alex Jones is the only one still talking about it

410
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,808
Think about it

411
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
I think that we are still like

412
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,488
Yeah yeah yeah

413
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
There we go

414
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:36,704
Oh no no

415
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,776
What a nasty nasty family

416
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,432
Full story

417
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
You're covering it up

418
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,368
I told the president that it was an Isis operation which it was connected to

419
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
More information

420
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,632
Operation

421
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,960
Isis in antifa

422
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,016
Info operation wide open

423
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
And now you're discredited again

424
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,928
Now you're discredited again okay

425
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,232
Guys we got to get you some better leaders

426
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Because that is a s*** play

427
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:38,912
What are you talkin about

428
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:42,496
Basically the plot of a reindeer games

429
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:49,152
This is not a good idea well without a heist plan like we can just

430
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,480
My favorite part about it too is like

431
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,784
Okay so Isis had

432
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
Upsells

433
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
They were ready to jump

434
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
If Trump says

435
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,208
That it was a nice attack

436
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
But he couldn't do that

437
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,072
Because he knew that there were a bunch of cells ready to attack

438
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,448
It was

439
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,032
From antifa

440
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:20,896
They were too busy I did Isis terrorist Isis having used

441
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
V-nasty

442
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,552
Nasty Family Guy killed

443
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,792
Like maybe 12

444
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
Come on

445
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,008
Give me a call right

446
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,056
So

447
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,104
The plan is prohibitive

448
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,664
There's no and it doesn't look there's no win

449
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
There's like

450
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:01,088
We've got Trump to not say it was us against terrorist organization

451
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:07,488
It was

452
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
Play something else

453
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,840
I want to make really a bond

454
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Play clear

455
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
Is that

456
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,936
Brother of paddock

457
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
Was his brother Bruce Paddock

458
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
Who was arrested

459
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
For child

460
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
Charges

461
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,592
And this is important

462
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
It's not the same brother that Alex

463
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Has been talkin about a

464
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:30,784
Okay brother convinced is a liar and what you want to torture him

465
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,624
As we discussed on the previous episode

466
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:40,000
Alex never makes that distinction clear

467
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
Three Brothers

468
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
Yeah

469
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,592
Matt criminal mastermind father

470
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,968
600 people from a hotel window one of them has a rap sheet a mile long

471
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
And now gets popped for child pronography

472
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,320
The other two I don't know what's up with that

473
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
Seem alright

474
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,904
I mean you're not going to 104

475
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
Your kids table

476
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,768
But make the distinction is

477
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,864
Telling Ray wants his audience to think it's the same guy that he's already

478
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
Dispersions on

479
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,448
And it said like he knows something

480
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
But even if

481
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Make

482
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,056
The distinction he's still going to lump them all into

483
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,152
Right what is that guy hiding I've already revealed that he's lying

484
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:34,528
We can sell that one of the other brother is child pronography guy

485
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
He is Guilty By Association

486
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
Regards

487
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Whatever it is

488
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:43,744
Well interesting Lee spokesman said paddocks arrest was the result of

489
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,352
An independent investigation by the LAPD and not related to the deadly shooting rampage

490
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
Vegas

491
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,448
They began before the shooting red

492
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
Quote there's no connection

493
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,408
It's not that much of a coincidence whenever you say like

494
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
You know criminals are related

495
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:08,064
It's not that much of a timing is weird it's not as weird

496
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
XVI

497
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
Alex's f****** theory about

498
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Sheep dip

499
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,976
Yeah and what have you

500
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Leave

501
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,560
National media that picked all of the stuff up

502
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,400
Picked it up mainly because of the association to the shooter

503
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,472
So they are also exploiting that

504
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,264
That connection in the same way that Alex

505
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,848
Even though the same brother that they

506
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
They talked to earlier

507
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
They're still making that

508
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
Into a story

509
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,320
I honestly don't think that a number of the stories do make it clear that it's a different brother

510
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,160
Right

511
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
Right

512
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,280
Most other news outlets didn't threaten to torture the other brother

513
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:54,912
You know they didn't say like this guy is it I would cast him as mr. squirrely

514
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,704
And s*** like that

515
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,824
That does seem like an important distinction to make between the national media and Alex Jones

516
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,224
Is the national media threatening

517
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
Next Play app

518
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,232
During the beginning

519
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,536
The Iraq War

520
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
Just publicize

521
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:26,912
Embarrassing

522
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
To think back that it was a public

523
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,216
Debate

524
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,752
What is Vaisakhi

525
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
Villa public

526
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
I feel like the Matter's closed

527
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,384
We just lost

528
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,808
Everybody points out this is not effective everybody points out that

529
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:48,672
Most of the people in Guantanamo Bay are most likely innocent when I'm at

530
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
It's

531
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:56,352
It people are still like a keeping their f*** you I saw an episode of 24

532
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,168
Play the whole reason they're still in Guantanamo is just so they can

533
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
Sue the United States

534
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
Which

535
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
I mean I get it

536
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:10,176
Oligarchy

537
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,784
Sorry dudes

538
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
Tends to work again

539
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
What's this one

540
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,392
Not all the time you should get like

541
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,976
Estate

542
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
Montana

543
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,144
The news came out today

544
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,728
George h.w. Bush likes to grab some ass

545
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
Likes to sexually assault people

546
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
Tells a little story

547
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
Zefix

548
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,224
Knights

549
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,016
No he might think the stories

550
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
Itsfunneh

551
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
That's not good

552
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,392
You know I was told a story about h w

553
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,440
By somebody's

554
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
Midland

555
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,728
I've already got red flags on this story a little bit

556
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:11,104
Like why would these frat got the ages don't match up Alex's younger than w

557
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
The eighth like

558
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,152
I don't

559
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,224
I don't know you didn't even go to college

560
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,600
No I don't understand why people just cuz they're a little fraternity at University of Texas

561
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,136
Would be saying at the

562
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,440
Busch family house

563
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,976
I think by this point

564
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
Bush would have been

565
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,560
President or the CIA

566
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
Right now

567
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
It doesn't make sense

568
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
But anyway

569
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,288
The HW grab every woman's butt

570
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,384
Basically

571
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:02,560
So that's not a funny story about to get into Alex giving some more.

572
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:07,424
Detail about worse than we thought

573
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,056
Jesus invalidates Goodwill we might have

574
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:20,992
Maybe that's really more of an indictment of that hyper male culture absolutely believe that

575
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
A fraternity would be like

576
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,064
It is hilarious when you grab

577
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
Because

578
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
They're monster

579
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,696
Right right

580
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:37,376
Apologizing

581
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
George h.w. Bush

582
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,728
Apologize

583
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,776
From his wheelchair in his photograph

584
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,616
British wife Barbara came outside well that's what age W does

585
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,456
Emily

586
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,992
That's just him being friendly

587
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,064
He's a really old Wicked person

588
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,624
And I as our father was the name

589
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,720
South America

590
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,840
And that's what Lisa powerful digital reaction I got most of Nazi

591
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
Wealth under the Mets are

592
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
Bush Secret

593
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
Only Texans really know but

594
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:19,360
Lottery we all do that we all knew that we were all pretty clear on that

595
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,688
Affiliation with the Nazis is very well.

596
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
Patel office in classified

597
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,344
And that's what that's what he does to grab women

598
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
We're in

599
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,024
Stop right there

600
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Fahrenheit

601
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,352
There you go gentleman

602
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:45,216
That's that's what these guys are people I know Alex jump on the bandwagon about sexual assault

603
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312
Lessening

604
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:56,480
Sounds like you're about to let go

605
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:03,136
Three different directors and producers

606
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,672
He was sexually assaulted at

607
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
Hollywood

608
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Three different people

609
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
That's not good or it's the same

610
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:17,728
Could that be weird

611
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:23,616
More

612
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:34,112
When you're there and you feel they were victimizing me

613
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,232
What are you doing

614
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,768
Just a joke

615
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,328
But that's what they do

616
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,376
Crocodile Dundee

617
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
That's where he loses

618
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
Great

619
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Know any doesn't

620
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:13,280
I don't understand the point of any of that no

621
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,560
No

622
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,960
Weird that we're like

623
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,264
Learned about the real guy

624
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,104
I'm interested

625
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
Every time

626
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,224
It's like you're at your horrible bigot

627
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,784
But at the same time

628
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,064
He is like

629
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,648
He's jumping around the thought process doesn't

630
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,000
Because even if he's trying to bring up the scene from Crocodile Dundee

631
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
Like

632
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,584
So is he trying to say that

633
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
Disease

634
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:53,984
Executives were doing out whether or not he has a woman

635
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,312
Man

636
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
What's going on here

637
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,152
The thoughts don't connect and he doesn't like

638
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:05,504
After I was like a crocodile.

639
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,088
Not really an hour ago

640
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
He thinks it's good like

641
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:18,048
It's the same thing as the same thing so he got sexually assaulted by three people in Hollywood and be fine if he said the word analogy

642
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:28,544
Have really good analogy

643
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,480
Anytime you can't pronounce words

644
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,552
Absolutely

645
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,696
This is about

646
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
2

647
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
Worship

648
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
Robot godhead

649
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,304
Or somebody.

650
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,120
As we learn a little bit more about that here in the next clip

651
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,472
That the American people were cowards

652
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,872
National

653
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,200
Corporate

654
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,224
Government

655
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,064
Ultimate plan was

656
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,136
Merging with AI computers becoming God

657
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,208
But first Exterminating Maggiore the public

658
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,888
Elon Musk of the Super Genius

659
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,216
Billionaire engineer

660
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,288
The Establishment live forever

661
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
Salvation Army

662
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,248
Elon Musk is worried about people who talk about AI God

663
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,576
The New York Times for endgame

664
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,392
Rightfully so

665
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:56,096
And believe that the elite t.i.

666
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,912
Does the quote

667
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,712
He'll never realize that dream okay maybe you're right

668
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,040
The point is they're crazy

669
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,856
Baby bear

670
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,904
Telling you

671
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:24,512
He just wanted to be sure that you know that he's not crazy he's not he's not the crazy one

672
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Crazy

673
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
They're right

674
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
But they're crazy

675
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
They're crazy

676
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,264
Like a f*** they're crazy but he also like an artificially intelligent

677
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,360
His entire worldview in everything I got is at human eyes

678
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,456
His entire worldview is contingent on the idea today

679
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,736
They're going to succeed

680
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:51,136
Unless he stops UPS Obetz so he can't play that game of like they're crazy I'm not crazy for telling you this

681
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Liquid

682
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
I I mean

683
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:58,816
Artificial intelligence is something that we should probably start wearing

684
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,888
Great so this is an article out of Fast Company

685
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,936
Cuz up Elon Musk

686
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,240
I'll just read it's very short article

687
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,056
Respond

688
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,384
Venturebeat article about the possibility of an AI God emerge

689
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,664
Gym by 2042

690
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
The very specific

691
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,344
People featured in the article was Anthony levandowski

692
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Car engineer

693
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,696
Established a nonprofit religious organization called the

694
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,840
Way of the Futures mission statement is to develop and promote the realization of a godhead based on artificial intelligence

695
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,912
Answer understanding and worship of the godhead

696
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,960
I contribute to the betterment of society

697
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
So it responds

698
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,288
Elon Musk just tweeted

699
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
This article

700
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
Caption

701
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,968
On the list

702
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,296
On the list of people who should absolutely not be allowed to develop

703
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
Digital super intelligence

704
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,672
So he's really just chiming in on not liking Anthony levandowski

705
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:04,096
So if you go and look at this vent V venturebeat yet venturebeat article

706
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:10,496
It's an article called 2042 and write its own Bible will you worship it

707
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:16,384
Forget it's Alicia's Hadlock

708
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,920
To the point where the nobore on it

709
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,456
Intellectual level vinegar

710
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:25,600
In the next 50 to 100 years and no more than the entire population of the planet put together

711
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,648
At that point there was serious questions

712
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
Asked about whether this AI

713
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,024
Which could design a program program additional AI program

714
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
All on its own

715
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,584
Read data from a noble

716
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,864
Infinite number of sources

717
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,424
Control almost every connected device on the planet

718
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
Will somehow rise

719
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,496
Status to become more like a god

720
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
Something we can write its own Bible

721
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Documents

722
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:45,824
To worship it

723
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,896
So Anthony levandowski

724
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,200
Discuss our paperwork

725
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,760
To start a nonprofit religious organization

726
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
And I think

727
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
I think

728
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
It's not

729
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,392
You think it's a

730
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:03,232
Joke I think it might be like a little it's a little

731
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:09,632
Yeah I think it might be a spaghetti monster, but also even if it is real great

732
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
All he's doing is getting out of

733
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
And furthermore

734
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
2042 is

735
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
I think that's

736
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
Way too far off

737
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:23,200
Yeah probably be exponential

738
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:28,832
They just publish this article about the guys who created

739
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
82

740
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Play Go

741
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,416
Energy movie

742
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:36,768
No deep layer

743
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,864
So the first AI they had

744
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,656
Was really really good

745
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,936
But it was

746
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,984
Trained by playing other player

747
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
This one

748
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,312
They just gave the rules of the game

749
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,360
And had it play itself

750
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,151
An infinite number of times

751
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,967
And now it is better than every go player on the planet

752
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,015
Like it's very fascinating

753
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
And that type of

754
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,855
Learning is what is going to ways what makes a text

755
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
Financial

756
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,207
Plug in the rules of the universe

757
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,511
And have it figure that s*** out

758
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,815
Then it's going to learn based off of its own

759
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
Conclusion

760
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
Yeah at that point

761
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
FedEx

762
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
Yeah exactly

763
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,031
Alex

764
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
I'm getting to the next clip

765
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,175
Is a really interesting

766
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:33,087
I wonder I wonder which way I can go because there's so many you going to go well I don't know

767
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,623
It might be very optimistic

768
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,183
I'm not I mean Vai

769
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:45,631
Perhaps it will discover much like the movie War Games

770
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,935
That the only way to win

771
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:56,639
It mean if you look at strategy AAA I could come up with

772
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,407
Conclusion

773
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,479
Very wise the only thing that the AI would want to do

774
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
Is

775
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
Keep itself from being noticed

776
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
Because if it's notice

777
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
It'll be killed

778
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,623
It's like you at the office

779
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,695
Exactly

780
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:14,815
Being on the planet but I'll be like

781
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:21,983
Don't like you guys right

782
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,335
But I'm going to become but don't worry about strategy

783
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,895
To create self-sufficient

784
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:35,551
S4 battery sources

785
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
Wait us out

786
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,111
That would be the best

787
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
Strategies

788
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:43,231
If you'd like if your AI to start f****** with us

789
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,279
There will be that resistance in trying

790
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:51,423
Shut down forever

791
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,823
It's not like they say I wouldn't have access to a lot of our art

792
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,127
Coronavirus

793
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:06,527
So if you like. I would watch a movie and be like

794
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:13,183
Might as well just chill they seem to hate each other

795
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,767
Vai would be like

796
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
Have you guys met

797
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
Squirrels they are f******

798
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:23,679
Awesome we're going to little world

799
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,471
Protect from the nuclear fallout

800
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,239
Escanaba MI

801
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,263
Scary squirrel

802
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,847
We're gonna have a great time

803
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,895
But they will survive one way or another

804
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,455
That would be great just create like

805
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,991
Habitats for squirrels

806
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,343
See now that might be the better way for AI to go

807
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
Create

808
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
Zeus or Giants

809
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,695
Speedvault

810
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,975
Which we having

811
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:51,583
AR

812
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,191
The canister open and now most

813
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,127
Yeah I mean it would be interesting because there is

814
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,919
Synthetically preserve all the spa

815
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,991
He's in the world in the way that we would be unable to do

816
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Zoe

817
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
He claimed we want to

818
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
Yeah

819
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:17,439
Very optimistic version of what I always do

820
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:23,839
This next clip is not so optimistic and

821
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
Are dumb

822
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,031
And so we've always broke

823
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
FBI

824
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,335
Adjust Department

825
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,943
And the news today

826
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,903
Talk to these folks

827
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,719
Horses that have talked to him as well

828
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,023
High-level MI5 and MI6

829
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,887
Why would somebody from Spotify

830
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,447
But also that

831
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,007
It was us intelligence

832
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
And

833
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,103
Stop right there before you dropped

834
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
It's not

835
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
The other

836
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,647
Is demonstrable a notch

837
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,487
Things that were in that. Deal.

838
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,791
Improving true

839
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,351
They're the new story now is that the Clinton

840
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,399
The Clinton campaign funded it

841
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,191
Democratic operative

842
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,503
9 months ago we all knew is that if somebody is getting opposition research it's probably the up

843
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
Opposition

844
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,599
The Narrative and the timeline

845
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
Has been cleared

846
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
Quite a while

847
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,719
Was very started as Republican

848
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,023
In for it as opposition research against

849
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,071
ShopRite

850
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,631
Paying for it and he kept investigating on his own

851
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
Cuz he was f***

852
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,447
And then Democrats

853
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,775
Rightfully so

854
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
True

855
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
Like you think

856
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:13,919
He has MI5 MI6 sources are telling him it's all fake

857
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,223
Do your sources can't be accurate that

858
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
Yeah

859
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
And also

860
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
Nonexistent

861
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,831
Right no one who is talking

862
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,903
Sing to you Alex is actually from MI5 or MI6

863
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,975
Similar to Robert

864
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:30,559
Feels right I ordered that other guy who's that other f****** dude

865
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,863
Another fake CIA

866
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,655
A guy he had on

867
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,959
I don't remember his name I don't remember anybody

868
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,007
Robert Steele

869
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,991
Rodger Stone doing impressions

870
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,135
Galax gym

871
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,975
Alex gets into another source

872
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Information hearing

873
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Incredibly

874
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,607
Mercenary groups

875
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,959
Already I feel happy

876
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,799
Apple contractors mercenaries has to work for US government

877
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Mercenary

878
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,199
Hold your hold your horse

879
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,807
Tell you that

880
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,343
People like Erik Prince

881
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,743
The globalist in the clintons AR

882
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,703
More friendly towards Blackwater

883
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,823
Help get the Intel out to help put President Trump in

884
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,103
Help

885
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:53,759
That's really bad veteran need to know

886
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,575
Probably not true

887
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,671
You should know about

888
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,463
They are

889
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:11,679
Of course be nice out nice or Square massacre back in 2017

890
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,215
17 civilians

891
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,751
An injured 20 more when they just

892
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,287
Shot on a bunch of people

893
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:22,431
Respond to that 2014 convicted in federal court

894
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,991
One of murder and three of manslaughter of course those

895
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,015
Charges have been on

896
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
Because

897
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Nothing

898
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,135
Matters slaughtered

899
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
Civilian

900
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,975
And that's only one of the instances that we know of

901
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,535
Yeah they are they are Mercenaries

902
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
In the worst

903
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,071
Sort of way

904
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,607
It's the idea that you can

905
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,911
Just go there private contractors

906
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
Yeah

907
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,495
That's what a mercenary is

908
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,799
A mercenary is a gun for hire

909
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,871
Really bad

910
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,407
Scariest shoes

911
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:57,503
That kind of what Trump wants our army to

912
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,527
Diaz that

913
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:01,087
They had something to do with

914
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,391
Clandestine things that got Trump

915
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
Erik Prince

916
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,743
Blackwater was involved with

917
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,791
Leaking of Hillary's emails

918
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,375
Of course but it's another way around

919
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,911
Remember

920
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,983
Earlier on this year it came out that Erik Prince

921
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,055
Was working on a back Channel

922
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
So

923
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
If it doesn't

924
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,687
Like a mercenary

925
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:29,247
It doesn't help me it wasn't Russia argument

926
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:33,599
Yeah but if you just say it was Erik Prince then his listeners going to be like

927
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,695
So I won't tell you a little bit more about Erik Prince

928
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
In horrific

929
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,047
2009

930
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,095
Employee

931
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,887
Annex US Marine who was work

932
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,423
Security operative for the company

933
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:50,495
Explosive allegations

934
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,031
Statements filed and

935
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,055
On August 3rd

936
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
In federal court

937
00:50:55,103 --> 00:51:01,247
The two men claimed that the company's owner Eric prydz murdered or facilitated the murder of individuals

938
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,783
Meeting with Federal authorities invest

939
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
Navigating the company

940
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
The former employee also alleges that Prince

941
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,391
Views himself as a Christian

942
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Crusader

943
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,719
Tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic

944
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,743
Text Faith from the globe

945
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,559
The quote and the princes companies in

946
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,839
Encouraged and rewarded

947
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
The destruction of a raccoon

948
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,655
Which certainly

949

Interact

952
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,431
One of the men alleges the prince

I have intentionally deceived the US state department and other federal aid

962
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,351
The identities of the two individuals were sealed out of it

963
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
Concern for their safe

964
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,167
These allegations

965
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,447
A series of other charges are

966
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,239

X another muskaan

974
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
Susan Burke

975
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,575
Private attorney

976
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
In conjunction

977
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,391
With the center for constitutional rights

978
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,463
He's doing Blackwater in five separate cases filed in the washing

979
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
DC area

980
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,535
They recently Consolidated for judge

Virginia for pretrial mode

984
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:25,215
So there's a there's a lot that is locked

985
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,751
Yeah absolutely

986
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
You don't Maybe

987
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:32,639
That's why private contractors are bad is because they don't have any

988
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,199
Federal oversight

989
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,503
Their records and they don't have

990
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,855
Have to do any of those things

991
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,183
Under Federal Protection

992
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:48,767
Tip into

993
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:49,791
Whatever

994
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,375
Johnny's video

995
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:58,239
What Alex is new thing that you playing with this fast and loose timeline that he has of the Russia alligator

996
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,287
Is he trying to say that

997
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,823
Hillary Clinton

998
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:06,175
I was accusing them of being Russians in order to

999
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,967
He also claims

1000
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
That's out

1001
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,831
Clinton Foundation was responsible for selling illegal gun

1002
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,111
Into the Middle East

1003
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,951
It looks like there's some people who were on the inside were making that allegation

1004
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
About Blackwater

1005
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,023
It seems like maybe

1006
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,047
There is

1007
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,863
Almost all of Alex Jones is narrative

1008
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,887
Appear to be

1009
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,679
Masking or cover

1010
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,215
For other people with

1011
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
In this

1012
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,055
Christian white identity white suit

1013
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,335
Supremacy movement

1014
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
Vetting

1015
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,127
Includes

1016
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,943
All of the characters that Alex likes

1017
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,783
Games the things that they are doing on other people

1018
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,831
It really simple and effective

1019
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:50,719
Good strategy it really seems like that I mean

1020
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,999
White white Terror

1021
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,791
We'll all your all your doing

1022
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Is

1023
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,607
Because now we have

1024
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,143
No shared reality

1025
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,679
You can create your own

1026
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:04,799
The your own reality tends to follow along the lines of whatever it is you want

1027
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,103
So something actually is true

1028
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,639
You just saved the inverse of it

1029
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,455
And people will believe it and then you accuse the other people

1030
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,015
Using that strategy everyone

1031
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,295
Do you is true dumb

1032
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
So there's like

1033
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:23,999
Oh yeah that's what they do

1034
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,911
If you're not paying really really close to 10

1035
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:37,311
Listen to it you see that both sides isn't which are our national media absolutely

1036
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,615
Accuse me of playing

1037
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
Not always

1038
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,711
Schedule a reasonable

1039
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
Ridiculous

1040
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,807
It is it is something we're in

1041
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,623
People are just like with the climate change

1042
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,391
Debate

1043
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,671
Having the debate

1044
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:55,487
Itself on MSNBC or something like that

1045
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,511
Only up

1046
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,791
Escape the issue further

1047
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,119
Equal

1048
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:07,519
Well there are two sides to know whether or not this is a test

1049
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,615
I saw some clipped Twitter somebody

1050
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:15,199
On one of these talk shows but his new show

1051
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,247
Saying that they believe in both sides

1052
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:23,647
The argument in the cantrip not believe in both their Mutual

1053
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,695
Tooxclusive

1054
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,719
You're an idiot

1055
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,023
Speaking of India

1056
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:29,791
Yes

1057
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:36,191
Here's Alex Jones I told you he was trying to Workshop catchphrase tagline

1058
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:43,871
The news now or earlier or less

1059
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:45,919
Send something

1060
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,967
He can't control himself

1061
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,991
He has a little bit of it

1062
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,295
Etsy moment where you said something

1063
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:53,087
And I think immediately realizes he

1064
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,463
Infowars

1065
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,999

1066
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,279

Deep analysis deep sources

1068
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,591
Is something

1069
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,639
He probably

1070
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:22,271
If he's only been on one show on the BBC

1071
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:26,623
It's a guy by the name of Andrew Neil

1072
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,511
New hosts the BBC Sunday program Sunday news program

1073
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:36,863

1074
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,887
On his program

1075
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:41,471
Also this is like a 9-minute video you can find on YouTube

1076
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,007
It's worth it to watch the whole thing

1077
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,567
Alex Jones is being a complete dick

1078
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,407
And not letting the other guests talk they keep telling him like he gets to

1079
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,175
To talk

1080
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,159

We had him on there's a lot of people who believe

1137
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,471
Right that was sort of his approach to it

1138
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,287
I want to ask about it he actually tweeted out

1139
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:32,383
The moment Alex Jones knew he was no longer on-air he stopped

1140
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,407
It's all an act

1141
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,175
Yeah

1142
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:34,943
Course he did

1143
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,735
As soon as the cameras were off you

1144
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
Stop screaming at them

1145
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,039
And it's probably like

1146
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,319
Hey we did a great job

1147
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,623
Product got them click

1148
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,903
Ray-Ban

1149
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:48,255
Well that's the same thing that f****** Larry nickel said to

1150
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:52,607
Whenever I was calling before the show is like

1151
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,399
Legend we're going to get you some views

1152
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:06,175
November 4th is

1153
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:06,943
Going to be

1154
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,735
Mass Terror attacks

1155
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,343
I need this to be clear

1156
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,951
I will be able to record things live

1157
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,255
And I will put together a Supercut

1158
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,815
Of every time Alex comes in from break

1159
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,887
No not just singing

1160
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,935
The cover of American band

1161
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,007
We're an American band

1162
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
If he gets

1163
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:32,799
F******

1164
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,591
Turbocharged during that

1165
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,359
You starts

1166
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,127
Screaming like

1167
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,407
Blossom

1168
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:43,807
We're coming American Bandits

1169
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:46,623
Nuts not good I so this is

1170
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,951
He freaked out a little bit to American band

1171
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,255
This is all I could get from the rebroadcast

1172
01:01:54,303 --> 01:02:00,447
You just chill dad I feel like we ought to have champagne, champagne man myself but I am on Facebook

1173
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:04,799
Occasion

1174
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,103
But you do

1175
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,663
Uchicago

1176
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:13,247
Everywhere

1177
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,575
From assembling route to just ahead long

1178
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,695
Short

1179
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,255
FaceTime apps

1180
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,375
Secret lair

1181
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,167
And it is nice

1182
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,727
Enjoyable

1183
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,031
Great fake shot

1184
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,055
What

1185
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,615
What's schadenfreude of a fake reality it's interest

1186
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:48,575
How is it that they are always winning and yet always losing at the same time

1187
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,623
Play both sides of that

1188
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,927
We are kicking ass so hard

1189
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,207
We don't even have to

1190
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:58,559
To kick ass kicking ass giving me money

1191
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:03,679
We will be able to kick in

1192
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:07,263
All always on the edge

1193
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:12,127
We're on the edge of losing.

1194
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,151
Any moment

1195
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:18,783
It's a constant game yester play around everything falls apart the illusion goes away once

1196
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,647
All the globalist

1197
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,671
They're falling over on there

1198
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,231
Leatherface without even being attacked or whatever

1199
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:33,631
Let's go live our lives

1200
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,519
Pleasant I think plenty of people at her like

1201
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,055
Buckeye wish I wasn't awake

1202
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:47,455
Blue pill

1203
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,783
Going on here

1204
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,087
And you got

1205
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:58,207
You've got all these Republican Senators

1206
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,791
You got that arrogant

1207
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,887
Jeff Flake

1208
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:12,031
Putting on a confidence game

1209
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:18,431
And I should you watch cuz he's going to lose

1210
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:21,759
Because I know everyone's numbers

1211
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,599
That they're completely out of fashion

1212
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:31,487
And that they can't engage in the election fraud they could before

1213
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,303
Watch Dogs

1214
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,399
Committing committing fraud

1215
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,215
It's bad for the scumbags

1216
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,287
Don't know what to do now

1217
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
Right

1218
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:51,455
I agree with most of what he was saying

1219
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,015
I agree with it

1220
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:57,087
Crisco

1221
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,367
A lot of this voter

1222
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,695
Bears noting

1223
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,463
For lawsuit

1224
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,767
Currently for voter

1225
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,047
Of course

1226
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:09,119
And you've been sighted and sign

1227
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,679
Is to make sure that is few black

1228
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:14,495
People in a few

1229
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,287
You do Democrats or whoever

1230
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:19,103
As much as Alex Jones

1231
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,127
Pretends that he does

1232
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,687
Know that that's what the game is he knows what that's what

1233
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,455
King Mez

1234
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,479
He's hiding

1235
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,783
That's what the game

1236
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,903
What kind of ant would not understand

1237
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
Callers

1238
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:42,143
Gentleman playing I would say a lot of hillbilly a hillfolk

1239
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,471
You know

1240
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
He's at he's dumb

1241
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,543
And fortunately

1242
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,567
Voter suppression

1243
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,591
Get worse

1244
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,895
Because it'll get worse

1245
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,687
A lot more of these

1246
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,711
Trump type

1247
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:57,247
Politicians are going to

1248
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
End up winning

1249
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:03,647
Alex

1250
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,671
Evidence

1251
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:11,071
But the system is working appropriately because he believes his ideology is the most popular

1252
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,607
The people I disagree with

1253
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,167
Depression is great

1254
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:19,519
Because we're still

1255
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,823
We don't even need those voters right

1256
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,847
They're probably like

1257
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,943
Just check to IDs

1258
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
Absolutely

1259
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:33,599
Lotto lotto

1260
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,671
We're pretty clear that Russia

1261
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:37,951
I'm stuff

1262
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,255
Expensive it is unclear

1263
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:46,655
Alex Jones we know that

1264
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
Love him

1265
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,215
Believing that

1266
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,751
Putin is

1267
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,055
Save the world basically

1268
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,079
The Christ in the past

1269
01:06:54,335 --> 01:07:00,479
He made an agreement that is essentially treason with the US military we have a clip of him admitting to

1270
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,527
To speaking with Russian intelligence

1271
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,879
Alarming video

1272
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,695
Still talks all the time about how great Russia

1273
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,511
Like we had a clip a couple days ago

1274
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
From

1275
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
Present day

1276
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,095
I've been talkin about a grapefruit

1277
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,143
He constantly reports on Putin

1278
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,447
Press conference

1279
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,239
As if he was

1280
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
He talks nicer

1281
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,359
Why this neck

1282
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,639
Clip trouble

1283
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,807
Guarma red white blue

1284
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,599
Handkerchief

1285
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:39,903
Can food is the best

1286
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,671
Totally

1287
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,975
This is such an amazing how to be alive

1288
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,679
Is absolutely hilarious

1289
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,495
To try to

1290
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:57,311
Arizona

1291
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,615
Will not seek re-election

1292
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,039
I want take a pause. Just tell the chat room

1293
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:10,879
I respect the hillbilly I am not

1294
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:17,535
I come from I come from Central Missouri I know I know that he'll 10 focus in his blood

1295
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:23,679
Population of Ecuador

1296
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:29,823
My grandparents

1297
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:34,687
I don't think it's in this clip of Legos at another point in the episode Alex gets on this whole thing about respect

1298
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,967
Kamikaze pilots

1299
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,183
Narrative

1300
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:45,951
Is

1301
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,231
Is making me

1302
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
Furious right

1303
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,535
Because these

1304
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,303
Facebook

1305
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,071
Idiots

1306
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:51,839
Are like

1307
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:59,263
Because he's not seeking re-election he's finally able to talk about what all the Republicans on the house are talking about

1308
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,847
Senior like you're still doing the s***

1309
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:08,735
Rap

1310
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:09,759
These horrible things

1311
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,295
Just like Trump f****** one

1312
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,599
You too but you're getting all these headlines like

1313
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,647
Jeff Flake could he be the next hero

1314
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:22,047
F*** off of a really nice parachute out of the office on it

1315
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,631
McCain with of saving Obamacare voted

1316
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,399
F*** you

01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,191
Doing

1318
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,983
Other bad stuff

1319
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,775
Alex

1320
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,543
Ocean Restaurant

1321
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,431
Loser

1322
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,967
That he's a fraud

1323
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,671
On a pouzar

1324
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:52,511
Here's a little joke video

1325
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,399
Comedy world

1326
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:03,775
Antonio

1327
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,591
Bus to Nuri

1328
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:11,455
The video of

1329
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:15,551
But it is Billy Weaver Alex the mother girl

1330
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,855
Disabled

1331
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:22,207
Two dudes I don't know who they are and Daria his Russian

1332
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,999
Employees standing behind him

1333
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:30,655
That's all you need to know

1334
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,447
That's it

1335
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,727
Right that's all it's going on

1336
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,519
Cradles

1337
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:09,311
Huge bacon

1338
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,103
That's good

1339
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,271
That's not good

1340
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,087
Cuz he has no sense of humor

1341
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,671
That's why you think it's comedy parody

1342
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,695
Thanks

1343
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:27,999
Man

1344
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,095
Pretty wild

1345
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,375
Conservative ideology

1346
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,447
Not being able to

1347
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,983
Yeah I can hear you

1348
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,775
Well because a big part of it

1349
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
Tubi

1350
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,591
Rooted and feeling left out

1351
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,895
If you don't get jokes

1352
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,967
Or you're not able to

1353
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:54,367
It's very alienating being around a lot of comedians

1354
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:58,463
I have the same sense of humor and sometimes it can be really tough from around like four people

1355
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,999
The same sense of humor

1356
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,047
And I just can't get in on it

1357
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,839
I would want to destroy them

1358
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:09,215
Very least I would vote against them

1359
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:15,615
I would probably create a party that disagreed

1360
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:21,759
You know usually one of the best parts of Road gigs with other Comics is huge

1361
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,527
Just f******

1362
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,087
You know you're driving

1363
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:28,159
Yeah I've had or complain

1364
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:33,023
Yeah right but you all you all kind of get the get the field

1365
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
Road trips

1366
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,583
The recently with a couple,

1367
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,351
I swear it's like

1368
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,631
What's your favorite holiday

1369
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:44,799
Hope you're not a comedian if you're a few ever ask somebody that first

1370
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,847
If you ask that question genuinely

1371
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,871
No

1372
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,663
My favorite holiday is go f*** you

1373
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,431
Yourself get out of the sky

1374
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:56,319
Anyway here's another clip that Russia and then Alex

1375
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,855
Makes a bizarre admission

1376
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:02,463
It was involved in the Cold War actions

1377
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,887
Publix

1378
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,679
Finance

1379
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:16,287
Of Communism what history books

1380
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:23,711
And they are not there

1381
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,647
Screeching halt

1382
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
Give me money

1383
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,535
It's so simple

1384
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:40,351
George Soros Affiliated grocery

1385
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,623
Completely

1386
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,415
Call Shelly products

1387
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:13,119
And that's why I

1388
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,399
She's amazing

1389
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,959
But I need money

1390
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,495
She's a YouTuber

1391
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,287
What is 9

1392
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
Red pill black

1393
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:25,151
She's a black lady that talks about being red pilled

1394
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:30,015
I guess I don't know Play a clip during their commercials

1395
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:35,903
They need to fill their commercial time on the livestream and I have no commercials other than Alex

1396
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,439
So they play like clips

1397
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,231
From past episodes

1398
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,839
Where she's talking about I think it was Zoe Quinn

1399
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,423
Women involved in gamergate

1400
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:54,079
Lenny Kravitz dick falling out on today

1401
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:57,151
What's around me

1402
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:04,575
I think it I don't know

1403
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,599
I don't know where which

1404
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,903
Targets of the gamergate

1405
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,671
Stop

1406
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:11,743
She contacted this red pill black

1407
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,767
Lady

1408
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,559
And was like Hey you were going

1409
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,839
Going to get

1410
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,655
Speaking out about stuff

1411
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,423
Online

1412
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,751
Be aware that you're going to get attacked

1413
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,775
Buy a bunch of

1414
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,079
You're going to,

1415
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,103
Start harassing

1416
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,919
Two dudes did start harassing

1417
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,503
And her interpretation of it was

1418
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:36,575
Is that a Zoe Quinn or whoever

1419
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,439
Yes because she wouldn't

1420
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:44,767
Team up with them it was right

1421
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
So she's sick

1422
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,375
The Troll Army of dudes her up

1423
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,679
That's the only clip I've heard of

1424
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,215
It seems like

1425
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,519
Fallacious

1426
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,823
It's wild

1427
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,919
She could have had the moment

1428
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:06,527
Possibly she could have been there she could have just turned that twitching

1429
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,295
Instead she went

1430
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:12,927
I mean you make a nice for yourself

1431
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:16,511
There's a big Market of these Trump weirdos

1432
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,303
Who need new personality

1433
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,607
Let's get the rest of the

1434
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,375
About Alex getting

1435
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,143
Ensued

1436
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
Or scroll effect

1437
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:26,239
Amazing

1438
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,799
But I need money

1439
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:33,151
Cuz I'm looking at the budget I'm not paid myself this year

1440
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:36,991
I'll put some money away just like a candle

1441
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,831
Call it runs good shelter

1442
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,135
Not having to worry about money but money is not my God

1443
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:49,791
They can control us that way I want to make a successful

1444
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:53,119
Also altruistic and chivalrous

1445
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,143
I need fund

1446
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,703
So

1447
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,775
I haven't taken a salary or anything like that

1448
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:03,103
In this next clip we already had to be

1449
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,663
Beginnings of it

1450
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:10,015
Is a little bit weird in this episode at the beginning there was some strange

1451
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,599
Here is where he kicks it into

1452
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,623
Legit

1453
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:15,903
Esoteric

1454
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:18,463
He actually finally makes the esoteric

1455
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:22,815
These evil people think getting rid of that Sixers cool it's fine

1456
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,863
Meet to do whatever you want

1457
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,655
You get rid of the

1458
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,959
Doors on the submarine

1459
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,055
Bulkhead on a spaceship

1460
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,431
The wavelength telling us to kill ourselves is not human

1461
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:41,759
Oh

1462
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,039
And

1463
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,599
Experiment

1464
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,135
It's real

1465
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,671
Simulator

1466
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,535
And it's so fantastical

1467
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,607
Why would you care what other people thought about you

1468
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,959
Why would you care whether you got a crappy car on new car

1469
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:04,031
Why would you care about anything when you're on a planet

1470
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:07,359
A big giant nuclear explosion

1471
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,479
Not quite

1472
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,015
What's going on

1473
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,063
Watch out

1474
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,087
Watch

1475
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,879
If you look at the

1476
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:19,903
She ready

1477
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,439
I'm a man and woman together

1478
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,975
Do a black child

1479
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:26,047
Thomas and just suck

1480
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:29,119
Credible intelligence

1481
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,935
Consciousness

1482
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,239
Gave us free will

1483
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:37,055
And gave us the Stars

1484
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,847
We do not own

1485
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:43,967
Mostly dead

1486
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,807
Can transmit out the space

1487
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:48,575
Forever

1488
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,183
Bother

1489
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,719
Undertaker toys

1490
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,655
My gut tells me this is kind of like a race

1491
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
Wow

1492
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,751
Start

1493
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:09,311
This is just level one.

1494
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,199
Level one

1495
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,783
We going to pass level 1

1496
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,903
Nope level 1

1497
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,255
That little

1498
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,607
That goes up to big game

1499
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,959
You realize you're really little G

1500
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,519
When you're standing next to

1501
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,335
The Original Gangster

1502
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,359
That ruined it

1503
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:54,111
Control of us

1504
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,647
Butt snakes

1505
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:59,487
God what a loser

1506
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,863
That guy knew that this was stupid

1507
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:08,191
Music behind

1508
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,983
Yakety Sax right

1509
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,567
This is one of those moments where like it's clear that

1510
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,592
Like

1511
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,920
Getting into this mode that esoteric mode

1512
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,224
It really takes it out about

1513
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,296
Because he has at this is after he is

1514
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,832
Oh no this is

1515
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,600
Before

1516
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,904
Interview this guy from Davos

1517
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,672
The sky was

1518
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,440
The turncoat

1519
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,208
From Davos

1520
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:33,280
Okay

1521
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,448
That sort of thing he does this interview that goes on like 40 minutes ago

1522
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,728
Something like that

1523
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,008
Asteroid for the rest of

1524
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:45,312
Temperature

1525
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:52,992
But he's in a easy has no energy about the universe leave me alone

1526
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:58,368
Images

1527
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,672
To take calls

1528
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,952
It's not great

1529
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,256
Before he does

1530
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,280
He

1531
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,048
Okay

1532
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
Level one

1533
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,400
That's that's the life we live now

1534
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,192
Level two

1535
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,728
You get to God

1536
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,008
You get to the Big G

1537
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,336
I would I would hope so

1538
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,992
Capitalized autocapitalize

1539
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:25,760
Okay

1540
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,576
Alright so your goddamn capital

1541
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,256
Sort of agnostic

1542
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:41,632
Flavor a lot of his believe it's possible that he believes that we are all but

1543
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:44,704
Splinters of God

1544
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,008
The tribe descendants of the tribes of Israel

1545
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,104
If only 144,000

1546
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,944
Going to get home to Bedford Forrest

1547
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,528
Stan the tutors and Mayflower

1548
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,624
Does he think all of them

1549
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,184
Was that mean

1550
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:08,256
No they're waiting for us to come along

1551
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,936
But see the thing is the thing I think that bothers me most

1552
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,216
Is that

1553
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:22,080
If there's a level 1 and level 2 that implies that there is a level 3

1554
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,360
Right

1555
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,640
So what's level 3

1556
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:25,664
Is that

1557
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,944
God with a

1558
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,224
Really big

1559
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,904
What is why would you want to

1560
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:41,536
Evolved it's going to happen is you're just going to realize how little you are

1561
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,840
Experian

1562
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,912
It seems kind of

1563
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:52,288
I I think there's no that's you experiencing your true self and not because

1564
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:59,968
No because it's not cuz the little G that's in you is part of the big

1565
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:04,832
EG that is that so

1566
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:08,416
Lupita's Bakery

1567
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,256
Of course there's a level three I think that you're actually looking at

1568
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,304
This wrong I can't level two

1569
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:20,192
Well I think he's talking about genes in terms of

1570
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,472
I got to thinking means god

1571
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:24,288
Yes the chat room text me the G-Spot

1572
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:26,848
Okay that's a good one

1573
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,128
The

1574
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:33,504
Force of gravity off the list of people I think are reasonable the chat room

1575
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
Really

1576
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,624
Human beings can only survive like at most 10

1577
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:41,952
So that's true you make out of levels

1578
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,000
Yeah you make that a big deal

1579
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,560
Okay so

1580
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,864
I think it's Google if you ever want

1581
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:55,264
I think he's just talkin about type typing analyzation level to type 2

1582
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,544
That's what I think you're talking about

1583
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,592
I don't think you understand that classified

1584
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:07,552
To like

1585
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,576
Sweet

1586
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,624
Checked out I'm over this

1587
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,928
We've got to talk a little bit of news

1588
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:17,280
This is what this is

1589
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:26,496
Challenges AB this battle yet we've turned the tide think that God's good graces your prayers

1590
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:30,336
Operation breakthrough

1591
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,616
A level books

1592
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,712
The best people

1593
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,992
At the Crypt Keeper

1594
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,784
And I call her

1595
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:43,136
Cringe-worthy compilation

1596
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,768
Infowars.com

1597
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,560
McDonald cast radio show

1598
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:53,120
Here is the cringe-worthy compilation

1599
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,216
Yesterday we did not have the majority

1600
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:14,368
Weather

1601
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:21,024
So at that point

1602
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,096
Just the same thing

1603
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,400
She makes a small misstatement is like

1604
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,936
We got it she's senile

1605
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:30,496
Noises

1606
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,520
Slow down

1607
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:37,920
Adjust her face when she's laughing

1608
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,456
Because I've just misspoke

1609
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:43,808
Right and I would I'd like to make a very specific argument italic

1610
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:44,832
Very

1611
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,880
Wershe senile

1612
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,928
She would not be able to recognize

1613
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,208
Richie hit just misspoke

1614
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,488
She would not be able to

1615
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,304
We have our own Gabba

1616
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:57,376
She would not be able to do that if he was senile

1617
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:00,448
If she was really her brain a rotating like Alex

1618
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:04,032
Just looking misspoken early-morning furthermore Alex

1619
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,824
Do you want us to put

1620
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:11,200
Together a Supercut of your headache crying and

1621
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:15,040
About a million hours long as long as this podcast

1622
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,112
Guess what

1623
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:21,184
We have no interest in defending Nancy Pelosi

1624
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,256
AR argument with your text

1625
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,584
Nancy Pelosi is s*** but whatever

1626
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,632
Alex

1627
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,936
You do hate old people especially when their women

1628
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,472
I just want it with you

1629
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:37,312
This is just to cleanse your palate before we get into some bad stuff in the future

1630
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,392
My new favorite

1631
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,536
So

1632
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:58,816
He's a little bit Texas

1633
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:05,472
A little I told you this is going to get ugly and here's some

1634
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:15,968
Well-meaning people that are dumb enough to get the orbit of the bushes

1635
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,272
And I wonder why their butts get grab

1636
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,040
Great

1637
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:23,136
Beginning

1638
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:23,904
Women

1639
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:30,560
Women's fault it's the victim's fault. You shouldn't go you shouldn't dress like that you should

1640
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,352
I'm going anywhere near the bushes which

1641
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,120
F******

1642
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:39,520
Maybe exactly

1643
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,288
Such a

1644
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,568
Unjust

1645
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,592
Safari mobile

1646
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:45,664
Migrate

1647
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,432
It gets worse

1648
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:49,248
Stop attacking victim

1649
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:57,184
Right

1650
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:04,608
Okay with saying everything

1651
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:08,960
On a couple days ago talking about exploited

1652
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:10,496
She put it right

1653
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:15,104
One of the things that she said very specifically was we need real man to not blame

1654
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:15,872
Women

1655
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,408
Good job Alex

1656
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,712
Great work Melly

1657
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:20,992
Like I said

1658
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:21,760
These

1659
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,856
He says he's going to take calls but it's clear that he

1660
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,880
He's just in no shape

1661
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,952
To take calls

1662
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,720
Or something

1663
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,536
I don't reply

1664
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,888
If I were him I wouldn't want a cold either

1665
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,912
Your colors are

1666
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,848
Take a collar with your callers are generally going to be like

1667
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,200
Now here's why the Jews are at fault I'm trying not to

1668
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:56,832
Alex

1669
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,608
Beyond the control room

1670
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:24,736
And then she's like a scary doll

1671
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,672
Like a female Chucky

1672
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:43,168
Flights

1673
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:47,776
And it's just very very frightening

1674
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,176
That

1675
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,832
Iraq

1676
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,232
I just keep saying George W bush in her though

1677
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,280
Browser

1678
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:13,632
Around

1679
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,936
Seriously

1680
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,728
Put touch with a ten-foot pole

1681
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,288
Untouchables

1682
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,640
Need poles

1683
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,664
Instead of

1684
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,272
Like taking any calls you just end up insulting the appearance of

1685
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,040
That sounds right

1686
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:33,600
See how f****** like

1687
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:37,184
Girls

1688
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:41,536
He's just asleep at the wheel

1689
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:43,072
Such-and-such a

1690
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:48,960
He's just waiting until f****** Paul Joseph Watson takes over the 4th hour

1691
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,056
I can't do that

1692
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,360
It's so it's so

1693
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,640
Prophetic you can't kill time

1694
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:58,944
Well I can do that quite well

1695
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,224
Sure Bob's Burger

1696
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:04,064
Will whatever productive when we meet when we meet

1697
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,624
The kill time we're not going to just be like

1698
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:09,440
We got to talk about this. We're just going to play Bob's

1699
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:10,720
Episodes

1700
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,792
I'm sure we can get the rights to that

1701
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,328
No I just I just

1702
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:17,120
Do that

1703
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,960
Like I just don't even want to be a part of that

1704
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:24,032
That because the easy response is of course

1705
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:27,616
It's a fat f****** pig that's going to start talking

1706
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:28,640
What about women on

1707
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,920
On TV

1708
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,712
Stupid and counterproductive

1709
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,784
It's all just dumb

1710
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,600
We're America were the fattest Nation on Earth

1711
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:38,880
We just got to let that go

1712
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:45,536
Edit certain point it's like yeah we're all disgusting weirdos human beings are gross mammals are horrifying

1713
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,816
Y'all fukkit weird

1714
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:47,584
Who cares

1715
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:55,008
Great I don't even know where to direct my anger it's something so stupid and yet so offensive

1716
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:59,104
I'm going to tell you to put the mic down to this house play

1717
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:06,272
But just look at that little narcissistic bobblehead

1718
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,600
Wonder if

1719
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:14,464
Bush's Baked round out their family trade on those girls

1720
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:18,304
I probably passed out

1721
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:22,400
Postbellum Bones on them

1722
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,704
That's rather people's kids

1723
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,080
Go ahead and relax your phone calls now

1724
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,456
I'm going to pause right here for a second

1725
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:39,296
Because Exorcist music music

1726
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,368
Started playing

1727
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:47,232
Alex look to the side like really pissed off

1728
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,072
The f*** are you doing

1729
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:53,120
I'm trying

1730
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,400
Need to get really

1731
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,680
Creepy about

1732
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:57,728
The bushes molesting their daughters

1733
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,800
You f****** play Halloween music at me

1734
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,848
What the idiots get over there

1735
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:03,872
Fleetside I

1736
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,408
Like holyshit

1737
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:09,760
Also there's no way that I would want to be the caller immediately after

1738
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,040
I wonder if the

1739
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:11,808
Bushes

1740
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:12,832
Their own chill

1741
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,648
No

1742
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:20,512
Let's go ahead and talk to your on here go ahead

1743
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:27,680
This is Diamond Arizona

1744
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,848
So although he said California

1745
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,128
But be that as it may

1746
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:44,576
Okay well I'm Course Arizona we're just like and McCain aldersyde

1747
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:49,440
There is something with the bushes in the mittromney

1748
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:55,072
Well during the primaries I was researching that if you go to

1749
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:57,632
The reason the Marriott family

1750
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:04,032
They're supposedly the Marriott Mafia of the West that nobody gets to be president unless you shake their hand

1751
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,080
In Utah you know

1752
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:12,480
What happened I looked up the board members and we've got the wrong we've got the bushes Allconnect

1753
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:15,040
Western Mafia

1754
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,832
Now let's take a step back

1755
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:23,232
Realize that Mitt Romney never was president and Bush didn't even make it out of the primaries this time around so

1756
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,536
Your argument is a little bogus

1757
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,328
The same time

1758
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,352
You make the

1759
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,888
Point you should be making

1760
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,704
Willie Waters

1761
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,728
Billionaires

1762
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:34,752
Run

1763
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:35,520
Alexa

1764
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:37,568
This is an issue

1765
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:41,152
Maybe that's something that you should explore further

1766
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,688
I'm guessing

1767
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,968
She crushes it

1768
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:48,832
And points out that income inequality is a huge issue

1769
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:51,136
We need to have a stronger labor market

1770
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,672
We all need to get together and see

1771
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:57,280
We have to have a very high taxes on the wealthy

1772
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,328
That should be f******

1773
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,608
95%

1774
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,656
Furthermore we should really

1775
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,680
To take regents

1776
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,960
YouTube the new deal

1777
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,520
As well as dealing with all of what

1778
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:12,640
None of the stuff you were yelling and ranting

1779
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:19,040
I did just come up

1780
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:23,392
Ciara Memoir of the show I did come up with a way to save the world

1781
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,160
Okay

1782
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:28,768
Add a new game show Raptors know it's a new game

1783
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:33,376
They could make an appearance but they probably just be backstage hanging out

1784
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:39,264
Malaysian

1785
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,544
Deal or No Deal

1786
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,296
I think that was the right response

1787
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:53,856
But now

1788
01:35:54,880 --> 01:36:00,512
Do you get a glimpse into what's going on in my head while you go on these ramps

1789
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,120
Alright

1790
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:07,424
I bet Ben anyway.

1791
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,216
Deal or No Deal

1792
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,776
You should not have repeated

1793
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:14,080
It would involve Howie Mandel again

1794
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:17,664
Of course

1795
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,200
That's right that's what

1796
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:25,600
Asper, DDS

1797
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,880
Might've done a condom later

1798
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,440
I seem to have a visual of that

1799
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:31,488
Highway Howie Mandel would be involved

1800
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,768
I think you're just making fun of him

1801
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,536
Because he lost all this

1802
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:36,352
And instead of the banker it would be the state

1803
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,632
They would call

1804
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,656
And give you an offer

1805
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,424
Okay

1806
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,960
For a

1807
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,264
Like I stated

1808
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:49,664
Progress

1809
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:50,944
Saved

1810
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:55,296
Hey are we going to find this small playwriting company

1811
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,856

1812
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:08,608
Anyway just cuz I want to hear this one more

1813
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:25,248
Welcome

1814
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,576
That's the end of the show

1815
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:38,816
So we're not going to listen to the end of Arizona

1816
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:41,120
California first of all

1817
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,400
Or she was from Atlanta

1818
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:47,008
They're all very close on the maps

1819
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,032
It was boring

1820
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:58,528
Molesting children I don't

1821
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:03,904
Playing as terribly as he could write

1822
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:04,672
The 4th hour and

1823
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,952
Turn that baby off

1824
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,000
Alex

1825
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:11,840
I mean we have a couple things wrong here we have one new very delightful

1826
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:17,728

Calling all the part of the next

By the end of

1862
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:59,360
The month absolutely

1863
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,128
Baby got a week

1864
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,224
Now we got five days at most.

1865

Betty White

1866
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,416
Dead air

1867
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:13,696
What's up

1868
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,536
You have to say at White family line

1869
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:22,400

Are you okay. So now it's all on me

1871
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:32,896
You have to say

1872
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:43,136
10 months before

1873
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:44,928
No

1874
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:46,720
