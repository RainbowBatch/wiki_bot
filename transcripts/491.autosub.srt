1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
What's fight.com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,024
Everybody sit around and talk a little bit about

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,816
Alex Jones

7
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
Jordan

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
Yeah

9
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,728
Vibrate spot today is that I realized

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Didn't know that

11
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,360
Vaguely aware that it was coming down the line eventually in the future

12
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,944
There's going to be another Pikmin game sure yes I love

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
Pikmin

14
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
Into

15
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,112
Space captain

16
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,952
Around and help you solve puzzles

17
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,256
Lemmings but for

18
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
The modern world

19
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,632
Their similarities I see a little bit of lemmings in pick

20
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,496
Especially in the wave at like Lemmings they had like specializations like some kush

21
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:51,104
Could dig Pikmin or battery differently

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,920
Sunken survive fire some could go in the water

23
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,224
I like the idea that they're like 90

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
2 year olds

25
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
Listening to this right now going

26
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
Like what though

27
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
F***** they talk

28
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,720
Let me see you weren't alive when Lemmings was around

29
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,840
My friend is 19 now they might have been

30
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
One or two when the first pick launch title on the game

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,848
Long time ago out of that back back in those days

32
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
I love those games though they're really fun

33
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
Had the series

34
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
Play Donkey Kong Country that I'm like I will

35
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736

00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
Not get

37
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
For one of them to come out

38
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
And the end of October

39
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
The new one comes

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
Alright I didn't realize it was that

41
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
Close

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,488
That was like really exciting

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,328
It's within my reach almost it's almost there

44
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352

47
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,408

00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,480
The Hyrule Warriors age of calamity

49
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
Prequel to breath of the Wild

50
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,880
He comes outside to games I'm actually a

51
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,904
Excited about

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,696
In the near future

53
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,536
I hope I hope civilization last long enough

54
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
Spell Venus

55
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,656
I hope that Civilization last long enough for me to be

56
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448
Maybe underwhelmed

57
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
To get my expectations up a little too high

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,456
Good yeah

59
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,064
Society last long enough for me to make excuses for

60
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,976
My bright spot Dan is yesterday the final scene

61
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
Season of kipo and the age of the wonderbeasts

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
Came out

63
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,632
Nobody I understand that you have no concept of that but

64
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:55,008
You know how I like Steven Universe been I like those kind of the kipo is of that same vein of like

65
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
Oculus positivity will over

66
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
Become a goddamn any problem

67
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,920
And the soundtrack

68
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
That is so goddamn

69
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,528
Ivory watch this

70
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Kipo

71
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:12,416
Kipo it's not Kubo and the two strings

72
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
Two strings are you completely

73
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Different movie

74
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,768
This is a TV show and it's just

75
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
Incredible

76
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,655
Overwhelmed by the amount of words I don't understand

77
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
Ideas give me soundtrack.

78
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
It's one of the like Ivory watch

79
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
Watch the first two seasons

80
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
Iowa

81
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
I want to say like two or three times

82
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
In the background just because

83
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
The soundtrack will kick

84
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
Can sell so many different grapes

85
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
It songs

86
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Like you don't even

87
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
I need to watch the show

88
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
What sound does Joe

89
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,111
Incredible I would highly recommend watching

90
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Kipo and the age of the one

91
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,719
I'm not positive I'm going to watch it but I'm going to look for that music

92
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,535
But it's so good I'll check into it

93
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
So Jordan

I got your website now

135
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:10,335
You can do is you can go back to about the 1920s or so is not about it when it was alright

136
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:16,735
Federal Reserve

137
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
In my head is

138
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,367
The great Beast Aleister Crowley

139
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
You know just like that thought of

140
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,791
And I have some anxiety issues.

141
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
I just kind of wondered

142
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,911
Relax today I don't know how to make a bomb noise but I was just trying

143
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,519
That was more like the daddy shark pop pop pop

144
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
It's kind of a bubbler

145
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
Anyways

146
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,687
You should take that generosity and give it to a local charity or Bell founded

147
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,783
I'm sorry that I tried to interrupt you there but what I wanted to celebrate with you

148
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Started now to get it

149
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
Excited when I throw it to

150
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:58,719
Yooper cup

151
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
Yeah it was actually surprised

152
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,583
You thought that it was like I had something that I was looking like

153
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
But instead I was like

154
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,679
Baal Veer told you I am quitting early

155
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703

156
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,007
Hey Dad burnout not following through with any B

157
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,639
That unfortunately got lost in the shuffle

158
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,455
Last week was

159
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,527
The life getting in the way was that somebody Bob

160
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,135
He had money bomb scheduled for Wednesday of last weekend

161
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
I didn't end up watching

162
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
Much of it at all

163
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Because of

164
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
I thank you everybody for being so kind

165
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
I really appreciate it

166
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
Things are good but

167
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,959
Couple people who checked in on it wasn't that great

168
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
I find that very easy to bleed

169
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,567
Yeah I'm not surprised by that I assume Harrison

170
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
Smith hosted about 20 hours of it

171
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,687
The rest was just special reports

172
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
Other than their shows as normal

173
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,295
How off Alex was on for wedding

174
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,647
Extra hour that day maybe I mean I bet you showed to hang out with

175
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:04,767
With Deanna Lorraine

176
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:11,167
I'm less interested in the content of it necessarily now they were just like soda moving

177
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,007
Forward something on this episode

178
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,567
That I find also very unsurprising

179
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,687
There's good news happening internationally good news happening nationally a good news happening

180
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,575
Wolfie you belong X I can't tell you about the attack for under 4

181
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
Reasons you can probably figure out

182
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Prairie

183
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,287
I just want to thank you all for your prayers your support because

184
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,615
It's been really really rough behind-the-scenes and

185
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
T'god

186
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
* 2.2

187
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,559
Because I worked out

188
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,167
Hey I got enough money over now

189
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
Whatever whatever was motivating the vat like mad I'm not going to reorder supplies or whatever

190
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Whatever he was going

191
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:29,503
Through has been solved by an inflow of cash

192
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,903
About this inflow cash that I can funnel into my dad's fake business so I can hide it from my eventual

193
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,023
Dual credit for paying your bills are coming up on it Whatever It Is

194
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
This is just

195
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
This is too transparent

196
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Tell you

197
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:52,031
I'll tell you about it later.

198
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,847
Definitely not involved with my personal lawsuits including

199
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,455
Family lawsuits as well as all the crimes that I've committed that I'm finally being take

200
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Passport

201
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
I will tell you more about what

202
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:08,159
Satan is doing to me later one day I'll tell you all about this when I'm laughing about it in hindsight about how

203
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,071
It was that I pulled all this off tomorrow or next week

204
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
So we'll get to that later

205
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
We start off the show

206
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
Is big old news

207
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,239
Stewart law big news

208
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Spiel by board

209
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,943
We will actually end up touching on that

210
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
He doesn't deal with a blowout that doesn't

211
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,087
Spoiler alert for towards the end of the show

212
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,647
But there's news of foot

213
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
And

214
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
It's always interesting

215
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
Chooses to start shows

216
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
Because Blackwell this is what your

217
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Coming out the gate with

218
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
That is what he's got

219
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,007
I got so much to cover so many angles I want to take calls I got a bunch of special gas

220
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
Play about that next segment

221
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
I really think we should just open up

222
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
The transmission with this because

223
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
You see a semantical headline

224
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
Really behind.

225
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
This one headline

226
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
Does he need a hypothetical

227
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
Program

228
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,119
Adam Schiff about

229
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,239
Exodus from California

230
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
The topography

231
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Climate

232
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,527
There's an exodus from leftist globalist shy, looting and

233
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
And control

234
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
Engaged

235
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
Touch Belmar

236
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,975
Whatever I don't like how the right keeps pushing people

237
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
I'd like you're you're over there

238
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
Like we don't have to

239
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
To take them I don't want film

240
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,399
No can have a beer you guys take me

241
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,983
Little push push push the shity people over the conservatives

242
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Here's what Boomer is

243
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
Bill Maher is a right-wing conservative

244
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,407
Done

245
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Build all these straw man

246
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,295
Off like Bill Maher speaking for the laughs at are there any of the times

247
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
The bilmar

248
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
Super shity

249
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,135
Marginalized groups

250
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,719
He doesn't remember any of that stuff doesn't that mean that the left

251
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,351
Pete's Islam what you want

252
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,447
Should be murder but I think he's on the radical left

253
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,799
According to the US Census the population has been increasing in California pretty

254
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,615
Consistently with approximately 1% increase this year

255
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
You could talk about how like

256
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,247
Increases in population have decreased like ain't going to decrease and increase

257
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
But that's

258
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
Spell whatever

259
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
Alex is misrepresenting the impulse

260
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
The people he likes like Joe Rogan

261
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:54,303
I have they want to flee California to Texas right around the time they start a hundred million dollars Spotify deal

262
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
Payless text he was

263
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,959
Lean towards money you can sleep towards a better opportunity

264
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,031
Some folks are doing this overly dramatic I'm leaving

265
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
People like Dave Rubin

266
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:15,039
Some businesses who are looking to take advantage of increasing City sizes around the country

267
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
Regions on the ground floor

268
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
Of a possible future Metropolis

269
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,695
There's also a lot of talk about normal working people wanting

270
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,511
Believe largely due to covid-19 related employment is

271
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,095
But it's too early to really have concrete data on that

272
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,703
I love the information that you can find comes from anecdotal stories and Facebook post

273
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,263
So we're going to have to wait to have any real idea about it

274
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,615
Much of the people who may actually make them move out of the state or people who work in the Tekken 2

275
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Who may be able to

276
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Continue working

277
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,039
He's decent jobs remotely

278
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
The big tech companies that Alex professes

279
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
Wouldn't be hurt by this but the normal work

280
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
Can people who can't afford to move could be

281
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:00,095
As well as the people in the area that those people end up moving to since cost-of-living would likely increase

282
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
As we previously more sparsely populated areas

283
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Become more dense

284
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
Play Popular

285
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,567
This is the conversation that's largely being sensationalize by the right-wing media type so it's no surprise

286
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
Steve Belmar getting in on the ACT

287
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,919
And yet again Bill Maher show somehow the most

288
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
Important thing for Alex

289
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,295
Discuss level sources and a depth of information that he has four

290
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
From years of

291
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
Studying that he could be getting into and

292
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Instead of this dump

293
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
Show me October 9th rating guide

294
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,791
You'll find that Bill Maher's real time program had about 1.2

295
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
23 million views

296
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,167
This is less viewers are pretty much every news program on cable

297
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,263
And honestly not many more viewers than episode of Diners Drive-Ins and Dives

298
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,615
If you only count the 18 to 49 year-old demographic Guy Fieri

299
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
Brown's Bill Maher

300
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Who it is

301
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
I'd like Alex

302
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,735
Stop over exaggerating the

303
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Isabel bar

304
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
He only does that because Bill Barr works as a

305
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
Strawman for him

306
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Pretend speak

307
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Express enemies

308
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,207
Reality most people I've ever met who consider themselves of the left

309
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Think Bill Maher

310
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:05,375
Sucks I'm appreciative of the career transformation

311
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Thierry has had

312
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
In terms of public perception

313
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:14,079
Should like everybody was like a weirdo punchline and then people discovered that he's a f******

314
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,871
Great person and I like sky

315
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,663
God damn it I guess we all loved him now

316
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
We get Guy Fieri

317
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:24,319
You guys can have Bill Maher and if that's the rule now it's all thanks to Shane Torres

318
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,975
The series awesome and then everybody goes old you're right

319
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,791
Damn it man why were we such a

320
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,375
Predicted him are we all believe it yeah cuz of the hair

321
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
Mannerisms

322
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,471
Decide what is on the back of the head

323
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,311
It's understandable why optically you be like f*** this

324
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
Jimmy Buffett walking down the

325
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
Straight you be like

326
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,503
You learn a little bit more about him

327
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
I mean he wrote fins

328
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
To the left

329
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,903
Fins to the right

330
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
He sucks

331
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,279
So does another headline but apparently not in board

332
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
The bilmar

333
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
I mean

334
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,679
If it was you think that be the first thing you'd cover but it's not

335
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Second thing

336
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
Headlines from yesterday

337
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:21,151
Bombshell says covid restrictions are killing Millions must ah

338
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,783
Fallbrook on Saturday, also broke

339
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,647
Firstly this headline and Alex's reading it's not an article on Infowars

340
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,975
It's just the page of his that has the Sunday show embedded

341
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,279
As a video on his website

342
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:43,167
I know she's just written the headline that he's now reading which is apparently supported by two hour videos in Southpoint

343
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Which is meaningless

344
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
This means

345
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,055
Second neither Infowars nor Gateway pundit broke

346
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
The story

347
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,223
They're reporting on an interview that Andrew Neal did with dr. David Navarro who is the World Health Organization special Envoy

348
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Boy on covid-19

349
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
19

350
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
The interview was published by the

351
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
The Spectator so if anyone gets credit for this story

352
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Eight of them

353
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
This isn't the bombshell that Alex is trying

354
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Presented as either

355
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
This is an interview that

356
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:12,607
Easy to take out of context but what doctor Navarro is expressing was that the World Health Organization doesn't

357
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
Support quotes

358
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,959
Using the lockdown as your primary control method

359
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,775
He's clear that lockdowns are appropriate when you have

360
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:25,151
Optical by time to reorganize regroup rebound to resources protect your health workers who are exhaust

361
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
Nothing seems that all out of sync

362
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
With messaging

363
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:34,111
There's a reason that there was no need for any talk of lockdown on their other outbreaks empath

364
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:38,975
Because appropriate action was taken so it never got so bad that lockdowns were needed to buy that time

365
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,583
There isn't a lockdown in the United States put the measures that have been taken were necessary

366
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
Because the situation was

367
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
Completely bungled

368
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
He continues to be

369
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:52,799
Any white This World Health Organization Envoy didn't say anything that is somehow damn into the UN or World Health Organization

370
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,847
Position on the coronavirus response

371
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,151
It's just something looks close enough to that that Alex

372
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
Can create this narrative

373
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
And it takes

374
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
It's like this is

375
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
Keeps hitting this

376
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,319
It's all bad and they're killing everybody

377
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,855
Yeah it's unfortunate it's like

378
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,231
And Kubo and the two strings and you were like I'm

379
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,327
Thrown off by The Barrage of words that I have no context

380
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
I keep thinking of

381
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,423
How that must be how right-wing

382
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,959
Feel like all the time

383
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,007
Anytime they read one of those interviews there

384
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
Just like I don't understand you but for you you're like Curious you're like okay well let's see what this is all about

385
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
What if I killed it

386
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:36,575
I just want to kill you because I don't understand your word what I imagine

387
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
Did the people who

388
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
AR

389
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,999
Like in Alex's world

390
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,071
Consumers a straight-up right-wing media bullet

391
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
Like they see an article

392
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
News Outlet

393
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,727
And there is bewildered as I was hearing those words

394
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:58,079
Which is the same as any normal person probably listening to Alex

395
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
For the first time

396
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,919
A very much

397
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Completely

398
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:08,319
I don't understand in different realities at all

399
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:14,463
At all times in the only people who are at all interesting are the ones who are curious about other realities and the ones who aren't

400
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
What to kill the rest

401
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,815
Ironman Infowars daywalker

402
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:24,959
I can I can translate

403
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,055
And here my next clip is just

404
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
Titled this show is dumb

405
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,919
I got to certain point where I'm listen to visit like this show stupid

406
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Troublemaker

407
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
Liberal

408
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
Thomas Jefferson was a liberal

409
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,903
Small government

410
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,487
People want government to micromanage every pass your life

411
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,071
Bubble and go outside and just engage in concert

412
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Scammers

413
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
These are

414
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,383
Society

415
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:12,575
Because there are no ladies in fishnets and

416
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:19,744
Rabbit out of a hat very innocently

417
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Dakine to whisper

418
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,400
Thank God he doesn't use a teleprompter

419
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,216
About goddamn magician

420
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
The UN apparently is admitting

421
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,360
That's how you know they're doing this whole thing

422
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
Things are going to go in

423
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
Kill people

424
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,528
Distancing in the hell that all the coronavirus death

425
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,832
About how big this is

426
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
They're finally admitting

427
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,768
Super good news to cover their butt and say okay

428
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:58,400
All the social distancing the end of the economy

429
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,216
It's causing a planetary collapse is going to flood the West

430
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Them

431
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
Wood

432
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
That was supposed

433
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,440
Be there plan originally

434
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,512
The releasing a super bio weapons

435
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
Still think vet

436
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,328
Maybe we're actually all day

437
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,984
Maybe we've already died Alex forgot that he said that like their plan is to orderly kill

438
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,640
Forgotten that there's a plan B

439
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,432
Right and now

440
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:48,832
Not everyone's going to die. The crawl out of the rubble and find George Soros

441
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:53,184
Now we force their hand if we're going to have to go to vaccines

442
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,536
How do you understand the stakes anymore

443
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,400
We're all going to die except we'll all be fine except they are going to continue killing us but you should give him money

444
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Sure

445
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,728
I'm so China is taking over the sea

446
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,776
Sure all the

447
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,872
The South China Sea

448
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
Some folks

449
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
For oil

450
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
And that's not good

451
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,648
Southern Vietnam

452
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
Grabbing

453
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
Sending troops in and

454
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
AB control

455
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
United States

456
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
Yes

457
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,432
Steven

458
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:52,320
How do you save yesterday's ballot

459
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,368
Early career

460
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
What are you doing

461
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,000
Can you imagine the u.s. sending in the military

462
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:06,400
Can you imagine a the u.s. sending in troops and overthrowing a government of its own demo

463
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:12,288
Democratically elected people in order to install a right-wing dictator who is more positive North American us

464
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:17,920
I mean even in Alex's current form part of his

465
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,992
Is like worldview does involve like the overthrow the

466
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
Like this doesn't make any

467
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:34,048
No it is fun how we it is fun how we always talk about how a Ron is is like a big butt

468
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
Is it big Boogeyman and it's like

469
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,888
We never talked about how it's our fault

470
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,728
Every part I think people do talk about that

471
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,224
There's a more competent people than I could get into about China and they're they're at

472
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
I'm not under

473
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,088
You're cutting out of minimizing it I think it's a real life issue

474
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
She'll bite

475
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Just funny to hear

476
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
Fix a stuff

477
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
Doing

478
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,048
Do you think they ever talked about that in those high-level meeting

479
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:10,912
You know whenever they're talkin to, or something like that

480
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
It's just like hey man

481
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
Union have your

482
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,056
And job if we didn't overthrow the good government so how about that

483
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,128
How about that don't stop causing problems for us man

484
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,408
I would back.

485
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,712
And conversation probably

486
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,552
I don't think I'm allowed in high-level talk

487
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,672
You got two celebrities they got opinions

488
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
Certainly we know that Alec

489
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
Complains about every

490
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,536
Left-wing

491
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,816
Or

492
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
Non

493
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,936
Crazy right-wing not rhyme right way unless they're talking to an empty

494
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
The chair he doesn't want to hear about

495
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:50,592
Celebrities exactly celebrities metaphorically

496
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Stuck in Love

497
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
Punk rock

498
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
Pistols Johnny Rotten

499
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,720
Cuz of course I'm voting for Trump cuz he's a rebel

500
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,400
He is obviously has dementia

501
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,216
Wife has Alzheimer's I know what it looks like

502
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,544
Sometimes he's out of his mind

503
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,336
And the media says back

504
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,992
Yeah Johnny Rotten

505
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:36,160
Medical Care

506
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Adjust

507
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
Oh Jolly Rodger

508
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:44,352
I don't care if Iggy Pop was voting for Jill Stein I just don't care man I just I just think it's

509
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Remarkable

510
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,400
Alex

511
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
Is like

512
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
Buckhead Johnny Rotten

513
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,240
I just don't

514
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,848
Man

515
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,408
You can't just

516
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:01,760
Okay this person has one political opinion one time I agree with

517
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,320
So now there are entire thing is heroic

518
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,368
Like the Sex Pistols like there

519
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
The biggest song

520
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,976
Anarchy that's one of their biggest songs yes

521
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Super against and doesn't understand

522
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,608
Anarchy in any any form

523
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,424
I imagine if you were in favor of Anna

524
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
You might

525
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Take the long

526
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
Approach towards voting

527
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,520
A trumpet be like this

528
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
Is the best way to

529
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
Collapse all

530
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:32,992
Yeah you might but Alex also is very explicit E8 there an arcade

531
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
Chaos

532
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
To absent

533
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Rulers

534
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
So Alec

535
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
I did some weird stuff

536
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,976
When he was covering the fact that Rob had been diagnosed

537
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,024
The covid 11th Place

538
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,120
And now he's trying to like pretend like

539
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
USA Today

540
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Chatsworth

541
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,288
Jones says doctors are trying to

542
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
Desiderata

543
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
Figure of speech

544
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,344
Not the president's okay

545
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,136
In the report I said

546
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
Now figure of speech

547
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,024
No it was fascinating here is this

548
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
We're trying to

549
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
To kill them

550
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:25,472
The figure of speech I meant it

551
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
I meant it

552
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,872
Politically

553
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,896
Okay

554
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:38,784
So what's my contacts is Alex's version of his own

555
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,832
Coverage of the coronavirus diagnosis

556
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,928
Immediately Alex reported it was probably a false positive test result

557
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
What's a globalist

558
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,024
Somehow created in order to provide cover for them to poison Trump

559
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
And blame it on covid-19

560
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:55,680
Exactly when this narrative became unsustainable because Trump went to Walter Reed hospital and is becoming

561
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,520
Clear that claimed it was a false positive was going to be too hard to pull off

562
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:05,920
Alex shifted the story to be about how the doctors at Walter Reed were either trying to kill Trump or they were so incompetent they're going to do so

563
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,688
Accidentally

564
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
However

565
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:12,832
The story that Alex appeared to land on on his October 4th Show when he was crying on Air Buddies fantasy

566
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,904
Christian Jihad with Greg Reese and John bowne

567
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,928
Was it someone hits

568
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:21,280
Spray Trump with a weaponized version of the coronavirus in an attempt to kill him

569
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:27,936
Of course Trump didn't die so all of that hysterical not that much of a site

570
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
Disappointed look

571
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,496
Silly

572
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
His behavior

573
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Control

574
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:38,176
His audience has already forgotten all that b******* that he said of his previous

575
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,736
Britannia was looking at the issue from Alside

576
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
He wasn't he was trying to say

577
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,064
Sensationalizing story in the great to the greatest

578
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,112
Except possible in way the prophet is busy

579
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,416
It's really dumb and even Alex

580
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
Poconos that

581
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
I wonder if he was rooting

582
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,304
You think I think that would solve a lot of his problem

583
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,352
Zip Trump died like

584
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,424
So many problems would actually just float away and so many opportunities

585
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
Opportunities would appear for

586
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
He's the guy who

587
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
Who's f******

588
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,824
Fighting the people who killed the president

589
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:13,248
It creates a new set of problems

590
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,552
If you're Alex

591
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,368
You know like it does solve some problems

592
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,184
But the way in which

593
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
His rhetoric is work

594
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,024
Yeah I get creates an expectation of the audio

595
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,816
Chance of you getting on a horse

596
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,376
And leading a charge

597
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,680
If you don't do that you're going to lose

598
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
At least

599
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,544
Some considerable portion of those people

600
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
You said that if

601
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
See if there was

602
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:42,176
Any positive diagnosis and then there wasn't he was just like

603
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:47,808
Killerman even that wasn't enough for them to be like okay well let's do something because it wasn't

604
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,392
Well they sprayed him in the face with it covid

605
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:56,000
Oops a stud

606
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
He's just that good it's like

607
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
It's like Trump so you can't kill a bull moose

608
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
Mobile man

609
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,216
What is it going to take for these guys to just

610
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Die

611
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,384
We just let them denying there was a problem you should deny the medical care I think we should

612
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,176
Never have allowed them

613
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
Your doctors

614
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:21,088
Cuz their doctors are trying to kill him once just tell the right the doctors are trying to kill all the Senators and then if they already do believe

615
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,464
Next clip I find

616
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
Really strain

617
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,840
Especially in light of the revelations

618
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
The New York Times

619
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,448
Released about their analysis of Trump's tax returns

620
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
Sure sure

621
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
If I were Alex I just stay away from

622
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
Territory like this

623
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
No taxes this year or last

624
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,624
Don't make what professional baseball play

625
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
Air Max

626
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
Operation

627
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
In boats

628
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,864
Taxes

629
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,984
Call restaurant

630
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
65%

631
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
Grand

632
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
Supposedly

633
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
No it is more than Jeff Bezos

634
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,464
Enterprise blacklivesmatter $400

635
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
Just like Tim Cook

636
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,328
Why even go into this territory it's

637
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:40,704
Underbelly of very clear like

638
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
12 pesos

639
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,336
He doesn't pay taxes cuz he's evil any funds black lives matter

640
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,128
Trump doesn't pay taxes

641
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,200
Cuz cuz he's super smart and funds conservatives

642
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:55,040
Actually he doesn't even do that he creates fake universities and

643
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Steals their money

644
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,624
That's why he's smart and a good

645
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
President

646
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,464
Seems like an unnecessary gripe

647
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:07,328
I have about a certificate

648
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,400
To have about Bezos fiber it's a bad one for him to talk

649
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
That's what I mean

650
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
Unnecessary for Alec

651
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
Yeah yeah seems like

652
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,896
Just go ahead and drop your complaints about their tax payment

653
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,712
Man it's just so unfair that they can

654
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,272
Just refused to cede ground

655
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
Even though

656
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
8-bit they're meaningless nonsense

657
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,672
Just like yeah I'm going to be pissed at Bezos for not paying tax

658
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Pictures of prison

659
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
Doesn't it I think

660
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,352
He's got but I really mad at Bezos

661
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
Black lives matter

662
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,984
It's

663
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
Sort of a descending

664
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:54,944
Charade to the bottom

665
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,576
Is matter about make it more presentable complaining

666
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,600
Facade

667
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:07,744
So Alex got a use got a little bee in his Bonnet about about antifa

668
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,816
Here's a story

669
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
Out of Germany

670
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,912
He tries to make connected

671
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:15,936
Data is not

672
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
Police radar

673
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,872
House in Berlin

674
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
Infowars Europe

675
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
Queen

676
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,016
Match.com

677
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,416
Folsom Aquatic

678
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
German MP

679
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,632
2000

680
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,936
The capital

681
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Summoned

682
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
Reinforces around Europe

683
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
This was not an a

684
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
Antifa Builder

685
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
No

686
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,688
By building recently

687
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,552
For decades enforcement

688
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
Being reinforced

689
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:12,512
I'm sure actually whoever wrote this is probably Dan Lyman

690
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,096
Alex doesn't know anything she's just reading this

691
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:21,984
Anyway this is about an anarcho queer feminist housing project in Berlin called liebig 34

692
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:28,640
The building space foreclosure in 2008 where Panos purchased and the residents were offered a 10-year lease at really good rate

693
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,944
To continue that same housing project

694
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,992
This week's ended

695
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,576
In 2018 and by this point I guess the owners of change their mind

696
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,136
And I didn't want to extend the lease agreement into the future

697
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,232
The residents didn't want to leave so they filed some lawsuits and in June

698
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,560
The abyss year 2020 the German courts

699
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,096
They ruled that the owner had the right to

700
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
The tenant

701
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,448
But they couldn't be removed from the premises immediately

702
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
Didn't want

703
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,544
Believe still and they continued squatting

704
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,384
Just came to a head earlier this month when police were called to clear out the building

705
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:07,040
This building didn't mean a lot to a lot of people and dust the idea of it being cleared and no longer existing as this project or something.

706
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
Resonated widely

707
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,624
He does make some sense but other anarchist

708
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,416
Some supporters from around places

709
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
Outside of Berlin

710
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Felt drawn to

711
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,024
The common protests against the eviction

712
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,352
That has nothing to do with antifa or George Soros or the globalist

713
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,656
This is honestly pretty simple

714
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,752
Tissue that surrounds at an Arco queer feminist housing project in Berlin

715
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,800
Now this is lying about it to try and make it

716
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,104
Some kind of a culture War bulshit

717
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
Nonsense

718
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
I don't know

719
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,736
I just

720
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
OU

721
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,296
Check this out

722
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,584
Some landlords are great and they're definitely not going to ruin it and I'm sure that their rent prices will

723
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
Yeah I think

724
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,400
Prague

725
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,192
Play a large part of the story

726
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:02,592
Is that they had a really good 10-year rate

727
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,128
Valuable real estate

728
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,152
It sucks

729
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,200
Because everything I can tell it to

730
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,040
Seemed like that was something that was really cool and meant a lot to a lot of folks

731
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,368
Piano

732
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,904
It sucks it's something like that.

733
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
That existed for so long

734
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,256
Gets swallowed up in the name of probably

735
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,816
A cleaner looking building in better rent

736
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,352
Rate

737
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
It sucks to that like

738
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
No

739
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Someone

740
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,848
Buying the building and offering 10-year leases 10 years ago is really cool

741
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,664
Happening

742
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,064
Alexandra wants to complain about Brian

743
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
Stelter

744
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
What's new

745
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,160
Respect

746
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,488
Stelter

747
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,048
Little flashcards for kids

748
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
That's a seal

749
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
Papi

750
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,568
Pedophile

751
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
Psychotic

752
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,136
Still not called chicken wire

753
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,952
Holy crap you know women just run from him

754
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,512
I want the video still walking

755
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560
Hollywood

00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,448
English weird crazy smile

757
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,984
You just see people like

758
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,544
Who's this

759
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
Look

760
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
What

761
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
What

762
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,112
Partying away for brides Cafe

763
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:56,512
I'm just like doing a little smooth dance backwards analysis

764
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:02,656
Surveillance tape

765
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,448
Are you watching that

766
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,752
Do you have the one where Reagan gets paid

767
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:12,128
That I would like to know

768
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,176
This is

769
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,968
Really silly and stupid

770
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,272
And honestly I was getting to point

771
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,040
We're like

772
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
Zizek

773
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:25,952
All right there's no reason for us to really play this on the show Alex talks about Brian stelter looking creepy all the time

774
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,488
The reason I did was

775
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,536
Provide an opportunity to say something

776
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,304
Sing did I've been

777
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,120
Thinking for a long time and I haven't really

778
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
Brought to the show they should have named

779
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
The clown It

780
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Yes

781
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,776
Thank you I can move on

782
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,640
I don't think that

783
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
Like people realize

784
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
How much I have to just

785
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
Ignore

786
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,576
In order to make our show the CIA

787
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,416
If I wanted to I could be so much worse to Alex

788
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,000
I was just lost in thought while I Was preparing

789
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,304
Man I'm pretty generous

790
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:10,240
There's so much racist and horrible s*** that I just have to turn away cuz it's like well we've already made

791
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,544
Yeah over and over and over again

792
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
It does seem like

793
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
We will face consequences

794
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,640
This for being redundant

795
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
And like

796
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
Boring about

797
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
Pointing out the

798
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,528
The same thing over and over and over again

799
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,320
Where is he gets rewarded

800
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,088
Non-Stop

801
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,392
That's another one of those

802
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
Unfairness

803
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,696
This is Stewart's trying to create something

804
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,304
Yeah it works in his favor and we just kind of have to accept

805
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:39,936
And this one guy is a little off base

806
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,056
Basically

807
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,152
Jeremy 1938

808
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
You had the brown shirts

809
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
Jewish man

810
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,088
And the number of days

811
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,464
You know I had to question that when we went back and chest

812
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,096
We don't know that yet

813
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:22,176
Profoundly offensive with this collars

814
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
Suggesting for

815
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,504
Wow number of reasons off

816
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Uncountable

817
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
Man

818
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:31,136
Bill Maher Keith Olbermann

819
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,696

821
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:40,096
God damn excited the right-wing is the Keith Overman started a YouTube channel

822
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,656

824
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,704
About it buddy

825
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,728
That kind of anger.

826
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
It's the same thing like

827
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,776
Complaining about Hillary Clinton

828
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
It's like what Alex loves

829
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,663

00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:59,551

832
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,367
Complained about his YouTube channel

833
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,647
Great

834
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Oh my God

835
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,207
So get ready for that you're ready for

836
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:12,607
Keith Olbermann to piss Alex off a whole bunch

837
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,143
Politics in the 90s

838
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
Just gold

839
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:20,799
Just disappear like Hillary gone I don't care about your podcast you have nothing valuable to say get the

840
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
The f*** out of here

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,639
People ruin get the f*** out of here Bill Maher get the f***

842
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,943
Out of here

843
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,039
I don't know I think I think that you might be

844
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:37,695
I mean certainly I want to see D Pilgrim at any more probably does have a lot to offer in terms of insight

845
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
Keith Olbermann the bill

846
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,559
Delmar Maybe

847
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
Just go

848
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,423
Or be more aware of the ways in which

849
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
Basically your content

850
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:53,567
Exist to anger right-wingers in a way that profits right

851
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:57,407
It's not angering them in a way that's actually trolling them more like

852
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
Anything it's just

853
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,527
It's basically creating material that they can respond to

854
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,807
Create

855
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,599
False versions of argument

856
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,647
Did they can pretend to be on the right side up

857
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,951
Only a nutmeg

858
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:15,327
No there's no positive thing that they do that counteracts Howard - there

859
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,887
Present I'm sure someone likes

860
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
Steve Overman

861
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,799
I have a hard time disagreeing with you

862
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,359
Blister going to destroy everything right

863
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,431
But maybe not maybe not

864
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:43,487
American Republic

865
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:02,687
Myself

866
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:08,063
Leben dog in the whole time we've been warning others

867
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
We've been preparing

868
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,951
Flat-footed

869
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,767
Keeping us all in defense

870
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
Ready for this

871
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,655
What about Plan B got a good shot at beating them

872
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,935
What about Plan B

873
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,983
We were already dead a few weeks

874
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:31,359
Plan B was about to happen because you ruined playing that we might

875
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:36,735
We might have a chance of beating plan a we're already packed

876
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,527
Plan B

877
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,343
There's a second

878
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,695
Everyone dies why is incoherent a solid strategy

879
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
You know

880
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:50,559
Like that is amazing to me that there is there is like

881
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,327
Let's

882
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
Why

883
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,375
Try and use language

884
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,143
2

885
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:00,799
Clarify think it's because a lot of this is emotional Alex's like connecting with the listeners on an emotional fear less

886
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
That's true

887
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,615
Emotions aren't always

888
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,431
Rational Oklahoma

889
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
Whatever you feel

890
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,295
Resume with Alex even if he's contradicting

891
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,575
Himself all the time

892
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
Both of them

893
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,607
You know he made up because they're terrible and would never work

894
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,631
Exactly

895
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,935
Man speaking of emotions

896
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,471
I think Alex is changes

897
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
Within the span

898
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
20 seconds

899
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,311
In a way that kind of terrified

900
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
Hi how are you

901
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,295

00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,623
Looking good I mean I know that they are really scared what

903
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,903
Doing and you can just

904
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,255
The fear in their eyes

905
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,167
Sounds optimistic

906
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,447
That's great

907
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,775
Hey how you doing Alex

908
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:08,127
About to be angry

909
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,663
Feeling optimistic

910
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,223
About my room

911
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,671
Signs point to yes this color plugs Alex's iodine

912
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,487
And I was going to get in unplugging that iodine

913
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,559
Very family-friendly way

914
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
I don Mexican

915
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,727
Virility

OSHA 10 exactly what he's doing

917
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,847
I was being

918
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,223
15/16

919
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:56,255
Well I'm 15 years old again what the hell

920
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,583
Oh yeah

921
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,191
Alex the globalists are going to kill everybody

922
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,495
Your boners don't matter makes you

923
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:12,895
You f***** good anyways plan-b we're all going to die but try some of my iodine I can't believe this

924
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,687
Exactly what I was being so

925
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,039
Sincere when you said when you said it was

926
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,319
The family so here's what I was

927
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,879
Taking him to accidentally say like

928
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,303
And then I was like I wouldn't it be funny if he was like

929
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,191
Doesn't make any f****** sense

930
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,239
Yep

931
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,567
Great news show

932
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
You're dumb

933
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:48,223
Brian stelter's evil is a pedophile but if you take iodine you got a big old dick

934
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:54,111
And Alex has to be aware that like children are listening cuz he constantly says it's a family show in like 13 year olds

935
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,415
Called in and he is talking about his dick

936
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,999
What is trying to sell iodine to thirteen-year-olds I guess they don't need it

937
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:05,631
13 boners for no reason you don't need iodide

938
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,471
You had iodine on top of that you have non-stop boner but too much

939
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,799
Just enough so I jump away from that

940
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
Topic

941
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
Alex

942
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,127
Listen to new covid

943
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,407
Conspiracy

944
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,431
Which I think is

945
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
Going to be probably

946
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,063
I really think that

947
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,599
We don't know if the virus

948
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,391
Exist at all

949
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,695
Family members of

950
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
Family members that got released

951
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
2080

952
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
At the end and also

953
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,327
2019

954
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,119
Some of them actually almost

955
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,263
We already seen this virus

956
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,335
Complete everybody family

957
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,127
Three of them died six years ago

958
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,967
Hospitals that were full of dead bodies

959
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,807
Meniere's

960
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,599
6 years ago 2040

961
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,623
Team okay

962
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,463
Okay are you telling me that covid both does not exist

963
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:08,863
And also has been around for a long time killed three of Alex's family members 6 years ago

964
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,143
Alright no

965
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,447
Yeah I find this to be a nun so

966
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
Sustainable level of

967
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,495
Conspiracy

968
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
That's insane

969
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,543
Yeah that's just

970
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,615
It doesn't exist anymore but it did in the past

971
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,687
When my relative got sick in 2018

972
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,223
What is he could have said something else

973
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
I just

974
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:28,063
You've proven Nothing by telling me that your family member got sick

975
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087
2 years ago

976
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,135
I just did I just feel like

977
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,207
We don't even have any evidence covid

978
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
Still around

979
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:35,999
Water

980
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,839
We probably isn't though really I think I don't know how do I think about it

981
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,911
Tierpoint

982
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:47,007
But you made before I think that's already retrograded out completely I don't think it exists

983
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,383
Pneumonia

984
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,151
They're not

985
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,087
Everything is covered. Bless you brother

986
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,111
So Alex

987
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:08,767
You can't you can't act that way when I call there's like I don't think covid even exist anymore and I'll expect absolutely

988
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:12,351
Gladiator protein

989
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,679
This you just did you send that to a caller he literally just said that

990
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,983
You also said that it never existed

991
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,311
You also said many did six years ago

992
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
In the past

993
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,615
Sprite you said that

994
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,175
Just then that they're not even counting flu deaths

995
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:26,943
So what year

996
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,991
You're saying then to that color is

997
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,551
You're dumb family could have died of the f******

998
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
Flute Maybe

999
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
Let's go

1000
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,623
Maybe the pass

1001
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,903
Exist anymore

1002
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,695
To also

1003
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,767
I have is alright alright

1004
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:44,863
You win another call her here

1005
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,935
Did you know that the CDC straighten out the yard

1006
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,151
Sonogram and take away the tax

1007
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,967
Swansea 3

1008
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,599
Explain that Alex

1009
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,159
Yeah I do know that when the caller said the

1010
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,463
The CDC is traded on the stock market

1011
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,511
Do you think that's true

1012
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,351
Man isn't it a branch of the

1013
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,375
The federal government

1014
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,679
I suppose if the federal government is

1015
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:26,079
Is traded on the stock market is some sort of bond yields do I know that I have six years in the state department

1016
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,151
The CDC is

1017
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:34,527
It's created using the initial CDC but it's not the Centers for Disease Control

1018
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:39,391
That's just be stock ticker abbreviation for victory Capital portfolio fund called Victor

1019
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,415

You can check out Victory funds website and see that it's a collection of Holdings including some

The people can invest

1025
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,007
I don't know why the abbreviation is CDC but I also couldn't

1026
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,311
Explain a ton of other stock ticker abbreviation

1027
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,127
I can't see those at the Centers for Disease

1028
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,919
Control is not a company

1029
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
On the stock market

1030
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
Furthermore

1031
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,295
CDC Foundation does it not for

1032
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
For-profit

1033
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,879
I'm going to go out on a limb here

1034
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,159
And I'm going to say if your

1035
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
Part

1036
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,207
Of the federal

1037
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,999
Maybe you don't

1038
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,047
Get 501c

1039
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:18,815
C3 status

1040
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,375
That's just what I'm going to go out there and say

1041
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
I think the

1042
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,679
You certainly don't have

1043
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,239
An IPO

1044
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,287
We've decided

1045
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
Privatized

1046
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,383
Jesus that we will privatize the CBC probably

1047
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,735
Just imagine the CDC on the investor

1048
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,503
Call

1049
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,599
They're like guys covid stats bad

1050
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:48,255
Weaver we've cured exactly 15 people today so it's been a good day it's 30,000 of Tide but you know that

1051
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,535
We can't cure everybody

1052
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,351
So Alex touches back on the story out of Germany

Interviewing a hard right politician

1066
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,615
Germany outside

1067
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,407
Of the house

1068
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,943
Everything has gone down in the US

1069
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,527
6/8 minute video interview is

00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,319
His butt all the footage of the actual stuff

1071
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,599
Is there stuff that they've take

1072
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,623
Taken from other outlets

1073
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,903
And now they're claiming is an

An exclusive

1075
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,695
Seems like a pattern

1076
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,487
Yeah give me the pattern of Alex's

1077
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,511
And then also the

1078
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,047
Forgetting about Plan B

1079
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,887
The murdering everybody that the globe has is going to do that too

1080
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,447
I do like how the mainstream media is filled with lies

1081
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:03,007
But also when they get good content it's an Infowars

1082
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:05,311

Sucks I drunk by global exclusively

1084
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
What you going to do

1085
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:19,135
Whose caller next caller is I don't even care about what they were saying but

1086
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
Anderson happens during this call that Alex

1087
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,207
Should not be engaging in

1088
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,791
Bartolotta

1089
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,423
The truth have a

1090
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
When your

1091
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,407
Website is compared

1092
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,735
As being similar to Jim Fetters website

1093
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,807
You shouldn't agree with that especially when you're engaged

1094
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:51,391
Then a lawsuit

1095
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,207
Got lost a lawsuit about it

1096
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:00,095
Haven't you do everything in your power not like that guy I don't know him I have no involvement with him

1097
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,263
When friends are down that's when you know

1098
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,823
That's that's what's going on

1099
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,919
I swear that you got to you got to step up

1100
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,087
I'm pretty sure he's just saying absolutely to any like

1101
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,367
Just

1102
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,183
Just the Cadence of the end of a sentence

1103
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,255
You got it agree with you

1104
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,303

00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,519
Court nomination

1110
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,335
Alex plays her opening statement

1111
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:46,431
And I got it I got to say like I mean obviously I'm against her nomination but like

1112
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,967
Beaver Charming open

1113
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,783
Obvious attempt

1114
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,551
Set jokes

1115
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,087
Horrible

1116
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,647
A personable they're Charming

1117
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
Who's talking about how I'm

1118
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:01,791
I'm used to being in a group of nine cuz my family we have seven kids

1119
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:06,399
You know one of my kids when we adopted them

1120
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,727
They were they wouldn't be able to talk about it

1121
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,799
Everything is great now and I assure you they can talk

1122
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,103
You don't like that kind of

1123
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,663
Family style focal whatever

1124
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:23,295
Group I only know this.

1125
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,831
I only know this because Alex

1126
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,367
Play that on the show

1127
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:29,183
This was really funny

1128
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:32,511
Because I found it to be incredibly on offense

1129
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,815
And only made Amy Coney Barrett look

1130
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:41,471
And I am against her being on the Supreme Court

1131
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,007
Response after he came back from break

1132
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,031
After playing

1133
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
The Jurupa

1134
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:45,823
Statement

1135
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:52,735
Let's go ahead and take a call

1136
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,551
Yes

1137
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,623
That's a good fish

1138
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,391
About 8

1139
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,927
An actual hearing

1140
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
It should be boring

1141
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:08,351
Yes she isn't saying insanely Authority

1142
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:15,263
Talk crazy like Trump so I'll kind of bored

1143
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,847
This is a real like everybody

1144
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:22,431
The debate was really embarrassing because Trump was a lunatic

1145
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,455
And then all of that

1146
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,295
I find the Supreme Court hearings Apple watch

1147
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,575
Watched some of that

1148
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,879
To be the most embarrassing

1149
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
Game of

1150
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,695
Pretend

1151
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,719
These are all Adele

1152
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:40,095
These are all adults are all doing all of this s*** that they know means nothing

1153
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:44,959
Knowing that there is Meaningful stuff they could do and instead they're participating

1154
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,799
It is

1155
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,823
Is childish

1156
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,103
It is kind of

1157
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
Strange

1158
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:56,735
Enough to say that it's okay or should be this way

1159
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,063
I think that's all that different than a lot of the other Khan

1160
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,855
Information hearing that I've seen it

1161
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,927
Totally like I think that there's a lot of dodging questions

1162
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:07,743
Oh no that the amount of stuff that she's just like

1163
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,303
I'm not going to answer and everybody's like well

1164
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,887
I guess that means you get to be on the Supreme Court there's a lot of like

1165
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,447
What appears to be going through the motions

1166
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,007
Does suck

1167
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,055
It is frustrating

1168
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,847
I would say that like

1169
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,455
It's not embarrassing as much as it is kind of scary

1170
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,503
Embarrassing

1171
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,783
It also upset

1172
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
Sure

1173
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,087
The Supreme Court at least like

1174
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,391
I can see obviously isn't it

1175
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,159
Just yelling

1176
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,207
Complete nonsense

1177
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,743
Scary

1178
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,767
Bilberries

1179
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,815
Scary

1180
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:46,143
Do Boris carry Trump is embarrassing

1181
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,679
Geberit is scary

1182
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:52,287
Because like I said I just listened to the bit that was on Alex's show at

1183
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,079
Decent

1184
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,359
Because of the

1185
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,383
Like

1186
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,407
That's not a force

1187
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,991
Worst joke you know how to make yourself sound like a pretty

1188
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,295
Decent family

1189
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:06,111
And Alex can't handle the idea that like

1190
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,647
The person who would

1191
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,951
Support all of the policies that you want

1192
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:16,351
He's trying to get through the confirmation she can't act crazy there are you telling me that I have to

1193
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:20,703
Watch her go through a confirmation without her foaming at the mouth the entire time

1194
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
I want her

1195
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:27,871
To defend drinking beer while she's sexually assaulting someone in the room why does she have to say about

1196
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
Alberta

1197
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:40,671
Send children another call and just call her I think he's pretty bright on although I think

1198
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975
You got my wife

1199
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,511
Actually yeah

1200
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,559
Changed her mind she's been listening to

1201
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,119
Munchies

1202
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:53,727
Petrified to be honest with you what's going on and all these other nations

1203
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,055
And she's worried it's coming here and she's asked

1204
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,359
The troops from China in

1205
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:03,967
Coloring Catch-22 let's go to Canada I said no you don't want to go to Canada

1206
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,015
Let's go to

1207
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,575
Let's get out of here and I'm like this is the last

1208
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:17,535
I don't think the last battle part is necessarily right on but like

1209
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,583
By my wife has started listening to your G

1210
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,607
She's terrified

1211
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:27,007
Starting to like Alex

1212
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:31,103
You know I need his help figuring out how to not be scared anymore

1213
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,431
I'm going to have to take that idea because I too want a giant

1214
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,247
It's it's kind of sad

1215
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,783
It really makes me

1216
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,599
Bummed I do I I do like

1217
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:44,159
Alex should hear that and be like

1218
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,951
The general vibe

1219
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,535
Exactly right

1220
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,119
So I told you there's a Congressional candidate

1221
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:53,887
And that is

1222
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,423
Our old pal

1223
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,703
Laura Loomer

1224
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:03,359
Call Laura Loomer is here from her campaign headquarters in Palm Beach Florida

1225
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:11,039
Why was she sitting on the ground pull show.

1226
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:23,583
Big Sky problems what a shot

1227
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,351
And say

1228
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,423
If you have any problem that can be described as

1229
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
Big

1230
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,215
Big Sky problem

1231
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:29,983
You shouldn't be

1232
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:33,055
You should be at least able to figure out Skype

1233
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,079
If you want to be

1234
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:37,407
I think Alex is really just blaming her

1235
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,687
For his own issues

1236
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:42,015
Headline from Florida politics

1237
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,807
This is from October 5th

1238
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:50,207
Lois Frankel nearly doubling Laurel Uber support in new ct21 survey

1239
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:53,279
If you read through the article you find at the newest poll the disc

1240
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,095
Bloomers running in his Frankel ahead 61

1241
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,119
233

1242
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,703
Luminate surprisingly well in the primary though but there's a lot of factors

1243
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,239
Considerate

1244
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,287
The first is that her general election

1245
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,871
Frankel ran unopposed last cycle

1246
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,687
The second is that the district has equipped 17-point

1247
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:14,527
Five-point registration Advantage for Democrats over Republicans

1248
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,135
People have a party affiliation it's a deeply democratic

1249
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,439
The third factor is that there were

1250
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,743
6 people running in the GOP Primary

1251
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
Seriously

1252
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:31,423
Laura Loomer was somebody who had some name recognition and ability to fundraise with her publicity stunt

1253
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,471
Which set are ahead of the other five candidates

1254
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,543
None of them really had much of a chance of winning the general election

1255
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,615
No matter how ReSound ugly they might have won the Primary

1256
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,455
Standard Infowars adjacent Senate run

1257
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:47,039
This was never about winning it was about appearing like winning was even

1258
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:47,807
Impossible

1259
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,343
Lemon grifting along the way

1260
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,415
Well pushing hateful and bigoted rhetoric further into the mainstream

1261
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,999
I will say that Laura better figure I would have grieved that you wants

1262
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,023
Run after

1263
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,303
She loses the race will be

1264
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
Now

1265
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,351
Because if she doesn't

1266
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:03,935
She's going to end up like Deanna Lorraine hosting an evening show on Infowars

1267
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
In a couple months

1268
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,983
Yeah that's

1269
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,007
It's still

1270
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:11,615
Insane

1271
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:18,015
Crying because of

1272
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,855
Infowars think it's amazing that

1273
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:26,463
When she won the Primary there should have been like two journalists who were like okay

1274
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,767
Countdown to when we catch her committing fraud

1275
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,071
Because I I would bet fifty bucks

1276
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,631
Right now that you if you looked into her find a

1277
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,727
If she has committed fraud already I bet you wouldn't even have to like

1278
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:45,919
Know you know what you don't have me as a story there's so many ways for her to lose

1279
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,711
I don't mean that as a story I mean like

1280
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,015
Play zeze

1281
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,831
Let's do something about campaign-finance fraud 41

1282
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,135
Sure

1283
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,207
Yeah I just another one

1284
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,231
Omar Navarro

1285
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:04,095
That guy who said Auntie Maxine Waters Alaska kept typing on

1286
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,167
No

1287
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
That's true

1288
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,751
Who's going on to

1289
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,031
To bigger and better things

1290
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:15,871
In the in the bad Infowars primary

1291
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,639
Candidate run

1292
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:21,247
Alex is doing way better off back in like 2009 when he was having state

1293
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,551
Representatives in state senate members on

1294
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,623
Because

1295
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:31,231
Thousands of them across the country could probably find some of them

1296
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:31,999
Instead of these

1297
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,583
Springe as candidates who are not even

1298
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,607
Got to

1299
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,631
Honestly

1300
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,167
I don't even care about that

1301
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,959
61 to 33 Pole

1302
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:44,287
That loomer's down here she's just going to end up saying

1303
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,311
Fake

1304
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:49,919
Of course my internal polling says I'm up course

1305
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,967
A normal

1306
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,527
Like middle-of-the-road Republican

1307
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,831
Probably couldn't win that District right now

1308
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,879
Based on the Democrats win

1309
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:03,743
17.5 Point Etheridge registration advantage

1310
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,511
Like

1311
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,071
You have

1312
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,375
If you want to win that is a Republican

1313
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,983
And I just don't

1314
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,055
I don't care about her internal polling

1315
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,335
He's not going to win

1316
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,455
Even after she goes with him

1317
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,991
Epinephrine

1318
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,271
Somehow there are

1319
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
Nope

1320
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
Places to

1321
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,087
Pass a democratic

1322
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:35,487
Ballot with 97% of the vote

1323
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,511
Ballot now so

1324
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:41,119
Do you got this pool that sang 6133 Bloomers down

1325
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,935
Boomer says that her internal polling

1326
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,959
Gore has her up

1327
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,263
Alex knows where the real numbers

1328
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:51,103
Do the one they're searching how to vote Republican

1329
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,919
Democratic Google searches

1330
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:56,991
These are the type of real numbers that show real engagement

1331
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:02,367
You don't win this election fraud

1332
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:10,559
I committed voter fraud

1333
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,607
Set up the precondition that if she loses

1334
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,887
Probably stolen election

1335
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,935
And also

1336
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:18,495
That is such a weird idea

1337
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:23,359
That people are Googling how to vote Republican twice as much as Democrat

1338
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,663
And that's some kind of an indication of

1339
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:30,527
So what that is I that really threw me for a loop

1340
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:33,087
This was a headline in Glenn Beck's

1341
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:33,855
Website

1342
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:36,415
The Blaze great that apparently

1343
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,999
More people are Googling how to vote Republican then

1344
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,279
How to vote Democrat

1345
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,303
Sure

1346
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,095
I would say I don't know what that means

1347
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,887
I would say

1348
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,679
Ain't that one possible interpretation

1349
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,495
Maybe that you have not done a good job of Ed

1350
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,287
Educating your voters on how to

1351
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:55,103
What is it mean like what

1352
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,663
Someone trying to

1353
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,431
To figure out

1354
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,223
If they Google the word

1355
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,759
How to vote

1356
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,319
Do you know you just vote for the Republican

1357
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:07,135
Guess what there may be with theirs

1358
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:11,231
Thinking is primary register as a Republican

1359
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:16,095
I understand that it may be except

1360
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:21,727
Search however I would also argue that many of the words that people are searching for are not

1361
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,519
The questions that they're looking to actually

1362
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,847
And that's what I'm wrestling with two

1363
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:29,407
Like trying to register

1364
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,687
That's possible

1365
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:37,855
Whatever it is I don't think Republic I don't think people searching how to vote Republican or how to vote Democrat

1366
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,879
Indication

1367
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Of life

1368
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
Final vote

1369
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,487
It's more confusion

1370
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:49,887
Yeah it's certainly confusing and it's not proof that Laura Loomer is going to win or its voter fraud

1371
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,655
I'll guarantee that

1372
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:53,471
Alex likes to portray himself as like an

1373
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,519
Truth-teller he's the news

1374
01:07:55,775 --> 01:08:01,919
The fake news on the other hand they're all liars Peach and they have liberal bias because they're all liberal right

1375
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,943
They're all globalist

1376
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,711
And what have you

1377
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,503
And this is like an important

1378
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,295
Straight down the middle new show

1379
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:15,231
2800 in the primary so you could give another 2,800

1380
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,679
Floor lamp

1381
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,871
People want to win this is how we do it

1382
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,663
Straight down the middle news

1383
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,455
I'm at donate to Laura Loomer

1384
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,503
Campaign

1385
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,319
I would I would like

1386
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,599
I would like

1387
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,415
Exactly how much it

1388
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,183
Did you donate

1389
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,743
2800 probably dead

1390
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,047
Like there's an impotence

1391
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,071
But this is Advil

1392
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,863
100

1393
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,911
Anything other

1394
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:59,263
Then the worst version of what he accuses all the other news media of being

1395
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,823
Can you imagine

1396
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:08,223
Wolf Blitzer just just coming out in like I'm going to donate to 2802

1397
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,551
To bring my

1398
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,343
A personal account out of here

1399
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:16,159
So I can say as a independent

1400
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,695
Neutral journalist

1401
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,999
I'm giving 2802 Bernie Sanders

1402
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
So ridiculous

1403
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:25,119
She wants to inject

1404
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,143
The real issue

1405
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,447
Into the mainstream

1406
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,471
Right

1407
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:35,871
There's no one talking about the stuff that actually matter thankfully Alex's a brave enough

1408
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,407
Guy to have her on

1409
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,687
And she's brave enough

1410
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,479
To talk about what matters

1411
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,087
Country

1412
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,391
Issue with Law and Order and

1413
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,535
Horse I have to reiterate

1414
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,839
It's on your program

1415
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,607
We'll talk about it

1416
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:03,007
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris

1417
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,943
I don't want to because their entire camp

1418
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,711
Campaign

1419
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,503
Is a dog whistle to the radical left

1420
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:16,575
I know you just grab your phone cuz you're trying to see if it does

1421
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,135
Okay

1422
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,415
I'm wondering why it doesn't

1423
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:25,023
Cuz anybody could have said that up as a redirect yourself

1424
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:30,399
Anybody could have done that any proof that Joe Biden bought

1425
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,679
Fifa.com

1426
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:37,567
Explain to me why is a non-existent organization

1427
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:41,407
Bought antifa.com

1428
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,039
Why would I not talk about this

1429
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
Oh my God

1430
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
They did

1431
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,599
They did last by

1432
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,207
The stupid store

1433
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,999
That would be a smart thing to do

1434
01:10:56,255 --> 01:11:00,607
Thanks for really focusing Law & Order this is what matters

1435
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,143
Is Joe Biden's website

1436
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,703
Akram antifa.com

1437
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,239
God

1438
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,519
Laura is

1439
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,079
Keeping us but let me ask you this question

1440
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:12,127
How would it make sense for

1441
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:12,895
Antifa

1442
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:17,759
Medical leftist organization hell-bent on destroying the world

1443
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:21,855
Right to mess things up by making their website

1444
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,623
About

1445
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,391
Touro College

1446
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,463
Team strange what does seem strange right

1447
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,511
And it seems like

1448
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,583
Alex's whole game is supposed to be that like

1449
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,911
The reason that Joe Biden doesn't say

1450
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:40,287
Tear down Christianity and white people need to go to Camp is because

1451
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:44,383
He's trying to keep it hush in the same reason why I like people who

1452
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,431
You are left

1453
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,783
Protesters in such they're not excited about Joe Biden

1454
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:58,463
I keep that under right right by then and all these left-wing protesters they're working together

1455
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:03,071
The essential shell game that needs to be played is it a pretend that they're not right

1456
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:09,471
People f**** it up by redirecting antifa.com to Joe Biden's website now I feel like we're dealing with

1457
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,495
An enemy that is

1458
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,263
Is very

1459
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,287
Very stupid

1460
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:17,151
We're used to that with Alex only able to think as well as

1461
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,431
1 Alex Jones

1462
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,199
In terms

1463
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,991
The planning something

1464
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,015
Joe Biden

1465
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:27,647
Even if Joe B yeah even if Joe Biden is like running antifa

1466
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,415
Antifa.com

1467
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,439
Obviously

1468
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
Here's the thing

1469
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,231
Laura

1470
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,511
And Alex

1471
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,279
And all of the

1472
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,559
The people in this world

1473
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,839
Are not very good at the

1474
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:39,935
They're not very I mean I don't know if maybe they are smart in their ways

1475
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:43,263
But they're not very good researchers or they're not very good

1476
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,335
Snow so whenever they solve a mystery

1477
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,895
Like antifa.com redirect

1478
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,431
Two Joe Biden's website

1479
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,455
They

1480
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:55,039
Include that Joe Biden is running a full or empty

1481
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,599
Supporting or whatever

1482
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:00,159
And then that becomes the mystery was

1483
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,951
We found the solution

1484
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,231
I found the answer

1485
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,279
And that means mystery must be what

1486
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:11,679
Caters to all this s*** up

1487
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,703
Nancy

1488
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,495
Drew you would really

1489
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,055
Crush Laura Loomer in a Republican

1490
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,127
Really be able to solve a lot more B

1491
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:24,991
Conclusion and now you're writing a story

1492
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,039
Very stupid

1493
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,575
Speaking stupid

1494
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,879
I respect this

1495
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,415
On some level

1496
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,439
But this isn't good

1497
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,975
I mean I respected in terms of

1498
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:42,143
Clear wiggle room with it

1499
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,935
Okay alright Laura wants to make one

1500
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,959
Joyce Bonner record

1501
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,055
To say

1502
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,151
A lot of people you shouldn't

1503
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,247
Going to be really good

1504
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:03,647
American group of men and women we probably women is a good wholesome group

1505
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,951
Where is clear on that

1506
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,303
It seems like a really easy to take something like that and make

1507
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,327
A damning

1508
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,863
Political ad

1509
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,911
See now here's

1510
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,679
Here's where we

1511
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:18,239
We get into why their plan for what Joe Biden

1512
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,799
Is doing is so stupid because that is

1513
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,823
Their plan

1514
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,359
Understand

1515
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,407
Like oh yeah you should be doing

1516
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:31,551
You should be creating a separation between you and the proud boys disavowing any interest even though you of course

1517
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,831
Love them dearly

1518
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:36,415
That what you separate yourself from the more extremist wing of the party

1519
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:40,255
And you get to say like what will I still condemn violence and all that s***

1520
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,279
That would be smart

1521
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,095
Sing you love the proud boys is the equivalent of

1522
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,119
Jill Biden

1523
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:51,519
Antifa.com your plans are dumber than

1524
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,335
Y'all got it's the equivalent of Joe Biden

1525
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,615
Being out

1526
01:14:55,871 --> 01:15:00,223
On the streets with a balaclava in a multi-functional absolute

1527
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,039
Just cut it out

1528
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:07,135
Joined p**** Riot yeah that's where we're at

1529
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,183
The character like the character

1530
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,207
Picture of

1531
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:10,975
A left-wing

1532
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,791
Antifa protesters

1533
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,351
So stupid

1534
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:19,935
In the same way that I appreciate that Laura's being clear

1535
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,959
About her

1536
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,263
Connection with the proud boys and support for them

1537
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,847
I hate black people I want to be very clear about this

1538
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,175
She also is very clear about what you will do if alive

1539
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,247
Clarity

1540
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:34,527
Hate everything else

1541
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,343
Inoculation

1542
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,183
Yeah I'm not taking the vaccine

1543
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:46,303
Search me

1544
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:49,375
Cuz I know you going to call me as a witness on censorship

1545
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,679
You are going to be my spy

1546
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,727
Alex and you are going to testify

1547
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:57,823
Defy you and Gavin McInnes and Milo

1548
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,639
Goldie

1549
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:04,223
Alex okay

1550
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,759
That is quite a lot

1551
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:08,063
Don't think Alex will be played by

1552
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
By Jimmy Stewart

1553
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:09,855
This remake

1554
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,927
I think it's going to happen

1555
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:16,255
This is a bad lesson

1556
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,535
Bye bye man

1557
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,839
I'm all for it send them in there

1558
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,631
Breaking a fire

1559
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,215
I think that list is a terrible list of bigger

1560
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
And Weirdos

1561
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,567
Publicity stunt

1562
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:33,151
It is very strange to me that like

1563
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,431
Two of them are Canadian

1564
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,479
Two of them are British citizen

1565
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,063
There's a heavy overlap of

1566
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,623
I don't think it means anything

1567
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,927
I mean it it does kind of suggest

1568
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,951
Just do that

1569
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,535
Americans are allowed to say whatever they want

1570
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,095
There is no censorship

1571
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,143
I'm choosing people not from here

1572
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,447
Well Laura and Alex

1573
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:02,335
Sure sure there's a to American British people into Canadian

1574
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:06,175
If you will of all white bigots

1575
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,991
Yes yeah there we go

1576
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,783
So Alex gets

1577
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,319
Complaining here this next clip

1578
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,855
About how like

1579
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,391
Eso's

1580
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,671
Supplement

1581
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,439
That's right

1582
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,207
But they're not

1583
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,487
It's not like he's selling

1584
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:23,071
AccuWeather are prevention covid

1585
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,607
But then again

1586
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,911
If you take the stuff that he has

1587
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,447
You can't get viruses

1588
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,871
Does mi Freedom into Funland

1589
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,319
It's essential

1590
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,855
Literally

1591
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:49,183
Cannot dive you have high levels of that providers

1592
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:58,655
If you haven't watched a sense of virus causes cancer

1593
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,983
Can replicate in the nuclei in

1594
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:09,407
Vitamin D3

1595
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,711
That seems like a real problem

1596
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,479
That cliff

1597
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,759
Is

1598
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,295
I mean

1599
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
He's saying

1600
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,367
Fatty cells

1601
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,391
Vitamin

1602
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:22,463
You can't die from a virus

1603
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,743
If you have those vitamins

1604
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
The wood

1605
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:29,631
Indicate that he's selling his supplements as a prevention of death

1606
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,655
Viviparous

1607
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:38,079
It does seem like a big fault in our legal system if you can just split infinitive and get around all of that lie

1608
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:41,663
I didn't say it was a cute guy just said that sure

1609
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
I sell them

1610
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,039
I didn't say that I sold cure

1611
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,855
Now I see I separated it

1612
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:53,951
I put it in between the two so now it's fine

1613
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:57,279
Do I do think I'm in vitamins and minerals are in pork

1614
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,303
The human bodies

1615
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,399
I think it would Alex

1616
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,167
Does mixing up

1617
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:06,495
Here in a very intentional and manipulative way

1618
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,263
Is

1619
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,055
The fact that

1620
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:12,639
Vitamin deficiency can make you more susceptible to

1621
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,687
That does not mean

1622
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:18,271
That if you have all the vitamins you need it's impossible to get sick

1623
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,063
Also if it's different

1624
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:22,879
You don't get to that you don't get to sleep after you did something right

1625
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,903
You don't get to do that

1626
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,463
Is trying to kill all the

1627
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:30,047
So he doesn't get to do anything right

1628
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:35,167
He doesn't get to save it all everybody was surprised that fauci threats out you need vitamins

1629
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:37,471
You don't get that

1630
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,031
Try to kill you but using Alex

1631
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,823
Needs to say something like that

1632
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,591
Because he

1633
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:45,151
You painted this picture of fauci as the guy was trying

1634
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,175
Kill Everybody

1635
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,479
She does say something like

1636
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,015
Vitamins are in

1637
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,783
Like

1638
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:54,623
Essential part of your diet they do help you stay healthier

1639
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,903
Alex

1640
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,927
Well s***

1641
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,743
If people see that and I don't explain it

1642
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:02,815
They think I'm a liar

1643
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,351
3DS to come up with

1644
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:10,751
It's not even then it doesn't make sense if he's trying to kill everyone and then he confirms what

1645
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,519
Alex says

1646
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,543
That suggests

1647
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:15,872
To me that would Alex is saying will kill everyone

1648
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,408
Seems Seems like

1649
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,968
Hit that. It's hard to get away from

1650
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,832
Laura has some theories about to have a left one

1651
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,112
How to kill all the old people

1652
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,648
License

1653
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,208
Schwan's older people

1654
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,232
How to dye a lot of

1655
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,256
The time because they

1656
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,792
Are more conservative

1657
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
Everything about this

1658
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:36,864
Aspirus has

1659
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,704
Inherently political

1660
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,240
Sounds exciting

1661
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,264
Open pig

1662
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,848
I came back from break cuz I wanted to hear what this thing that was big that Alex

1663
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:47,872
Came up with was

1664
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,920
I don't know if I did

1665
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,944
Get that but

1666
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,480
Here is Lori explaining

1667
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,272
A little more

1668
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,720
He senior rhetoric

1669
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,000
Perforating through

1670
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,864
It's the beginning of this year

1671
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,400
With the okay Boomer memes

1672
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:18,080
Hatred or disdain for

1673
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,360
Maleficent

1674
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,040
Don't bring a Bill Ayers on your show it's just an embarrassment for your career

1675
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,064
So good

1676
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:33,696
Like okay so the okay Boomer meme was the first Salvo in the war against the elderly

1677
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:37,536
Do you not want to talk about all of the Republican elected politician

1678
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:42,400
Sewer like let the old people die so the economy can stay open

1679
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,424
Do you think that's

1680
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:50,080
Less Insidious not okay Boomer okay lieutenant governor is coming out and saying that the older

1681
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:53,408
Sacrifice their lives in order for the economy keep running

1682
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,176
That's not

1683
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,712
Wanting to kill old peep

1684
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:59,808
People dance that's inspiring old people to die for us

1685
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:02,112
You've had a good run old people

1686
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,392
Okay Boomer

1687
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,416
What

1688
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,440
Deck design

1689
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:11,584
Laura you have terrible stupid takes based on nothing and we go

1690
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,864
Okay Boomer because

1691
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,400
Nothing you say means anything

1692
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,728
That is exactly the same as the lieutenant governor of a state

1693
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:18,496
Sayings

1694
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:23,104
Kill all those people for money

1695
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,176
One last clip here and I promise

1696
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:28,480
This is Alex being forced to deal with the fact

1697
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,016
Actor that Trump

1698
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:33,856
Got a stem cell related covid-19

1699
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:37,440
And like I said I'm positive that Alex would rather not

1700
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,464
Talk about this but

1701
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,232
Unfortunately

1702
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,512
After Laurel leaves

1703
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:41,536
He takes more call

1704
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,304
Call Lou bad idea

1705
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,840
Thanks for holding

1706
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:49,984
Hey Alex my main thing was there now starting to talk about

1707
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,264
Cure for covid

1708
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,080
Wi-38 is in there witches aborted

1709
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,688
Now they are complaining about it which it's

1710
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,456
Spinning our pet

1711
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,224
Pepsi

1712
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,760
Are Doritos arvac

1713
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,808
Maxine's and now the media is

1714
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,368
Mustang turns their evilness and pointed at you

1715
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,672
Story is true

1716
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:12,000
I'm going to have to do more research on it but where was all the coverage on this

1717
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,792
Back in the day and I am so

1718
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,608
Serious about it there is no

1719
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,168
Explanation on how serious I am about this

1720
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:22,752
Why do you cover the shower

1721
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,872
Therapeutic

1722
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:32,224
One of the things he's promoting uses fetal cells

1723
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,344
Absolutely

1724
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,648
No

1725
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:47,584
I think you just exactly where I'm at now

1726
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,400
No no no no no

1727
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,680
No no

1728
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,984
Eyewear but we got one point one point

1729
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,264
If you guys don't like abortions

1730
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,616
And you would bringing them outright your dumb f****** president would be death well

1731
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,432
Well this is probably doesn't do anything but that's the point

1732
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:07,296
Subway in a little bit glad when we talked about this on the last episode

1733
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:10,624
You know about the relation to fetal cells

1734
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,928
There are other ways that stem cells

1735
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,976
Are are

1736
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:19,072
Like there are cell lines and stuff like

1737
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:21,120
One thing I was reading is active research

1738
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,680
This treatment was involved in

1739
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,216
Comes from a cell line

1740
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,520
From

1741
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,056
Fetal cells

1742
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:32,640
Yeah yeah it's it's not like

1743
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,176
This is all running on

1744
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:36,480
Abortions are whatever

1745
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:39,808
Well some of that I mean some of the cultures and stuff that we used all

1746
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,624
Originate with one black woman in the in the 50s

1747
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,696
He's or whatever so I didn't get any compensation

1748
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:49,280
Ignition for it until recently

1749
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,816
Stem cell research

1750
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,376
Does Don Edwards involve Sara Lee

1751
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,960
I think the point

1752
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,752
Is really

1753
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,288
Important here is

1754
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,568
People don't

1755
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,848
Have a problem

1756
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,640
With the treatment

1757
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:05,920
But have a problem

1758
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:08,992
With the fact that you don't have a problem with that

1759
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:14,368
Because if you if you say that now oh now they're all mad about it

1760
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:16,672
You're just saying that nothing you believe means

1761
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,976
Think so just say nothing you believe means any

1762
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,256
Course not.

1763
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,048
I don't have a problem

1764
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,584
With stem cell research

1765
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:24,864
I don't like

1766
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,144
But if Trump

1767
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:26,912
Is sick

1768
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,448
And he uses a treatment

1769
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,008
That relies on some stem cell research

1770
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,032
I don't have a problem

1771
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,824
Alex should

1772
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
Alex

1773
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,616
Should

1774
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,408
It's just

1775
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:42,528
That's the disconnected it doesn't it's not fair for them to be like oh now the left

1776
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,064
He's mad about

1777
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,392
No I don't think I've seen anybody

1778
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,160
Appointed like

1779
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,440
Hey isn't it weird

1780
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:52,000
That you guys are mad about this stuff but not now

1781
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:52,768
Guys

1782
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,536
Right now

1783
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:59,168
On the same day that you were saying now the left is all mad about abortions or whatever

1784
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,216
You are trying to

1785
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,752
Confirm a Supreme Court Justice

1786
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,520
2 hour

1787
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:07,104
Blow the very process by which many of these therapies are

1788
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:07,872
Created

1789
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,152
Zoosk

1790
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:10,432
Uart

1791
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,736
Just just say you want

1792
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,016
Just say you're racist

1793
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,832
Just say that you're a bigot that's what it is just figure of fun

1794
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:20,160
F****** bigot or whatever that anger

1795
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:23,232
Really does represent bike

1796
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,024
A big part of what this whole

1797
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:25,792
Cool thing is

1798
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:29,376
That one other callers talking about his wife listening to Alex

1799
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,400
And she got really

1800
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,168
Scared

1801
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:35,520
Translate it eventually into what this caller

1802
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:37,568
Is representing and that is

1803
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,336
Peoria

1804
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,872
They just you get in with

1805
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:40,640
Sphere

1806
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:44,992
And then it gets changed into anger against the people Alex wants you to be angry about

1807
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,552
Even though none of this stuff makes any sense

1808
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,088
Do you actually look at what's up

1809
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:49,856
Being sad

1810
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,392
Also I mean like

1811
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,160
This

1812
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:56,512
Pharmaceutical company that made this treatment to the regeneron Pharmaceuticals

1813
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:01,376
Like they were awarded a 450 million dollar contract by Trump's government

1814
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,680
My back in July to research treatment

1815
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:06,496
That was very clearly built on stem cell

1816
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,776
Stop like it's not like

1817
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:12,384
Trump didn't not know that was maybe he did not like you might not know everything

1818
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,408
He doesn't know any

1819
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,272
Trying to pretend videos no like involvement in any of those to go fuc

1820
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,296
Yourself busy

1821
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,320
It's so

1822
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,600
Weak but the

1823
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,648
You just

1824
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:24,928
It's so weak

1825
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,464
He should just not talk about it

1826
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,024
But he can't cuz he accidentally took this called

1827
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,560
The best you can come up with his Dad

1828
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:31,584
And it is

1829
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,608
Infuriating

1830
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,632
The meaningless

1831
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,936
That's it

1832
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,728
Just soap

1833
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:39,776
It's so brazen

1834
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:40,800
It's just like

1835
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,336
Why why

1836
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:46,688
Why bother with the lies if you're going to be that Brazen about how stupid

1837
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,248
Like that you can

1838
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,552
You can't not see through this

1839
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,344
No

1840
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:54,880
I think

1841
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,160
Can't if you're looking at

1842
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:59,744
Critically but if you're looking at it emotionally and experiencing it emotionally

1843
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,024
Think it might be tough

1844
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,072
See-through and I think that's

1845
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,608
What

1846
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,376
We'll stay in the fold

1847
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,704

1848
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,472
And

1849
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,240
I think

1850
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:11,776
Things that I'd like to

1851
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,056

1852
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,592
Be more careful when he takes calls

1853
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,640
And Laura Loomer is gone

1854
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,736
And she's going to make plenty of money Allah

1855
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,808
I guess

1856
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,880
