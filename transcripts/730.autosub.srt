00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge babe I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Alex Jones

6
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:11,424
Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
My bright spot today is the Turning of a season that turning of the sea

8
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
Wrong or how everybody

9
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,944
Sure and it's getting a little chillier

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968
Right maybe

11
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,064
I think it's a little chilly here in my apartment than it is even outside with ugly

12
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,832
That is true

13
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
But I don't mind

14
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,184
I like I run hot generally Sotomayor

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
The cool weather

16
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
In the past

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
The Cult

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,328
As always signified one thing for me

19
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,936
That cranberry splash Sierra Mist is right around the corner

20
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
I did not know that that was a cold base

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,336
Sierra Mist cranberry

22
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
I don't know I think it probably will be sometime like closer to December

23
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,624
I've realized there's a new thing that's been Incorporated

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,440
But it is an indication that I think I'm getting old

25
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
And that is I got

26
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,072
Excited as at the Walgreens and I saw that they had

27
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,144
The soft Werther's Originals

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Candy apple

29
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
Variety

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,664
Excited that you get it goes.

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,064
Didn't immediately like give it to a child with a little piece of wisdom as you walked out

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,464
I'm eating them all

33
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
Games of all of them

34
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:44,864
There's a couple other flavors to that I may try there's a maple and a cinnamon

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
I want

36
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:51,776
That I may try there's also pumpkin but I'm not into that so

37
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
Considering they're clearly not

38
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Original

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
The karbala

40
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
What exactly

41
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,736
I mean those you can call where there's originals but what do you call the maple one

42
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Werther's innovative

43
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,624
Innovative Innovative I like that I don't know

44
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
It's great

45
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
Congratulation

46
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,768
Derivatives would be a little bit more

47
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:19,168
Yeah

48
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
Play can go three Mount Telegram

49
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,408
My partner and I have we've been on a fitness week

Spots you know you I'm not like all I'm an old man I'm 30

56
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
There are certain spots in my body that are not Werther's original

57
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Butler

58
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
Thereby many is 68

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Like it's that kind of

60
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,152
That kind of situation

61
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,248
It's it's good and also very difficult

62
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:11,648
Do I do one of these with my shoulder hurts a lot

63
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,720
These are things that take a little bit of a hit

64
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,071
There's more where on that been on some of the other parts of the body

65
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Well I forgot

66
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
That's good

67
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:29,055
I wish you the best that I don't know what that feels like at all no memory of motion

68
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,663
To Jordan today we have an episode to go over

69
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,479
I decided after our last step

70
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,551
Episode where we talked about Alex's weekend

71
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
Excursion

72
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
With a Robert Barnes

73
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
Where Barnes committed

74
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,999
The crimes I decided I wanted to put Alex on timeout I don't want it

75
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,327
Here's the thing you know we've been watching the trial as a

76
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,727
Progressed over the week and this week has been a lot of family

77
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
People telling

78
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,359
Moving and difficult stories of their

79
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:10,015
Hear their loved ones some some very heartening and bright stories about their lives

80
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
Eminem

81
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Terrific

82
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,135
Tales of the abuse they suffered

83
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
I mean yeah it is

84
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
It is a

85
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,023
Emotional rollercoaster that is is like

86
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,423
So extreme you know you you see them cry and in with with smiling happy

87
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,799
Happy tears at the at these joyful memories and then you are and then it's it's just

88
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
Voice in pets

89
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,431
What are the things that I keep hearing a bit too like that just

90
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,479
I don't know maybe will haunt me

91
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Is the

92
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,343
Consistency that you hear people

93
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,207
Describe one of the effects of the abuse that they get as like almost

94
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
The denial of their self

95
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Do you know like yeah

96
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Being asked

97
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:00,703
Are you related to this person who died at Sandy nope that's not me right y'all having to deny your sibling or

98
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,823
You know your child just for the sake of like I don't want to deal with

99
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,407
The possibility that they're one of those people who wants to yell at me

100
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,943
It's just

101
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
It's dark and

102
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,807
I am challenging I appreciate

103
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
That

104
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,415
These people are getting this opportunity

105
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
But

106
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
I don't

107
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
Waktu cover Alex

108
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
This stuff

109
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
Right now

110
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,887
You know like he did as bad of a

111
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
Thing is he

112
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,471
Could do on Saturday

113
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
I can't

114
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,543
Think of much more disrespect

115
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
That he could give

116
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
And

117
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
I don't want

118
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,783
To be at like we talked about this I don't want to be an Alex Jones Chris Hardwick show

119
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,879
Talking Alex

120
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
Mohican go on timeout

121
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,487
So we're going back to the past

122
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
Yeah I don't know if he could get worse but I don't think I'm interested in seeing him try

123
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
I will where we he did and he in Barns

124
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Stepped

125
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
To cross that line

126
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,079
Last episode to a point where I'm like

127
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,895
Why aren't we all suing them as a

128
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Country

129
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,967
As as a as a species

130
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
We should get

131
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
Together and like

132
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
Include talking rhesus monkeys because he probably defamed them to like we should be all sewage

133
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
Him and barns for what they did

134
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,279
Class-action human sonrisa

135
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,143
Yeah and I totally would not talk will not talk about like Alex at all

136
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,959
Trial progresses or anything or his present pay stub

137
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
It's too much

138
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
Yeah we can go sit over there

139
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
And we'll talk about the past

140
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
So we're going to talk about August

Continuing or pass through 2003

143
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783

144
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,439

Before we dive into this episode here's a fun out of context

173
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Today Show

174
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,647

175
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,999
Just so happens if you wonder what kind of

176
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:14,399
Apropos of nothing I look like a potato

177
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,263
I look like a potato

178
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,615
It really is a non-sequitur that drives you insane

179
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,431
Is it reminds me of Lewis Black

180
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,783
If it weren't for the horse I never would have spent that year in college

181
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,111
I need so much more information than that

182
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
Well you'll get none.

00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,279

Talk about big stories but a cat

185
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Battenkill

186
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Grenada

187
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
In their barracks

188
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Iraq

189
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Dying

190
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
World War

191
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
4

192
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Governor of

193
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
And I know

194
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
Play the dark

195
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Hercules

196
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
Kent Chevrolet

197
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
Okay

198
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
So I think it literally everyone knows that Arnold was a powerlifting guy that's what he is

199
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,567
Mr. universe

200
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,151
Also Arnold represent Austria

201
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
It's a small point

202
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
Different countries did you know that Dad

203
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
That's true Alex's nah

204
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,831
Also Arnold is not an atheist he's a very public

205
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Catholic

206
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,999
You may remember that his daughter Katherine married Chris Pratt couple years back there was a bit of a public Reckoning with

207
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
The notion that. Only Pratt but also Arnold's daughter

208
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
We're pretty traditionalist Catholic vote remember that Arnold is married to Maria Shriver

209
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
Famously a member of the

210
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:33,151
The Kennedy family notable for the fact that JFK was the first Catholic President of the United States are is that

211
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,295
A mother Eunice was JFK's sister I also have no idea what kind of books

212
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,695
Books Arnold was right before 2003 but looking mostly bodybuilding Memoirs with checks out

213
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,535
I'm actually Alex does touch on this later that is what he's talking

214
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,887
About bodybuilding books

215
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,543
God is bodybuilders book

216
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,895
Weights as well as if I can Arnold tan we know this I guess

217
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,199
Come on so there's a really fun

218
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:13,599
Thread that goes throughout this entire episode that is like Alex there's so many big stories to cover but I do know I got it.

219
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
Talk about Arnold

220
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
I did

221
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,767
Is making really

222
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Very

223
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,935
Put a part that he has to talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger

224
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
No

225
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Okay

226
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
President

227
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
National

228
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Police horse

229
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
Right

230
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Dress

231
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Arnold

232
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
Okay

233
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Korean

234
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
A little bit in the shower

235
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,943
Well it looks like Alex is a bit off on his prediction there about Arnold haha like he was just governor of California for a bit

236
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,551
And now he makes videos with animals in his kitchen about Trump is bad news and how he loves

237
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:20,927
The people of Ukraine and the people of Russia yeah he seems like he's having a way better

238
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,999
2020 life

239
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
Another point

240
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,351
Alex is totally wrong about the etymology of Schwarzenegger

241
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
He's assuming that Schwartz

242
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
What's means black

243
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:36,287
Jack and the second half of his name well you can guess where Alex

244
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,687
Popular piece of incorrect information that was flying around at this time and Alex

245
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,271
Probably in a meme or some dumb blog and then just decided to pass it along

246
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,343
Who is audience of gospel

247
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
Do chit had stuff right there

248
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:55,231
In reality the name comes from his ancestors being from a place called Schwarzenegger

249
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
Which is in modern-day Austria

250
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:02,655
Does being black in this case and egg is derived from the word meaning Ridge

251
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
Schwarzenegger's name memes

252
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Person from the Black Ridge

253
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,359
Here is Alex's stupid in most of the things that he says mean absolutely nothing

254
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,919
He's playing this kind of like

255
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
Expertise are like this

256
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,783
This depth of knowledge that he has really just like

257
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,135
It's nothing it's the confidence with which is delivered by absolute

258
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
Made-up nonsense then just

259
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,511
No matter how many times it happens there is a reason Khan

260
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,327
Men have confidence in the name like

261
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,215
Let's just rags

262
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,823
Like I don't even think Alex probably thinks this is dumb

263
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
Yeah of course

264
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:48,991
Because he never takes time to look into anything so

265
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
Is like 50% is

266
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
Is like

267
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
Well I did that

268
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
That's fair

269
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,183
Who got we are Arnold on the docket

270
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
Is very important

271
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
Yep that's running for governor

272
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
But Alex needs to take some calls

273
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:09,471
Because if you were if you remember on our last episode he was in Johnston at Miller's Studio it's we couldn't take

274
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Call

275
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
So now we got to get to these calls

276
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
This is very important

277
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
I'm also movies are real

278
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Call

279
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Dory

280
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
Lumos

281
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
Sprint

282
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
If you want to come

283
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,743
We want to spend the night

284
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,263
Confirm

285
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Abortion

286
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
Falcons

287
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,687
That's the way to disagree with you

288
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:31,647
I can't be like hey maybe you're just the wrong about stuff

289
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Strawman

290
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
I'm I'm

291
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,511
I'm going to guess based upon the

292
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
Length of time he's drawing out

293
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,655
Call Me Maybe

294
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:49,055
The show isn't as busy today as he might have you believe so much she has to talk about like I'm starting to think

295
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:55,455
I think that maybe he doesn't have that much to talk about I really don't think I would be

296
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,783
Here's all the stuff he's not going to talk about today

297
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
I will talk about Arnold

298
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,559
Why not

299
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Make

300
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,615
Smallpox

301
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,479
Showtime

302
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,367
No time

303
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
McDonald's

304
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,791
What if I call in and talk about this

305
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
Feel like he's drawing you out

306
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,151
Could be talking about it now in this space

307
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
Oregon

308
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
I've been called

309
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,271
Pneumonia

310
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
The UN organization

311
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
Quote no time

312
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,711
Sounds like you got a busy show is he can't talk about all this

313
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
Talking about what

314
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,463
When you're too

315
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
Over a5000

316
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
So

317
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,191
I'm talking about who put those spikes

318
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
To the bottom of that ravine

319
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
Play Mortal Kombat

320
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,847
Yes on the GLK

321
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:04,223
It's down there

322
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Tow truck

323
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
All Alex's choice

324
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,183
What you cover if he's so mad that he's like

325
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Arnold Schwarzenegger

326
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
He should have

327
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,047
Just like chosen to cover what he wants like

328
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:24,447
His audience is clearly captured in the sense that they are going to leave him if he decides not to cover celebrity stories

329
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
Explicitly believes

330
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
Are beneath him

331
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,311
They'd stick around whatever

332
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
Purely his choice

333
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Something that he wants

334
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Talk about

335
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
He wants to talk about this because it's easy

336
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,783
The pontificate about like celebrity type gossip style stories

337
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,111
Yeah and Egger is easier than

338
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:47,231
You know like what he just did there he's covering these stories for him right

339
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:53,631
It's touching the surface of it and what is story

340
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:02,079
So just touch on it and move on your above

341
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:08,479
I have to talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger but the people demand that I do it I mean

342
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,087
Love the idea I'd like in a tragic sense this is that that almost

343
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
Twilight Zone and you know like

344
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:21,280
The TV journalist who's always stuck talking about I don't want to talk about the cat stuck in the tree you know

345
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,864
I want to be a real journalist and then they capture the audience

346
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,680
So they can finally talk about what they want to talk

347
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,008
Talk about But realize that all they're capable of talking about

348
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Is that cat suck

349
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,432
In the tree you don't like it the tragic situation and ultimately that is what they talked about today

350
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:43,040
Hello this is Alex's Black Mirror

351
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
So

352
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,928
I was actually with Arnold Schwarzenegger

353
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,792
It's called from a guy's been giving out a bunch of his tape

354
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:58,656
Now I know that we know from listening to Alex the show that the success rate

355
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
With those tape

356
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,240
90 + 40

357
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
Covid-19

358
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
Giving out hundreds of your cakes

359
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
50% of

360
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
The people are left

361
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
They just don't even

362
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
And they don't have any

363
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
Carmen

364
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
The second thing I do

365
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
That's true

366
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
Usher videos

367
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Videos

368
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
Scared to death

369
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,160
And I think they're sitting on the parents they don't know

370
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,144
Okay your tongue is a little different now

371
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,960
We only need four

372
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:11,360
Like we're happy you that 90% happens first point those 50% aren't lethargy

373
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,384
They're polite

374
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:19,296
That's number one sleepy they don't have the energy to fight

375
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:25,696
Actually maybe there to fight you

376
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,976
They can take the test

377
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
Yeah

378
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,328
I noticed second things that Alex

379
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,168
Is doing here he's like those people aren't even in the game

380
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448
I wonder if

381
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
Alex is 90%

382
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,568
Excludes people who just like don't even want to bother

383
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:46,944
This but I don't want to talk about it I want to fight you on this

384
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,344
Those people are removed then you're artificially creating these imaginary 90% by excluding all of

385
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,744
The people who don't even want to talk to you right right okay if you were saying

386
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
You know hanging out your mixtape

387
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:07,680
Trying to get people to listen to your demo 95% of people don't even want it don't even take

388
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
Right

389
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,496
But some people do ticket

390
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,592
And the one person who comes back to you eventually was like a man that was really good

391
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,432
That's 95% of the people that have listened to it

392
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,528
Probably so you got a 95% success rate

393
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,344
If two people take your tape

394
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,232
Right and we'll Boy 2 is too small it's good

395
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
But you've

396
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,280
Approached

397
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
1000 people

398
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
It's 50% success rate

399
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
I deducted right to be

400
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,728
Something like that

401
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:47,104
Surly reset the movies are real and film is real and all this stuff

402
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,152
And you wanted people to call in

403
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
And if they've seen if you see something

404
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,040
Say something Cena movie that tells me a secret about the

405
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,064
The globalist that I can

406
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,880
Can pretend to know about I need to hear about it right

407
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
Alex is mad about

408
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
Dynamic

409
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Because

410
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
He has to watch

411
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
TV to get the

412
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
These messages

413
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,656
He doesn't want to watch it no fever

414
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,216
Exactly how they send message

415
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,056
He can't rely on the audience to constantly tell him everything

416
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,872
All these messages that they're speaking in the television

417
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
If Alex

418
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
Doesn't watch TV

419
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,248
Are they still sending out

420
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:31,648
Text message

421
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,440
Why hasn't Alex made this like

422
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
Real attempt

423
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,536
Tina like let's try and change the globalists behavior

424
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:44,192
Right so I won't watch TV or talk about TV or let my audience talk about TV and if they still

425
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
Want to get messages to me

426
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,776
They will have to send them through a different media

427
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Well here's

428
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,848
Here's the actual answers that

429
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
It's not

430
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,944
Just messages that they're sending to Alex also like

431
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
You know

432
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,064
Demoralizing the public through the messages and stuff so

433
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,464
Even if Alex isn't watching the global has to have every reason to still do the same

434
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,864
Demoralizing

435
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,264
Bonus bonus game that we can f*** with Alex and demoralize a bunch of

436
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,312
Rising things which Alex experiment

437
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,408
Experiences as them taunting him gacha so there is that

438
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,712
That that two-way communication

439
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,040
Anyway we can talk more about that episode of Frasier that's a good

440
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
I want videos

441
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
Reading

442
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
Again

443
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Call Peewee

444
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
Kerala house or whatever

445
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,328
Television

446
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
We talked about

447
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
And

448
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
We're building

449
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
Group

450
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
And

451
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Is dangerous

452
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
Commercial

453
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
Dan

454
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,272
Everything must be made with my

455
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,832
Particular trigger warning

456
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,416
Alerted to me in advance he does frankly

457
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,952
Edo sound

458
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,232
A little Center

459
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,536
He sounds a little bit like he's triggered

460
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,352
Well look Alex hasn't seen this Frasier episode

461
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,168
He's just taking a little misrepresented

462
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
Details

463
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,800
Paul Joseph Watson interview on yesterday's show details

464
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
To create a better story out of

465
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:08,736
He has really basic plot points wrong like how it was Niall's not Fraser who got into guns

466
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,528
Importantly that it wasn't a gun club

467
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,344
He was at Niles and his dad went to a shooting range

468
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:20,512
The bigger aspect that I was really messing with this episode is that the shooting range and guns are treated as totally normal safe

469
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,048
And actually fun

470
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,704
Brazzers dad has a routine of going shooting at Niles is a stick-in-the-mud but after firing a gun he realizes that it's

471
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,752
Really enjoyable and not that scary

472
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:35,360
Nothing about guns are even an issue that the episode makes look bad

473
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
It's the p

474
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,784
People that he met at the shooting range of their weirdo New World Order dude and that wouldn't even really been a problem except

475
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,856
They were trying to get Niles to come to their compound in Idaho

476
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,440
Which is why Frasier's dad was worried in the first place

477
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,000
The compounded Idaho that's suspicious

478
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
Not the gun

479
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,816
Freezer is

480
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:59,424
Portraying guns as a legitimate way for a father and son to bond

481
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,824
Definitely that's like a real thing like I was to be fixated on that saying like look look the New World Order

482
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,224
Even the New World Order is like dieta for like fine recreational activity

483
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,272
What you want people to think guns are

484
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,368
I mean at best Maybe

485
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:23,232
Making a machine to fight the new world order it was in a basement

486
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:29,632
They were at the gun show and the dudes were looking at blueprints for a generator that they were going to need once the New World Order

487
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
Took over which is what clued Niles in

488
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
But he's shooting

489
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
Go to Idaho with them

490
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,056
Anyway the point is that Alex doesn't even watch

491
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,128
TV to find these evil hidden globalist messages

492
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,432
You just hear secondhand retellings of

493
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:47,296
Plots and then makes up stuff so we can ramble to his listeners about evil hidden globalist messages

494
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
That aren't real

495
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,624
Yeah they're not real

496
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:57,280
I mean I think what's funny is that now that you know back then if I saw that episode of be like yeah it's because those

497
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
Guys in Idaho

498
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
Be crazy you know that kind of thing

499
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,656
And now it's like I would run away from them

500
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,960
It just because their stories are really boring

501
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,752
They're just B they're made of

502
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,312
They don't think you weren't actually in the war

503
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:14,432
Whichever one you're pretending to be now you're imagining details into this episode of Frasier

504
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,272
Nice guys

505
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,464
Feature heavily in a Frasier episode now

506
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,536
Would have been a true prediction

507
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,096
So Alex takes takes another call

508
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,888
And this person also want

509
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,472
Wants to talk about his film and this is kind of frustrating

510
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
This point

511
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,360
Which would be your choice

512
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,176
Probably 911 Road

513
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,552
9/11 the road to tyranny

514
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,416
Police state

515
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
Tremendous

516
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,656
Your ear singing

517
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
Let's crepe

518
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
Maybe somebody wants

519
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
I thought you were the one

520
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
Oh my God

521
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:36,096
See you are still what's going on here

522
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:42,496
About how I got all these big things we got to talk about Arnold

523
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:48,896
Justify his like I've got to talk about this I would love to

524
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:53,760
Talk about these important issues but then the colors are going

525
00:32:54,016 --> 00:33:00,160
He's frustrated that they are analyzing goddamnit

526
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,512
Back from break and his audience into telling about Artemis just

527
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,560
Little bit frustrated

528
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:22,688
Literally nobody wants to

529
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
What are you doing

530
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:29,088
The only thing I kept thinking I was going on was like well this

531
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,648
Pageant is not working

532
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,952
Play is just

533
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,536
Completely laid bare in front of everybody

534
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:45,472
Oh that's the fault of mine

535
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:58,272
Yep just delicious this is a fantastic tripping up the stairs and falling onto a Paisa

536
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,552
Situation

537
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:04,160
Alex has some other news not in my laundry list of things

538
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
This is true

539
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Because it's not

540
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,104
Last week

541
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Lion

542
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,528
Noticed

543
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,648
Bet your lawyer

544
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
This is that isn't true

545
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,664
That sounds that

546
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
That's such a great like

547
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,248
If This Were happening I be

548
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,064
Furious right now no I agree

549
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,208
I imagine this has something to do with there being some exceptions

550
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:17,120
If you're trying to witness tamper or like destroy evidence

551
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:23,520
You want to commit a murder with me later your attorney doesn't have to maintain privilege if there

552
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,336
They're trying to be involved in a crime with you

553
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,408
The crime-fraud

554
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
Provisions

555
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,736
Allow for that to be

556
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,528
Be breached fireman

557
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,576
Live for me I can't

558
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,392
Do that that mean I have to tell people that you said that

559
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:45,792
Sorry man you could just remove yourself as you can break the

560
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
I don't know

561
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
Anyway there's other news

562
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,520
3

563
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,616
Level four

564
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
Work

565
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,552
Smallpox

566
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,584
A level 4 in

567
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,448
This is why I'm saying you just

568
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:30,848
When are you list off the things

569
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
And also

570
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,176
What you just said is so not true

571
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:40,064
If I was actually thinks that level for labs are for weaponized things that explains a lot of his dumb ideas

572
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,112
But he's just making that up

573
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:48,768
The distinction between level three and four are the things that are studying level for labs are quote infectious agents

574
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,560
Toxins that pose a high risk

575
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:56,960
Have aerosol transmitted laboratory infections and life-threatening diseases for which no vaccine or therapy is available

576
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:02,848
Both use very high levels of safety protocols but understandably for things that are Aquino

577
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,384
Start even level forward they need

578
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
Greater controls

579
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,016
Smallpox and Ebola are absolutely not level three pathogens

580
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:15,904
Third studied in level for labs

581
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,256
I am in and I'm just going to throw this out there I'm the globalist

582
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,584
I'm trying to figure out where to put my weaponized

583
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,936
I'm not just going to give it a blanket late level

584
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,984
I'm not going to be like oh by the way

585
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,848
To the whole world in case you're wondering all of my level 4 Laboratories

586
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,896
That's where I weaponize thing

587
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,456
Take a swing at this Apple ID

588
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:45,856
Level five

589
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:52,256
Is there any of this it's all clandestine make it a secret level was a weaponized

590
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
Lab level

591
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,352
I wouldn't tell people about a secret

592
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,632
The slam dunk

593
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,192
Yeah

594
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
Do better

595
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,008
So look

596
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,544
There's another really fun thing that have

597
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,104
Office episode the first thing is that Arnold

598
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,896
Charade falling apart

599
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
Delightful

600
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,968
First hour of the show

601
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
Just what

602
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,064
Absolutely there's another really fun thing that happens

603
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
For the net

604
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
If eyeglass hours

605
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,976
I wish it's so different

606
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Unfortunately

607
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,352
There's many semitism we got to get through on the way there

608
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
This is weird

609
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,472
Alex is upset that people are mad at The Passion of Christ still

610
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
Fisher

611
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
And he said something strange Hawkeye

612
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,576
Is the passionate person

613
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
Because

614
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,008
Corrupt

615
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,856
IC

616
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,928
Yeah

617
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
Not

618
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,608
It wasn't talking about Jews just the specific subset of Jews that don't agree with him

619
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,264
The setting off at ability for us to hate them for the rest of our lives I don't understand what that is

620
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,568
Problem there hahaha no big deal

621
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
What

622
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:19,200
No he just chooses to hate every juzt

623
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,736
Oh no now I'm getting it

624
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:29,440
Already about The Passion of the Christ and the the problems with it and Mel Gibson's dad

625
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,744
Problems with almond problems Holocaust

626
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:35,840
Denial and such and he still allowed to be in movies

627
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,168
The way I was just framing that there at the end

628
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,704
Is bizarre

629
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
Is

630
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,384
I I just I don't understand how these things can just they can come out of his mouth and he doesn't recognize what I'm saying

631
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664
Cannot say that

632
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,968
Yeah there are things you can

633
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
Choose not

634
00:40:54,272 --> 00:41:00,160
One more click before we get to the really fun thing and it's Alex reporting on a story that is not

635
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,232
Wonder Channel

636
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,536
Ford

637
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
Over in

638
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
And that's normal

639
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
Carnival

640
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,640
Sure would be

641
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,232
That's absolutely horrible

642
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:41,632
Scotland yard's diversity unit is going to come after you if you criticize an alleged show where they put

643
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,472
10 year olds in a house to have sex

644
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:51,872
I do appreciate that that is kind of the bread-and-butter of radio though there's a little bit of like

645
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,175
Did you hear this did you hear this in the news

646
00:41:54,431 --> 00:42:00,575
I read recently don't quote me on this I read that somebody somewhere in some

647
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,159
Government said that they were going to replace the sugar in ice cream

648
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:09,023
With bird feces why did you believe this

649
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
Out of control

650
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,583
They brought him back

651
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,655
I will say though I recently went back

652
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
And I was watching

653
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
All of the egg

654
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,263
The Christie Poirot

655
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,591
And there was one where Paro and Colonel Hastings

656
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,639
Things were sitting around having a conversation

657
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,967
And Chief Inspector shop came in and he was just

658
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:34,367
Complaining, hard day of arresting people for crystallization

659
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,279
This is just

660
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,607
He's not Fred she is Belle dress

661
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,167
We get to this

662
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,495
Out of the guest

663
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,055
Naomi is really giving an interview and play

664
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,103
I wish man that be great

665
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,151
Yeah that would be great

666
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,711
It's a guy named Paul Revere

667
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
Not real name

668
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,855
Really quick

669
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:11,231
Alex Jones I'm not accepting bookings for people with aliases

670
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,303
No fear

671
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,703
Can't trust you come on man do Paul Revere more than somebody who changes

672
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,495
Is Dave de Paul Revere you're a liar

673
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,823
The pastor of sorts sure

674
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:30,943
And Alex recently heard him on another guy's show this guy named John Andre

675
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
Jose

676
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,783
A guy I think he has a voice of ministry or voice of

677
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,343
The truth is another show on Genesis what are those

678
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,391
Answer Paul Revere

679
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,439
Had some thoughts about Roman

680
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,207
What's 13

681
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,999
Now as we know Roma

682
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,815
113 is one of the things that

683
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
Christian

684
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,911
Folk like Alex are really mad about

685
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,727
Right because it's it's the scripture that

686
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
They think is

687
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,311
Going to be used by the new world order to

688
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:01,919
Convince everyone that Christians need to submit to Authority and right have you sold

689
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,735
They believe that this is a twisting of scripture on there

690
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,551
Very very upset about real mad about something in their butt

691
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
So this is what

692
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,951
Paul Revere's bread-and-butter is Alex to give an introduction

693
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
And then I have a fun

694
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,023
Story to tell you

695
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
Is

696
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,871
Minister

697
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,815
Romans 13

698
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,911
All orders of the government

699
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
Promoting

700
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
The new Bible

701
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,479
Getting off

702
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,247
About

703
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
Mister

704
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,743
Mister

705
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
About his comment

706
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,151
Put a pin in Alex's disagreement

707
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,687
About eschatology

708
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,247
Might come up later

709
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,783
I meant you know

710
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,087
You know if your book can just like

711
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
Edited

712
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,695
And then that's it

713
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,511
Then it wasn't that Holy of a book in the first place

714
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,791
You know

715
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,863
There are some

716
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,911
Arguments you can make on that front

717
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,727
I would rather focus on the fact that

718
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,751
You have

719
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,311
Priam post-trib Rapture ideas

720
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:43,711
And people who believe different things about that 10 to fight with each other real mad because Alex is not a pre-trip guy

721
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,503
You got to go through it

722
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
To do it

723
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
This

724
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,575
Might,

725
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,647
I want talk about Paul Revere okay

726
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,303
Alright here we go he was on John Anderson show talking about how

727
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:04,703
Yeah that's fine I don't care what is the scam that

728
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
Working that he doesn't bring up

729
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,775
At all on this show

730
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,103
I don't know if he thinks it's a scam I think he does not poke

731
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,991
Part of Paul Revere's philosophy is that you are a citizen of the country that you're born in

732
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,551
And when your reborn in Christ

733
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,343
You are now a citizen of Heaven

734
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:28,255
That's something I can go along with as a metaphor but I need to make it clear to you that Revere means this literally

735
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:34,143
Are you going to tell me that he is going to sell some sort of citizenship passes

736
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,727
He runs a church called the embassy of heaven and there's a reason

737
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,519
It's called the embassy he gives

738
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,287
These people pass

739
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:46,687
Exports to Heaven through his website

740
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:53,087
US Government document like a passport a driver's license to be a citizen of Heaven

741
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:57,951
Mutual Assurance which appears to be some kind of fake insurance

742
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,839
Alright also there's business licenses

743
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:08,703
It's creating an alternative government and just calling it happened

744
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,031
At least be like documents office of it yes

745
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
Appreciate that

746
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:19,967
Beyond selling fake official documents probably illegal

747
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,271
1 Civic information about the country of Heaven

748
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,551
For instance

749
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:29,951
He takes things that are mentioned in the Bible and then uses them as official symbols of the country

750
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
4 things

751
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:34,815
Okay that I'm going to ask you when you have to guess what they are okay

752
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,631
What is the national musical instrument of Heaven

753
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,215
Finish be able to get I mean

754
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,263
You know you could go with the liar

755
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
Right

756
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,591
Because it sounds too much like liar

757
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,175
I think there's probably a number of options on this could also go harp

758
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,527
That's not good

759
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:58,367
Draw people into your Embassy of Heaven everybody already thinks the harp

760
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,463
So it's a lot of trumpets in the Bible

761
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,487
What to eat

762
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
Be national animal

763
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
Of Heaven

764
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,655
No that's the national bird

765
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,495
National animal

766
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
That's enough

767
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,311
I think of you

768
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,127
Why is a bird at lion

769
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
No

770
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,759
Lamb of God

771
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,551
Breaking me shut up

772
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:33,695
Next one third Euro 42 so far

773
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,255
The national dance

774
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,815
The Lambada

775
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,423
Leaping for joy

776
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,799
Leaping for joy

777
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:52,127
The Dead Sea

778
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,735
Okay alright last one

779
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,015
Leaping for joy

780
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,855
National song of Heaven

781
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,695
What Okoye Ode to Joy

782
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,279
It'll be it'll be an interesting choice traditional

783
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,071
My Country Tis of Thee

784
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,887
Explain to me how that is

785
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,167
Possibly

786
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:20,799
First it doesn't even fit the pattern

787
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:27,199
My Country Tis of Thee America

788
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:31,039
And the dude who wrote it just stole the tune from God Save the Queen

789
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,159
Boy

790
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:40,511
This guy's got a website called the embassy of heaven and

791
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
It's

792
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
A lot

793
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,215
He has a whole section about his encounters with police

794
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,055
Is the type of

795
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:57,151
Something that you would experience a lot if this was your church

796
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:01,503
He's driving around 1 BC some cops

797
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:07,903
And so he pulls over it isn't after he'd gone to the post office cuz he had to do some official business

798
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,975
The

799
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
White guy

800
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,583
I think so I only seen a small picture of him

801
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,119
I would guess

802
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,935
So sweet

803
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,263
He goes down down the street

804
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:29,919
At the same time quit a city of Slaton police officer was traveling north on Center Street in

805
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,711
Recognize the embassy of Heaven vehicle

806
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,759
A SEPTA

807
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:38,111
After circling the block he realize that we were headed out of town toward the embassy

808
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:43,487
We were about three blocks ahead of him and he traveled at a high rate of speed to catch up with us

809
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:47,583
After leaving the city limits I turned onto the long driveway of our friends place

810
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:54,239
Quinn also entered the private property and turned on his overhead lights.

811
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
Pulled up behind us

812
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,823
I open my door and started to exit the car

813
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,639
Quinn stepped out of his car and yelled for me to remain in the car

814
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:07,295
Remain seated in the car and close the door on the radio I asked

815
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,831
How to handle the situation

816
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,855
She had no answer

817
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:14,207
We both realize that it has been five years since being stopped and I was pretty Rusty

818
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,767
Do unmarked cars arrive within bone

819
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,351
One of the persons in the first car was the chief of police

820
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:23,935
Clean approach this my side of the car and stood slightly behind me

821
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,495
He has to see my driver's license and registration

822
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,311
I asked if he was tape recording and he said he was not

823
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:34,431
Rather than answer his question I stated I am an ambassador of Jesus Christ for the kingdom of heaven

824
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:40,831
I'm using the highways in the Kingdom of Heaven in the performance of my official duties to evangelize the Kingdom of Heaven according to the Great

825
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,599
Commission

826
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,159
Alright sir I'm going to have to ask you to step out of

827
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:48,767
I declared my intent which showed I was operating under the highest Authority

828
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,839
And ignored my statement and repeated his question

829
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,887
May I see your driver's license

830
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:59,263
I want more I want more info about how he rates a chief of police stop as well

831
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:05,407
Like the chief of police is also in the call town or not actually that fair enough

832
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,455
I was not quite sure how to handle the situation

833
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,503
So I said that I needed some time to think about

834
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:13,343
Quinn said he would give me a few minutes and he returned to his car and talked with

835
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,623
The undercover people

836
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:18,207
If I was Paul Revere

837
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,815
I responded by saying yes I am Paul Revere

838
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
The moment

839
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,799
Paul Revere

840
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:37,151
Everything I've ever work for just paid off in that moment when the cop goes

841
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:43,551
Are you Paul Revere yes you better believe it's there for a third time

842
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,599
May I see your driver's license and registration

843
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:52,255
Probably a little bit slower this time I have responded I have documents at the embassy of Heaven that I also have document

844
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,095
If I give you these documents will you what will you do with them

845
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,399
I responded if if

846
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,983
It is those Church documents I will not recognize up

847
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,287
Okay well I guess that settles it

848
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:08,639
You're under arrest

849
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:17,599
Running to police

850
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,183
About this story because of the pulled over in the first place

851
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:25,535
Emily scroll down a little bit further and there's a section here and the title the section is

852
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:32,191
Heaven plates removed that's kind of what I was waiting for some sort of Heaven reason

853
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:39,103
Dude you a you lit your own lights up with handles that's not how cars work

854
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:45,503
He made his own Embassy of Heaven license plate switch is going to get you pulled over

855
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,343
I'm amazed you made it a couple years without getting pulled over

856
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,135
Yes I got it

857
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,695
Are you Paul Revere item at maybe there's like

858
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,719
Let him go

859
00:54:54,975 --> 00:55:01,119
There's absolutely there's no doubt in my mind that he gets away with that just because the more you the more you bought

860
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:06,239
Bother him the more he's going to bother you again like more proof of his own persecution complex and

861
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:12,639
I don't know what you do all of these loads are fake and made up in her only enforce baster

862
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:16,735
Upon the willingness of the law to enforce itself upon us

863
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,271
Dad

864
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,599
You could just say no to the cop I wouldn't do it

865
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,671
Well they're having conversation

866
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,695
What's 13

867
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
Everything is going good

868
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,791
And Alex believes that these are smart smart people

869
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,735
You're both very intelligent men

870
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,855
Then what we hear

871
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,231
Hell yeah

872
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
Let's think

873
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,791
I don't

874
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,607
I'm thinking about some stuff

875
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,375
Yeah are you

876
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,167
I'm thinking about

877
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,191
Alright

878
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:08,959
Secure

879
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,751
We have this guy Paul Revere

880
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:17,151
Right and he's on with John Anderson that they're clearly associates they seem to like each other he's been on Anderson's

881
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,479
Paul Revere believes

882
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,247
That

883
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,551
The United States doesn't exist

884
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,575
Or at least

885
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:31,231
He's not beholden to any of these laws cuz he's a citizen of heaven and everybody's born

886
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,047
He doesn't really care too much

887
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:34,815
About

888
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,119
America

889
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:43,007
Right brother and founding fathers Constitution

890
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,055
And maybe this comes up

891
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,431
About Roman

892
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,199

893
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,527
The king version

894
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,183
Okay here's an example

895
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,463
Alex

896
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
Served

897
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
To the point

898
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
If I ask you

899
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,399
Father Fredo

900
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,751
Jefferson Georgia

901
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,311
Archaic

902
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,335
What if I name

903
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,359
Peter

904
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,127
John

905
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
Going in

906
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,295
When we read the Bible with the freak

907
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,831
These ideas

908
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
We come up with

909
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:37,535
Yeah man your small-minded thinking about America Nonono the country was founded by the apostles

910
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,839
That is such

911
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,655
Verbs of hooking Eckhart Tolle like

912
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,447
Giving a speech

913
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,727
Let me ask you a question

914
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,007
Who are your

915
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,031
3 best

916
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,055
Businessman

917
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,127
Oh yeah I'll tell you who mine are Jesus

918
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Bryce

919
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,431
Himself

920
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,735
Okay alright bad alright okay

921
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,271
Yeah

922
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
Pretty good

923
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,319
Pretty good

924
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,647
So this is where things started to feel like

925
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,671
This could get

926
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,463
This could get messy

927
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,255
I'm not sure where this is going to go

928
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,327
Quicker than I imagined

929
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:17,471
It did get into ideas about the Rapture they are not on the same page

930
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,263
For just a moment

931
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
As far as

932
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,175
Eschatology or last night

933
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
Book of Revelation

934
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,831
The Jets be fulfilled

935
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,999
Paul Revere

936
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,655
So here's the thing to understand

937
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:49,471
This is not even an issue of post or pre-trib rapture

938
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,775
He's denying that the Rapture even happen

939
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:55,103
Because he's saying that the Book of Revelations was already fulfilled

940
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:01,503
Jesus is coming the entirety of of the

941
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,319
Is gone

942
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,855
Now we're now we're

943
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,903
We're waiting to get our passports

944
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:14,303
To get into the Coney Island of habit

945
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,215
Get a Gray's Papaya of Heaven

946
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,007
Yep

947
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,847
Alex can't handle this

948
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:31,455
The reasons that I really feel coming through strongly

949
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,735
Is that Alex

950
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,015
Needs

951
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
The devil

952
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,063
And

953
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:42,463
Yeah this will put to bed very officially whether or not Alex believes in a literal devil of 2003

954
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,999
I like it definitely does

955
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:48,095
And there is such an aversion on his part

956
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,935
To living in a world without the devil the devil

957
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:58,847
I mean once again reinforcing my belief that he is the actual Satan worship are you know based upon what he

958
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:02,943
Describe Satan worshipping people the noises they make are the noises he makes

959
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,735
Bullseye no

960
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,503
The way works

961
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:10,879
I think it's not worshipping the devil on Alex's bar

962
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,695
Just very weird somebody else's fault

963
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,399
We attract here

964
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
But

965
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,239
I heard about Roman

966
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:27,775
And

967
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,847
Grand Furniture

968
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,455
Nu Look

969
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,183
How do you say but hey

970
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,023
The government

971
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,071
Following orgasm

972
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,591
Look at that slave Bible

973
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,687
Twerking

974
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,143
BigCharts

975
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,591
My Bible says

976
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:43,295
They're not disputing that really right

977
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:47,135
There's still bad it's just bad people who doing bad things

978
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:51,743
Who are outside of this Kingdom of Heaven that exist on Earth

979
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:58,143
Like they're still like an obligation to be a good person and be opposed to bad things

980
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:02,495
Apple doesn't go away if Romans I mean yeah

981
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,311
It's interesting and then Alex is trying to twist it

982
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,359
Now to be the poster

983
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,383
Pre-trip

984
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,711
Ikea there without these churches that are saying that

985
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,527
We're at we're taking out to get that's not with these guys are

986
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,807
Trailer difference

987
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:22,463
This is the type of s*** that makes me want to like really get people to understand why Christian Nash

988
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,487
Nationalism is bad

989
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,023
You know like phone

990
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,815
You say you want a Christian Nation

991
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:32,447
But are you a futurist interpreter is do you know like what are we what are we doing here because you do

992
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:36,543
Don't f****** know what Christianity f****** is the breakdowns of like

993
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:39,615
Really really aggressive disagreements

994
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:43,455
Same thing with like alright I want

995
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:47,807
Statehood and state sovereignty

996
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:52,159
Well now I don't know if I want that

997
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,743
Oh I didn't think about how this could go wrong

998
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,791
Inconsequential

999
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,071
Yeah

1000
01:02:59,327 --> 01:02:59,839
But yeah it's

1001
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:03,167
Just I think that Alex has an idea

1002
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:06,495
Of how things operate in the way here

1003
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,567
Mythology and the cosmos to him

1004
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,103
It requires

1005
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:11,871
Cosmic

1006
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
Evil

1007
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,919
It requires

1008
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,991
The bad guys on his side not

1009
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,807
Be bad people doing bad things

1010
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:24,159
People who are parts of bad systems or neutral

1011
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:24,927
It has to be

1012
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,487
Something of this

1013
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:31,327
Mythological Good vs Evil struggle

1014
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:36,191
You can really decide that's what I feel coming through and I in his opposition

1015
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,591
Problem

1016
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,487
Because

1017
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,943
Calling Christians

1018
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,111
Because

1019
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,415
And we are

1020
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,519
I was just confusing himself

1021
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,287
Yeah

1022
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
Cuz if they're not

1023
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,359
Saying you shouldn't talk about

1024
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:50,175
Or talk out about any of those things

1025
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,479
Maybe the New World Order isn't the devil

1026
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,503
Right right

1027
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,039
I think I mean like

1028
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,575
We ghetto

1029
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,623
Deep down

1030
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,183
My fear my feeling on it is

1031
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,231
Alex finds it very very

1032
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:03,999
Comforting

1033
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,791
To think that there are people

1034
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,327
That can override

1035
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,631
You know what I'm saying so like

1036
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,655
No matter what

1037
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:15,519
At the end of the day you've got a I don't need to take responsibility for my actions card

1038
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:20,383
You know what I'm saying like that's why the Devil exist is because

1039
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,919
At the end of the day

1040
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:24,223
I am in there

1041
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:30,879
You know sway I'm just part of their little struggle or whatever it is you know sure you don't have to look at

1042
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:37,279
Myself in the mirror and say I'm responsible for every single thing I've ever done I'm in the arena but it's there

1043
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,327
Are Arena

1044
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,119
I think there's something to that

1045
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,399
And then I also think

1046
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:48,031
That because Alex is so obsessed with this idea of this tyrannical One World Government

1047
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,567
It's the entire world

1048
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,711
Alright what's above the world while it's got to be causing it

1049
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,783
What president of the world is a human

1050
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:04,415
So then there's the other aspect to that I think

1051
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,207
That is narcissism

1052
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,487
And that is

1053
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,023
Alex sees himself as such

1054
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
The Conquering Hero

1055
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:15,935
He must be up against the great evil in the entire universe

1056
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
Hubris

1057
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,775
The thinks he can actually defeat

1058
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,335
With Depo

1059
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,407
And I think it'll be unsatisfying for him to just

1060
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
Be like

1061
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:30,783
Somebody who's like okay I see a problem I'm going to work towards an actual solution to it

1062
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,831
Yeah okay yeah you

1063
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,599
Denovo

1064
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:40,255
You rebuilt someone's house after a natural disaster or something will they fight somebody

1065
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:46,655
I mean there's Livia devils

1066
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,679
22 like

1067
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,447
Sort of ba

1068
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,471
Part of working

1069
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:53,823
Towards helping and solving real issues it is gratifying to imagine

1070
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,383
Everything you do whether it is

1071
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,687
Productive or a mistake

1072
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,223
Or stupid

1073
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,759
All of those things are

1074
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:06,623
Part or you're misinterpreting a Frasier episode there is that all of that is

1075
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,647
Fighting the

1076
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,671
F****** devil

1077
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:12,255
Grandiose way to live your life

1078
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,279
And I

1079
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
Imagine

1080
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,375
Empty

1081
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:21,727
I'm with with that kind of narcissism you know if the devil is his nemesis

1082
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,519
It's not as archenemy

1083
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:29,407
You know like the arch enemy you would be fine defeating Nemesis you would feel exactly

1084
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,199
If you defeated you

1085
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:33,503
He be like grey we defeated

1086
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,551
Damn you know like we got him

1087
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:38,623
But if he defeats the Devil he's like well then who's going to push

1088
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,183
You know who's going to make me more holy

1089
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,231
That kind of feeling it does not

1090
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,839
That's not nice.

1091
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,887
And also there isn't a second

1092
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,703
Imaginary

1093
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,751
I don't know

1094
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,775
This

1095
01:07:56,031 --> 01:08:02,175
This aspect will come up more later this absence of the devil in their world you and how's this is like

1096
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,711
Incompatible

1097
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,479
But

1098
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,783
The not liking America thing

1099
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,063
Is

1100
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,087
Great

1101
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,391
This is so fun here we go

1102
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,183
Where do you stand man

1103
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
Because

1104
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,679
Well it's real simple

1105
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,447
Alex

1106
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,727
If you take a look

1107
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:27,775
Jesus

1108
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,567
Ritchie producer

1109
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,615
Bad seed

1110
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,407
I don't like

1111
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,199
Bad bad cannot

1112
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
Produce

1113
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,015
Good

1114
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,295
Gregor Mendel with music

1115
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
What did

1116
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,135
Stage the people

1117
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:46,975
Fathers of the

1118
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,511
America

1119
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,071
Where did these people

1120
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,423
Majority of them were.

1121
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:04,127
14

1122
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:09,247
Can I come from Pat

1123
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,783
And he elaborates on that here

1124
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,599
They came from England

1125
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,415
The teenager who had grown up in

1126
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,439
I want

1127
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,207
Piece of the action

1128
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,255
I don't want the mother

1129
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,303
Country rulers we want to rule ourselves

1130
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,095
That's really work

1131
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
Came from

1132
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,191
Eating their own skin

1133
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,239
They were fighting

1134
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,567
But they wanted they wanted to be a teenager that grow up

1135
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,103
Did it come out

1136
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
Come out of

1137
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,431
The kingdom of God

1138
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,479
Possibly have

1139
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,271
It came out of

1140
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
The world

1141
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,831
And they even in their own declaration

1142
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
Declared

1143
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,135
We take equals

1144
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,927
Powers of the Earth

1145
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,167
How we don't know that

1146
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,447
Come on

1147
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,615
Paul Revere

1148
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,895
You're even nine.

1149
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,455
Wouldn't

1150
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,295
We wouldn't exist

1151
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,279
They did it

1152
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
He did

1153
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,327
In fact at one point

1154
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,351
Candidate even made

1155
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119
Man

1156
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,935
Troy the whole world

1157
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:35,263
Ghetto Barbie worshiping that guy

1158
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,567
Real quick real quick

1159
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:42,687
You said your God was like all I should have killed everybody I don't want to work with that guy

1160
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:49,087
Wow I mean he does make a good point to Alex's you know it's over bottle

1161
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:53,439
Yeah apparently too obviously

1162
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:57,279
If you could understand anything about what these people actually believe

1163
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,815
You would know that they

1164
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,863
Can't possibly be in favor

1165
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,911
Of the United States

1166
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,703
The founding document

1167
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,983
The founding fathers

1168
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,799
All of that stuff

1169
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,847
Here's what's interesting about this

1170
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,407
A lot of the beliefs that you have

1171
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,943
Could still overlap

1172
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,783
According to Alex so many of these things that are in the Constitution

1173
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:21,087
The tution are actually god-given right

1174
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:26,719
That's so they preclude or are they predict the brat the Constitution

1175
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,767
Those are things that the government cannot

1176
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,839
Do to you as opposed to write that they give you

1177
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,887
So coincidentally

1178
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:37,471
He believes by Paul Revere and John Anderson both are like

1179
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,007
Everybody should have all the guns

1180
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:43,615
They could still believe that with or without a belief in the Constitution

1181
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,383
Rye Rye

1182
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,151
But

1183
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,711
I don't think Alex would ever let the conversation get there

1184
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
Because

1185
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,783
It's so much

1186
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,831
He means the Constitution

1187
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,623
In the same way that he needs the devil

1188
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,183
Memes that in order to

1189
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,999
Have his god-given right or whatever

1190
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,791
He doesn't actually care about the cons

1191
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,327
Institutional cares about that

1192
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:09,727
D of the Constitution that he's created like he doesn't like all of the Constitution and if he answers

1193
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,775
Scratch him out of a couple of

1194
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:15,871
It is if stupid stupid conversation whenever he's like

1195
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,663
The Constitution is inviolate

1196
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:24,063
I mean I would get rid of this amendment I would get rid of this part I don't want to deal with this freedom of religion get that out of here also

1197
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:30,463
Outlaw the Democratic party you and okay so why are you arguing with him about whether or not the founding fathers were

1198
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:36,351
Hundred percent right about everything cuz he's doing

1199
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,679
Do so stupid so look there's no devil

1200
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,447
But

1201
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:47,359
What do you mean do you know that

1202
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,759
Okay there's no devil

1203
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,551
Why do people worship the

1204
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,399
That is according to

1205
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,935
Scripture.

1206
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,055
Why did the world leaders

1207
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,735
I want to talk about

1208
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,759
5 years of my life

1209
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,063
Nonsense

1210
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,855
I came but the truth

1211
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,415
Chrysler January 9th

1212
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,439
70 nights

1213
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
Alex

1214
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,327
Spectre Channel

1215
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,887
People have a lot of

1216
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:47,007
I found myself in a very bizarre position where

1217
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,799
I am laughing my ass off

1218
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:54,687
Paul Revere believing that he's a citizen of the kingdom of heaven and laws don't apply

1219
01:13:54,943 --> 01:14:01,087
But he and John Anderson make a lot more sense than Alex in this interview I know I really

1220
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:07,487
Do I really do want to fight him I really do want to throw a rock out face while so people talk to him

1221
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,511
Hey listen

1222
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,583
I've seen people do all kinds of weird s*** like fruits

1223
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:14,143
One time I got pulled over by a cop

1224
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:20,287
Cuz I believe it's some weird stuff I started talking to him to be fair this is John talking

1225
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,311
Anyways

1226
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,591
Vivi

1227
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,615
The question

1228
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:27,967
If the devil doesn't exist why do people worship Him and the interbeing

1229
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,759
People do a lot of weird s***

1230
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:33,599
Is like well I don't have a rebuttal to that that is true

1231
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,671
You do a lot of weird s*** God dammit

1232
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:40,511
I'm pretty sure that if I knew more about

1233
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:46,911
Either Paul Revere or John Anderson would not think they come off as rational at all and obviously

1234
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:50,239
Even just from this website I don't think Paul's got a good head on his shoulders

1235
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,007
B

1236
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:56,127
Alex cannot handle very basic things with John Anderson is throwing at him

1237
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,407
Yeah it's

1238
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,943
Pretty not good

1239
01:14:59,455 --> 01:14:59,967
But

1240
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,991
John

1241
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,783
That he used to be involved in the occult

1242
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:07,135
And this is going to be good way for Alex to try and be like maybe you are the Dead

1243
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,303
Oh no they can't bond over his previous being in the occult

1244
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:18,911
Maybe is just like her back right now

1245
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,239
Are you into

1246
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,287
Involved in love

1247
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,615
Call Linda

1248
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,407
We believe the base

1249
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,943
Ecclesia

1250
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,479
The great white Brotherhood

1251
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,759
What

1252
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,111
Predictions

1253
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,767
Georgia

1254
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,631
Call a lucky guesser

1255
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:56,287
Damn

1256
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,823
Damn

1257
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:01,151
Alexina understand that the point of this story is

1258
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:04,223
I no longer believe I was psychic

1259
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:09,599
Alex you realize the point of this story is that I am telling you I am not actually psychic

1260
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:16,255
I do not have the powers of a psychic I believe that back then

1261
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,279
Didn't do it

1262
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,071
The thing I said I died

1263
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,863
Didn't I wasn't a psychic

1264
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,399
So

1265
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
Again

1266
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:29,823
That's delightful Alex who lies about his predictions

1267
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:36,223
Order to appear prophetic in driveways right I didn't look into this so I don't know John Anderson actually did make his money

1268
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,271
He did

1269
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,319
She's disowning it as

1270
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,343
Some kind of a

1271
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:44,671
Like feet of His Brilliant oh yeah as a lucky guess

1272
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,719
Kind of like

1273
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:51,071
It's refreshing supposition to Alex

1274
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,887
Although I'm sure John Anderson is

1275
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,167
Play Wildwood

1276
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,959
No Doubt

1277
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,007
Hades it is fantastic

1278
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,823
Did you tell Larry Flynt

1279
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,615
What's going on here

1280
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:06,175
I don't know what I don't know what time

1281
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,991
It does feel like maybe we're in different

1282
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:14,367
Like spots of the like on about your predictions like he's like

1283
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,927
I do know that was my old Griff

1284
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:23,071
Like maybe Alex we see him in 10 years on somebody else's show like Adam prediction anymore

1285
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:26,143
I used to lie about you know like where are we in this grip

1286
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:32,031
This guy probably isn't saying that it was a lie that it was some kind of a psychic prediction MIDI

1287
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,079
Felt like it to him then

1288
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,871
But he got lucky really

1289
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:36,895
If you think

1290
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:44,831
I would see it that way disowning necessarily the fact that he did say this and it

1291
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,599
It came true

1292
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:48,415
Just if there's any meaning to it

1293
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,207
No Lie

1294
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,487
No

1295
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,511
I mean

1296
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,791
Did he get paid for it

1297
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:57,119
Who made the national news

1298
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,655
So look

1299
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:01,215
There's another problem that Alex has was that all right

1300
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:01,983
Fine

1301
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,775
Is this all happened in the past

1302
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:07,359
Why isn't the devil in a cage

1303
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,407
Troydan

1304
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:10,943
He would do

1305
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,319
He overcame

1306
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,511
Okay first of all your daughter revelation

1307
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,791
20 and your

1308
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
Taking the

1309
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,119
199

1310
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:29,887
+ 1

1311
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,519
Circles

1312
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:48,319
It's almost like we're both walking in mud

1313
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:51,135
Going on that you're arguing about imaginary dog sheds

1314
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,415
That is very silly

1315
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:58,815
Are we just keep going back and forth cuz there's no way to settle this argument based upon made-up nonsense from thousands of years

1316
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,959
I would I would say I don't want to believe it either of these people's ideas

1317
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,495
Sad

1318
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:11,615
Forced to choose between the two and we grade on a curve because this is Alice

1319
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:18,015
You know Alex you know all the s*** that he believes

1320
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:20,063
Good person comes off looking pretty good just

1321
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,599
Based on not being the

1322
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:27,999
A wild liar on the lake in his passports idea

1323
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:32,607
Ringo also somewhere

1324
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,911
All things

1325
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,935
Being equal

1326
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:38,751
I'll take a world where there isn't it

1327
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,287
The devil running

1328
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,335
As opposed to one where there is

1329
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:46,943
Answer already John's idea in his world is far more appealing

1330
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:52,319
It seems bizarre to wants to hold onto the idea that there is a devil

1331
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,623
Yeah but unless you need it

1332
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:58,207
It does it does seem like something he needs

1333
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:01,279
That he absolutely could never be able to

1334
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,303
To process

1335
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:05,375
And I can understand a like he can't understand

1336
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,655
No I don't want

1337
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,447
The Devil Inside know you do

1338
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,983
You do

1339
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,775
But you can't process

1340
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,848
But you just can't understand it

1341
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,152
Deal with the idea that they're the devil's dead

1342
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,968
Zuckerberg

1343
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,552
It's not what I'm

1344
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,832
Scriptures

1345
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,112
Teaches the problem is

1346
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
Really good

1347
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,952
Christians don't have a clue

1348
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,280
Okay

1349
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,560
Hebrews 2:14

1350
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:37,120
Portsmouth Spanish the children are protected

1351
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,400
Play Sheboygan

1352
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,680
For Christ

1353
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,264
Destroy him that had the power of death

1354
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,312
Did he

1355
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,384
Walkabout

1356
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:02,976
Is this an immigration hearing for the heaven country what's happening

1357
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:09,888
Before the courts of Heaven before the courts of Heaven shows

1358
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:16,288
Yeah I wonder if they're integrated those courts are part of the empathy of had a right

1359
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,824
Notarized

1360
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,640
All of the documentation to get into heaven

1361
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:22,688
These are not notarized on argument

1362
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,016
There have to be a notary

1363
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:30,112
Not public Define notary Devine

1364
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,416
Why do I know which is third search

1365
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,976
Is great

1366
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,536
Alex has no rebuttal to this because it is

1367
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,304
Okay

1368
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:44,448
Scripture tells us

1369
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,472
Did you fail

1370
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,752
Right

1371
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:53,408
He's he's introduced the thing into a religious argument that you just can't

1372
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:59,808
Can't do which is a yes or no question about Uptown question cannot happen in a religious argument

1373
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:02,368
You answer yet

1374
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:06,976
Screwed your position and answers

1375
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,840
The only way to answer that question is to not answer the

1376
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,448
But it's bizarre that I mean like at this point in his career

1377
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,728
It's so weird that I like

1378
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:18,496
Looks just like

1379
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:19,520
Does this

1380
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,544
Yeah like

1381
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,592
He doesn't hang up on them he doesn't

1382
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,896
End the interview he just gets kind of

1383
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:27,200
Petty and childlike a little like

1384
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,248
I don't know yeah

1385
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,040
The lawyer trick

1386
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
Or something

1387
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,576
And I think

1388
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,368
There is a desire

1389
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:37,184
That he has to be seen as strong

1390
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,720
In these settings

1391
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,744
To his listeners

1392
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,536
This looks very weak

1393
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:45,632
Right he doesn't come off like somebody who can defend his position

1394
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,400
Yeah

1395
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:52,800
He reminds me I mean this is fairly early on liking this reminds me a little bit of those early debate Bros

1396
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,080
Online

1397
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:59,200
The twitch platforms or whatever the the debate brothers who would go in there with a

1398
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:02,784
Freshman-level philosophy

1399
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,552
Audit

1400
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,856
To their name and and like

1401
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:09,696
Just try and argue with people about religion for a while and it didn't matter if they're

1402
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,744
Obviously stupid argue

1403
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,024
It's look stupid they just

1404
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,840
Clowned on them or

1405
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:22,240
The stand-ups who were like pretty early on wanting to tangle with hecklers or something you know like man

1406
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,800
There is a there's a desire to like

1407
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,824
Appear

1408
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:28,384
Above or like having like

1409
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,920
Like stood up

1410
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:34,272
2 something medium destroys Heckler like

1411
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,576
In order to

1412
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:40,160
Counter the things that this guy believes

1413
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,976
You need to personal understand what he believes

1414
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:47,840
And then second you're going to need to unpack this entire idea of Heaven being the country

1415
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,120
And you don't want to do that

1416
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:51,680
No cuz it's way too complicated

1417
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:54,752
Your audience is going to you're going to lose some of them

1418
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,312
You're going to reveal the

1419
01:23:57,568 --> 01:24:00,896
Those are the sorts of people you're going to take seriously on your show

1420
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,432
And that kind of

1421
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,712
I don't know

1422
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,272
Demand the entire show

1423
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:12,928
Yeah and I think if you're interviewing and taking seriously a guy who calls himself Paul Revere

1424
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:18,048
Embassy of heaven and sells fraudulent documents to people like passports

1425
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,584
You kind of

1426
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:25,984
Take yourself that seriously and you would need to reveal that in order to actually have the Conn

1427
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,032
Conversation that Alex is wanting to have

1428
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,312
And

1429
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:34,688
Yeah you just stuck in the end because of that you just has John Anderson ask him these

1430
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,736
Crap questions

1431
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:44,928
That's why I that's why I later on he's like I'm not doing that anymore I will hang up

1432
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,720
Are you if you challenge me

1433
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:50,560
So weirdly later on as the Tea Party grew

1434
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,864
Revere would come back up

1435
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:55,424
As somebody who

1436
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,960
Work for FEMA

1437
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:00,288
Paul Revere works for FEMA he was he was like

1438
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,848
The pastor that was recruited by FEMA

1439
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:06,944
In order to get them to preach Romans 13 how am I going to everybody

1440
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,296
Mysteriously isn't in his backstory here I would have to assume based on

1441
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,600
His lack of

1442
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,624
Any

1443
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,904
Documents

1444
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,208
Clearly Froedtert

1445
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,232
I don't think

1446
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,256
FEMA's going to be

1447
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,816
It recruiting him into any

1448
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:29,216
Kind of Pastor initiative I'm interested to know about a conversation that happened what meeting room did it have

1449
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,496
Happen where they're like man

1450
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:36,640
We cannot find anybody to preach the correct interpretation of Romans 13 and our Felix

1451
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,944
Nobody will do it

1452
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,992
There's nobody that we can get

1453
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,528
To preach

1454
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:48,928
Romans 13 as a means of submitting to the FEMA camp

1455
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:55,072
A guy who's made his entire career preaching the opposite of it and selling people fake passports

1456
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:55,840
Yep

1457
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,632
Yep yep

1458
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:00,960
One passport if you want to enter my land

1459
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:03,520

1464
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:31,168
Big news so we have all those stories that Alex didn't cover price

1465
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,960
I want to talk about Arnold's

1466
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:39,360
How do you spends like over an hour talking with these dudes because the real big news apparently is that Romans

1467
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,640
13 is been twisted

1468
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,408
Yeah

1469
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,944
What that is

1470
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:47,296
That is a curveball it is but there's one thing that's important to remember that

1471
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,368
You're not

1472
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:01,376
This is not a religious show is not a religious show

1473
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:07,008
Over an hour talking to a weirdo Pastor who calls himself Paul Revere bleezy

1474
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,544
Head of the embassy of Heaven

1475
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,568
Yeah

1476
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,384
But it's not a religion

1477
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,664
Touches on religious

1478
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,432
Topix

1479
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,712
Okay from

1480
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,736
Time to time

1481
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:20,320
Has transformed the mythology of

1482
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:25,440
The United States into its own smaller version of Christianity itself

1483
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:28,512
That's making my belief in the country of religion

1484
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:31,584
Along with my belief in this state is a religion

1485
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,216
Along with my believe in this house being really like he's a religious man

1486
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:40,032
This this is not a religious show

1487
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,592
All right we will spend

1488
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:48,992
Over an hour discussing religious stuff for me to cling to my belief in the devil

1489
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,344
And then

1490
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,136
Here's what you don't understand

1491
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,416
This affects

1492
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:01,536
It it made me laugh

1493
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,840

1494
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,608

1495
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:10,752

1496
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,032

1497

01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:31,744
Do you know

1501
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,536
Thinking that he's onto something

1502
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:39,680
Remember that his career is meaningless

1503
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:44,544
Lake Jordan will be back probably check back in on the present day on Monday

1504
