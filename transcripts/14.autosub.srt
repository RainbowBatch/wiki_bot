1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,936
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,984
Everybody welcome

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,800
Then we need to work out a new introduction

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,128
The point of the matter is that I watch too much Infowars

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,408
And I like to sit down

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,432
Describe it to you

8
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,456
Jordan

9
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:26,112
Wait did I redo that I don't know later. Can I just say I'm Jordan 3 times in a row

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,976
Beetlejuice

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,168
Boone's Farm

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:43,264
Strawberry Hill.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,104
Cover we need to get into the right heads

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,480
Space of what's going on here

15
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,528
Amazing Lisa

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:02,720
Firefighter but quicker

17
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes

18
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,304
In the last week

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,864
I always had recorded

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,240
Donald Trump has given a incredibly unhinged press conference

21
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,080
He went to Florida to have a campaign rally a month to his present

22
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,480
No off the chain

23
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:29,088
I can't do it come out and give a little bit of an introduction

24
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,720
Candle in the Wind started playing

25
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,144
I don't know is he going to kill princess

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,544
Princess Diana still alive and take him out

27
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,592
I was like why the f***

28
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
You playing Candle in the Wind

29
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
But then I started to listen to the lyrics

30
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,224
And they talked about how evil the Press is

31
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,344
All the papers was founded

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,416
There's a couple lines in the song that are about how depressed

33
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,976
Makeup forced Marilyn Monroe

34
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,792
To change into Marilyn Monroe from Norma Jean

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,352
Stretch

36
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
Stretch

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
If you're listening

38
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,216
Yeah we got some stuff to talk about

39
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,872
About the alignment know that you're the one

40
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,664
Fallout 4

41
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
So then

42
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,992
He's the camera pans over

43
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
And it's to the open

44
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
End of the hanger

45
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
Cuz there's a bunch of people in the hangar

46
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,672
And I'm sitting there like there's no f****** way he

47
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:42,560
He's going to taxi in on a plane

48
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,936
Just pathetic thing he won't do there was like the the stair car

49
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
Was there

50
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:54,592
He's got to come in on a plane

51
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
F****** Christ

52
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
F****** ever

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
I mean that he gets off the plane comes down and gives

54
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
Absurd speech

55
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
Let's a fan

56
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Come out of the crowd

57
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
Speak to the audience

58
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
Just some guy

59
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,768
On Fox News being interviewed by recognize come on up here

60
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,328
What

61
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,144
But we know our people know

62
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
Why do we even do this I don't know why are we even American anymore

63
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
Everyone everyone

64
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
Go

65
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
Go now

66
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
So there are other place

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,944
To be this place needs

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
To be abandoned places for loans

69
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
We need to build biodome

70
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
In the rainforest

71
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
There is no other solution

72
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,536
Cuz Breakaway civilization under goddamn ground

73
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,120
Nuclear weapons the whole f****** world are advocating

74
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,704
Underground military bases

75
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,056
Yes

76
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,152
We all know trumps cut up the greatest

77
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
Yeah

78
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
The guy

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,928
Funniest f****** thing why don't we get to enjoy it

80
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
Funniest fuzzy

81
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
I've ever lived

82
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,351
Through it all

83
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,423
So hilarious

84
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
There's nothing

85
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,775
There's no way any writer would be allowed to get away

86
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
With writing the story

87
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,871
Outside

88
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:37,503
Do you need to punch out

89
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
People react

90
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,343
So the gives his speech

91
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,183
I meant the Applause it all comes at very predictable time

92
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
Quite frankly I don't think I heard any lock her up or anything like that so maybe we're moving on from that

93
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
Hillary for prison signs

94
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
Still

95
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
Really horrifying

96
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,311
I don't like we're taking this much time to talk about non Alex stuff

97
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,895
There was a bunch of people with blackspur trump2020

98
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
Signs

99
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
Behind him there like seven people

100
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
2020

101
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Is a campaign

102
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,415
The rally in Florida with a campaign if it's 2017

103
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
He's campaigning 3 years in advance

104
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
For the next for his re-election

105
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
This is

106
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
That makes me

107
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,423
Yeah we plan

108
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,335
Along with everyone else has blacks for Trump

109
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:40,735
Everyone else in the audience along with them people who are behind Trump all stand in unison

110
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Handclap

111
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,111
Straight

112
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
Grbl desk

113
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
It's implan

114
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
There was a lady with us Veterans for Trump sign

115
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,887
And one guy in military fatigues

116
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
Behind him

117
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
And at one point

118
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
Who here veterans

119
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
And what he says that

120
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
The lady with a Veterans for Trump sign

121
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
Sit down and hides her sign

122
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
I'm a guy and

123
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
Doesn't even

124
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
That would be your f****** time

125
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,367
That would be

126
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:24,511
And forgot that you supposed to be military guy stuff

127
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
And I got to be honest

128
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
This is wearing on me

129
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
Yeah it's getting to the point where I

130
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
Starting

131
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,983
I'm not starting to go crazy or anything like that

132
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
Starting to hurt

133
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,847
Oh no I'm not saying this for pity

134
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
To take credit for

135
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
Martyr for the cause

136
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
No I'm I'm sitting at most part our Jesus

137
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,855
Get myself off the hook a little bit

138
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
Because

139
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
I've been listening to a bunch of

140
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Is s***

141
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
And then

142
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,023
During the rally

143
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
When I was watching it I started

144
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
The drink

145
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
That is what you should have

146
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,215
Yeah but it got me

147
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
And I started drink

148
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,591
Sommore and by the time it was over I realized oh f*** I've got to get

149
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,383
Clips for our next episode

150
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,455
So I isolated all of these clips drunk

151
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,575
I don't remember what some of them are

152
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,415
Yeah this is our next grab bag

153
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:29,279
But I do know that it's from February 27th

154
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,887
17th Friday episode

155
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Respond

156
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Two trucks

157
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
Prescott

158
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,287
So we get to get to into that a little bit

159
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
And then I have a little bit of

160
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
Double bonus clip

161
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,015
From an episode that he put out only on the internet

162
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
Does unfiltered on the internet

163
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
He

164
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Put out an

165
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
H clip

166
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
That might be the most

167
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,975
Boring and stupid thing I've ever seen in my life

168
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,119
No maybe we should just start with that looks with the bonus

169
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,727
It is actually

170
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:14,079
Introduction

171
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
To the show that he did

172
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
For the internet

173
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,967
This is interesting this is like dessert for dinner

174
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,063
We're having a bonus ahead of the actual episode

175
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
So here's a introduction

176
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:31,231
Central Standard Time

177
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
That I've never succeeded in

178
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
A big frustration I

179
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,447
This morning today during breaks probably

180
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
300 articles

181
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,663
There were a couple others I couldn't even look at I watched all these video Clemson

182
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
Complaining

183
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,087
So this may be a train wreck it may be good at may be bad

184
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,023
Their system of like being on the Shadows running everything is coming down

185
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,071
Does that mean

186
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
No no the fight has just begun but

187
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,239
So this point are you getting any sense

188
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,311
Of what he has tried in the past to do but failed

189
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
No

190
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
Make a woman come

191
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,023
No you don't, 43rd

192
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
I've learned.

193
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
Is a good 500

194
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
Where

195
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
He hasn't all-in-one are they stacked

196
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:52,127
He has them all on the desk and tabs open on his Chrome do you have them all

197
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,735
And they are printed out articles I don't know

198
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
But I will tell you this

199
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
500 articles

200
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Way too much

201
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Ever cover

202
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,207
Of the substance of it

203
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,047
Do you know how much a ream of paper weigh

204
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
I do

205
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,655
Because I used to work at the Office Depot

206
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
200

207
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Okay

208
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,775
Now put two of those on top of each other

209
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
Cut Alex Jones

210
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:27,967
Alakazam that's how many Alex Jones is red

211
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
1/2

212
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,319
Spoiler alert

213
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,415
Boring stupid f****** show I've ever sat

214
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
She has all these articles and

215
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,559
Does he ever reveal what he's not done

216
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Successful in the past

217
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
Getting into the weeds

218
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,935
Getting through all the article I think is what he was saying

219
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,519
Oh cuz he always interrupts himself or go.

220
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
So he tries to just read off the headlines of all of these articles

221
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:03,295
I didn't count okay well let's listen to all of it is what he is not telling you

222
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,135
All of them are infowars.com articles

223
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,863
Not all of them but I would say 85 to 90% are Infowars or Prison Planet

224
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
F****** Synergy is what that

225
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,591
A little dried multi-level marketing

226
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
Fascinating

227
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Economics

228
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,951
Hey man you did read it

229
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,279
Define the word Mercantile

230
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
I always thought I had something to do with

231
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Clothing

232
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,495
Natalie clothing

233
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
Yeah

234
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
You know it's the big one

235
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,271
You know the East India

236
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Alright this is going to be a badass

237
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,159
Medline

238
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
I'm supposed to pick the kids up about an hour and a half so

239
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,399
I said it'd be a two-hour I guess I better just shut up and actually just online

240
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,495
And then not comment on because I always comment whenever he's been story

241
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543
But just imagine

242
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,199
At night in the morning

243
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
What

244
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,319
Headlines of Articles account

245
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
It's gives you what news he wants you to hear without knowing what the actual story is

246
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,863
You think it's an accomplishment to read the headlines of apparently

247
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,519
Especially not on Diane headline

248
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
That's like reading that's literally like reading a library but only reading the names of all the

249
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,343
Book by its cover

250
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
We all have

251
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,607
Because it's like no wonder Gardens

252
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,495
Political leaders create

253
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
Comparing that to

254
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
Other people

255
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,855
I don't think anybody

256
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:57,375
My person I know recess

257
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:14,527
My window is open then versus than Alex

258
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Reeds

259
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
More news

260
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,927
Is metallic K on this planet

261
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,511
Aside from maybe Ron Paul or Donald Trump

262
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
He can't read

263
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,191
Everybody shut up but you're not real

264
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Just cable news

265
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
He is

266
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
On the way here

267
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
I don't

268
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,711
So I don't use this

269
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
I think

270
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:51,391
Guys this is a really big here

271
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Inoffensive words

272
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
But I do believe

273
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Is it Donald Trump

274
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Look in the delayed

275
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
I think I think

276
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
He was

277
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
He's with trap

278
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
12 year old child

279
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
12 year old child

280
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
You have millions and millions

281
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
That's all he's done he is

282
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,199
Retarded has not know anything more than what a seventh grader

283
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:20,575
It appears that he's least not very capable of abstract thought

284
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
Yeah

285
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
It sucks to say that it

286
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,207
I don't see that is like

287
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
He's an idiot

288
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,655
In the way that we were all bummed out whenever the

289
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
The Twin Towers

290
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,751
31

291
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
Twin Towers falling

292
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
Yeah

293
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
Driving up his goddamn rent

294
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:51,551
My building is the tallest in the door

295
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Anyway

296
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
Can't we just can't get rid of it

297
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Let's build

298
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Fake White House

299
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
He already had

300
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,655
Now

301
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
Rebuild Big White House

302
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
We build

303
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
We put all of this

304
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
People in there

305
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,895
Truman Show let's turn it into a reality show

306
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,943
Government

307
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
People who are a bunch of nerds

308
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
Give us a nerd

309
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
We'll just watch him

310
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Hilarious if you

311
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
You didn't have an impact

312
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
Sonic

313
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,799
His first article is about

314
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Trump's line

315
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
Is doing well

316
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
Despite the backlash

317
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
Despite the other protests

318
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,479
Greg who cares

319
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,527
Wonderful f****** Wonder

320
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
His argument is that everyone hates

321
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,135
The globalist so much that they try and boycott her products

322
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
The only answer

323
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
Bit of news lady gets to this

324
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
A little bit later

325
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:11,167
2018 Michigan

326
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Set up the show on Monday

327
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,103
Michigan

328
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,431
He reads the headline wrong

329
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
He said

330
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
The Event Center

331
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Run

332
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,879
Newton wants to run

333
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
The guy who is notorious

334
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,231
For saying the n-word all the time

335
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
The guy who

336
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
Often

337
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
Goes on stage

338
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
With guns

339
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,167
And it's like suck my gun

340
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,471
F*** it

341
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
I don't care

342
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
Let's put all of the

343
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:57,503
And I mean the band

344
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
Are House of Representatives

345
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
Just be

346
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,647
Faded 80s on surround 2

347
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,463
Those guys are both Detroit guys

348
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,327
Frederick's death run in Florida I think

349
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,191
Yeah we welcome you into the Senate With Arms Wide Open

350
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,847
So I mean that's problematic as hell

351
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
Eclipse with him just reading headlines

352
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
It's cuz it's boring

353
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,223
Yeah it's super boring

354
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,063
I'm reading headlines if you wanted to show I just wanted to show you and I

355
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
But he's in the weed

356
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
That's like him being like

357
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Hey guys

358
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
I'm going to show you this video of me brushing

359
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:45,375
I've never been able to do it for you

360
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,519
Clip where he actually literally with the Russian ships

361
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Off the course

362
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
Of the coast

363
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Which is

364
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Yeah

365
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,407
What's 5

366
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,223
Within the span of about a minute

367
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,503
He literally contradicted

368
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,855
Realize he's doing it which is gorgeous

369
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
Also just to stop by really quick that is

370
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:15,839
Search

371
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
I miss representation

372
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:26,079
Yeah

373
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,151
Company conference we found out that

374
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,711
Just learned what mutually assured

375
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Distraction beads

376
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:40,415
Learn to act like none other uranium is you

377
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
Used for bad stuff

378
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,839
Miles Austin

379
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,191
Like 57

380
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,495
There's a hundred ships

381
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,503
That's how this works we should deescalate

382
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,511
East Coast the X

383
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:25,471
Callers calling up

384
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,311
What's going on before you try to run the world

385
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
So from this first part of the clip

386
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Right

387
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
He's talking about

388
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
Signal ships that can relay

389
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:41,855
Messages

390
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,415
Yes now what

391
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,487
This is the next headline

392
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Okay

393
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,607
Russian spy ship

394
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
No kidding

395
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,751
East Coast

396
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
Horrible

397
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,407
Bethel literal contradiction of the words that just came out of his mouth

398
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:10,015
He's talking about how these ships are there and they can signal

399
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,831
Also existing submarine

400
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:18,208
That will destroy the East Coast the next story is there's only one and it's not a threat

401
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
Threat

402
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,936
Legitimate dissonance is actually Alex Jones middle name

403
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:33,312
He's got to respond to that

404
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
This snow

405
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
A long-term memory

406
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,432
Now if I

407
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
If I think

408
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Give him as a key

409
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Little puppy

410
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
So much better

411
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,464
Yeah I mean it's an annoying puppy but he's so cute he looks like a Shar-Pei

412
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,096
All over the place logo

413
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,728
Possibly could use it absolutely we always love

414
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Really awesome

415
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
Anna Elsa

416
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,176
Seeing these numbers grow

417
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,528
It's heartening much like Obama's seeing protest

418
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,392
Tell your friends

419
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,928
60 degrees

420
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:26,048
In February in Chicago normal thing that happened

421
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,888
It makes me a blizzard in May last year

422
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,728
So cool I love I love unpredictable weather

423
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
I like how I took

424
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,848
Sick from my window I'm a horse f*** in like 2 weeks

425
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,992
To get to the actual Friday show put out on Friday

426
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
You want to go watch it

427
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
Highly don't recommend

428
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,880
Him trying to read headlines

429
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,440
Just f****** it up

430
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,488
Just completely f****** it up

431
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Did not ask

432
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Has he mentioned

433
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
I don't know

434
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Friday's

435
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,312
By Evan about what

436
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,128
About the media

437
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
It is

438
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,968
Not interference

439
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
Deception of

440
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,560
I thought of this morning and I'm sure because it's such an obvious

441
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,864
It is well

442
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,424
It just hit me up

443
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Can we pull that tweet up

444
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,872
Show me some perfect

445
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,688
And fourth on new Independent Media

446
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
Journalist investigative journalist

447
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,320
Just somebody to videotape something

448
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
News

449
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:02,816
The government is fake

450
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,120
I know you could accuse that of being fake news

451
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,680
Like video of Cop

452
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:14,080
There's no there's no reality we are all living in

453
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:18,176
It's Fantastical dream world

454
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
This is such a

455
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Cure

456
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
Pure

457
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:26,880
Insanity it's one of those things were like I've been starting to wrestle with it I don't really know if there's any way home

458
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
I don't know

459
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928
I don't think we can

460
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,536
Can click are glass slippers together and wish ourselves

461
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
Even even if

462
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,120
UNLV ends up getting impeached and we

463
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:41,728
Trying to right the ship I think the damage is done

464
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,032
All of all of the rules

465
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
He broke

466
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
Are forever broke

467
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:51,456
There's a template for breaking the rules America

468
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
Is nothing

469
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
02

470
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,368
Destroying

471
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
You can't just break rules with

472
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
Impunity and no one's going

473
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
Stop you

474
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
Tax return

475
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
Yep you're right

476
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:12,704
You're yelling

477
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,264
Still we're still we're still waiting

478
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
He's already

479
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,456
He's already present

480
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
He can release them

481
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:29,600
He's already has a thing as an advisor who committed

482
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
Light

483
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,464
Light treason

484
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
He can just

485
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
And you can just do it

486
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,376
I just want now I just want to know how

487
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
Fuct we are

488
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:49,312
Don't know how deep it goes but it's probably like Olympics

489
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,128
It's high dive deep

490
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,712
Dildo up his ass

491
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,272
That's all.

492
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,600
Did a write off

493
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,416
So do I use the term that he came up with

494
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
He's really f****** proud that it came up

495
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,288
And so it's the fake stream

496
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Nail there

497
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
Searching

498
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,456
Searching and searching and

499
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Search

500
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:32,576
I agree with him puns are hard

501
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
Getaround I'll be like

502
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,928
How do I how do I play with words

503
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,512
I'm sorry hard

504
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
Oh man

505
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
I like fake news

506
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,632
And I know there's a mainstream media

507
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
Let's go with

508
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,776
Fake Media news stream

509
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
So close

510
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
Jalisco

511
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Let's go with

512
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152
False media

513
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,200
Mediastream

514
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:04,320
Let's go

515
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,136
Lies on lies on balls on my face

516
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:12,512
Alright maybe it is pathetic

517
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,840
Cupid looking and looking

518
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Proud of him

519
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
Yeah

520
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,728
Guys he puts on his like scream that's behind him between

521
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:27,616
Look at the corner pliers

522
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,712
But he's a Greek he's the new Michelangelo

523
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
The walls of the

524
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,552
The Sistine Chapel

525
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,112
Disturbed live on when I'm dead

526
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
This will be my great work

527
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,304
Twitter malveira censoring Trump

528
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
Find what he says

529
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,352
Cease on Twitter

530
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
It's all

531
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
Trump

532
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:56,032
I don't know if

533
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,592
Twitter is

534
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
Juking their algorithm

535
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,176
So whenever you look at

536
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
All the responses

537
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
UCR negative

538
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,648
Alex is theory

539
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:15,488
Is the Twitter is doing this intentionally so the president

540
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
And feels alone

541
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:22,912
It's improper

542
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
Get that most

543
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,776
Of the world is pretty much on the side of

544
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
Hope Trump

545
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:41,088
You and I are on slightly different sides of this cuz I think that would cause more trouble than it helps

546
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,112
You know what

547
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:48,512
I don't even know if your on burn it down and run away

548
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:56,448
Is joking around the Rhythm like this

549
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
Is equally likely

550
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,008
Baby more likely

551
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,544
Is that there is enough

552
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,128
Negatively responding out of his mouth

553
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,408
It seems awesome

554
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,504
Terrorist attack

555
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,320
People are like

556
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:17,184
When he was talking about that

557
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
Iraq news

558
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:25,120
We won't talk about an actual terrorist attack news report on Fox News the day before

559
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,656
About how

560
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,216
Made by immigrants are on the rise

561
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
In Sweden

562
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
Yep

563
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
It much better

564
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,664
President watches

565
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,016
6 hours a day

566
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:47,392
Now I'm on let Trump living just look at it

567
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,696
Athletic

568
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,280
Again if you go back just a month ago on my Twitter

569
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,352
All the comments

570
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,240
You go to YouTube

571
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,592
Definitely not for those who looked at Twitter audit

572
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,128
Yeah people do

573
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,200
And

574
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
Of Alex's

575
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
Followers are

576
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,320
I have got a third of

577
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
Prison plan

578
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
What's up Paul Joseph Watson

579
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,184
Twitter

580
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,280
Numbers are few years old I don't know if

581
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
Estranged

582
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,096
Since then but I would assume that the trend is

583
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
About that

584
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,192
I mean

585
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
I think there are a lot of

586
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,752
There's a lotta box

587
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
Involved

588
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,104
In their online price

589
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Anyway

590
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,440
The first

591
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,984
Manifest

592
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,592
Did read the headline

593
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,920
Zuckerberg wants to hurt you

594
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
Through

595
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,272
Through throughout

596
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:24,160
Yeah I'm out about them

597
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
They have done that selectively like

598
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,536
Experimenting with what you see on your Facebook

599
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,072
Like what types of stories

600
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,096
You see from your friend

601
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,632
Which friends you see

602
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
Kind of

603
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
But I don't think this is one

604
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,872
Also I don't like

605
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
How would you even how do you begin to write a

606
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,224
An algorithm

607
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
That targets

608
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,784
Negative responses

609
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,320
But only for Trump

610
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:58,720
Apply to so many other people I don't know

611
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
Where the issue is

612
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Of course

613
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,328
I think that you have a difficult time

614
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,656
Having a robot figure out what is a positive and a negative

615
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
That's a good

616
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,056
Does tone and irony isn't going to be able to be

617
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Picked up

618
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,712
Cyborg

619
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,016
Have invent

620
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
A robot that can pass

621
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,136
Is Trump

622
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,000
Two things I want the globalist to get to work on right now

623
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,792
An algorithm

624
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,400
Biscuit pass the Turing test and also trolls

625
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,704
I am a human algorithm

626
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,800
So f****** stupid

627
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:51,200
Trout

628
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,504
Alright

629
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,832
Shopbot 2.0 about this and then

630
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,904
He gets into one of our favorite podcast

631
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Stupid

632
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,488
Facts of Lent

633
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,192
Call out to smoke

634
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,504
I mean you're making that

635
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936
Richthofen

636
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,216
That's how it comes

637
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
Is amazing

638
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,720
Absolutely

639
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
But just look at that

640
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:20,032
Now every where it's to make us feel bad because the majority of the work

641
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,360
World waking up

642
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:29,760
Wait

643
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,624
He doesn't get to

644
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:38,208
These articles

645
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,048
Beginning it doesn't really play it all out

646
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,096
How many times do you think

647
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:49,728
I would say

648
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Like 50

649
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
Maybe in the 50 range

650
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
He really hammers

651
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,408
What you're saying

652
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,736
It is

653
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
It's like

654
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Mean Girls

655
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,368
So you saying that

656
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
The globalist

657
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
Don't want nationalist

658
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,888
To feel verified in their own opinion

659
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,680
I think we met is validated

660
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:26,336
Very specific connotation

661
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:32,736
Frogs have a blue check mark

662
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:37,600
5 of my friends have check marks

663
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:47,072
Maybe we'll be free of them once and for all

664
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:53,472
The number of listeners we have compared to

665
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
Floors we have is crazy

666
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
100

667
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,152
It's really easy for someone who doesn't like us to attack us

668
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,736
Yeah but you dumbasses is 40 followers

669
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,784
You still download so pretty decent

670
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
Dude

671
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
Dude that's not

672
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
You're no it's not

673
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Your defense

674
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
Should be

675
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
Yeah

676
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,816
You're one hundred percent correct

677
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:25,216
You know what I think I'm projecting that other people are bullying me maybe a little bit and that's not healthy that's your victimhood but

678
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,008
You know what who feels it more what do you want

679
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Safe space

680
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:35,968
Oh man I hope you have pills

681
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,368
F****** Alex Jones

682
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,208
Are a bully cult

683
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,448
Fastenal

684
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
He doesn't

685
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,872
He doesn't but also get ready for you know how we has like this

686
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,176
Thread to go through our retail stories but did

687
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Didn't happen

688
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
This

689
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,296
Is an excellent version of a story

690
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,832
Didn't happen

691
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,624
And when it when he's done

692
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
I would really like

693
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,952
Explain what I imagined

694
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Even happen

695
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
The business

696
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,608
No we can't Rivera

697
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:31,776
The New York Times we've we've emailed the New York Times for comment, or not

698
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,592
Perhaps better yet

699
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,872
No response

700
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:43,040
Hey guys f*** off

701
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
40

702
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,112
The answer is no response

703
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
Here's some fun fanfiction

704
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,608
Definitely not the ladies

705
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,472
That's not a

706
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,800
Mitsubishi

707
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,848
Add. Me sometime

708
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,912
It isn't

709
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,680
Potterhead

710
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,872
It's possible the New York Giants game

711
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,920
It's possible there was a reporter there

712
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,712
Pornographer

713
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,760
It's possible that all that is true

714
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,600
But I think a more realistic version of what happened was

715
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
This photographer

716
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,256
I got to go take pictures of Alex Jones and then she shows up

717
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
I don't want to engage

718
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:02,912
Pictures for us and not because the liberal establishment will bully her

719
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
Choose like

720
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
I want to get involved here you guys are nuts

721
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,080
The snow and well

722
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,360
It was not

723
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
For us it was more like I

724
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
Hey

725
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,136
I'd like to give you some super female Vitality on the house

726
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,720
Turn your p**** into a log flume at least

727
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,000
So what

728
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
Magic Mountain

729
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
Oh my God

730
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,424
The visual that you just gave me

731
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:40,288
Imagine how Alex Jones Mike sexually harass somebody

732
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,616
I didn't have to involve super female vitality

733
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:47,200
What you can get back.com

734
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,064
My dad makes

735
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,768
I should say that I actually that to pay superblue would not work

736
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:08,448
Did he make 100%

737
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,776
It could not be used this literally makes a big deal about how it's

738
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
Stick

739
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,568
Insubstantial

740
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,128
Toothpaste

741
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:21,504
How do you make toothpaste

742
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,856
This photographer

743
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,160
He thinks a dead

744
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
Fascinating

745
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,464
The paranoia is

746
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
Everywhere

747
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:38,400
I asked if she was being bullied but kind of naughty

748
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:43,264
She gave me the liberal media the fixery media is bullying me

749
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:47,616
Politely

750
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:51,456
Blink your left eye once if yes when your right eye

751
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,224
Twice if

752
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,248
No

753
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:57,344
It's absurd absurd fanfiction about his own life

754
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,392
Based based on

755
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
Actual

756
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,720
Right probably

757
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
The weirder things

758
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
If it was a

759
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
Photographer

760
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,400
He spent all this time talking about writers out of

761
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
*

762
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,264
Yeah

763
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,312
Is one photographer

764
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,616
The assignment

765
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
Touch

766
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
Yeah but I also think

767
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,784
If he is lying and making it up out of whole cloth

768
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:31,904
The Narrative that I had a writer, and I tried to get him to write stuff for us

769
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
That's a harder sell

770
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
Jennifer

771
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,744
Freelance

772
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,864
Like a writer would actually have to care and like be on the same page is up

773
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,656
Just be doing

774
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,984
But but in our history of Alex Jones

775
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,056
He does not go halfway

776
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,360
No believable

777
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,943
Yeah that's true

778
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,223
It would literally be

779
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
Woodward and

780
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
But we're a little bit

781
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Because of the globe

782
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,207
He keeps talking about how much Seymour Hersh loves her

783
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,535
This next clip

784
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,839
You told a story

785
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Emile Hirsch

786
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
Judd Hirsch

787
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,703
All the Hearst Clan

788
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,335
Even even the one who's not related

789
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
So does next

790
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,367
Make a point using a law that never existed

791
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,511
Then he conflates reality with a movie

792
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,071
Another f****** wild a

793
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,863
I love

794
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,895
Spencer Rivers

795
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,455
That's completely illegal

796
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:03,295
They have big contain slurry pools that they put it into

797
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:17,375
Water runoff.

798
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,167
Austin farming

799
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,007
$1,000 signs the next one was 20000 just went up

800
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,799
So I looked into that

801
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,151
Obama wanted to ban

802
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
And dust

803
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,015
You would have to Define.

804
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
Really well

805
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,623
This is an article from 2011

806
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,255
Ideal talking point illustrate a federal bureaucracy

807
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:49,887
Only God

808
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Control

809
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,679
The Dust in the Wind

810
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,007
Now here comes my favorite part of the crazy regulatory Act

811
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,823
The EPA is now proposing rules to regulate.

812
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,383
Representative John Carter of Texas

813
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,919
Set on the house floor

814
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,223
He said Texas is full of Dusty Rhodes

815
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,759
The EPA is now staying

816
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:09,087
Can be fine for driving home every night and your gravel road

817
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,623
You are a representer

818
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,927
Your automatic

819
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
Yet I have

820
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
Have yet to hear

821
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:22,399
Single with Kinky Friedman in the house for a little while

822
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,167
Anyway

823
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,727
There was just one

824
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,007
It was not true

825
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:32,383
Never did

826
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
Oh my God

827
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,431
Yep

828
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,551
Remember do you remember when this thing that didn't happen happen

829
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,343
I hated it I hated it

830
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:47,231
Still the Spectre of this rule has spurred three bills to prevent it

831
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:50,303
One of which was approved Thursday by a house subcommittee

832
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,863
It sparked a late night

833
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,983
GOP Presidential candidate Herman Cain decided in a debate as a reason to eliminate that

834
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
EPA

835
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
The hubbub over this Phantom rule

836
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:04,383
Surely one of the most controversial regulations that never was

837
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,711
Involved

838
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,991
The EPA and its Crossing

839
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
Never existed

840
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,159
Is that is that worth

841
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
Completely and utterly

842
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,231
Really evil the fact that they

843
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,047
Still get away with s*** like that

844
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,327
Truly amazing

845
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
Yeah

846
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
The old

847
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
The first thing that came up

848
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
To mine was like

849
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,103
Reading The Art of War

850
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,919
No point in The Art of War was it

851
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
Just like a man make

852
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:42,271
Shut up

853
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:50,207
Like there's no way someone could have figured out that you could just

854
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,743
Pretend & Win

855
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,839
Especially if you repeat the pretend thing over and over again

856
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:59,935
People just start to education

857
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:05,311
Instantly says that the Chinese are trying to buy Hollywood

858
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:10,943
To the point where people get used to hearing it no like oh I remember him talking about that but he never approved

859
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,479
What's my source my source

860
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
Was that I heard it a bunch

861
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,807
Sources

862
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:23,999
I think I'm going to do is take his talking points and on our Tumblr

863
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,583
Every now and again I'm just going to thoroughly breakdown why it's b*******

864
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:34,495
Savannah will in the future when it comes up on episodes I can go to Art and reading

865
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,823
By Holloway

866
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
Is we are going

867
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,615
To reference art

868
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,663
Selves

869
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:48,063
But the issue

870
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,671
The difference will be the amount of

871
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,743
Primary resources

872
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
Headlines

873
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,143
Just like you have those

874
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,703
Twitter where they take a screenshot of their note

875
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,055
Just transcript insane like

876
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,991
Jordan Holmes was quoted as saying this is not true

877
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,295
And that's our response

878
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,063
To make this even worse

879
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,647
Actually change the rules for dust on farms

880
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,207
EPA would have to formally propose a new rule

881
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,231
And as of March

882
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,791
EPA administrator Lisa P Jackson said

883
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,327
She was not likely to do that

884
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,143
Quote we have no plans to do so Jackson

885
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
Sunset

886
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
Luscious lips

887
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,287
Started

888
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
2 second

889
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,639
Just to s

890
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
It's

891
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,623
How

892
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,439
Could you possibly outlawed dust without

893
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,975
Turning it into like ever

894
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,863
Chemical bath salt

895
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,655
What time do I have to live in bubbles

896
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
Outlawed

897
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,239
Even if you want

898
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,519
No

899
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
Dream

900
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
Was this o.c.

901
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,871
CD and nuts not to be

902
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,175
Sure sure

903
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,991
Sotd meth addict dream of it

904
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,783
It's finally time to outlawed.

905
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
Finally

906
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
No

907
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
Would ever

908
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,647
Consider doing

909
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,207
Super horse

910
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:33,535
I mean even take away the outlaw part everyone understand

911
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,559
Dirt and dust

912
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
Exist

913
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,911
Lack of cleanliness

914
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,495
But there's not really anything you can do about it

915
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,031
In the desert

916
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,079
You're going to get.

917
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:52,479
Alex about regulatory stuff Gone Wild in order to reinforce his point

918
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,295
That what they're doing with coal mining shitizen

919
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,599
Polluting Rivers

920
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:00,927
All the time

921
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,999
And that was the rule that they just got rid of the one

922
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,047
The what the Only Rule

923
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
UA

924
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,863
Can be no way you're again

925
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
There can be

926
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,191
No human being who's like you know what

927
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
I hate

928
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
Petco

929
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
Coal miner

930
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,847
From throwing s***

931
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,687
But the reason you can't

932
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
Terrified

933
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Fluoride

934
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,271
Making water right

935
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
Love f***

936
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
Call call Mike

937
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,111
Makes me warm

938
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,135
Makes me drink good

939
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:37,023
What's well there's been a couple things if you believe this b******* about regulatory should Gone Wild

940
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,815
Ben you might assume

941
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
That this

942
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,631
Dumping s*** into a river

943
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,959
A regulation is the same thing

944
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:50,847
Those are my favorite commercials that around 1

945
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:51,871
Pant suits

946
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
Titties

947
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:55,455
So

948
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:59,551
Hillary election

949
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,183
Baby. I don't know

950
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,351
If you believe

951
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,655
It's like Alex does the clean

952
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,983
You would think it's all Much Ado About Nothing

953
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:24,127
Legitimately believe that there's clean enough coal that is all it does when you use it is it puts out water

954
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,919
That's not true

955
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,943
That's not possible

956
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,807
It's not possible and it's not like carbon dioxide and water vapor

957
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
It's not a thing

958
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,951
I'd love to get into it at some point but it's

959
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
Not real

960
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,887
Brilliant strategy

961
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
Make a thing up

962
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
That we have to

963
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:50,751
Because then

964
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,031
Get away with f****** at 8

965
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,567
If you're just making up like

966
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,359
Hey there trying to outlaw dust

967
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,127
Now I have

968
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,663
No

969
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:00,735
Legitimizes that is it just me saying

970
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,527
Come on

971
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,575
Do you remember

972
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:08,415
The Phantom Tollbooth when Milo was trying to open Milo

973
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,719
He was trying to get

974
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:15,071
Doraemon reason and free them from captivity run into

975
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,119
The terrible Trivium

976
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
Trivium

977
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:21,983
Is like a big pile of sand

978
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
Put it over there one

979
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,079
Colonel at a time one little piece of string

980
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,871
His basic thing was just like

981
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,175
Creating tasks for Milo to do the waist

982
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,223
It is time it seems like there was a point

983
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,015
I know what Alex Jones.

984
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:40,927
It's pretty good yeah doggy sound

985
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,719
Let's go further into this clip cuz

986
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,511
We got a ways to go we're almost

987
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:52,703
Anime

988
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:57,567
16

989
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,127
So not true

990
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,903
McDonald

991
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:20,351
Just like the Deepwater Horizon

992
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,495
I just shut up

993
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,359
Absolutely word-for-word

994
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,407
What was

995
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:38,271
Now he doesn't cite the actual transcripts but what he does now is

996
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,319
Performs the theme from the movie

997
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:47,999
What to show with me

998
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,815
To show the policy

999
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:56,191
Instead of getting into the Weeds about the actual details he does enjoy this

1000
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,239
It's great

1001
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,079
Russell and

1002
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,687
Listen

1003
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:13,087
379 billion-dollar company

1004
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
No it's not

1005
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:26,655
Don't matter I'm going to do whatever I want whose voice is that

1006
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,823
So it's just how I covered

1007
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
This

1008
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
What is this

1009
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,671
All of the article

1010
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,743
Nobody can talk for hours about this

1011
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,535
Referring to

1012
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,327
An impression of Kurt Russell

1013
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,119
But it was a greater pressure

1014
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:01,471
Is escape from l.a.

1015
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,007
The Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken

1016
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,335
I could talk for hours about this

1017
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,919
2 minutes that we listen to of it

1018
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,455
What you talked about was

1019
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:15,039
A Federal Regulation that never existed about regulating.

1020
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:20,415
Yes about child labor that he's completely misinterpreted

1021
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:23,743
Have your family members work on a farm

1022
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,791
That's exactly what they were trying to outlaw

1023
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
That you know

1024
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,863
It's it's not

1025
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,887
It's definitely not a

1026
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,911
Straw man argument

1027
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
Not at all

1028
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:34,239
It is a it is a 100%

1029
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,007
Real thing

1030
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:41,407
Could you imagine 4 hours if in the time he allotted he just lied twice in order to justify the

1031
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,687
The idea that regulations

1032
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,455
You're crazy

1033
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,735
Yeah man it's cool to

1034
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,295
Pollute Rivers

1035
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:53,695
If you just makeup regulations you can just do that forever

1036
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,743
Isn't that Kurt Russell voice

1037
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,559
Billion dollar company

1038
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,887
Build.com

1039
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655
Brooklyn

1040
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:06,751
Queen from the 70s

1041
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,775
Weird

1042
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:09,823
What are we doing

1043
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,127
I don't know

1044
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,175
Accompany

1045
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,991
They're putting

1046
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,159
Against

1047
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
Hey

1048
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,743
It's bad that they put arsenic in the water and is like

1049
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,559
It's probably better that they put f***

1050
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,607
Poison from the

1051
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,399
It's all good

1052
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,447
It sucks it's all bad

1053
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,031
Yeah but you know what most of the time when you complain about things that

1054
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,567
Business wants

1055
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,335
To do

1056
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:47,967
Or the Nationalist one

1057
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,991
All you're doing is

1058
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:49,759
Virtue

1059
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,807
I don't know what that

1060
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:58,719
It's this idea Paul Joseph Watson talks about it all the time it's

1061
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,743
Black lives matter

1062
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,767
Or

1063
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,327
Post something about Reproductive Rights

1064
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:07,167
And stuff like that on Facebook or on Twitter

1065
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,727
You really care about the issue you're talking about

1066
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:13,311
All it is is you were trying to perform for your liberal friends

1067
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,103
And show that you're one of them

1068
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,407
So your signaling your virtues

1069
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:20,223
Through poster making in behaviors

1070
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,247
Don't

1071
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:26,367
Well on a known one level you are expressing your virtue

1072
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,695
Junior standing up for things that you

1073
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,255
That fall within your principles

1074
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,303
Just posting something on Twitter is not really

1075
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,119
Pause lot of people who are

1076
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,399
Maybe do a little bit shity

1077
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,167
Certainly

1078
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,191
But there's there's

1079
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,215
There's a lot of people

1080
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:44,543
Uncle Express their opinions.

1081
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,127
Anyway Alex virtue signaling he wants you to know that your pizza

1082
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:58,367
That's exactly because I have a beard

1083
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:03,487
Virtue signaling talk about black lives matter whatever

1084
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:10,143
Carnival greedy people

1085
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,895
Do you think about stealing

1086
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,175
Actually wait

1087
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
You can

1088
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
You just

1089
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:29,599
Do you think about stealing stealing land from Hawaiian

1090
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,439
What about Mark Zuckerberg trying to build a house

1091
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,511
But

1092
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,071
Probably

1093
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
Any billionaire allowed

1094
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
To go out

1095
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,399
Sure

1096
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,703
Open and someone who grew up in Hawaii

1097
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,239
Small little boxes

1098
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,007
Under the ground

1099
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,823
I hate

1100
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,103
Trying to get back to the

1101
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,175
The point but I grew up for a bit in Hawaii

1102
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:59,551
Who celebrated King Kamehameha day with native population

1103
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,111
Also known as Dragon Ball Z

1104
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,927
If you want

1105
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,719
To make the argument about

1106
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,511
Stealing land from Hawaiian

1107
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:14,911
There's a lot more you're going to have to do American history that would involve

1108
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,727
Always been America

1109
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,799
Pretty sure that Native Americans

1110
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Not

1111
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,383
The American

1112
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:30,015
Landed

1113
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,903
On me

1114
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,911
George's place but the native populations there

1115
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,751
But I've been making claims about how it's going

1116
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,967
I'll listen to that

1117
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,759
But if you don't care about

1118
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,295
Other parts of it

1119
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,319
Then you're just

1120
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,135
Capitalizing on someone you don't like

1121
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:09,439
I can't imagine anybody that

1122
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,743
Being a

1123
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
Complete and utter Giant

1124
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:15,839
And I'll certainly not everyone we talked about

1125
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,375
Have any perhaps

1126
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
House

1127
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,983
Justice committee leader

1128
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Name Chaffee

1129
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,055
Being a complete and utter

1130
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:25,823
F****** HIPAA

1131
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,967
Yeah anyway

1132
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
Let's get through this

1133
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:39,135
White papers article today about Zuckerberg says users are dumb

1134
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:46,047
He already has

1135
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,631
Elegant crazy

1136
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,055
Absolutely devastating

1137
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,103
Devastated

1138
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,663
Yesterday and

1139
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,991
They just don't know what to do the confidence

1140
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,039
Nobody's getting hurt

1141
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:19,327
Being a superhero

1142
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:23,167
Definitely not racist

1143
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:27,519
Paste for people not the post-industrial technocracy

1144
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,175
Where they're all saying the end of humans is here you will submit

1145
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:40,575
Machines it's all over we already spawned a Little Liars

1146
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,279
Drum roll

1147
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,327
I was reading papers

1148
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:58,751
Which wallpapers was 30 articles

1149
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:05,919
The numbers of Articles is really good

1150
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:11,039
Facts about transhuman

1151
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:17,695
I'm guessing that's what he's trying to say

1152
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
He's made

1153
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:23,071
So is about the extent

1154
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,351
To which he covers

1155
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,399
The press conference

1156
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
This point

1157
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,751
Okay does end up getting to a little bit of it later

1158
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,287
But if he's like

1159
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:37,407
We have a press conference and was on Thursday and I was really really waiting for him

1160
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,687
To go off on it

1161
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,991
Like really

1162
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
Be like yeah

1163
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:48,671
You know you the specific instances like you told them

1164
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,695
Black caucus

1165
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,279
Like I was expecting that to happen

1166
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,863
And it really wasn't he didn't respond too much was really boring

1167
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:57,887
On the

1168
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:01,983
It really disappointed me that he didn't get into a ton of that

1169
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,799
Let's get into it

1170
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,615
Do you think it's because there is

1171
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,639
Even for him

1172
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,455
Nothing really defensive all about that

1173
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:16,319
Talking about so many of the things that came up in the press conference

1174
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
So many of Trumps Behavior

1175
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,391
Are kind of put it behind the eight

1176
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,207
I think that he realized like a lot of this

1177
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,999
It's going to be too difficult for me to

1178
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:24,767
Defend

1179
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,559
So at the end

1180
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:30,399
We're going to play today is when he finally gets to actually talk

1181
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,935
Press conference

1182
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,727
You'll see how like

1183
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,263
How little he engages

1184
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,287
The Source material

1185
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,823
But what

1186
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,847
What is the

1187
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,943
You'll see I'll let you know what's faster

1188
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,711
About that is

1189
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,479
Is that I was really

1190
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,783
I wanted to see

1191
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:47,807
Because there's

1192
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,831
There's so many

1193
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,855
People who would

1194
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,135
And whatever none

1195
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,463
They're already always

1196
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,279
So they're going to do that

1197
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,815
If you

1198
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
If you have

1199
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,351
Any sense

1200
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,375
Of critical thought about

1201
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,911
You watch that

1202
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,935
Even if you voted

1203
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
A trumpet

1204
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,495
What the f*** is happy

1205
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,031
I can't imagine

1206
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:12,383
Frazee I can't imagine any of my people in the red state of Missouri

1207
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,943
All my old people to Maita voted for Trump

1208
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,991
Any of them watching that

1209
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,319
Boys off his rocker

1210
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:25,183
Now you know how it

1211
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,767
How you could possibly defend

1212
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,863
Exactly right there and that's why

1213
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,631
Really hoping that

1214
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,447
He would have something that's what I was looking for.

1215
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,239
Today conservative websites

1216
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,567
And they were all like

1217
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,175
0

1218
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:51,039
Zero from what all he's all

1219
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,599
Prince was bad

1220
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
Go through anything

1221
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
Here is a

1222
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,743
Possible argument that Alex

1223
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:03,583
Please and that is look look

1224
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,935
Trump may appear to be crazy but it only appears crazy

1225
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,983
Because you may or may not have superpowers

1226
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,519
Abreva

1227
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,823
That brings us to our next clip

1228
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,383
God dammit your transition skills are

1229
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,991
Filtered blocked on Twitter

1230
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,239
I might as well tell people

1231
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:49,407
She wants to talk to her

1232
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,943
At the switchboard

1233
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,223
About 2 in the morning

1234
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,551
Please read

1235
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,743
Code

1236
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:13,471
And weather

1237
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:18,335
Is sportsball which Harkins he has autism

1238
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,663
I mean

1239
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,967
I guess

1240
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,783
I can't think of any

1241
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,575
Cuz I'm sure it's okay

1242
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
Alright

1243
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,903
We got that magic

1244
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,183
That's not great

1245
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,231
Toad

1246
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:35,999
What about you

1247
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:41,631
Toad the Wet Sprocket I think that's very heroic character in Mario

1248
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:48,799
Absolutely Toad and that the very the very gay Series where the toad

1249
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,847
Load in the rabbit or whenever I know that

1250
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,871
That's not important

1251
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,919
Incorrect

1252
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:01,599
Goes to Hell

1253
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,879
Traxxas

1254
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:10,047
You're totally wrong if you think that looks traumatized me

1255
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:14,655
Why is mr. toad in hell for kids

1256
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:15,679
Anyway

1257
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,959
We haven't gone to the Superbowl

1258
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,519
How can they

1259
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,103
All of

1260
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,383
Trump

1261
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,687
Sits there with his reading drugs

1262
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
Not

1263
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
He 70

1264
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,039
You should know

1265
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,319
He just okay

1266
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:38,719
Why is there

1267
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:42,303
16 women with all these little headphone Jacks in there like

1268
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,863
Operator

1269
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,935
Switchboard just talking to regular people

1270
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,215
Sor

1271
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,543
Are people call in the White House and he's like 2 in the morning

1272
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,311
This one sound

1273
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,335
Sounds good you up

1274
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,663
McDonald's

1275
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,943
But also

1276
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:05,343
It's clear that if a seventy-year-old man is up till 2 in the morning then wakes up and does his job

1277
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,903
He's got to be on some sort of amphetamine

1278
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,671
Like that

1279
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,975
Can't you just like your body does not allow for

1280
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,023
His wife

1281
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,815
He's a magic toad

1282
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:22,751
If there's anything

1283
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,031
Alright

1284
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,079
It's at when you are a magic

1285
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,151
Quickly

1286
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
Engineer

1287
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,247
Weather

1288
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,111
And as we all know one of the

1289
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,647
Powers of a toad

1290
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,719
If you stay up until 2

1291
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,999
And wake up early in the morning

1292
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,815
I think it's more like a superpower is a deist

1293
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:50,655
Secretes hallucinogens

1294
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,007
That explains his appearance on Jimmy Fallon

1295
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,567
That's for goddamn sure

1296
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,847
What Spiderman was that

1297
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,639
Photographer who showed up at Infowars

1298
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,407
Oh my God

1299
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:08,063
I know we got we got Batman

1300
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:13,951
New York but there's no evidence

1301
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,047
He's freelancing for the New York

1302
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,327
And the New York Times

1303
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,607
Him on this

1304
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,655
Oh my God

1305
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,935
Freelance mission

1306
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
But

1307
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,775
In the meantime

1308
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,079
He would turn into spider Gwen

1309
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:34,943
Which is the new thing of Spider-Girl

1310
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,711
And

1311
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
And that's

1312
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,295
As logical as the story he f******

1313
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:41,855
And Marvel in the

1314
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
And

1315
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:48,767
Mr myxlplyx or whatever

1316
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:49,791
Whatever

1317
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:54,399
We have a new hero to answer the pantheon has Donald Trump superpower

1318
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,167
Alright

1319
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:57,983
Yes

1320
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,079
Stop right there

1321
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:10,783
And basically he knows on the switchboard

1322
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,727
This is incredible

1323
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,567
What

1324
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,871
Lame superpowers

1325
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,991
Because it's

1326
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:45,599
But let's not talk over the cliffs as much cuz I'm getting this weird feedback then

1327
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:49,183
It's hard not to respond I know I know I'm sorry

1328
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:54,047
Grade a nonsense numbers come up

1329
01:09:54,303 --> 01:10:00,191
He memorizes numbers for memorizing

1330
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,215
Dino's phone number

1331
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,751
Which is

1332
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,799
Amazing to

1333
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:09,151
People that's really cool

1334
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,455
Is impressed by somebody knowing phone

1335
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,223
Alex

1336
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,015
He just said it's

1337
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,415
I texted you

1338
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:25,279
Yes I recall cuz I knows what color ideas

1339
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,119
Which I really don't think he understands that modern phones

1340
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,679
Have a name that comes up with a phone number

1341
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,727
Connect

1342
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,495
Because

1343
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,775
Again I'm living in

1344
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,311
He's in front of us

1345
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:41,151
Actual plugs

1346
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:41,919
Yeah

1347
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:47,551
Alright people who like using the first two numbers as letters whenever

1348
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
He's

1349
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,879
You remember phone numbers

1350
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,903
When people are calling

1351
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
The number

1352
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,695
140

1353
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,023
This is way over there were only eight numbers

1354
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,327
Okay and then

1355
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:02,143
But why

1356
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:08,031
Yeah yeah where they mad again because they can

1357
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,335
Everyone else knows

1358
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,871
Unclog up the line

1359
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:17,247
Maybe it's the media's going to be pissed cuz then they can't call Trump late at night

1360
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,295
Which is not happening

1361
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
I don't know

1362
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
Insanity

1363
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:29,023
It is on all sides

1364
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:33,631
There's there's no there's no way to get in there without going through

1365
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,935
Nightmare of crazy

1366
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,727
Describe it

1367
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:42,335
If it's true it's crazy if it's not true it's still crazy

1368
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:45,151
If even a part of it is true is crazy

1369
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,855
Reading even the slightest bit true is

1370
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,391
Verify

1371
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,927
The reality peace

1372
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,975
Is possibly

1373
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:05,375
He calls Trump the only part of it

1374
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:18,175
How did he know in that press conference also was complaining that the media never calls him

1375
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,759
Direct refutation of what Alex and sing

1376
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:24,831
The fourteen-year-old child the most insane

1377
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,879
So Alex Jones

1378
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,951
Has an iPhone we've established that he's had his phone on set Buffet

1379
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,791
Is it an iPhone or a

1380
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Now

1381
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,119
Based on what he just told

1382
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,679
Does he know how to add

1383
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,591
Didn't recognize.

1384
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,639
He is

1385
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,919
He is Amazed by

1386
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,223
Buy Trump being able to recognize

1387
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,759
Just before he

1388
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,783
The answer is yes

1389
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,575
Because he doesn't know how to put

1390
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,111
Name

1391
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
In the

1392
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,719
Trump doesn't like I don't think

1393
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
The Trump would give Alex

1394
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:04,767
Nexus cell phone

1395
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:11,679
That would be that would be

1396
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:15,007
Neighbor sitcom I would watch all the time

1397
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,543
If if your if

1398
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,591
A f******

1399
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,871
Kramer was Act

1400
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,407
Text Jones

1401
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,687
Just calling

1402
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:29,087
Trump all the time president this is a knowledge

1403
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:32,671
Intellectual property

1404
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,951
Do you know that even better

1405
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,487
MB Home Improvement

1406
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,023
Where Alex Jones Wilson

1407
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:42,143
Screaming from the other side of the fence

1408
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,959
Instead of

1409
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:48,031
Running a TV show about Home Improvement

1410
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,079
Stop the president

1411
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:56,479
Instead of Wilson giving out good advice he yells about the globalist

1412
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
I just had a real rough

1413
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
Fight with my

1414
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,159
Who's my wife

1415
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:07,743
George Soros

1416
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,703
The move on and grow as a person

1417
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,239
All right I got to get on air

1418
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,615
Don't don't steal that either

1419
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:25,663
SNL skit

1420
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:31,295
Call me mad TV was still around

1421
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:35,135
Already have a 5-year deal

1422
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:35,903
You gets back

1423
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,975
To the New York Times photographer narrative

1424
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,303
I am and I don't remember exactly what the

1425
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,351
This is about but I've labeled it as a

1426
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,631
Really bad example of a

1427
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,399
Slippery slope

1428
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:55,359
He doesn't care what they do what they say he realize they're a bunch of bullies slave

1429
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,431
And he's just out there to show them they're bullies

1430
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,391
Photographer

1431
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,999
Can't

1432
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:15,583
Contract

1433
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,631
Country

1434
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:21,983
You're not allowed to ever work with anybody who's not

1435
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,287
The big corporate liberal approved

1436
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:32,479
Gulag

1437
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,271
There was a slippery slope

1438
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,319
No

1439
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:39,135
That makes perfect sense

1440
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:43,999
But also another conversation

1441
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,423
He's showing us

1442
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,215
It's okay to be who

1443
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,775
Yeah so long

1444
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,567
As you are not Muslim

1445
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,615
Sure

1446
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,895
Latin

1447
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:04,735
It's okay to be who you are

1448
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,015
If you are white

1449
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:10,111
Can stay here and if you are everything else

1450
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,159
Be who you are somewhere else

1451
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:17,279
Exactly Trump slogan from now or somewhere else

1452
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:23,935
That sort of mentality that people who believe it don't think is racist

1453
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,703
What is like

1454
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,239
Europe for the Europeans

1455
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,775
Africa for the Africans

1456
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,103
It is super racist but it

1457
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,895
Everyone who believes it thanks

1458
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:37,503
They're not be more of me at my homeland

1459
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,319
Why should mixing

1460
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,599
Why

1461
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,719
Reasons

1462
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,303
I can I can pretty comp

1463
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:53,375
At least

1464
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,703
He interpreted their interactions very wrong

1465
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,983
Definitely would not

1466
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,543
Infowars

1467
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,335
If she did

1468
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:07,455
In Alex Jones's nightmare scenario where she's being bullied into

1469
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,223
Freelance work

1470
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,503
He desperately needs

1471
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,527
Which she doesn't

1472
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:14,111
That still doesn't lead to gulags in a year

1473
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,695
Doesn't leave the gulags ever

1474
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:20,255
Alright whatever

1475
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,815
What's wind-up in gulags

1476
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:26,399
Vladimir Putin

1477
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:33,823
We want to start arresting y'all Trump

1478
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,807
He's talking about Evan McMullen went on

1479
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,599
MSNBC isn't he a senator

1480
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:50,207
From Utah whatever used to work

1481
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,231
Intelligent stuff

1482
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,511
Okay

1483
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,279
Definitely not good

1484
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:59,679
Do not make me happy

1485
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,215
World president tube

1486
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,799
Be compromised or working with enemy countries like

1487
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,615
An anime

1488
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,663
The domestic enemy of our country

1489
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,687
Like he is

1490
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:16,319
McMullen said it wasn't great but it's way more nuanced than what Alex was talking about

1491
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,087
Do you mean

1492
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,623
What the way you said it

1493
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,159
The way he said truth

1494
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,231
Send

1495
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,887
Specifically about Madonna know the White House is really nice

1496
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,423
Also talked about

1497
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,239
Madonna's speech where she said

1498
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:37,823
I sometimes think about blowing up the White House but I don't want to do that

1499
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:42,431
Yeah but you know

1500
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,223
Even before Trump was elected

1501
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:47,295
Sometimes I think about blowing up the White House

1502
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,599
I think

1503
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:55,999
Roland emmerich I think also I think

1504
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,863
I'm not sure about this

1505
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:06,751
But I think the White House might get blown up in that American movie that Alex Jones is in

1506
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,031
He got blown up

1507
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:08,799
Thousand

1508
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,079
Independence

1509
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:15,711
Roland emmerich

1510
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:16,735
Is a enemy of

1511
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:21,087
State

1512
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,903
To say anyways

1513
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:24,671
At the Republic

1514
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:28,511
Just like Evan Baldwin being on CNN

1515
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:31,327
The intelligence Community talking about how Trump is anatomy

1516
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,887
Blow up the White House is about Madonna

1517
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:36,447
The idea that people want to

1518
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:38,495
To kill Trump I'm guessing is based on

1519
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,055
Tweets Houston or something like that

1520
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:44,383
I think

1521
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,455
You're speaking at least I am not

1522
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,479
Norton

1523
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,271
Insinuating that I will do anything

1524
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:53,087
No and you're speaking a little bit glibly

1525
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
Very much

1526
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,159
Emilio

1527
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:59,999
Fully protected under parity laws

1528
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:07,679
Well they've outlawed dustox with flowers

1529
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,471
Like that

1530
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:14,080
They cannot get that's why they hate real men they cannot get

1531
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,872
The real men.

1532
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:18,432
Like

1533
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:23,552
Problem to be absolute filth

1534
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:27,904
Eagles on to explain that that's why they're creating robots

1535
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:34,816
Yep it's that this is the first instance that we're playing so far of what I would call Joe

1536
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,608
Toxic masculinity

1537
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,656
It always goes back to

1538
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,592
It gets Warriors

1539
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:52,736
To get so much worse as it goes along like there's a couple things that actually left my jaw open

1540
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:59,136
And I've been listening to him everyday

1541
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:01,696
You know if you want to get excited for later

1542
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,976
Part of this episode

1543
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,768
You said some stuff there

1544
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:10,144
We're really going to have to unpack a real dangers of male identity

1545
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,472
Male identity I can think of

1546
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:16,800
Except that last clip in about dogs

1547
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,872
Anytime he talks about what a real man is

1548
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,664
It is so

1549
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,480
Glaringly obvious

1550
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:28,576
A real man is that which fits the mold

1551
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:34,208
And anybody who disagrees with him or Trump is a chicken neck to weirdo

1552
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,512
Or I call them effeminate

1553
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,840
You know I wouldn't say that

1554
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,608
An insult to women

1555
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:44,960
He doesn't understand

1556
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,520
The things he's implying with his own word

1557
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,336
I don't understand any of the words

1558
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:55,456
Step through store hours 3 hours

1559
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,296
Hate whenever there's that

1560
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,064
Mail

1561
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,112
Mail

1562
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,184
We're manning that means that week

1563
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:09,792
The man

1564
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:13,376
Explain some of the ideas

1565
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,912
Videos about his mom

1566
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:17,728
Was bullied

1567
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:21,056
Victim of bullying

1568
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,360
But unfortunately that transitions

1569
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,408
Into him not understanding

1570
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,688
He is wildly

1571
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,480
Well

1572
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:35,648
Operating system of early reducing language vindication

1573
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,928
Scrambling

1574
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:49,728
You can't go to somebody

1575
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:51,264
Are there just monsters

1576
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,128
I just remembered

1577
01:22:57,152 --> 01:23:03,040
Always online

1578
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:03,808
Bully bully

1579
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,536
That was a lot of

1580
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:14,560
Erebus

1581
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:17,120
Saudi Arabia

1582
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,168
What does dialectic

1583
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,704
The whole thing's fake

1584
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:23,008
Hollywood was pushing

1585
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,800
I just real first agenda

1586
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,872
Also pushing the agenda

1587
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,152
So what

1588
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,712
Under

1589
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,016
Let me try and help you

1590
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:34,784
Parse this

1591
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,832
Was

1592
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,464
Conflated

1593
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,256
Then call from Nate Burrows

1594
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,560
Every

1595
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,352
Possible enemy

1596
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,656
Yeah

1597
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,424
Leftist

1598
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:59,360
Would you like me to explain results

1599
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,896
Okay

1600
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:06,528
He's responsible for.

1601
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,808
Conspiracy in the world

1602
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:11,136
In the world but at least in America and people online

1603
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:14,208
Sister and Subs because he's been going for so long

1604
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:17,280
In such a public way a lot of people get there

1605
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,048
Productions

1606
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,584
Conspiracy through Alex Jones

1607
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,400
He has done wonders

1608
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,168
Ford

1609
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:27,008
Creating and building the world

1610
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,056
And think everything is a false flag

1611
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:32,640
Unfortunately the byproduct is at

1612
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:36,224
It's that whole narrative story that you create something you can no longer can

1613
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,248
Control

1614
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:40,832
The entire conspiracy world not all of it but a lot of it is

1615
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:44,672
Because they think he doesn't criticize Israel

1616
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,976
So a lot of people think

1617
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,768
He is a shill for Israel

1618
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,328
There's a lot of scary to think it's

1619
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,352
Conspiracy

1620
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,960
Because we are down

1621
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:03,104
He's responding to hear what he's saying he's being bullied

1622
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,408
He's not being bullied

1623
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,944
Or by Erebus

1624
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,480
Or anything like that

1625
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,528
Keep being bullied by people that

1626
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,064
He's had a hand in creating

1627
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,856
They have gone too far

1628
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:15,648
Down the conspiracy aisle

1629
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:17,440
Too far and they're like

1630
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:23,584
Go that far

1631
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,120
He's a crazy enough.

1632
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,752
That's what he's getting at

1633
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,776
Fascinating like

1634
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,568
Fork in the road if you're an Alex

1635
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,616
One span

1636
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:36,896
Either I did

1637
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:37,664
Agree with Alex

1638
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,712
2insane

1639
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
Or

1640
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,528
He's not insane

1641
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,576
Like everybody ever

1642
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,856
Conspiracy theorist

1643
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,416
Fork in the road

1644
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,256
Like that's your ultimate like that's your

1645
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,024
Directions to Manor

1646
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:58,656
I actually think The Road Less Traveled is the one that sticks with him

1647
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:02,752
I think that most people who go that far down the road get to the fork

1648
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,032
And they're like well

1649
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,336
You know what this

1650
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:08,384
Doesn't do it for me anymore I got to

1651
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,408
Switch to Coke

1652
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:16,064
Flipping on what you believe previously The Alex Jones

1653
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,416
Okay

1654
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,464
How do you how do they want him to call out

1655
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:28,864
Do they want him to don't know specific because Israel is like I'm like there

1656
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:29,888
There

1657
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,216
Destroying the two-state solution and they're not creating a

1658
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,520
Creating

1659
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,592
I get the

1660
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,360
Feeling

1661
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:40,896
Instinct

1662
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,968
They're not on the side

1663
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,528
Relation

1664
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:53,184
They f****** take Mossad did 9/11 they think that the Jews are basically responsible for everything that's

1665
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,208
Cyber hacking bad

1666
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,512
Like

1667
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:03,936
Did the fact that he's complaining about being bullied by the people who think that he doesn't call out Israel is really unfortunate

1668
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,704
Because

1669
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,520
Everything that he believes in in terms of the globalist

1670
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,312
Is poorly packaged anti-semite

1671
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,616
It really all goes back

1672
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:17,760
To the fake document the protocols of the Elders of Zion entire episode on that

1673
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,552
Yes I've just done

1674
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,344
I have like in the past

1675
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,368
Also protect

1676
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,904
Nice refresher course

1677
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:27,232
When exactly how it was a Ford Raptor

1678
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,280
Right it's f****** insane how clear

1679
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,352
The five do bankers

1680
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,376
Sealab

1681
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:36,192
Exactly

1682
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:41,312
People who were trying to hurt the world from behind the scenes

1683
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,616
Is all taken directly

1684
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,152
From the protocols of the Elders of

1685
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,200
Because you know

1686
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:49,248
But if you bring that book up

1687
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,040
And act like it's real because it is

1688
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:52,576
Discredited

1689
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,856
Not that that matters

1690
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,648
The only thing that people

1691
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:58,464
Right-thinking people will respond is

1692
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,560
Okay

1693
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,608
Repackaged it

1694
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,376
In a way that is

1695
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,680
Acceptable to talk about by calling them globalist

1696
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:13,568
Write in the same way that David Icke does it with lizards are in the same way that George Soros is a Nazi

1697
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:25,088
Yeah it's George Soros a Nazi collaborator

1698
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:25,856
Because

1699
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,392
He has enough

1700
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,672
Be nice

1701
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,744
Fall through

1702
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,280
Really was to be like

1703
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,072
Now I need to tell you about this book

1704
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:41,472
Pretty much all of my beliefs about Nature's and communism

1705
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:45,056
Look in the middle of a lake with no paddle

1706
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,360
No one would get on board with him

1707
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:53,760
Stormfront Israel

1708
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,856
So is he inside Israel

1709
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,672
I don't know if I have enough information to say

1710
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,536
Right

1711
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,304
The most

1712
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:08,864
He generally talks about

1713
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:09,888
To say that he's

1714
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:10,656
Fair

1715
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:11,680
He doesn't really

1716
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:18,080
Beetle with too much but he always talk smart move on his he always

1717
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:20,640
But then there's no substance

1718
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:24,224
There is an actual evidence in my

1719
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:24,992
Experience

1720
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,016
That he does either of those

1721
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,832
Of course but he does call out the Erebus

1722
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,624
What what

1723
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,648
I don't know

1724
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,672
The Erebus

1725
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,464
Probably offensive word

1726
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,488
What's the weather

1727
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:38,048
Sing about a Sierra Vista

1728
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:42,912
I remember back when I was a kid

1729
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:47,520
Do you like 106 & Park

1730
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,288
Arabic

1731
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:55,712
That is anyway

1732
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,600
Civilization

1733
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:02,880
Program

1734
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:09,536
And that in Israel did anything it was the worst thing on earth

1735
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:36,672
Well I'm sure the truth in between you know Israel do some bad stuff that the Muslims have been stuffing

1736
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:53,056
Work for the Catholics

1737
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:04,576
I want to send

1738
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:14,048
Alexander

1739
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,840
But also I love that

1740
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:16,608
Snap

1741
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,888
Clarification

1742
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:23,520
I'm not sure if it's in this clip but he's like

1743
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,824
I talked to Emma as MI6

1744
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:33,248
I want sex as a real thing I think I'm I-5 is removed

1745
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:49,120
Play talk tomorrow about

1746
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:51,936
Alien

1747
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:59,872
Seven billion people on the planet

1748
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:01,408
Muslims

1749
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:05,504
How many Muslims are OnStar there on this planet

1750
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,272
Billions

1751
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,296
Yeah

1752
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,088
How many do you need to have a large

1753
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,112
Engine of Muslim

1754
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:11,904
You would have to

1755
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:12,672
Like

1756
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,976
Statistically speaking we would need

1757
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,120
What 25% would you call a large contingent

1758
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:26,240
So let's let's relatively speaking call it a small

1759
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,056
If you have a very small reference

1760
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,336
It's a large

1761
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,152
Hundreds of thousands of pressure

1762
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:35,456
Alright

1763
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,480
100000

1764
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,248
Christians

1765
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:40,320
How long before you're out of Chris

1766
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,184
It seems like

1767
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,464
You would run out

1768
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:47,744
Harley Quinn

1769
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,072
At least weather

1770
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:54,400
Is there slightly more Christians are there are Muslims which is even more

1771
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:59,264
Or is it 100,000

1772
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,824
Ever the statistics very murky

1773
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:07,712
I've learned stuff like that I just

1774
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:13,088
I'm giving this new skill I'm giving this new skill which I'm not actually happy about what I do

1775
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:14,112
B is like

1776
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:15,648
Whatever he says stuff like that it's

1777
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:18,720
Like water rolling off a duck's back

1778
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:21,536
I can't engage hundreds of thousands of Christians

1779
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,560
Means like 10 guys

1780
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,584
Maybe

1781
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:28,960
Let's be clear about that

1782
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,456
We are the one podcast

1783
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:42,528
Take the stand real hearts.

1784
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:53,024
But not with acid is like I think every podcast

1785
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,048
Agree with that

1786
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,096
Never cover it

1787
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,632
You know what

1788
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:59,936
You know why cuz they're not real men

1789
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:04,288
Keep the ends up talking about Morrissey

1790
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,056
Secret service agent

1791
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:09,664
And then makes a horrible false equivalence

1792
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:15,040
Around Saturday 1

1793
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:25,280
It's just

1794
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:32,192
Everybody should just be able to talk to everybody's like that New York Times photographer

1795
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:39,872
Let me see your portfolio

1796
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,504
I think human beings

1797
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,600
Just a few minutes

1798
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:59,840
Suicide bombing Israel

1799
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:02,144
Somebody cuz you're a big man you're a good person

1800
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,680
Moral

1801
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,800
Bad person or whatever

1802
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:12,384
I apologize false equivalence about the Holocaust

1803
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,176
I must not have had that in the clip

1804
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:17,248
At some point in the show he talks about how like a holocaust was a

1805
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,528
A Jew's now it's again

1806
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,296
Chance the white

1807
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:22,624
Great to go back to the light

1808
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,392
Oh man

1809
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,160
If only

1810
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:30,560
What a Wonderful World

1811
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,400
Cuz you you're a self-hating cook white man

1812
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,776
You know you you are

1813
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:41,056
You defended evidence

1814
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,872
The programming what's going on

1815
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,640
I'm trying to

1816
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,432
Turn white people against themselves

1817
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,200
It's called

1818
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,832
Yeah all of the history

1819
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:53,856
Yes

1820
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,904
When you talk about that

1821
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,720
Yeah it's very complex and abstract

1822
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,256
Alex doesn't understand it

1823
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:05,120
You and I are both you and I are both white men

1824
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,656
Yeah

1825
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:09,472
Fortune things from history

1826
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,240
Breakfast

1827
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,008
Yet but

1828
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,288
Everyday we

1829
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:13,824
Yes

1830
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,384
And that is the piece of it that makes

1831
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,408
Talking about

1832
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,176
White

1833
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:18,944
Send

1834
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,504
Or white

1835
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,064
This in the past

1836
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:30,464
Whatever we don't have each other because you are white and I am light

1837
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,024
It is about a shared history

1838
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,560
Of benefiting from a pressure

1839
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:36,096
When I was in London

1840
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,376
I did see the crowns

1841
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,192
Well I was Prince

1842
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:42,240
They were good

1843
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,312
Little

1844
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:49,664
Those little ginger balls

1845
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,968
No it was it was really

1846
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,248
Because they did have them

1847
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,272
In a way that you

1848
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,552
Go through

1849
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:56,832
Pictures

1850
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:58,112
There are these weird little thing

1851
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:00,160
Kept looking at them going like

1852
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,720
Did you guys call this

1853
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,840
Cuz that's not

1854
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,888
That's also to take a step back

1855
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:22,432
Killer Mike

1856
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,712
They were there yesterday

1857
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:25,504
I just saw the sign

1858
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,296
17

1859
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:29,088
Which is the David

1860
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,880
VapoRub

1861
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,160
Run them Jewels fast

1862
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,464
I did not go to the concert cuz I

1863
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:41,888
We didn't include the thing that I said

1864
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,984
Evidence cuz I don't like saying that

1865
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,032
The proof

1866
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:50,592
Slightly higher

1867
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,920
Fairy not unrealistic

1868
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:56,224
Sick for you to believe that Alex Jones has ideas

1869
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:58,784
Scum

1870
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:01,856
You think that's what people call him online

1871
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:04,672
Cuz you work for is

1872
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:06,976
Alright

1873
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:09,024
Okay

1874
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,048
Okay

1875
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:14,656
Alright I don't know exactly what this next clip is so let's get surprise together

1876
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:22,336
Coming to you from the former United States of America

1877
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:28,736
How crazy

1878
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:38,976
States of America

1879
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:41,024
Zinus company right there

1880
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:45,888
You're walking on the Fightin side of me

1881
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,704
The nut Merle Haggard whoever is

1882
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,496
Detox

1883
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:51,520
This is one of those new catch phrase

1884
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,080
You know when you want to go get some

1885
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,408
Play Walking on the

1886
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,456
All the way

1887
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,480
He says it's against

1888
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:01,504
The Constitution

1889
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,208
You walking on the Fightin side

1890
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,232
Meowth on

1891
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,024
Is like anytime so

1892
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,048
So the biggest

1893
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,072
Bummer that I have

1894
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:15,840
With our system

1895
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:16,864
Is that it

1896
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,680
Really bums me out

1897
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,960
Because anytime

1898
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,496
It's like all the concert

1899
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:23,520
Says this

1900
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,800
I mean

1901
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:25,568
A lot of crazy

1902
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,640
It's not it's not a good or bad.

1903
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:32,736
Weird

1904
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,320
You can't change the f******

1905
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:45,024
I still don't know exactly what this is but

1906
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,400
Alright

1907
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:53,472
No longer the United States

1908
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:57,312
Merle Haggard

1909
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:04,992
Gas coming up and

1910
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:11,392
Trump sabotage infowars.com

1911
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:20,352
Carbon dioxide

1912
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:25,984
Behind

1913
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,800
Trump leaked when talk about that mumbler gas

1914
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:37,504
Amazing

1915
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:48,256
Don't know why

1916
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,024
Human being

1917
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:51,072
At this point you are a Muslim

1918
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,120
Because

1919
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,400
I don't know if you know this or not

1920
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,192
Muslims are also cute

1921
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:58,240
Yeah there's a lot

1922
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:00,032
And there's a lot for

1923
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:04,384
Yeah it's really bad stuff being done in

1924
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,664
Inwardly outward

1925
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,432
Delete all of it

1926
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,456
The others problems

1927
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,480
Who's in the community

1928
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,576
I just realized

1929
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,344
What business

1930
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,368
Cliff is where he talks

1931
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:18,720
About the Holocaust I apologize today

1932
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:21,024
For the second time

1933
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:22,816
We bring you the

1934
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,352
But

1935
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:26,912
Within this clip

1936
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,704
Alex wants to tell you a little bit

1937
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,728
About what he would like

1938
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,152
He probably.

1939
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:47,904
Hardcore history

1940
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,912
Country books when I was about six years old

1941
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,192
Red

1942
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:06,080
200-300

1943
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:10,176
University

1944
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,712
14

1945
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,248
About

1946
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:16,576
Yes you are a big store of knowledge

1947
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:23,488
Scholar level

1948
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:24,256
F*** you

1949
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,896
I understand the roots of the different Control Systems when I see them

1950
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,688
I know it's being built

1951
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:50,112
So he didn't read thousands of scholarly books

1952
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:53,440
There's an interesting thing that we can

1953
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:56,000
You know we can use exegesis

1954
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,560
Take his word

1955
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,864
See what's actually being said though

1956
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,656
It's possible

1957
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:05,472
They started to understand history

1958
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,496
When he was six

1959
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:08,032
2/8 to 10 years old

1960
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,360
Will know

1961
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:14,688
I'm saying he had a six-year-old understanding of History

1962
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:21,856
That's what I'm saying

1963
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:28,256
Possible you had this understand

1964
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,024
Meaning of AU

1965
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,048
Have a baby

1966
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:33,120
That able to read us both

1967
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:35,936
And he reads books and doesn't understand what he's reading

1968
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:39,264
What comes up with a fantasy narrative that a child might

1969
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,288
Okay

1970
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,568
And because

1971
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:43,104
He's so stubborn

1972
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:43,872
And

1973
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:46,688
I don't know I had a paranoid weirdo dad

1974
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,736
Okay never got correct

1975
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,272
You

1976
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:57,440
You are creating a Jenna General unified world theory of Alex

1977
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:00,768
Figuring out all that you are f****** full-on

1978
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:04,864
Zodiac Killer

1979
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:11,264
Trying so hard to get into his head space it's the only way for this to first of all be home

1980
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,056
Andy

1981
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,848
Not be boring

1982
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:17,152
So I think that

1983
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:19,200
He just fabricated that whole cloth

1984
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:22,272
He is not read he did not read

1985
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:24,576
Also also the

1986
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,856
The f******

1987
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,072
The headlines

1988
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:39,424
The books that they pretend to read

1989
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,192
He Redwood

1990
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,008
University

1991
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:48,128
But I was ten I read the Bible cover to cover

1992
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,944
And I've read other

1993
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,248
Another Bible

1994
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,856
I recognize that when I was 10

1995
01:44:58,112 --> 01:45:00,928
And I read the Bible I didn't really understand it

1996
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:02,464
In a way that I did when I was

1997
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,232
Taking

1998
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,768
Biblical classes in college

1999
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:09,120
Right when I was older person I had a more robust worldview I was able to

2000
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,144
More into

2001
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:13,472
Abstract language is more able to understand metaphor

2002
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,032
Contacts

2003
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:20,128
No matter who you are if you're 6 you're not

2004
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,664
Like what is that even

2005
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:23,200
Second grade

2006
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:27,296
First grade second grade

2007
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:29,344
You're not reading scholarly books

2008
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,112
Well

2009
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,904
Some second grade you might

2010
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:32,672
Hold them

2011
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,696
Do you know

2012
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:34,720
Do you know.

2013
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:36,768
Hop on Pop

2014
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,048
Okay well

2015
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:41,632
Pikachu

2016
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,936
You and most

2017
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,752
I would also

2018
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:48,800
Everything I own

2019
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:50,336
Yes which isn't much

2020
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,640
Exercise bike over there

2021
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:58,272
We have very little at stake of this Farm

2022
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:02,368
Anything that you have read more books

2023
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,720
Books than Alex Jones has

2024
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:09,280
In the past week in this entire life

2025
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:11,584
He

2026
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,608
Thousands of books

2027
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:13,888
Thousand

2028
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:17,472
Start to take his word

2029
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:18,752
And his own sort of

2030
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:22,080
Telling of his own history to get a better picture of

2031
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,616
Exactly why he is

2032
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,640
The kind of wrong

2033
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:26,688
Videos

2034
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:32,320
It is one of those things where you can learn a lot more about

2035
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,344
The Grecian

2036
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,112
People

2037
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,392
Okta

2038
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,672
Sometimes by the myths

2039
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,464
As it refers to the

2040
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,536
What what what externalization our culture holds

2041
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,816
The deer species

2042
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,960
Okay there

2043
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,544
Right there you look at it within

2044
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,080
In the context of their gods

2045
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:55,360
Isn't all of that stuff

2046
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:56,128
To see you

2047
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,152
The motivation

2048
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:59,200
Behind why they would believe

2049
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:00,992
Are doing

2050
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,784
That's why they would believe it

2051
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,088
Contact

2052
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,648
Mythology

2053
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,440
As being a

2054
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:11,232
Preternaturally gifted

2055
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:15,584
Six-year-old remember phone number

2056
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,864
Kids

2057
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,888
6

2058
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,984
Probably wants absolutely reading white papers

2059
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,008
White papers

2060
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:27,616
It was they were putting it out there when I say these things

2061
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:30,688
This picture of him I'm not doing it

2062
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:31,456
To get it like

2063
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,224
To justify

2064
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:36,320
I'm saying

2065
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:43,488
It's interesting and important to look at why a propagandist behave the way you're like an anthropology

2066
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,328
Somewhat

2067
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,608
Threatened

2068
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,376
Why are the

2069
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,400
The Pharaohs

2070
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:52,704
F****** weird

2071
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,472
Buried with your

2072
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,496
Your cat cats

2073
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:59,104
When that s*** going on here

2074
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,408
What's what I'm doing here

2075
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,688
What I'm doing

2076
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,992
Is I'm hearing up

2077
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,528
For when the collapse

2078
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:13,184
There's a terrible Civil War and then on the other end of it we try and figure out what how

2079
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:18,304
Happened for weeks I will be on

2080
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:24,960
Future MSNBC as a Alex Jones specialist

2081
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:30,336
I just tried to become an Alex Jones expert witness

2082
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:31,872
Yeah yeah

2083
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:33,664
Will be the first witness I would call

2084
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:40,064
In the trial of Alex Jones in his Nuremberg Trial you are on the list

2085
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,856
How to get to that part about the Holocaust

2086
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:46,208
It's just those who don't know history

2087
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:50,816
I only wish that I had time it's been years

2088
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:55,936
I know science fiction book

2089
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:03,360
Containers

2090
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:05,408
Watch football game

2091
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,480
Constantly wash the enemy showing

2092
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:15,136
Hiscox Diantha Copley watch with a direct no time

2093
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:19,744
Very vividly and

2094
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,536
At length about how football is

2095
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:23,072
Is just a retired

2096
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:29,472
No I meant to say men's testosterone I know that I know that's his

2097
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,752
He watches a lot of

2098
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,056
He totally watches

2099
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:37,408
The Superbowl on his else does

2100
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:40,224
Yeah he watches football

2101
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:45,088
He was going to boycott the Super Bowl and then live stream

2102
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,648
The his Sunday show

2103
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,696
While he talked s*** about George

2104
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,464
HW Bush

2105
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:51,744
For throwing a coin portal

2106
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,280
For that

2107
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:59,424
Police negative thing I hope

2108
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,008
Tell me about

2109
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:05,824
I just can't do it because

2110
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:18,880
Globalstar

2111
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:21,184
Receive the civilization the society

2112
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:26,816
The culture in Israel

2113
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:29,376
Israel

2114
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,664
Nordic

2115
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:51,904
Which is utterly ridiculous

2116
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:58,304
And wrong as can be right there

2117
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,608
Yeah

2118
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,888
1

2119
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,424
Perfectly correct

2120
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,544
Correct

2121
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:11,360
What religion is bad

2122
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:13,152
All all of the stuff

2123
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:15,200
All of it he's correct except

2124
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,480
Except

2125
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,760
Muslims

2126
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:18,784
Yeah

2127
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,832
Has been Meredith

2128
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:27,488
The culture is saying that all white people are inherently evil and no one

2129
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:33,888
But it's also too many of us to say to our face

2130
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,192
Has anybody ever

2131
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:40,800
Considered created by

2132
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,824
Yakub

2133
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:47,968
At this point as reasonable as everybody voting Trump for president

2134
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:52,576
All of all of it is reasonable right now

2135
01:51:55,392 --> 01:52:01,536
Everyone thinks they understand what these conversations about privilege

2136
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,560
Actually meme

2137
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,840
He has no G

2138
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:06,656
But it's like

2139
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:09,472
Didn't enslave anybody

2140
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:14,080
Well I mean but yeah

2141
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:21,504
I don't think that makes him inherently bad because of that

2142
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,528
Either but like

2143
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:25,088
His inability to understand and his

2144
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,112
Destin

2145
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:29,440
Need to take that s*** personally makes him think

2146
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:33,280
But everybody is saying that white people are inherently evil and therefore

2147
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,864
The victims of an impending genocide that's

2148
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:37,632
Being made right

2149
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:40,192
It is so hard

2150
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,472
It is so hard

2151
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:42,752
Listen to any of

2152
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:44,032
In the context

2153
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:44,800
Them spending

2154
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:45,568
So much time

2155
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:46,848
I'm saying that everybody else

2156
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:53,248
He says a white genocide is

2157
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,272
Because everybody

2158
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:55,808
White people

2159
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:57,856
And I hate

2160
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:58,624
Muslim

2161
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,392
Play the victim

2162
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:00,160
Yep

2163
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:05,024
How is black lives matter a cop killer

2164
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:06,816
How do we

2165
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,096
How do we fight against

2166
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,120
What

2167
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,144
What route

2168
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:16,032
Trick and they're available there is none

2169
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:16,800
Is that hard

2170
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:17,568
There's none

2171
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:24,480
Commit white genocide

2172
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:27,808
Darling

2173
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:32,160
In order for him to deal with the press conference

2174
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:32,928
Yes

2175
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:40,096
He actually ends up talking about another press conference but trouble so did that day

2176
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,120
Axilla

2177
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:46,496
I want to get to a bunch of Clubs trumpism

2178
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:49,056
I better get a small extra next hour

2179
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,872
Economy Inn

2180
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,344
When he just gets

2181
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:05,440
That's not ahead by the commercial evolution

2182
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:09,280
It's a big deal

2183
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:12,864
The very edge of death

2184
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:15,424
And demoralisation

2185
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,544
Shuffle around

2186
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:23,616
Programmed unhappy.

2187
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:26,688
Connection to the spiritual universe

2188
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:30,528
And that is now coming back into the world self respect

2189
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:32,832
Belief

2190
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:40,768
America

2191
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,352
Shutterstock

2192
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:53,056
Can I have something

2193
01:54:58,176 --> 01:55:01,248
Build a civilization

2194
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,576
We can go to the stars together but we're not going to be

2195
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:07,136
Run over by a bunch of Zuckerberg

2196
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:11,744
Alliance with China and some pipe dream

2197
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:16,608
Whole system's getting

2198
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:17,888
We're teaching you

2199
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,960
Two cabbage

2200
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:24,032
I want to listen to the eclipse

2201
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,568
What is

2202
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:29,664
Houses are so long

2203
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,712
But okay

2204
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:33,760
Disease in China is

2205
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:36,576
What is

2206
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:38,112
What is not being

2207
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:38,880
How does

2208
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:42,464
Civilization right now

2209
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:48,608
Do they not have one thousands of you

2210
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:51,168
The common man on the street

2211
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:51,936
It's maybe not doing

2212
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:58,336
Compared to what they were 30 years ago

2213
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:04,736
Straight like it's not good it's not but it's a lot like America

2214
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:05,760
The industrial

2215
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:07,808
A lot of

2216
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:08,576
Also

2217
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,768
Elsa that come with

2218
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:18,048
Haribol

2219
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:24,448
But also I love the line

2220
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,752
I know what that's how the

2221
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:33,152
I don't have never heard of that turn of phrase

2222
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:36,224
Do you know

2223
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:37,248
So you got a cow

2224
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:38,784
Alright

2225
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:50,560
Not China America

2226
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:56,192
The other day about how it's

2227
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:57,728
That's really absurd

2228
01:56:57,984 --> 01:57:01,312
To imagine

2229
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:06,432
All of the parts

2230
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:07,968
The plane rebuilt in the same

2231
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:08,736
Same place

2232
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,272
How it works is there's different

2233
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:11,296
Three component parts

2234
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:17,696
Tractor parts actually are made already

2235
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:21,024
Well there's a lot of stuff that's hard to transport

2236
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,560
If you need resources

2237
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:29,472
And let's not f******

2238
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:32,032
Split hairs the idea Factory job saving

2239
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,384
It's a saying

2240
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:38,432
Did not recognize how automation

2241
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,968
Absolutely

2242
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:42,272
Going to take all the jobs

2243
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:46,368
But actually reading a really really

2244
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,648
Good

2245
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:48,416
Thought

2246
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,952
About how

2247
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:50,720
This camp

2248
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:52,512
Both

2249
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,048
Werehog

2250
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:55,072
Getting back to the

2251
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:56,352
This vision of America

2252
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:57,632
From the night

2253
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:59,168
1950s folksy

2254
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:02,752
Yeah they are like they're the personal

2255
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:04,032
Grandfather was a

2256
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:04,800
Small business

2257
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:07,872
ISO

2258
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:13,504
Like that's not a story that resonates at like

2259
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:14,528
Our Generation

2260
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:17,344
And we're watching climate change

2261
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,880
Happened to us

2262
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:23,488
F****** February

2263
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:28,608
Culver opening in La where the fire trucks are falling

2264
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:31,168
Flood coming

2265
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:33,984
Real bad

2266
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:34,752
Till 5 years

2267
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,032
Like

2268
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:37,056
Why didn't

2269
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:38,080
Why isn't

2270
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:42,432
Cooking monster

2271
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:46,784
But tomorrow if he comes out and says we're going to be the most radical

2272
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,576
Country on fighting climate change

2273
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,600
As we possibly can

2274
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:56,000
He's going to be better for us than any other but because so much of that regulation

2275
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:00,864
But look at this next clip

2276
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:02,400
And I I'm going to make

2277
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,240
Was just looking to this all the way through

2278
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:10,080
It also gives us some weird inside

2279
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:10,848
Has passed

2280
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:14,688
Are you believe in ism

2281
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:16,736
But what he ends up talking about is

2282
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:18,528
One of those horrible examples of talks

2283
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:19,552
Masculinity

2284
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:21,856
And I really think the story is to

2285
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:23,904
The globalist

2286
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:29,280
Control Revolution to the university they only control the big donors and the corporate branch

2287
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,400
All human Rebellion to be socialist or comics

2288
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,472
Decentralized system they control

2289
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:43,872
Can you get demoralize and you're so dumb down

2290
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:47,456
What college degree

2291
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:54,368
Screwed up

2292
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,976
Competency

2293
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:07,168
And that were just absolutely really scary

2294
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:09,984
What kind of the end of America

2295
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:17,152
Wanted to go see movies like gangs people meet in the parking lot with chains and knives and

2296
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:22,528
They call that Justin movie so that's what a person

2297
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:24,576
Used to be

2298
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:28,160
People shed

2299
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:40,448
Knowing there be multiple people there they're all into the dark

2300
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:46,336
Bashas Hospital still win

2301
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:50,176
Where is that today that that's a fighting spirit

2302
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:52,992
Neither

2303
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,880
Pretty much it

2304
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:02,208
Really bad

2305
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:02,976
Every time

2306
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:06,304
I just want but in there cuz you yelling over

2307
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,352
You even saying

2308
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:10,400
I got

2309
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:11,680
Switch got flipped

2310
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:12,448
Yeah

2311
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:13,728
And then I became a

2312
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:16,800
F*** you you made a gesture and I'm not

2313
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:19,104
Entirely sure that this is what he

2314
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:24,224
Cement that looks like you

2315
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:31,904
Which would apply

2316
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:35,744
People got hurt real bad

2317
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,536
Why what

2318
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:40,096
Why would you this is such a lie

2319
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:44,448
Masculinity

2320
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:47,008
No and then

2321
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:52,384
Lemon learn not to flip that switch

2322
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:57,504
Even have that switch or you wouldn't want to go or you're trying to take us

2323
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:59,552
Because you haven't been there as adults

2324
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:05,952
You didn't go through Rites of Passage you're still trying to be men Zuckerberg

2325
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:07,744
Cannot be part of this control freak

2326
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:09,024
Ciocca Schmitt

2327
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:10,304
All of you but

2328
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:13,888
You just come from trash

2329
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,448
That's why I guess trash begets trash

2330
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:23,360
F****** in

2331
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:26,688

2339
02:02:41,536 --> 02:02:42,048
It is

2340
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:44,864
Basically

2341
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:45,632
Like

2342
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:49,472

Right on with what

2351
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:13,792
Terrifying

2352
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:16,096
Man would go beat each other up in the woods

2353
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:20,704
Roast

2354
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:21,728

2355
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:23,264
Plan ahead

2356
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:26,080
Whenever I

2357
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:27,872
I got bullied a lot

2358
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:30,944
And I was a nerd

2359
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:32,224
I was chubby as a kid

2360
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,808
Took me as a good Target

2361
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:37,600

Being a manly because I didn't go. Being a f******

2367
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:59,104
Amanda

2368
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,432
Globalist

2369
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:09,856

2372
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:18,048
Asian

2373
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:21,888
I don't understand what it is where

2374
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:28,544
Masculinity is all that matters

2375
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,848
I don't want to live in that world that's no

2376
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:32,128
It's a bad world

2377
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:36,992
I also don't want to necessarily live in Alex Jones is fake fantasy-world

2378
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:37,760
Lesbian create

2379
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:41,344
We're men and women don't exist

2380
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,624
Or anything like that

2381
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:43,904
Like I don't

2382
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:48,512
The idea of trans identity and

2383
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:50,560
Gender fluidity

2384
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:53,888
Don't at all threatened masculinity orphan

2385
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,704
No they don't at all if anything they

2386
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:58,496
Games

2387
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,544
From everything game

2388
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:05,152
Accepting a broader spectrum of reality

2389
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:06,944
It's okay

2390
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:10,784
You learn

2391
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:13,088
What it comes down to

2392
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,368
We've hit on it

2393
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:15,392
Couple times already

2394
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:16,416
Episode it's that

2395
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:18,464
I don't understand privilege

2396
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:20,256
I don't understand

2397
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:24,352
What these marginalized groups are actually saying

2398
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:26,912
I take it personally and I get mad about

2399
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:29,472
And frankly you don't understand the lesson

2400
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:30,496
To be learned

2401
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:31,264
From Westside

2402
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:35,616
You love it

2403
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:38,688
He learned one lesson and that is that he likes

2404
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:40,736
To be in America

2405
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:44,064
He's referencing the Warriors

2406
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:50,464
Warriors come out to Alex do you remember that part in the Warriors where they

2407
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:56,864
One guy tries to rape a police officer for that something Alex

2408
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:58,656
In the middle of a broadcast Village

2409
02:05:58,912 --> 02:06:00,960
Remember that partner Warriors

2410
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:03,776
Warriors

2411
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:10,432
Kissena Park

2412
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:16,832
Female police officer on a park bench

2413
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:17,600
Have you gone

2414
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:18,368
F**

2415
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:24,768
Holyshit this was okay it's fine that was the world we lived

2416
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:28,096
My six abroad

2417
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:34,496
Strokes of the Warriors is a really interesting story that's being told

2418
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:36,032
You can't

2419
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:39,104
You can't go back and watch so many movies without being like

2420
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:43,456
Do you like really clunky understanding of

2421
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:44,480
People in the seven

2422
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:46,272
Go back and watch

2423
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:49,344
Eddie Murphy special without being like

2424
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:54,720
No oh no oh nice, man

2425
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:57,280
We only have a couple left

2426
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,304
This

2427
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:01,120
It's called I don't remember what it is but I know that it's him

2428
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:02,400
I'm saying something really

2429
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,424
Sincere and serious

2430
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:04,704
I meant pivoting

2431
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:05,728
Hard into an app

2432
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:09,312
Which I always f****** love

2433
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:11,360
How do you how do you

2434
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:12,640
Is it from

2435
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:14,944
White genocide is happening

2436
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:15,712
2

2437
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:18,528
My dad makes his toothpaste

2438
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:20,064
Gods

2439
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:26,464
Do not understand that you all right we got weird pills

2440
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:39,264
Roundup

2441
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:42,080
Also it is that you can see the transition from like

2442
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:46,688
Demagogue Alex into salesman Alex

2443
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:51,552
Call amount

2444
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:53,600
Yeah calling all of them

2445
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:58,208
Going to see you again

2446
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:03,584
We defeat them we win

2447
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:10,752
Not be a bunch of losers we've gotten to the point where anything's possible

2448
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:17,152
Future

2449
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:19,456
Also I'd like

2450
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:21,504
I'd like to just take a second to be like

2451
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:28,160
Also I like the idea of

2452
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:37,376
A real bummer

2453
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:39,168

02:19:45,024 --> 02:19:45,792
I don't care

2646
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:47,840
Nothing happens to agree with me

2647
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:50,912
Whatever if Dave and it

2648
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:52,960
Tells me that Trump is garbage

2649
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:53,728
I'm like

2650
02:19:54,496 --> 02:20:00,640
Good on you Dave for my 20

2651
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:14,720

He's got the documents

2662
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:56,704
He doesn't just talk about John Brennan who he believes is a lobbyist

2663
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:57,472
Because he has

2664
02:20:57,728 --> 02:20:59,008
Islamic sympathy

2665
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:02,080

02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:12,736
Would love

2688
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:15,808
Nothing more than four people that advocate

I don't know

2697
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:44,224

Put people who have on his side

2699
02:22:47,296 --> 02:22:49,344

02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:17,408
I can't listen to this now without questioning whether Trump is laying a lazy verse

2826
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:20,480
I've been infected now.

2827
02:32:20,736 --> 02:32:25,856

2828

2835
02:32:39,424 --> 02:32:39,936
F****** crazy

2836
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:42,240
Alex

2837
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:45,056
Is playing just this quick because it's where he's not interacting

2838
02:32:45,312 --> 02:32:47,360
Question

2839
02:32:47,616 --> 02:32:48,384
Prepared statement

2840
02:32:48,896 --> 02:32:49,920
Observe

2841
02:32:53,504 --> 02:32:55,808
Doesn't sound crazy

2842
02:32:56,064 --> 02:32:58,368
Because he's not being hold on

2843
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:02,464
So you only like what he just said

2844
02:33:02,976 --> 02:33:04,768
Comparatively speaking

2845
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:06,048
Doesn't sound crazy

2846
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:07,840
That's how

2847
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:10,656
Through the Looking-Glass baby

2848
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:15,520
Through what they have to go through

2849
02:33:32,416 --> 02:33:38,560
35%

2850
02:33:45,472 --> 02:33:47,264
Yeah

2851
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:56,736
I don't fully disagree with him again government is always a mess

2852
02:33:56,992 --> 02:33:59,808
Is always entrenched interests

2853
02:34:00,064 --> 02:34:03,392
Natsu have to untangle

2854
02:34:03,904 --> 02:34:04,672
But he inherited

2855
02:34:04,928 --> 02:34:05,952
Compared to what

2856
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:06,720
Inherited

2857
02:34:06,976 --> 02:34:08,256
8 years prior

2858
02:34:08,768 --> 02:34:10,816
It's Unthinkable to think that he

2859
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:13,888
Do you know what I've never come out there and be like

2860
02:34:14,656 --> 02:34:15,424
Wow this is a mess

2861

I've never looked at a pile of laundry on my floor

2862
02:34:19,264 --> 02:34:20,544
Damn it I hate this mess

2863
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:21,824
You know what I'm going to do

2864
02:34:22,592 --> 02:34:26,176
Burn the blame.

2865
02:34:27,968 --> 02:34:32,064
Keep the store going to blame whoever sold me these clothes wherever they came from

2866
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:35,136
Inherited this f****** meso what I'm going to

I haven't done laundry

2870
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:46,912
So I'm going

2871
02:34:47,424 --> 02:34:48,960
To tell everyone who says I stink

2872
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:50,752
Okay

2873
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:52,544
How about start from the beginning

2874
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,568
All right and I'm going to drop

2875
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:56,640
I'm on the highway

2876
02:34:57,152 --> 02:34:58,688
On-the-fly way

2877
02:34:59,712 --> 02:35:05,856
Like this.

2878
02:35:06,624 --> 02:35:08,160
Home and abroad

2879
02:35:09,952 --> 02:35:12,512
Amen jobs are pouring out of the country

2880
02:35:12,768 --> 02:35:14,304
They're not be what's going on with

2881
02:35:18,912 --> 02:35:20,960
Definitely not

2882
02:35:22,752 --> 02:35:25,056
Ability overseas don't matter where you look

2883
02:35:25,312 --> 02:35:27,872
Cuz the Middle East

2884
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:30,944
Take care of it all

02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:32,480
How

2886
02:35:35,552 --> 02:35:37,344
Preemptive like

2887
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:40,416
Alright when this goes poorly just know that it's not my

2888
02:35:40,672 --> 02:35:46,816
Do it work a little bit but I know and I'd my bosses know I'm kind

2889
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:52,448
Kind of line that are overdue

2890
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:53,984
I'm just starting

2891
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:57,056
I can't get all of this

2892
02:35:58,336 --> 02:36:00,384
First realtor first rule of government

2893
02:36:00,896 --> 02:36:01,920
Blame the guys before

2894
02:36:04,224 --> 02:36:04,736
For it

2895
02:36:06,016 --> 02:36:06,784
Go for it

2896
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:10,624
Here. You're doing what everybody else

2897
02:36:13,696 --> 02:36:14,208
I mean

2898
02:36:19,584 --> 02:36:21,376
We're killing people with flying robots

2899
02:36:24,448 --> 02:36:25,216
The Middle East

2900
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:26,496
It's been a mess

2901
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:28,800
I think it's in the Bible

2902
02:36:29,056 --> 02:36:31,104
Is in the Bible

2903
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:34,176
North Korea

2904
02:36:34,688 --> 02:36:35,200
Agreed

2905
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:36,736
Yeah

2906
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:43,136
His thing we're going to take care of it it's the scariest part of North Korea North Korea

2907
02:36:43,392 --> 02:36:45,440
I am afraid of trump saying

2908
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:46,720
We're going to take

2909
02:36:46,976 --> 02:36:51,840
Caravan

2910
02:36:52,352 --> 02:36:56,960
Because anytime he says we're going to take care of it in my mind I hear

2911
02:36:57,472 --> 02:36:59,264
Exactly

2912
02:37:01,312 --> 02:37:02,592
Kill Kim Jeong Hoon

2913
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:03,360

2915
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:05,408
Killed him

2916
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:07,968
Thought it was a prank show

2917
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:09,248
What the f***

2918
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:13,088
You know what's even crazier

2919
02:37:13,344 --> 02:37:19,488
Implying that Kim John

2920
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:21,792
Probably has a false flag

2921
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:26,912
The only thing makes sense

2922
02:37:27,424 --> 02:37:31,008
He was a Defector

2923
02:37:31,264 --> 02:37:31,776
He left

2924
02:37:32,032 --> 02:37:32,544
Korea

2925
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:34,080
Like his dad

2926
02:37:34,336 --> 02:37:40,480
Like him that's why Kim Jeong Hoon isn't power I didn't know anything about that

2927
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:46,368
He's got it

2928
02:37:46,624 --> 02:37:47,392
Anyway

Large sections of the world

2945

Criminal law

2959
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:55,136
That's what government supposed to do

2960
02:39:55,648 --> 02:39:56,160
And

2961
02:40:00,256 --> 02:40:00,768
Okay

2962
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:04,608

There's another one Boogeyman

2968
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:15,616
Now

2969
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:20,992
Are we so low on Boogeyman that we're still going after Hillary

2970
02:40:21,504 --> 02:40:25,344
Hillary Hillary is actually directing the

2971
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:26,880
The press to do what it's doing

2972
02:40:27,136 --> 02:40:28,416
Through Soros funding

2973
02:40:28,672 --> 02:40:29,184
And what have you

Hint

2983
02:40:45,824 --> 02:40:46,848
Because there are so few

2984
02:40:47,104 --> 02:40:48,896
If know is

2985
02:40:49,152 --> 02:40:50,176
If there is a terrorist

2986
02:40:50,432 --> 02:40:50,944
Attack

2987
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:51,712
It's over

2988
02:40:51,968 --> 02:40:52,736
Right

2989
02:40:53,248 --> 02:40:54,272
What Nara I mean

2992
02:40:56,320 --> 02:40:58,112
If the government we have now gets it

2993
02:40:58,368 --> 02:40:58,880
Terrorist attack

2994
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:02,208
Sentence on America

2995
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:03,232

Yeah yeah

2997
02:41:04,512 --> 02:41:06,304
They get to end the world

2998
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:08,096
Basically going

2999
02:41:08,352 --> 02:41:10,400
To do Trump has indicated he's very willing

3000
02:41:10,912 --> 02:41:11,680
Nuclear weapons

3001
02:41:11,936 --> 02:41:15,264
If there's any kind of justification for it

3002
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:16,800
Yeah because he thinks that will help

3003
02:41:18,336 --> 02:41:19,872
Books on nuclear weapons when he was sick

3004
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:21,664
Arthritis Alex

3005
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:22,688
Now that Alex

Trump

3007
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:24,736
Trump has been

3008
02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:25,504
Planning

3009
02:41:26,528 --> 02:41:27,296
Since he was 12

3010
02:41:27,552 --> 02:41:29,600
She's been aware

3011
02:41:30,368 --> 02:41:32,416
Trump has known The Game Plan

3014
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:39,072
I want to go both we both ran out of gas

3015
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:41,120
Immediately once the wrap

3016
02:41:42,656 --> 02:41:43,936
Ulta

3017
02:41:44,192 --> 02:41:48,800
Is just him responding yet now there's no way this is going to snow

3018
02:41:49,824 --> 02:41:50,848
The parts of Trumps

3019
02:41:51,104 --> 02:41:53,152
Press conference that are not on hinge

3020
02:41:53,664 --> 02:41:56,992
I'm not yelling it

3021
02:41:57,248 --> 02:41:59,296
Members of the press

3022
02:41:59,552 --> 02:42:02,368
Complete dick to people for no reason

3023
02:42:02,624 --> 02:42:06,976
Registering a series of Lies I think about how

3024
02:42:07,232 --> 02:42:09,536
Out-of-control he was how abusive he was

3025
02:42:09,792 --> 02:42:10,304
Two people

3026
02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:13,632
Israel

3027
02:42:14,656 --> 02:42:19,264
Unhinged a man shouting lies

3028
02:42:19,776 --> 02:42:23,104
Yeah what reporter asked him about the

3029
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:24,128
Bomb threats

3030
02:42:24,384 --> 02:42:24,896
Synagogue around

3031
02:42:30,016 --> 02:42:31,296
No he's a phrase

3032
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:32,832
His answer was

3033
02:42:33,344 --> 02:42:37,952
People make this claim I hate this claim I am the least racist person you'll ever hear

3034
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:40,000
I'm the least anti-semitic person

3035
02:42:40,512 --> 02:42:41,280
Alex Drummond

3036
02:42:42,048 --> 02:42:42,560
Play Van

3037
02:42:42,816 --> 02:42:44,096
I quit because if he did

3038
02:42:44,352 --> 02:42:46,656
He would have to be like okay now here

3039
02:42:47,424 --> 02:42:52,800
Trump has no listening comprehension understand what this person is actually asking her

3040
02:42:53,056 --> 02:42:55,616
Trump's gold argument

3041
02:42:55,872 --> 02:42:57,408
He did not get a good score

3042
02:42:57,664 --> 02:43:01,504
Every single question that was asked at that press conference was not answered

3043
02:43:02,016 --> 02:43:03,552
According to the question that was

3044
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:06,112
So Alex doesn't talk about

3045
02:43:06,368 --> 02:43:06,880
Any of that

3046
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:08,416
All he does

3047
02:43:08,672 --> 02:43:09,440
Is her about

3048
02:43:09,696 --> 02:43:10,976
5 minutes of his

3049
02:43:11,232 --> 02:43:12,512
3 hour broadcast

3050
02:43:14,816 --> 02:43:16,096
You takes 5 minutes

3051
02:43:16,864 --> 02:43:19,424
To play the part where Trump is just talking

3052
02:43:19,936 --> 02:43:20,960
And not answering question

3053
02:43:21,472 --> 02:43:21,984
He's lying

3054
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:23,520
But he's not yelling and he's not

3055
02:43:23,776 --> 02:43:24,288
Combative

3056
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:25,312
He's like

3057
02:43:25,568 --> 02:43:26,592
Now the media is going to

3058
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:28,640
That he's crazy

3059
02:43:29,152 --> 02:43:29,664
Issaquah

3060
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:34,784
Is that the only part that you're actually listening to like if you're getting all of your news from Alex

3061
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:41,184
You might think of that other stuff didn't happen even if that's the only part you're listening to

3062
02:43:41,952 --> 02:43:42,464
Brazy

3063
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:45,792
If not if you actually believe there are globalist Boogeyman

3064
02:43:46,304 --> 02:43:48,352
Razee the media should spin

3065
02:43:48,608 --> 02:43:52,192
If that was all that I read on a transcript

3066
02:43:53,728 --> 02:43:55,264
I don't know why

3067
02:43:57,824 --> 02:43:59,360

02:44:09,088 --> 02:44:10,624
The only transcript

3070
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:12,672
That would be enough for me

3071
02:44:22,912 --> 02:44:23,424
They're supposed to

3072
02:44:25,728 --> 02:44:26,240
