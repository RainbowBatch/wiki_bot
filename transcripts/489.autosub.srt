00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Jordan

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320
College fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Nick.com

6
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,608
Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,888
What's up

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,936
Well my bright spots

9
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,984
Cut it goes along with the

10
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
The let's say the end of the Avenue recordings that offshore kind of inspired

11
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:24,224
But the potential of things that I've started working on something

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
Okay but I'm very reinvigorated by

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,976
A lot of the stuff that we talked about like that how boring Alex is in the present-day of stuff

14
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:39,584
I have found something that is tickling my interest

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Bone Thugs

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
And

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,728
I guess this is kind of Dez so your bright spot is Mystery

18
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,312
Yeah a little bit but I feel like I feel like I found

19
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,688
A Direction I want to go down and I'm very excited about that and there'll be more details about that forthcoming.

20
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Absolute value

21
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,272
I have a bit of a mix

22
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,832
Ever bright spot dark spot

23
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
So I told you

24
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,440
We might have a bright spot previously.

25
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,024
Getting my partner a birthday

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,680
I was so worried this was about like things going bad with about God

27
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
The s*** out of it

28
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,568
He's played all that okay cool I did I got her a good gift

29
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104
I got her a tennis

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Bracket

31
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,736
Was good tennis racket and I gave it to early

32
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Because

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Her birthday is in the fall

34
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
We might not be able to play

35
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,392
Seasonal

36
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
What I had my back

37
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
Pocket was that on her birthday

38
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:44,608
I had scheduled like fruit arrangement to be deliver Edible Arrangements

39
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:50,240
Percent chocolate dipped strawberries

40
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,384
So who's going to show up on her birthday she was like oh my God it wasn't that you already gave me over

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Is going to be fantastic

42
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
Exactly like that

43
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,280
Whatever

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
Somebody rang the doorbell and I went up and it was the guy delivering the thing not her birthday

45
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:30,432
I looked at it I grabbed it and I looked down and it had the correct date on it delivered

46
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
Big

47
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
On top of

48
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,296
Yeah and I just looked at the guy when he was like

49
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600
Alright man good job and then just left

50
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
Into the middle of the night you texted me about this complaining and I berated you how I don't

51
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,560
The guy got it there early

52
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:51,424
It's just hot it's the gesture and the symbolism

53
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,264
And it's a perishable

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,664
No no longer going to survive to the birthday

55
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,272
The situation we're like you can get around the uncomfortableness

56
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,600
That's good that we could actually like

57
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:15,232
Cause of fight

58
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,303
I'm happy that their birthday present thing worked out

59
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,375
And everything

60
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
Alright Jordan

61
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
Alright alright

62
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,031
Today we got an episode is it alright it's alright

63
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:33,663
Okay so we're going to talk about October 2nd through 4th 2020

64
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:38,271
Checking over the weekend cuz I think there was news that rocked the world

65
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
Oh oh

66
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
Know what was it

67
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
Suicide

68
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,511
The book drop nearby my place

69
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,071
Shutting down that's not the news are you sure

70
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:57,471
Larry Nichols has passed away

71
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
The world will never be the same

72
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
I feel

73
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
She's in heaven now

74
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,639
I feel real weird about that because

75
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
I mean I was aware that the key was probably going to die soon

76
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
Did that me like an obituary for him

77
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
I wasn't

78
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
Surprise cuz I have been trying to

79
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
Find a way to do a Wacky Wednesday about his YouTube channel sure cuz he's got a YouTube channel

80
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
And it's just trash most of the stuff was awful

81
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
But don't like lately there had been like some stuff about him being in the hospital

82
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,199
I don't know if I believe it and I don't like him not too long ago and it was

83
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:44,831
This is the case with Larry like he's been on death's doorstep for 10 years on Alex's show

84
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,415
So I never really knew what to take seriously but

85
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
I mean he was one of the most

86
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Cancerous

87
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,631
Forces and politicking in any way celebrating his death or anyting

88
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
But

89
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:03,007
I think we can trace a lot of the style and bullshitted project Veritas all the way back

90
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,567
Too f****** Larry goddamn nickels

91
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
And so much of the

92
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
The stuff about Clinton

93
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
Fear comes directly

94
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,991
He put out

95
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
So

96
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
I bring this up because

97
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
It does

98
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
You know it's

99
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Huge

100
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
On some level

101
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
Larry Nichols is a

102
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
Huge horse

103
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,071
In conservative politics for the last

104
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,887
30 years

105
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
He died

106
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,983
Yeah and Alex doesn't bring it up at home

107
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
It is here's what

108
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,151
He's out with his friends Nichols for years here's the problem dad

109
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,967
It's like if you and I were on the plane with the Big Bopper

110
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
All right you're going to get lost in the news

111
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:51,391
Could have been front-page obit man oh man

112
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:56,511
You're not the most famous version of the blade right now Larry I'm sorry it bums me out

113
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,559
If only because of like

114
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,119
The place that he should occupy

115
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,519
In Alex's world the place that he should occupy there is a celebrated pleasure and he's passing should be a Moana

116
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
Reflection and Rick

117
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Cognition

118
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,871
As opposed to I don't even know if it comes up

119
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:18,015
Yeah I don't know that's really sad because even dedicated his life to creating things that Alex could use to demonize

120
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
Yep it is political enemies and now

121
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
828

122
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:28,511
Explain to these guys that you are literally a cog in the machine of your own psycop

123
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
No one will care

124
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
When you are gone

125
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,399
It's a bummer it's a real bummer

126
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
All kind of must know that

127
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,919
I was sad about

128
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
Well exit

129
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,671

I got your website now that's right.

150
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,271
You could do is you could take an order for your generosity

151
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,087
Alright hang on to it it's supposed to be delivered later

152
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,623
But let me tell you something

153
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
You are too good

154
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:36,767
You care too much so you're going to take that generosity you're going to deliver it

155
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Fully

156
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
Way too early and it's going to work out while I'm trying to do the tire together with the brightness

157
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,031
You not your Fury at me the moment I start talking

158
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Is so disappointing

159
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,967
2121 what do you mean it's too simple.

160
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,319
Something complex something interesting

161
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
Alright

162
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:13,119
I'm just going to take transcripts of your older ones and I'll just read those who you talkin to would that make you feel that

163
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,167
We're going

164
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
Yes

165
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Do that

166
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
Alright

167
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
I think we're doing great

168
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:28,223
Has bet most likely I think the better aspect of this bed is way better than I've ever been

169
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:35,391
Obviously when I said that the big news was that Larry Nichols has passed that was a

170
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
Of course gouffon

171
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,511
The fact that Trump got killed

172
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:47,167
And I know is that we recorded on Thursday

173
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,727
I'm sitting here editing lalala

174
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,847
This episode took I took forever to prepare about the debate we did a lot of work

175
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:01,247
And then as I'm editing the news breaks the Trump got positive test for covid

176
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
Now I don't get a weekend

177
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:10,463
Emergency episode

178
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Have been caused to

179
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
Based on the content that Alex is putting out

180
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:19,423
But you know it did make the episode that we put out feel a little bit older

181
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,031
The new cycle had moved the debate has gone

182
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
From everyone's mind forever

183
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:31,967
On Sunday evening and who knows what will be the reality we're in by Monday

184
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
When you're listening to this

185
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,623
Somebody happened we don't know about at 3 a.m.

186
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
Monday morning

187
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,255
And you listen to our episode of hoping to hear what Alex is

188
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:49,631
The sex buddy I'm sorry I don't know yet

189
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,983
Do Alex I think in obvious fashion

190
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,311
A recognizes on Friday on October 2nd

191
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
When you get to the studio

192
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Wow

193
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
Other that's not the right way to put it

194
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
But as soon as he starts the show he's got to bring it up

195
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
L 20/20

196
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
We are 30

197
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
2 days

198
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
They will

199
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Balkanization

200
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Melania

201
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
So he's he's raising his head on

202
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
At least

203
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
Has anybody checked to see how pechanec

204
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
Taking the news that Melania

205
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,271
It has got to be over

206
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,367
Steve does not come into play on this episode

207
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:47,231
These three days of time

208
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Nothing really

209
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,863
Oh yeah I suppose you can't have those guys on there but you might get too crazy

210
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
President Maui

211
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:04,127
We gotta shoot everyone with the president at Walter Reed hospital to take the lighthouse

212
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:12,319
We Gather forty or fifty good men then we rule this country

213
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:18,719
Department

214
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,023
Alex

215
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,399
One of those big things is I got called it I knew this was going to happen

216
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Let's talk about

217
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
Many times

218
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Said that one scenario

219
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
The president

220
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Near

221
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
The election day

222
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
414

223
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
Economy

224
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Warehouse

225
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,911
So Alex had to dig up a clip from six months past

226
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
Of him

227
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,495
Saying that they might give Trump covid

228
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,079
But it had nothing to do with like near the election ready

229
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
I've listened to you this show

230
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,455
The pretty consistently and I don't think that

231
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,783
I would characterize that as one of Alex's big theories

232
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,903
I think that he might be giving himself a little bit too much credit for saying everything I do you think

233
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,023
Yeah I was six months ago I speculated to drop my kid covid and now haha I'm right.

234
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
No

235
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:30,399
Considering the number and volume of series that I have thrown at the wall

236
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
I'm pretty stoked that I got this 16 months ago huh

237
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
Whatever

238
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
So

239
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:46,527
Approach that Alex is taking on Friday and I think it's a little bit sad but it is what it is

240
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
5

241
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
Positive

242
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Call Shane

243
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
Deposit

244
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,415
Whole football team

245
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,511
So that's his first two it's really interesting

246
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
Like okay what if it's fake

247
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
No one's no one's talking about whether or not this is a fake it's a f****** president

248
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
Not this is a false positive

249
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
Because

250
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,895
People understand the science

251
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
It's and I don't so I'm asking

252
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,479
Questions that no one would ask unless

253
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
May have not

254
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,319
Please somebody tell me what's going on is the president

255
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,391
This is the first volley is

256
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,207
Is a false positive

257
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,047
That you can make up your own soda Theory as to what's going on from there

258
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,095
Not actually sick

259
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,167
Okay I don't know give him a false positive

260
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,311
Wow this. Might develop as the show goes along

261
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Well Alex

262
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
Information that you need

263
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
And it's the information that the world

264
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
Beyond

265
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
World

266
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Information

267
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
We'll just

268
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Listen to me

269
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Rush Limbaugh

270
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,111
We can save America in the world if everyone will just sound like me DNA

271
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
That's silly

272
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:07,071
See recording from the bunker did he did make the decision to go to the bunker it's interesting that you're asking

273
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
That's because

274
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
He is not in studio

275
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,215
I think I tell Romeo he's at home

276
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Okay

277
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
And

278
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
Work-from-home day

279
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
Well

280
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Weird

281
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:26,527
Use their home for the first half hour of the show what did you say to me then David night and Owen Shroyer

282
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
Your takeover

283
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,903
And then at the end of the second hour Alex shows up at the studio

284
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
Okay

285
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:38,303
Nick begich takes over the floor hour okay

286
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
I don't know what's going on

287
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
I guess you just

288
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
You just can't show up 30 minutes late for

289
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
You can show up

290
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
2 hours late first

291
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
My big theory is that Alex

292
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,639
Who's going to take the day off

293
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
And then he woke up

294
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
And the president die

295
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,575
He woke up at like 10:30 or something like that

296
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,975
Couldn't have enough time to get to the studio by the time the beginning of the show then

297
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
And drove in

298
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Write my theory

299
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,839
Yeah it seems like it makes the most sense

300
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,423
He would have taken the day off for sure if it's news hadn't broken

301
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,007
And then like fuk I got to go in on my day off

302
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,543
This isn't one of these big

303
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,151
Pieces of news that I can just let David and Owen cover I actually have to come in

304
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
So

305
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
The bottom line though is

306
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
This is a visible spot

307
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Listen to me

308
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Very

309
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Very

310
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Very

311
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
How carefully

312
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Understand that

313
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
Along with

314
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
So it's

315
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,663
I was as proof that it dis test is almost certainly false positive

316
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
Home he's not even in the office

317
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
Where is he going to get this f****** proof

318
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
Infowars.com man

319
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:12,255
Prove covid-19

320
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:19,423
Proof of that he provides is exactly that it's just a bunch of

321
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Coronavirus

322
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
What's up

323
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
You won the lottery

324
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Didn't really win

325
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,527
Who won the lottery menu 1

326
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
No

327
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
The airtight

328
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Appositive

329
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
But where's the taco

330
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
More test

331
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
President

332
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
Mega

333
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
Don't worry

334
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
Thanks

335
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,455
Text Alex vortex

336
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:09,855
Alex world all of the doctors at Walter Reed Medical Center around like well we did what test

337
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
Just got to watch

338
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
Got to wait who's the president of the country

339
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,767
We've kind of data.

340
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,631
Ridiculous

341
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,239
90% of tests are false positive

342
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,775
Alex Soto

343
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Connect

344
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,103
Like I don't know where he's getting that information from

345
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,919
But he does connected to a specific story

346
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,967
I think this might be what it's all based on

347
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
Houses of article

348
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
So Alex is lying about that headline

349
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
The actual headline is quick

350
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,351
Connecticut state lab finds 90 positive covid-19 tests were false

351
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,191
This was out of 144 test that we're done at the specific lab during the

352
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,007
Span of June 15th to July 17th

353
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,847
And 90 of them turned out to be false positives not 90%

354
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,431
90 out of 144 is 62.5%

355
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Still high

356
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,759
But Alex doesn't know any of the details of the story

357
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,391
This has to do with the lab testing procedure that this lab began operating in June 15th

358
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
Which led to a lot of false

359
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:24,096
When doing validation of the results they found this high level of false positive and immediately went to work on reviewing and correcting was going wrong

360
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
In the process

361
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:31,520
This wasn't something that Alex and is Intrepid Patriot journalists dug up or something that anyone was trying to hide it was just

362
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:37,408
Covered by the lap when they were doing quality control and it was reported by the mainstream media which is how Alex knows about it

363
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,760
The true version of the story doesn't call into question the validity of covid-19 testing

364
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,576
You just highlight the part of the scientific process

365
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,368
Or double and triple checking things

366
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,928
Can sometimes find errors in the way things are done

367
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,720
Can be improved

368
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,280
Only the fake version of the story supports Alex's

369
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,328
Conspiracies which is why it's the only version

370
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
Vino's

371
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:01,984
In the real world you can find a ride up from the Harvard Medical School which explains the PCR test which are

372
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
Beasley-Wood Trump is God

373
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,824
Have false positive rates close to zero

374
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,408
There's some concern about false negatives but the reason that the test is

375
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,456
Considered like a gold standard for diagnosis

376
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,016
Is because they are very precise when they're done correctly

377
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,856
The false positive rate should come close to zero

378
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,416
Most false positives results

379
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,024
Are thought to be due to lack of contamination or other problems with how the lab is performed the test

380
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
Not limitations of the test itself

381
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:32,448
A recent paper in Lancet discuss the issue of false positive with covid-19 testing saying quote

382
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,800
The current rate of operational false positive swab test in the UK is unknown

383
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,408
Preliminary estimates show we could be somewhere between .8% and 4%

384
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,040
That's still a significant figure if you consider the scale of testing with being. But it's a far cry from what Alex

385
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
Suggesting

386
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,624
To give you some context about how nuts it is for Alex

387
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,416
Say there's a false positive rate of

388
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
90%

389
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:58,304
The FDA put out a warning about a line of test produced by Beady back in July

390
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,656
A study suggested that 3% of their test could be false positive

391
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,472
Based on concerns about the reagents that were used

392
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,312
BFDIA quote told Healthcare professionals to treat positive results

393
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
From test using the BB real

394
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:17,248
Is presumptive and consider confirming findings using a different authorized coronavirus diagnostic

395
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
This was because of a

396
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,344
Concern about a 3% false positive for tr8

397
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
What Alex is talking about

398
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,416
Sweetly disconnected from reality

399
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,696
There's just nothing to that

400
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,792
You know it's like when you want to compromise

401
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
And you're like

402
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
On different ends

403
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
The Spectrum

404
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,448
What you really want to find out if you only need to change

405
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
55%

406
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
You know you're almost

407
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,336
But when reality is at literally 90%

408
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:48,224
And unreality is inverse that reality is 3% your at 90%

409
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
We're never coming close

410
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
It seems to never come

411
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:57,696
Even if it seems like making Headway with Alex would be getting him to admit alright 85

412
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
We'll compromise

413
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:05,632
It 95%

414
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Sure

415
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,984
So this is supposed to be a list of headlines

416
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
That are

417
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
Proving

418
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,336
Sing the Trump probably is a false positive test

419
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,384
Sure this gets thrown in

420
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
$1,000

421
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:30,208
What does that have to do with anything even money to people who have to shelter

422
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,024
They're lying and they're trying to kill the president

423
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,328
Also some folks are going to get like 1250

424
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:40,704
That the president

425
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
People are going to get 12:50

426
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:49,408
California talking about giving this money to people who have to quarantine in order to help

427
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,712
Tell them be able to survive

428
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:58,112
Spread the disease obviously means that they're going to go out trying to get coronavirus cuz they want at 12

429
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:03,232
That's the only way they only thing that makes sense to me that he thinking is so backwards in Twisted

430
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:08,352
But it's weird that headline is in this stack that Alex's used to prove the trumps

431
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,376
Diagnostic

432
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,912
Test was a false positive

433
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
Which is weird

434
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:18,336
And it shows that he didn't prepare at all he doesn't know just chill at home

435
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
A stack of headline

436
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
That's very sad

437
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
So there's another headline

438
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
This one

439
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744
Is really effective

440
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,536
The story about the Tennessee Titans

441
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:43,936
Players and staff who tested positive for covid-19 only broke on September 29th and as far as I can tell none of them have been shown

442
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
To be false positives

443
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,776
I strongly suspected I was just making that up

444
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,568
Because he just called read this headline

445
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,152
How about people tested positive for the virus any kind of realize that this was

446
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Supposed to be about 2

447
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,248
Fake yeah not about how people getting sick

448
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
By October 2nd

449
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:05,440
The day that Alex is recording this episode The Associated Press is reporting that the outbreak in the Titans organization was now up to 18

450
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,720
People testing positive

451
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,280
Along with players on the Patriots and Chiefs

452
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,840
Who had to postpone their scheduled game this weekend

453
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:16,704
The reality of the story unsurprisingly appears to be the exact opposite of what Alex's report

454
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
Supposed

455
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,288
This being the case with are all shown to be false positive results

456
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:24,384
It looks like the initial headlines about eight people testing positive we're only the beginning

457
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,432
Right well you think he's wrong

458
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
90% of the

459
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,528
But he thinks he's wrong about 3/4

460
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:36,416
So I think you guys can get to a compromise classica pickle

461
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,232
So you might be asking like okay

462
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,768
What's the game

463
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
With the false positive

464
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,328
That is a good question

465
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,632
I would like to know the motivation behind this

466
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
Clearly insane Act

467
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
Wow

468
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
I mean

469
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,776
Yahoo president drink a lot of soda

470
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
2 plan

471
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
Covid-19

472
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Pikachu

473
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
About

474
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,328
President

475
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:21,728
Alex you're going into reruns they already poisoned his diet so I was just riding down like this is

476
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:28,128
From 2016

477
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:34,528
Explain why he was speaking weird

478
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,576
Slow-acting poison

479
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,744
His show is in syndication basically

480
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,536
Something news except

481
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,840
And honestly I was looking at some of the comments

482
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,400
What's on Bandit video for this and like

483
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:56,800
His video that he put out on Saturday and a lot of them were like grow up Alex

484
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
Philly

485
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,320
Okay so the conspiracy is

486
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
They gave him a false positive rest

487
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:16,000
In order to have cover right to poison his Diet Cokes are again

488
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:22,400
Didn't need to do that the last time they played well it didn't work last time maybe the problem was they didn't have a good enough

489
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,800
Cover for your note suggests that didn't work last night cuz it didn't happen last night but I am 3%

490
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
Positive you're right

491
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
Alex has got to go

492
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Weather

493
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
3 days

494
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,696
3:00

495
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
Got to get some got to try and sell some

496
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,328
Stop before I drive him to the studio

497
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,912
This is so weird I mean like I don't understand outside of like

498
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,960
I woke up at 10:30

499
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:02,592
And I thought I had the day off yeah I don't understand what scenario could lead you to be able to

500
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,920
To get to the studio by like 1:45

501
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
But not by 11

502
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,504
Like I don't know what it what it could be

503
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
It's just it's just

504
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:15,392
I mean it could be so I'm not willing to rule out something innocuous

505
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
Like there's something with his

506
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
You know

507
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
Somebody's

508
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,768
I got to go to school or something

509
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,096
What is a possibility for the meeting he couldn't

510
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,912
Reschedule or should we had a meeting with the lawyers lawyers

511
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:33,312
Something like that for sure even so a lot of that stuff you can reschedule or you can pay some

512
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
Someone to do

513
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,152
Like

514
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,944
She could cure the kids to the hospital

515
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,712
Trump has

516
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,760
Covid well I mean yeah

517
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
Everybody still got to make it

518
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
Get to the school seems like Alex

519
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:50,208
Probably got wasted woke up at 10:30 as like froggatt

520
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,280
Now you are absolutely describing what I immediately

521
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:59,680
We thought was

522
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,984
Break it up this time I mean who knows

523
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,408
So Alex does show up at the end of the second hour

524
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
And

525
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
McMahon

526
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
There's no proof

527
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
That

528
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,576
This Coronavirus

529
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,624
Covid with the president

530
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Which was an attack

531
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
Sure but maybe it was

532
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
Once they is Benatar

533
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,424
The first one

534
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,728
The first person who breathes it

535
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,640
What

536
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,760
We're all dreaming

537
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
To make it look

538
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:52,928
No when I found out that Boris Johnson people that I know that were around a city

539
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Alright

540
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
Alright buddy

541
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
This is a point where even Alex

542
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
Should stop be like

543
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
Am I doing

544
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Am I here

545
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
I'm here

546
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,592
The prime minister's face

547
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
I said it was a false

548
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:18,272
Positive people called in the show earlier it was maybe Trump got sprayed in the face of weaponized

549
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
Coach

550
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:25,184
Or maybe he acted in ways that are specifically make you susceptible to catching it

551
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
If someone

552
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,048
Maybe he did exactly what you would do if you were being

553
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,840
Not careful about

554
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,168
Maybe this is the only

555
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,216
Logical and inevitable

556
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,520
Conclusion that his actions have lettuce

557
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,384
You know it's a situation where you can be careless

558
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920
A thousand times

559
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,968
Nothing happen if you're lucky

560
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,528
Circumstances are what they are but that's 1,000

561
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
Indian first time could be the time

562
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:56,928
Avec tell you end up getting unlucky and what you do you're unlucky

563
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:03,328
And if you're at roughly chance 100,000 444

564
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,656
Play Red by 1445 you're going to get cold

565
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:10,240
Dan's if you're at like 10 bucks a 300

566
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
Dammit previous 299 times you've been fine that doesn't change anything about the 300th time

567
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,944
Anything about like

568
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,968
The odds

569
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:26,368
Lucky every other time it's been going on black for a while then it's it's

570
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:31,488
That means it's more likely to land on red this time everybody knows that's how it works man

571
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Wild

572
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:38,912
There's a couple possibilities what's going on as we've already heard Alex has a couple maybe false positive maybe they say

573
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:45,312
Sprayed him in the face with it.

574
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:51,712
Like a crack team of international assassin taking out the president that would have been nice

575
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:57,088
The club has came up to drop with a Seltzer bottle just created

576
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,672
Vaudeville assassination

577
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:07,072
The possibilities here and shockingly Trump is dumb and behave in a way that you would if you were

578
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,352
Katchafire

579
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,776
It could be a false test most of them are false

580
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
Oregon

581
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,088
And I've already assassinate the president needs Walking Dead ride

582
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
Sure

583
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,096
So these are the three possibilities you've got I think it would shorten Velux out immensely

584
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,936
Three possibilities we got

585
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
Be there

586
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,496
It's

587
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
Assassination Norfolk tap

588
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
Or

589
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,640
Another

590
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
Right

591
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,760
The other one is

592
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:02,368
It seems like that's kind of Alex's

593
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,416
It can't be just an a******

594
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,720
Who did exactly what

595
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,256
It's poison

596
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,472
What is the false test what are you doing

597
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,800
Will they say he died of Cody dies or something else

598
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,640
That's how I do it you just poisoning

599
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
Test positive

600
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
Now

601
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,464
Decent

602
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,488
Poison

603
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,328
The blood

604
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,912
But now they're creeping in with a weapon from Canby

605
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
Alright

606
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,896
Spy novel whatever Alex says

607
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,456
That's why you would be caught

608
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:04,320
Elvis impersonator

609
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,648
To pin it on his friend

610
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,792
Know how I started the show with my brights by was kind of the keys

611
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,096
The Galaxy's in a teasing mood to

612
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,568
Very high-level today

613
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
1 reasons.

614
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
Incredible information

615
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,392
I was dropped

616
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,512
I'm almost speechless right now

617
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,584
Trying to digest all of this

618
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Asbestos

619
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,680
Play right-back infowars.com

620
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,496
Least favorite genre of Alex Jones

621
00:35:54,752 --> 00:36:00,896
Tuesday I have big bombshell news which explains why I was an hour and 40 minutes late

622
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
Totally

623
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,528
I can't tell you where it came from

624
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
But it's high level

625
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
I will get into it

626
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:16,256
I like whenever he's telling excuse he's telling like extravagant lies for why he's late to his bosses the audience

627
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
You know like

628
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
No no

629
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:25,728
I was trying to get here on time

630
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:32,128
I was trying to really believe that I'm trying so there is a bicycle

631
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
12 ones riding

632
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,296
In front of me while I was driving my car and then what do you know the guy throws little milkshake at me and I we can do an old-timey

633
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:48,256
Turns out he's David Rockefeller killed the president

634
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:53,376
Bicycle

635
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:59,008
Milkshakes

636
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,080
Who among you would not do the same thing

637
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,384
It's the cross I bear

638
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:10,016
So Alex goes back from break and he's got some interesting thoughts about the media's coverage

639
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
Trump and his sickness

640
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
We got President Trump

641
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,160
I supposedly with Coronavirus

642
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,744
Ianni's

643
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,024
They're saying in the media

644
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,560
Trump hasn't really

645
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,120
Confirm a friend if you still have him

646
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,704
Walking after dancing all looking list

647
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,288
Alex knows that because that's what he does

648
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:38,688
Yeah you can do that to every single time he's done something about her Hillary

649
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
My God they're about to die

650
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
Okay

651
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,064
I hope you know that game pretty well that's why you can

652
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
See it

653
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,184
Stu's not Steve pieczenik is not Rodger Stone

654
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,000
Someone named dr. Carrie madej

655
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,072
Maddie's not remember how to pronounce her name

656
00:37:55,328 --> 00:38:01,472
Anyway she's a doctor osteopathic believe who believes that vaccines are

657
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,240
They're all evil

658
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,800
She made a viral video and so Alex's

659
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,872
Hanging out with her here's a little taste of what you bringing to the table

660
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,944
John life study vaccines for

661
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
Since my early twenties

662
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,576
Because I was very concerned about them

663
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
And

664
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,392
Like to say that

665
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,952
Vaccines are not what we think they are

666
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:27,328
And a little story just to give some of your listeners some history of vaccines

667
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,656
The tetanus vaccine when I studied

668
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,192
There's a long story behind that

669
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,520
Turned out really it's an abortion.

670
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,664
Google search

671
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
Yeah

672
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
So

673
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
This this

674
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
Ichi

675
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,088
Cuz I'm interesting ideas

676
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
Obviously the xen

677
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
Evil

678
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:58,048
They're a bunch of different vaccines that are being developed and are possible candidates for

679
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,864
Coronavirus tracker covid-19

680
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
And

681
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
Terry believes

682
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
That there's only one

683
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,496
Now it seems to believe that too

684
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:12,128
And it's going to be something that changes you into a genetically modified organism

685
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:18,272
DNA and they're doing that because this thing that it'll change

686
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,088
Or whatever they're putting into you is patented

687
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,928
You know we can actually patents

688
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,048
Of something that synthetic so technically

689
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:36,448
When we are getting a piece or this vaccine and if it does become permanent within our genome

690
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Static

691
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,032
That part of us can be patented and owned

692
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,336
People need to understand this because

693
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:47,712
Owner because donors

694
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,272
So basically the theory goes that like this

695
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:56,672
Change your DNA so let's just imagine it's just like the DNA of your arm

696
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:03,072
No Monsanto owns your arm I gave you that strand of DNA and I can take it away review

697
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,144
Right.

698
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,936
I would I would say

699
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:13,824
I don't think it works that way

700
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,872
I'm sick of The Sovereign citizens like

701
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
With a

702
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:23,040
Capital letters capital letter sound stupid if the government said if you would say that the government owns part of your DNA

703
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,320
Now I'm listening

704
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,624
Now we're talkin Sovereign citizen

705
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
Right here

706
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,232
You just remove your own DNA and then the government can own you

707
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,608
Shockingly when he called into the show

708
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
It work totally fine

709
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
There were no problems

710
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,520
Audio-wise why everything went by probably cuz it's Hardline

711
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
My fortune

712
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
That is not the case

713
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
Doctor

714
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,176
And an animal studies

715
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
That's great

716
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,368
But then needed a challenge test which is

717
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,672
Ethical humans but they can do a challenge chest

718
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,096
You know a guy broke up when you come back to her

719
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
Yeah I did

720
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:09,888
Everyday

721
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,192
Every single day

722
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:17,824
Guy breaks up in the middle of talking about these of these vaccine trials on animals

723
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,616
They're having like really

724
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:23,456
Goodnight the past that had these positive results for this type of vaccine

725
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,760
I'll be there whenever they got a challenge test

726
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
Right that's what

727
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
Skype cuts

728
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,880
I'm going to pick up on this

729
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,488
I'm going to pretend that this was my Secret Bombshell news

730
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,768
This is amazing

731
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,560
This is Alex right here man

732
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,888
You know there's guy broke up when you come back to her

733
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,448
Michelle off of this

734
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
Because when

735
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
The challenge test

736
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,104
Because the horrible autoimmune response

737
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,663
To whatever the outside pass

738
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
The information

739
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
Proceed up today

740
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
Serendipity

741
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Synchronicity

742
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
Providence

743
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,695
What am I told you I razor isn't scientist

744
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,255
At one of the major biotech

745
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
Research

746
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
Ultra

747
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
And what are you tell me

748
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
He told me a lot

749
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,151
Forza Horizon 2

750
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,807
Alright Alex Jones b******* right here

751
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,855
Awesome tops

752
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:39,999
Secret top-level information in the reason that he wasn't on the show earlier it's because he was receiving the super important bombshell information

753
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:46,655
He doesn't even hit with the actual secret news's but Skype connection drops off right in the middle of her making

754
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
Sensational claim

755
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:52,287
Alex piggybacks patent claims that that was actually a secret news all along it sure does

756
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,591
Exactly what Alex

757
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
Just claiming here

758
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,407
In order for the story to make any sense

759
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:03,807
I guess this morning Alex randomly met the head scientist of a biotech company but didn't know that this guy

760
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,599
Guy was the head of a biotech company

761
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,927
This person presumably knew Alex wasn't told Alex

762
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
The covid-19 vaccine

763
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,999
Screen causes severe autoimmune response

764
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:16,351
Do General coronavirus is it which point Alex research the information

765
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:21,727
Found out it's true and I guess in the process realize that the guy was the head scientist of a giant biotech company

766
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,543
Researching these claims made it so Alex

767
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:30,943
Couldn't get to work on time I guess even though he would have known the Trump had covid and he couldn't possibly take the day off

768
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Rick what is

769
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
Soon as he woke up

770
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:39,391
Then Alex goes into his show does the first half-hour without mentioning this big secret news that he got from a big week in the biotech field

771
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,719
I wanted to confirm it as true

772
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:49,119
Of course then he shows up to the studio presumably having just done a real deep dive into this vaccine in autoimmune situation

773
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
Seapointe bring it up

774
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,447
Intellicast Skype connection goes out

775
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,031
Is it such a loadable shaped such transparent thing

776
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,335
Steelers

777
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,151
When you bring somebody on to drop a bombshell story you can't under

778
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:08,319
It's it's it's remarkable though the way he does this like you see this from time to time but it's not always as explicit as this

779
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:14,719
Winnie does be fake setup of huge bombshell news and then something will come up later in the show.

780
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,279
That's actually what my big Aaron's was

781
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,607
That's better than whatever it was I was going to make up with

782
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:25,215
It's time for me to lie about it or if I don't come up with something

783
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,519
But I want to lie about say is a big news

784
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,847
I can just say I'll get to it tomorrow I got to digest this

785
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,407
It's just too big too big

786
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,199
He does this quite regularly

787
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
A pretty impressive

788
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
It's a it's a nice cheap

789
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,807
Yeah it's so he's he's got this

790
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,599
Fake doctor

791
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,903
Working at biotech company was told in

792
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
All this stuff

793
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,951
And not this is

794
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:51,327
This is interesting because I went to the conspiracy about this imagined covid-19 vaccine

795
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,631
This is Improv

796
00:44:53,887 --> 00:45:00,031
Right here alright I am almost certain that Alex is coming up with this on the spot

797
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
Vaccine

798
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,223
For covid-19 but the main platform is a regular cold

799
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
Virus

800
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,783
A bunch of stuff stacked onto it

801
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
Call Stacks

802
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Bumper

803
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,951
If you do that

804
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:24,607
And then your body learns have an autoimmune response to that particular virus it's so Broad

805
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,239
You will now have an autoimmune response to the coronavirus that's so, it's everywhere

806
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,799
Making it where you can't even go outside

807
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,591
Because you'll get so sick

808
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,127
From regular cold viruses

809
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,687
They're trying to get rid of your immunity

810
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,967
Call virus

811
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,551
Allergic to it

812
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:48,415
Which is what killed most the people in the Spanish Flu was they were allergic to the virus

813
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,207
Not that it was actually replicating it

814
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,351
And it's just so diabolical the side this was breaking down the fact that

815
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,167
This is so critical

816
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,727
Define

817
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:07,359
With covid

818
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,175
The body doesn't even see it as a threat

819
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,967
And won't create a meal

820
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,063
But you're also allergic to

821
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,135
So you have an autoimmune response to both

822
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,463
Peanut

823
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,911
In the flu shot or whatever it was they got when they were younger

824
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,447
I'm guessing that

825
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,471
He probably did

826
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:39,871
Talk to somebody but it was like John Rappaport or Andrew Wakefield it wasn't some high-level bios

827
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,687
Weird anti vaxxer

828
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Told him these things

829
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,527
That wasn't why you was late this morning

830
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,831
I was just bullshittin

831
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:55,231
Sounds made-up AIU can you conceive you like little details he's trying to pull in goes through The Conspirator

832
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:59,327
Smiled at the end of that been like how did I pull that 1980

833
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,399
Team flew out and then throw some b******* about

834
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:07,775
That's how it kill people I don't know anything about the 1918 flu

835
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:13,663
Awesome skater who lands a trick the first try

836
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,247
This doctor that he is

837
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:20,319
Talking to his interview and get that made dude got to get her back

838
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:24,671

By dr. Terry

841
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
My daddy here

842
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,327
And I really appreciate her

843
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,119
Come out as she's medical doctor

844
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,471
That was crazy

845
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:51,039
Doctors across the board probably censorship is that never happens on your show

846
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,319
Forever happens on

847
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,343
Infowars

848
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:57,695
Tech issues never dated Sky problems never ever happen

849
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,999
But by your own logic earlier

850
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,047
Just because it's not censorship

851
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,607
The times doesn't mean that the hundred first time isn't that so

852
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,399
Logic

853
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,215
I appreciate what you're trying to do but it doesn't work

854
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:16,127
So we got to get this after back on man I got to get hurt to work

855
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
Navigate to Skype to work

856
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,431
Got to get her

857
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
The spout

858
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Her

859
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
Proof

860
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:27,903
Your head spins they want in our bodies and then we learn what they're doing is Jimmy pigging

861
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,303
Weather

862
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:39,679
Who wants to have this genetic Revolution over Rush

863
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,543
What do you think this is all going doctor

864
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,687
Play God Frozen again

865
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,551
Let's go ahead and play the full clip

866
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
Pelosi

867
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,879
It's never happened

868
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,671
Never happened

869
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,231
Now we're going to play this

870
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,047
Incredibly terrible audio

871
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,839
Nancy Pelosi

872
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:13,215
Dashing about her we get back to the doctor because they're going to give it another shot

873
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:17,311
She has a theory about a magical

874
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,663
That will control everything alright and it will know what meds

875
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Like all your

876
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:27,551
Your med levels in your body and all your vitals and every single thing about you

877
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,599
And well

878
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,951
Enter the smartphone through the house after you have

879
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,023
If you work on your house after you'll find drop-down

880
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,815
Stop categories

881
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
Brush your teeth

882
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,799
Everything about you is

883
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,663
Everything that you're doing with a transmitter yourself

884
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,503
Connection

885
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,575
Kind of behavior

886
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,415
Worthy country Society for the good of the whole

887
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,695
Repercussion

888
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,327
Oh she's getting

889
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:17,727
Censored again

890
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,007
But this is the next level

891
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,335
That's the next level of the censorship

892
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,383
Bad bad connection

893
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,151
Quietly

894
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,455
A very dark thing for him doing

895
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:31,295
I see her doing interviews all the time is heaven like

896
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,319
Deep David like

897
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,135
It's all this is us this is us

898
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:38,719
I thought there's something on all right because

899
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,535
Call the f****** time

900
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,839
Over and over and over combination of both

901
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,911
Like I don't I don't know exactly what it is but it's

902
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,239
It's definitely not censorship it's you guys being f******

903
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,007
Incompetent

904
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,823
Alex

905
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,615
Fortress

906
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,895
Is a little much

907
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,455
So let's just complain about Michael Moore

908
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,831
Michael Morris is Evil Genius to postpone the election

909
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,927
When the elections Democrats

910
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,095
If you have any intelligence you know Democrats to the mail-in ballot

911
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:19,679
They want a lockdown they said they're going to contesta matter what they know they're losing

912
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
Fake

913
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,335
He wants to hold off the election

914
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,639
You said

915
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,919
Can babysit your shoulder

916
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,735
Pull up your house is Conte

917
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,503
Tracers

918
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,831
I'm sorry you didn't submit the inoculations were taking your childre

919
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,879
Just the facts ma'am

920
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
Good

921
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,183
Good time

922
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Uncle

923
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,999
Shelter and uncle

924
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
More

925
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,327
Like I don't think I need that gig

926
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:51,423
They're both of them

927
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,727
Yeah

928
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
Community service

929
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
Did they get arrested

930
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
A of degrees

931
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,335
It's really weird that Alex

932
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:04,735
Is saying it's like there's a false positive test and then he's mad at Michael Moore being like

933
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,783
Saying that this isn't a real positive

934
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:13,695
You guys just both have weird conspiracies about what's going on motivated by slightly different levels of distrust

935
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
Both of you guys should

936
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
Call Patel.

937
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,047
Episode this Friday episode

938
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,119
That's where we're at basically

939
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,143
Yeah that's a big

940
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
Serious

941
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:30,079
Problem Alex at half hour at the beginning and been totally fine

942
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:33,407
There's no reason that Owen couldn't interview the tax lady

943
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,687
It would have been totally fine

944
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,759
I think that it was weak

945
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,807
From the perspective of

946
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
Everyone

947
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,367
Well I mean this is big

948
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,463
This is kind of a big deal

949
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,999
Is the real hard to wrap

950
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,791
Your head around it kind of situation

951
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:54,911
I don't pretend to know what like what's going to happen or know who you can trust

952
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,983
In terms of a lot of the details that are coming out like weather

953
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:04,383
You know like he was low on oxygen or what the temperature is like

954
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,151
Very difficult

955
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:09,247
Like he's going to die I have no idea

956
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,527
It's also weird say

957
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,551
He'll be fine

958
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
Although you might be

959
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,623
You might not be combined

960
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,415
Exacto f****** idea

961
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,695
What I can say

962
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,231
With no qualms

963
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
Is this

964
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,791
Stick

965
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,863
Agree with you

966
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:31,263
There's all kinds of questions about the timeline of when he knew he was sick what steps

967
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,287
Not taken

968
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:38,687
What do you wear around the time of the debate when he went to that fundraiser all these things the Supreme Court

969
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,455
Corpse Party

970
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:44,319
Like all this just wild he's very serious and very real and important

971
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:47,135
And Alex came in and the Bessie had was

972
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,927
Water tester false positive

973
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,719
They read about the headlines.

974
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,999
Connected so I'm not

975
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:56,095
And then he developed it to maybe someone with a covid lapels

976
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:56,863
Sprayer

977
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,167
Trump with a weapon Heights covid

978
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,727
It's like okay this is the best you've got

979
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,079
We got it we got to update that say you know it is like when the going gets weird

980
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
The weird turn

981
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,895
Pro some of them but

982
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,967
The already professionally weird literally phone it in

983
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:18,879
This is why he's being usurped by other online cast because he's not willing to

984
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,183
Like I don't know maybe just doesn't have it in him anymore

985
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,975
Doesn't have it in him to

986
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:27,071
Like really throw himself headlong into

987
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,143
Damn the Torpedoes kind of

988
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:33,471
But weirdness I mean he's been beaten down pretty

989
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,239
Pretty hard

990
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,287
Lawton lawsuit

991
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,335
I would I would be it's like it

992
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,151
It's totally acceptable I would find a reasonable for you to be like

993
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,175
I just don't got it

994
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:48,575
I've been beating too much like Icarus I flew too close to the Sun and my wings are burned

995
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,951
I'm not there anymore I agree yong-gun I agree and I would accept there too

996
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,279
But if you were in that position at your someone like Alex

997
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,815
You better get out

998
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,607
You better take your money and run

999
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,911
Because you're going to be

1000
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,703
Eaten alive by the Young

1001
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,751
Lyons Young Guns

1002
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:12,383
Michael Jordan on the Wizards was still Michael Jordan but he still got his ass beat a lot

1003
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,783
He was old people cherish whatever he beat their ass over like all goddamn

1004
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,623
Is Michael Jordan a fifty-year-old man I got beat by Michael

1005
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,159
Ifucking Jordan you know it's still cool

1006
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,975
So Alex I thought

1007
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,743
Pressure

1008
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,023
But the reason I didn't

1009
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:34,143
Immediately think like let's do an emergency episode of I think Saturday is going to come in

1010
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,959
He's going to do a special episode cuz you did about when

1011
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,007
Ruth Gator Ginsburg

1012
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:43,871
And so I figured like this is big enough stuff Alex Deeds to do a Saturday episode

1013
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:47,455
Do you know when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died

1014
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,247
A year ago

1015
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,271
Feels like

1016
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:56,671
No idea only put out like an 8-minute video

1017
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:03,071
On on Saturday and

1018
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,351
Realize like okay

1019
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,935
False positive Ain't Gonna Fly that's not going to work

1020
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,495
What are we going to do come to the hospital ocean

1021
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,031
Evidence

1022
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,335
The facts are overwhelmed

1023
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:15,871
Either

1024
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
The doctors

1025
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
Walter Reed Medical

1026
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
Trying to

1027
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:24,831
Idiots

1028
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,951
They are giving the

1029
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,255
Experimental

1030
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
Drugs

1031
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
18

1032
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,631
And the other rendezevere

1033
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,167
It's on record

1034
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,959
You wouldn't give either one of these

1035
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
Unless they were

1036
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:52,479
Well I mean the possibility there is that the case is more serious than you're allowing yourself to believe yeah

1037
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,247
Like

1038
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,807
Like I would say I would assume

1039
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,831
Generally

1040
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,623
They

1041
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,671
If this is the course

1042
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,719
Of action is being taken

1043
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,743
But neither trumpets

1044
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,767
Assisted on it

1045
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,791
Or

1046
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:09,375
He has a case that requires that in the doctors think it's a prude

1047
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,143
Course

1048
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,471
You know with malpractice for just like

1049
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:19,871
You and me normal people getting real big trouble for not providing the best care

1050
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:26,271
Alex Jones the bills they pay for insurance my friend

1051
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,343
Let's say malpractice with the f****** president

1052
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,647
You're going to be fine

1053
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,511
Career over

1054
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:42,911
Well I mean you don't bail wasn't remembered for that whole metal detector accidentally killing the president thing

1055
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,447
I think that you know

1056
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:48,799
I'm sure if the doctor invented is something that's really really important to humanity

1057
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,359
Here is the whole killing the president they would probably be for

1058
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:57,759
Forgot to do magic like the next day after

1059
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,647
Sketchpad

1060
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,231
What will I be remembered for

1061
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,327
So this is basically getting that play with the Big Bopper

1062
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:17,727
This is basically all the Saturday show has going for it is like these doctors are probably tried to kill Trump

1063
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,847
I got to say some sational dangerous kind of talk and doesn't do anybody a liquor good

1064
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,895
It's how we come in on the 4th

1065
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,919
What's that day

1066
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,967
This episode

1067
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,735
Is

1068
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:32,575
Possibly one of the weirdest things I've heard from Alex in a while

1069
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,599
It's

1070
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,879
Almost as if

1071
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,719
Haven't covid being in the hospital is

1072
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:42,047
Kind of secondary

1073
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:48,191
That's a good angles another piece of news that requires

1074
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
Hypertension

1075
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,359
The cover-up government

1076
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151
Child sex trafficking

1077
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,527
371

1078
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,063
18 votes

1079
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,415
Or elected Congress appear to be moving towards making

1080
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,695
Keto phobia

1081
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
Crime

1082
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,535
Who's the really interesting way for Alex to cover this story

1083
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:18,143
Apparently his version of it is that house Dems voted to cover up pedophilia

1084
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,727
In reality the house passed a largely symbolic resolution condemning

1085
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:28,127
McEwen. Which is slightly different than voting discover a pedophilia that is very different I would I would say that that is

1086
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:28,895
Buried

1087
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:34,783
Additionally was not house Democrats who voted the measure through it was overwhelmingly supported cross both party

1088
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,831
Speakers qanon s*** has no place

1089
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:43,231
Insensible politics 371/2 8-18-18

1090
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,279
And so that it's so if I'm

1091
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,071
Doing the numbers on house

1092
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:53,471
380 of those about right now is almost everybody in the house

1093
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:57,567
Oh yeah that would

1094
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,615
Literally nothing

1095
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,407
Actually bring any child traffickers

1096
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:06,271
Justice North actually saved any traffic children and infect experts in the field when very clear

1097
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:09,855
That away qanon people sensationalize the topic and focus attention

1098
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:15,487
In various bizarre directions has the real-world effect of making the actual work of disrupting trafficking operations

1099
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,255
More

1100
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:22,911
If you look at qanon from a purely consequentialist framework they're helping the very people they pretend to be bringing down

1101
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,471
But they're also creating an unhinged

1102
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,495
Colt behind Anna

1103
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,055
Extremely right-wing aspiring dictator

1104
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:34,943
So the secondary effect of their existence is the creation of a possibly highly-motivated politically-driven group

1105
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:41,343
That will never vote against outrageously right-wing candidates and will be willing to work for free to create social media

1106
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,647
Champagne Brandon or opponents

1107
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,671
These right-wing candidates

1108
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,207
How to repair files and Demon

1109
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:53,119
The yelling about saving the children it doesn't result in any actually save children it's necessary

1110
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:57,727
Marion order to make sure that the group has some kind of plausible ability to deflect criticism

1111
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,263
Head turner tax around

1112
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,031
It was all

1113
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:04,127
The house passes a resolution denouncing

1114
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:10,015
Sakura not because it's a weird cult that has led to multiple multiple violent incidents and has the potential to lead to a whole lot more

1115
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:13,599
Alex can report on that is the house voting to cover up pedophilia

1116
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:18,463
You see this game being played about all sorts of right-wing types Tommy Robinson is one of the

1117
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,791
Tacticas

1118
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,583
Deployed to cover

1119
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:29,983
Spell just a charade you use whatever Optics and tools are available to justify and strengthen your dictators grasp on power

1120
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,823
Even if it means carrying water for a group of lunatics who hate you

1121
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,103
And you yelled about freaky

1122
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,639
That's what Alex is doing

1123
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,943
Yeah that's the top story

1124
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:45,343
I don't want to I don't want to say it but it is occurring to me now that elrond really did know what he was doing whenever he decided

1125
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,879
Did not to like step into politics

1126
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,439
Like create your own kingdom

1127
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:52,511
Where you can't let you know so you know this what I'm saying like

1128
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,839
Whatever it's like you're in my reality just get him out of my own room

1129
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:01,727
They're doing Scientology think I'll make your own f****** compound in the middle of nowhere you guys can all believe in whatever you want

1130
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,263
Just stay out of my business

1131
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,799
F*** it I'll give you tax

1132
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,871
Exempt status if you stay in the compound

1133
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:11,199
You get your own internet you get your own little place there

1134
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:14,527
And then we get to live in our fun time

1135
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,063
I don't know the Galaxy's like

1136
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,879
Strong fond feelings about compounds

1137
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:23,231
So is what I wouldn't trust me if it a compound

1138
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,815
That's how it starts the show

1139
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:29,631
That's the beginning of the show but the top headline like

1140
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,655
It's not news

1141
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,679
Not the Trump

1142
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,703
Is in the hospital

1143
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:38,079
Top headline tonight on this Sunday October 4th Global transmission

1144
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:43,711
Inauguration he's not President Trump

1145
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:47,295
Walter Reed Medical military facility

1146
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,439
Military action against

1147
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,719
Hong Kong and Taiwan

1148
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,607
Destroy the US economy

1149
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,447
The heart of all of this

1150
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,287
That sounds right

1151
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,079
What makes them operate

1152
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,359
What makes them tick

1153
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,151
Your house Alex Jones

1154
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,223
I don't know if

1155
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:16,991
What makes

1156
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,015
Demon stick

1157
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,551
Is the top story

1158
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,831
I don't know if you

1159
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:27,231
You can cover that the New Yorker does one of those every six months or so they go to demon country and they're like

1160
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,815
We really got to figure out why won't you guys not like the Satan in the oven

1161
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:37,215
I like his policies on immigration and they really do it

1162
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:44,895
Play I don't know they're not far off are they don't know if this is a good use of time

1163
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:45,663
Her Alex

1164
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,687
Considering

1165
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,479
Everything

1166
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,807
Should be about Trump having Coke

1167
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,111
Yeah you know we believe

1168
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,415
We speculated on what would happen

1169
01:03:56,671 --> 01:04:01,023
If and when Trump actually got covid Alex's blame does not even

1170
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:04,351
Apparently

1171
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,423
It's definitely the second

1172
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:13,567
Yeah but the devil's around who know what you know what it is I think I think it's like

1173
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,103
I got to kick this game

1174
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,151
I don't know what's going to happen

1175
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,175
What happened

1176
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,711
Will very much

1177
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,247
Affect what I do

1178
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:25,087
Yeah cuz I give Trump ties Alex can't be like these doctors are going

1179
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,623
2BR killing Trump lick

1180
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,647
Yeah that will

1181
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,183
Possibly make his audience

1182
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
Start shooting

1183
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,535
But if he recovers then

1184
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,559
You don't want

1185
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:39,423
I already said that when this happens there moving on the president

1186
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
It's time to start killing

1187
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:44,287
I feel like he's just in a position where he's like that's that and see what happen

1188
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
Which is dumb

1189
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
In-N-Out

1190
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:51,199
Not good I think this is a proof of my theory which is that he will he's

1191
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:51,967
He blinked

1192
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,271
Now would be that literally

1193
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,063
He's already laid the groundwork

1194
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:00,415
The moment the news came out if he was going to pull the trigger on like now is when we start this

1195
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,207
Civil War that's when you do it

1196
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,791
Yeah and it's interesting to that I think Alex Mae

1197
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,583
Internalized some of that blank

1198
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,119
Any might recognize

1199
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,143
It because

1200
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:14,239
He's talking about qanon and the way they'd like the house voted

1201
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,543
Taking down the hall of fame

1202
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,871
And I have not heard Alex talk like this before

1203
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,407
Videos

1204
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,503
Lowrider pqq people.

1205
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,039
Because the public is awake

1206
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,367
They're aware and then and now

1207
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,903
Alex Jones

1208
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,463
Assembled each day

1209
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,071
Set up so that they can

1210
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,095
Poses Q

1211
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,399
Esoteric

1212
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Foggy

1213
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,239
Cliff into water this

1214
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,031
Louder

1215
01:05:53,919 --> 01:06:00,063
Good yeah I've not heard Alex say anything other than like I am the symbol of the

1216
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:06,463
The idea that he thinks he's second 2q and being a symbol of the resistance

1217
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,487
Into the deep state

1218
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,023
Steamed meaningful

1219
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,815
It reminds me of Shadow Water

1220
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,863
Whenever all the sudden he's like Lissa

1221
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,447
I don't actually deal with those deep State size I don't deal with that stuff

1222
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,239
You know who's the leader of this

1223
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,823
You know if anybody does something foggy

1224
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:28,479
Excuse the symbol of their elected leaders

1225
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
Just so you know that

1226
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,807
I didn't even think about that

1227
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:37,439
That's interesting. Interesting possible way to read that

1228
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,487
She's getting to real right now

1229
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,255
Trump

1230
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:45,631
Totally

1231
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,447
I can't let this s*** happen you're going to kill my kids

1232
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:54,335
That is that is an interesting possible cover-your-ass kind of

1233
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:57,151
Huh I didn't think about the Envy interesting see where things

1234
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:02,015
Things go I don't know if there's any strong indications

1235
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,551
From the rest of this episode

1236
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,599
But I want to keep that in mind

1237
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,439
Otherwise they're going to kill Trump Hospital

1238
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,255
Want to be a fear Monger for no reason

1239
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,351
I want to be if you're looking for money from sticking

1240
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,399
Are way more dangerous than covid-19

1241
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,751
Do doctors in a press conference yesterday

1242
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:27,359
We're monitoring him at Walter Reed Medical Facility because of the treatments

1243
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:35,039
Don't worry

1244
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,111
K drug

1245
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,183
Patent shopping

1246
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,279
You can't solve

1247
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,559
50 boxes behind

1248
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,423
Thousands of dollars per dose on

1249
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:56,799
Showtime

1250
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:06,783
We have the Infowars emergency elections Dale blowout our best-selling products that are still amazing experiences

1251
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,319
Yourself cool man

1252
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:11,135
Evil plan assembly.

1253
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:17,535
Trip for a few grand at a time they won't give Trump hydroxy

1254
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,423
Silly

1255
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:29,823
Now there's a further problem of this and that is if you'll recall a couple months ago Trump said he would take

1256
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,639
Taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative

1257
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:39,039
That by not work

1258
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
Gets us busy

1259
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:43,647
That's what this next clip is actually about but Alex misrepresented

1260
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,439
Persona headlines

1261
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,535
Faces credibility crisis

1262
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,863
They're saying he says it doesn't exist

1263
01:08:54,143 --> 01:09:00,287
Shut down travel from China crisis is about knowing knowing what to believe

1264
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,103
The credibility crisis is about that like

1265
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:09,503
He said he was taking hydroxychloroquine baby he was maybe he wasn't that no one knows

1266
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:13,855
That's why I like I think it's kind of irresponsible for folks like

1267
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,391
Michael Moore others to be like

1268
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:19,487
Hey you probably faking that you have no reason to

1269
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,791
You leave that other than distrust you

1270
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,815
So I think

1271
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:27,167
I think positing it is a little irresponsible but at the same time I totally understand

1272
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:31,263
Where the impulse who knows what the f*** is going on anything could be happy

1273
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:36,127
Real crazy conspiracies because they think that Alex Jones

1274
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,151
Williams work

1275
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:37,919
It's

1276
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:42,783
It's understandable to have your brain go into those areas

1277
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,807
I'd like

1278
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,623
Hey it's it's because of a crisis of

1279
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:49,183
Confident like I don't know what believe this s***

1280
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,511
These people are saying contradictory things can't believe

1281
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,535
The presidents

1282
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,303
Doctor

1283
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,863
Because the president's doctor

1284
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,447
Is told to lie about his condition to make him look good

1285
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,007
If you can't believe the doctor

1286
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
That is

1287
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,311
Covering the president

1288
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,103
You can't believe it

1289
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:12,223
Like that's the only like that should be literally the only job where you cannot lie

1290
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,807
Just doctor shouldn't be

1291
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,831
You can't lie

1292
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:21,439
Isn't there something wrong with that I don't know I don't know if that's in the

1293
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,207
I don't hide

1294
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:27,071
Probably not in those I think Epocrates was probably like well there's no way somebody would lie about the

1295
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:33,471
President getting hurt

1296
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:40,127
To buy Sunday Alex is kind of having to wrestle with the like well when I suggested it was a false positive

1297
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
It looks like I was wrong

1298
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
I think Trump is actually

1299
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:48,319
Maybe a problem about the only thing that Alex can work with is playing games around like

1300
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,623
See that's it

1301
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,951
Is he sick enough to have these preet alright

1302
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,255
Trump's blood oxygen level drop

1303
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
Probably Friday

1304
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,327
Parking health concerns

1305
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,863
Meadows

1306
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:05,471
So that's what the White House is now saying that

1307
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,751
His oxygen level

1308
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,311
Have a good eye

1309
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,711
You look very narrow face

1310
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,015
Passion

1311
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:18,783
Barry White

1312
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
Credit Karma

1313
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,367
Orange Glo

1314
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:29,279
What is a regular cold

1315
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:33,631
But they're giving him you don't

1316
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:40,799
So if you think the Trump drop 20 or 15 lb since the debate sure if that's

1317
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,335
Severe nausea

1318
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,127
Something really f***** up

1319
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:44,895
Few days

1320
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,431
Who doesn't look at

1321
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:50,527
You take you take a lot of zinc you lose 5225 everybody knows

1322
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:54,367
It's very unhealthy

1323
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:58,719
Yeah I think Alex is like I don't know where is he on dab.

1324
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,767
Where is he

1325
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,071
He's somewhere in there

1326
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,375
Starting to compost

1327
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,447
Deal-making

1328
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:11,007
Speaking to make a deal

1329
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:11,775
Yeah

1330
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,311
Never gotten supplements you never got

1331
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,335
Elmer book

1332
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,639
Now is the time it could be your last chance

1333
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,663
Because I'm

1334
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:18,943
I'm in business IC

1335
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,039
We can reorder

1336
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,623
Stockbridge

1337
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:27,903
Best selling

1338
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,743
You are my mom

1339
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,559
40 hour straight

1340
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,607
Apple the next year

1341
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,399
I thought about George Soros

1342
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,959
You so thanks for taking action

1343
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,983
Get the Money and Run

1344
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:48,639
That would support your theory

1345
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
If I were him

1346
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:56,575
100% it's getting too hot I know I can't imagine making a plan

1347
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,855
That far in advance

1348
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:01,439
Right now if you know what I mean like next Wednesday we're going to do something

1349
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,255
I don't know what I'm going to do within the next

1350
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:07,583
4 hours every Twitter update I get I'm like

1351
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,119
Is this the MoMA

1352
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,447
Weak there is no next

1353
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:18,847
There's a decent chance that I will f*** around and convince myself to watch that entire funny cam

1354
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:22,687
Probably not because I've done that in the past and so much of it is just like

1355
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,479
You playing the same video

1356
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,759
Although I think it might be

1357
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,039
It'll be really fun

1358
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:30,367
Do do that as some kind of a marathon or something

1359
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:38,815
It wouldn't you can have fun in my head you could live stream it and have a nice little watch party with with

1360
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,583
Bunch of policy

1361
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:43,423
Could I want to do that to people

1362
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,983
Think about something

1363
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,775
Hillary

1364
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,311
Really

1365
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
Talking Hillary

1366
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,615
Right now

1367
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,151
Well I mean do you know what happen

1368
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,175
I don't care

1369
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,967
This is actually really serious

1370
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,247
I mean

1371
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:00,575
Good looking like a very serious is very very Siri

1372
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,279
Let me search engine what's in this book

1373
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,583
Far worse than 40

1374
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,823
And actually Lori posed with a book

1375
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,383
What the devil

1376
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,943
Hillary Clinton at sexually explicit

1377
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,967
Book of satanic

1378
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,735
Blastoise

1379
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:33,343
Okay okay now damn

1380
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,415
Does he not know that Larry

1381
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
He doesn't

1382
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:42,303
Well you might know he hasn't brought it up

1383
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,095
Dude okay Hillary Clinton

1384
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,143
I don't even know this is now a podcast

1385
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,447
I did not know that

1386
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:50,751
Until she had a picture of herself recording a podcast

1387
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,031
Since you had a laptop

1388
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,567
It was sitting on a pile of books

1389
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,591
One of them

1390
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,127
What is an art book

1391
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,663
By this Italian

1392
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,735
Glass sculptor and apparently

1393
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,527
There is a Biggs about devils

1394
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,295
Suck it

1395
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:15,071
Alex is like a man it's it's Devil Ray okay so you're telling me that the president is on the verge of death

1396
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:19,423
And we're having an argument about whether or not the Venus de Milo should be shown in

1397
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,447
Schools

1398
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,519
Blown glass grape

1399
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:27,615
In the shape of devils having sex off is a sign

1400
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,151
Haha of the devil

1401
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:36,063
I'm pissed and we have been doing this for almost four years now and I bet Hillary has more listeners

1402
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,623
And I just don't think she's put in the time

1403
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,415
I mean I think

1404
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,207
Grammy making what is she done

1405
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,023
Andrew Secretary of State

1406
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,839
What you think of as the leg work

1407
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:51,423
Resume is much better than mine

1408
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,263
So

1409
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:59,359
Has this weird thing towards the lake

1410
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,383
The end of

1411
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,687
The 2nd hour

1412
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,479
Sunday's show

1413
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,015
Alex is in a weird mood

1414
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,551
He's talking about

1415
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,831
How

1416
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:09,855
He

1417
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,135
Is the last

1418
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:12,927
Person

1419
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:18,815
Who gets the information that that naked whenever they can't get the information out any other way

1420
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,839
They go to him

1421
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:24,959
Because they know that he's Brave and he'll I do that makes him a crap cover

1422
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,239
Toad or something

1423
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:29,311
Sounds very bitter about like

1424
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:34,175
Why am I not the first choice if I'm the one who's brave enough to put out the information

1425
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:37,247
We told you that's been out here before he released it

1426
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,015
Why

1427
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,319
William Benny I just met

1428
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,391
With the head of US National Intelligence ametron

01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,951
He already gave me until they gave him the Intel

1430
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,767
Instead no one's covering this we gave it the fox

1431
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,327
Go on Jones's showings

1432

Asha

Call Me Up and Hold My Hand go

City Hall

1447
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,079
Olive crap

1448
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,639

So bitter

1453
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:50,975
Is bad

1454
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,791
Yeah

1455
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
Like

1456
01:17:56,351 --> 01:18:02,495
That's what they do with you whenever they're like will throw this phone

1457
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:08,895
The people at Fox couldn't get away with putting this out because it's ridiculous and they wouldn't make it past any

1458
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,919
Any kind of editors

1459
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:13,247
Even though the shoddy ones that they may be employees

1460
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:16,063
So yes toad,

1461
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
Hey Dan quick question

1462
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:23,231
What would you call William Bennie's Warehouse where they hold those blackmailed

1463
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,559
Go for it

1464
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,583
Benny's Leverage

1465
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,351
Depot

1466
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,423
Oh I get it

1467
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:36,031
Sorry it took me a second to be a play on the liquor store

1468
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:39,615
But people outside of the Chicagoland area might not know

1469
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:41,151
Is there is a Binny's

1470
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:44,735
Beverage Depot liquor store here in Chicago

1471
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:50,879
Maybe maybe a couple other cities but I certainly don't think there's any of Europe

1472
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:54,975
This is a little bit of a US citizenship

1473
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,535
Alex

1474
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,351
You can tell there's a little bit of a different mood there

1475
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,631
He's bummed

1476
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,655
He's mad

1477
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,959
But I also think that he's getting a little drunk

1478
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,239
I think

1479
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:11,871
I think he started drinking during the first hour there's a point where you can really hear him take a tug on something

1480
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,943
But I don't you know you don't know it could be water could be

1481
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:19,807
I'm not saying for sure that in the second hour of his Sunday show he is in fact

1482
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,575
Struck

1483
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:21,855
He's different

1484
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,159
The first hour is

1485
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:27,999
It is what it is it's a normal just Alex Jones stupid show

1486
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:31,583
The second hour he brings in John bowne

1487
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,375
Gregory's

1488
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,399
Sheet Gates

1489
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,423
Off the rails

1490
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,703
So fat all right

1491
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:42,335
Here's John bound talking about how everyone who's not like his kind of Christian

1492
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:45,407
He's basically going to end up being into working for Sabre

1493
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,735
Their satanic

1494
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:52,575
Even if you think you're an atheist at this point you got to choose sides

1495
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,111
Because

1496
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,903
You're going to end up satanic

1497
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,487
End up seitan

1498
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,279
Can I suggest

1499
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:07,935
You will not end up satanic. The end up being viewed as satanic

1500
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:13,824
Bow wow there's that it's okay even if you are just an atheist or a Muslim or Buddhist store

1501
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,872
Jewish going to like hey

1502
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:18,688
We're going to call you Satanist eventually

1503
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,992
You understand with the script

1504
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:24,832
Or eventually we will label you all satan that sound

1505
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:28,160
Play basketball at the YMCA together I'm not a saint

1506
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,696
That's why would I even be allowed

1507
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,720
Now you're saying

1508
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,744
Hasbro

1509
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,376
Is where I really got the sense that maybe Alex is a little bit boozed-up

1510
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:41,728
They're talking about how they don't prepare for these interviews that they do just great

1511
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,264
Metallic

1512
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,544
This is just getting f***** up

1513
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:51,200
You turn on even turn on Fox News turn on MSNBC that just put you right back to sleep everything

1514
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,480

We never do any preparation for the show and then end with hugging and crying

1530
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:56,992
You would prepared for the show we wouldn't be hugging and crying cuz I supposed

1531
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,040
In Subway's you're right it's always I

01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:07,488
Kirby weeping drug people everywhere

1534
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,768
Everyone knows this

1535
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:12,608
It's only a love of Satan that keeps the rest of us

1536
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,680
Diaphragm getting drunk on an air and cry

1537
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:19,776
Oh God

1538
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,080
Care for each other or anything like that

1539
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,640
Or the way this is happening

1540
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,688
It's not

1541
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,480
Vulnerability

1542
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:33,088
Think is a little intense here to begin with

1543
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,904
By considering you didn't even bring up Larry Nichols

1544
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:41,280
That is fruit

1545
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:44,096
Anyway Greg grease is an optimist

1546
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,376
Vixella

1547
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,656
But not anymore man

1548
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:53,568
And I never I'm a very optimistic person I think through all of this but the day that President Trump and Melania Trump announces

1549
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:56,128
Today we had covid and they're going into the hospital

1550
01:22:56,896 --> 01:23:01,504
I would say that's the day that my optimism ended I don't think

1551
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,784
Panama song

1552
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:09,184
And to have them at Walter Reed hospital surrounded by big bottle. Just real complex at Walter Reed

1553
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,720
If you were to die

1554
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,256
From quote-unquote

1555
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
Covid

1556
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,864
It just seems to me like everything that the enemy has everything wrapped up till

1557
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,424
I've never seen the enemy so close to Victory

1558
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,472
Through all this until right now

1559
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,008
Poor guy lost his optimism

1560
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:30,688
So now we've developed fully from it's probably a false positive test to they

1561
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:35,296
Probably some weaponize covid-19 and now the doctors are trying to kill him with experimental treatment

1562
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,320
Walter Reed

1563
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,880
Steve doesn't go anywhere good now

1564
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,928
If this is what Reese is bringing

1565
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,744
Terrified of what pechanec would have said

1566
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,352

1568
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:59,104
Advocated arms overthrow now

1569
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:04,736
Breaking the law

1570
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:08,064
Well Steve wouldn't let Alex cry

1571
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:11,648
So I will put my life on the line for my

1572
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,696
Child's future and this country

1573
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,768
And we're reaching a point like you're even like

1574
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,728
How much longer

1575
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,008
Is the man

1576
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,544
But you're going to do it

1577
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,616
Yeah

1578
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,896
Slap yourself

1579
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,664
In the face twice

1580
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,968
We got to make Melania Queen now

1581
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:36,992
Alex

1582
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,576
Get off air

1583
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,392
You can let John bowne and gris-gris host

1584
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,928
You don't need to be there

1585
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:47,744
You're clearly going through something

1586
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,072
Whether it's intoxication or just over

1587
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:54,656
Emotional whatever it's not good this is a bad

1588
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,680
No this is bad

1589
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,752
War war is coming

1590
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,896
So what's going to happen next at the only way we're ever going to get through this I think I think at this point there's going to be War

1591
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,064
4

1592
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:20,512
What ancient civilizations we don't even understand half the stuff that all line up already

1593
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:23,328
Okay alright alright alright

1594
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,376
Okay

1595
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,144
Okay

1596
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,680
Are you telling me that I'm going to have

1597
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,448
How to Diana

1598
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:30,240
Civil War because some assholes

1599
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,288
Atlantis already

1600
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,056
Blue waffle

1601
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,080
Okay cool

1602
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:40,480
Here's the only way I could ever regain respect for Gregory's for johnbowne but Alex says

1603
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,248
4 twice

1604
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,856
What about me to say huh and then the other needed to say what is it good for

1605
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,392
Absolutely nothing

1606
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:54,048
Good got everything inside Bass

1607
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:57,632
So f****** funny

1608
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:04,032
Can you imagine the f****** it would short-circuit Alex's drug braids

1609
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,056
Roar

1610
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,200
Anyways let's get back to

1611
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:13,760
Otherwise we're going to have a war right we're going to war

1612
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:20,160
Feel bad just sitting next to Alexandra trying to express like this point I really don't think there's anything that can be done

1613
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,312
You know a lot of us don't know what the ancient edited yeah they already blew up Atlantis like okay

1614
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:41,408
Sure

1615
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,200
Corporate Wars

1616
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,224
Sure

1617
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,248
Not this one

1618
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:50,112
I would say it's safe to say the most of the wars we grew up with our corporate Wars at work

1619
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,904
Started under false premises

1620
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,696
This war is

1621
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:54,464
I mean

1622
01:26:54,720 --> 01:27:00,864
For lack of a better word perhaps a Christian revolution of some sort

1623
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
Christian

1624
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,192
Call the Jihad until there's one

1625
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,728
But we are under attack

1626
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,824
Is there going to come for you because your relationship with God

1627
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,616
They're going to know the algorithm

1628
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:14,176
You're connected to the big guy

1629
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:18,528
It's it's the war in heaven is about to happen here on Earth

1630
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,808
Whoa

1631
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,672
Guys this is a news show you know it's fun it's nice when they finally just like

1632
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,440
Yeah where I

1633
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,488
We're going to go

1634
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:33,888
Is the jahat where Isis where were the Republican party where ISIS come on back

1635
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:36,960
Is there Isis where Isis

1636
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:40,544
It's defensive

1637
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:45,152
Anyway this just deteriorates into what I would describe as a zealot recession

1638
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,944
We're on this planet

1639
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,064
We have to accept

1640
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,088
Responsibility

1641
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,368
Absolutely

1642
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:58,720
And right now we are at it's up to all of us it's up to everyone

1643
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:02,560
And this is why I feel so bad for the herd is because they're missing out

1644
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:08,960
One of the most epic opportunities that life ever has to offer which is actually take responsibility scan

1645
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:09,728
And up

1646
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,752
Fight evil

1647
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,032
Clean the garden

1648
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:17,152
And create a world for our grandchildren they're missing out a normal it's Unlimited

1649
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:21,248
They have an excuse for everything you just said

1650
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:23,552
They have an anti

1651
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,832
Argumentative

1652
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:25,856
You know

1653
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:29,184
Baphomet

1654
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,232
Could we know all that Gargamel

1655
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,304
Only building is betrayal

1656
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:41,216
Well it's it is amazing that we

1657
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,496
Whoa

1658
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:47,104
Alex when he's like all they build his betrayal he can't even like

1659
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:52,736
Pause there because Alex can't keep up with the thought I think the John

1660
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,016
And Greg are brothers like

1661
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:56,576
Gay Alec

1662
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,856
This is going through something

1663
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:58,624
Depth

1664
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,952
This is what belief system

1665
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,720
Like

1666
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:09,120
The only way we can create a better world for our grandchildren is obviously by slaughtering hundreds of

1667
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:11,424
Dozens of people at no point was he like

1668
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:14,240
Maybe we could do some research into agriculture

1669
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:19,360
Go take away rights anything

1670
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:25,248
Obviously the people who've gone around and slaughtered in order to create a grandchildren in the world

1671
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:29,856
Invented microphones right they were the ones who did it that we're sneaking into 7-Eleven

1672
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:34,208
So Alex go to break and I guess you like splashing water on his face

1673
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,256
He comes back a little bit more

1674
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,024
Composed

1675
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:41,888
Hours of the transmission

1676
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,448
Minute

1677
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:54,944
Harrison Smith

1678
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:01,344
And the old might stop selling it stuff

1679
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,136
Yummy and my God

1680
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,952
But you lit up

1681
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,304
Whoa

1682
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:17,728
I mean I feel like that's my response to a lot of this stuff is just woke

1683
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:22,848
Then God downloads things into my head and I know that I

1684
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,896
Got invisible how about no

1685
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:28,480
You go back inside take a nap you go back inside

1686
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:30,272
Get a glass of coffee

1687
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,552
Shitfucker

1688
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:34,624
Together man

1689
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:42,048
Hi I just wish it was just

1690
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,096
The two of us that would be nice

1691
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:47,424
Be nice my brother is John Brown and Gregory

1692
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:51,264
Let me tell you about how God gives me magic

1693
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:59,968
I'll be sober up more booze

1694
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,760
Is whiskey

1695
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:02,784
Do you have

1696
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,344
Big noyd Sky another with

1697
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,208
Wow just ridiculous

1698
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:14,560
So we already heard earlier that John down and Greg Reese

1699
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:19,936
Discussing and Alex to discussing how they don't do any pretty interviews right sort of a sign of

1700
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:20,704
Virtue

1701
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,496
Sure again

1702
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,592
Get more into this no preparation means good

1703
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,408
It's almost predictable when I went to report

1704
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:32,224
Comes on like just inspired and end

1705
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:36,320
Rapidan quick and get it out of those tend to be over the target

1706
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:39,136
Whereas if I spend a lot of time

1707
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:45,280
You know trying to pick a reports like I said The more egos involved in my report the less effective it is but you can feel the spirit

1708
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:51,680
It's almost too much research

1709
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:59,616
We need this out

1710
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,432
We're turning the god

1711
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,712
The real thing

1712
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:04,992
Okay Alex

1713
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:10,368
Gobi three old men in a bar that conversation is fine

1714
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:12,160
I understand

1715
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:15,488
Kind of white like there's two things

1716
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:20,608
I would say in response to the work process but they're discussing

1717
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,912
What is creativity is really into

1718
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:26,496
The same thing where a lot of times inspiration can strike in a way that

1719
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:30,080
You can feel like you're a conduit of creativity and like

1720
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:36,480
Startimes I'm sure you experience listen to write a good book

1721
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,248
Sometimes it's easier

1722
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,064
And end I know that macaroni

1723
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:46,464
It's something a lot of people talk about about the experience of the flow you know that kind of thing where

1724
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,488
Writing

1725
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:52,352
Can't get anything going and then out of nowhere and then you get a page sure she do that kind of thing

1726
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,144
That's one thing that's creativity

1727
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,168
Work

1728
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,192
And research

1729
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,216
Is a little

1730
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:57,984
A little

1731
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,520
I do not think

1732
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:01,312
They're what they're describing is like

1733
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,848
The flow or anything

1734
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:03,872
I think it's

1735
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,920
Oh this is easy

1736
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:12,320
That's the way I would go with that they intuitively and instinctively just gravitate towards things that are not very

1737
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:14,624
Difficult these dumb Boutique

1738
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:22,048
Making conservatives angry stories are really easy yelling about the devil is really

1739
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:23,840
Easy getting into the new on two things

1740
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,888
It's not it's very challenging

1741
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,680
Here's what I heard

1742
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:28,960
I heard

1743
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:32,032
My workflow is I go through a bunch of headlines

1744
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:34,080
And then when I see one that makes me think

1745
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,360
Thank you I'm almost done

1746
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:38,432
That's the one that I work on yes that's what I hear two

1747
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:42,272
And I'm really sick and tired of these people like Alex on his employees

1748
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,808
Trying to present

1749
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,600
Not trying

1750
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,624
And

1751
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,160
Putting in no effort

1752
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:53,024
And taking just the easiest path as some kind of indication of like rigor

1753
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:57,888
Virtue or God is working through me

1754
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:59,680
No this is this is

1755
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,704
Totally like that

1756
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:02,496
Failed right wing

1757
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:08,896
Field comedians become right-wing commentators because this is the type of conversation that I heard in the back of an open mic from

1758
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,944
First and second-year baby comic

1759
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,712
It's all the time

1760
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,248
Just that like

1761
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:15,296
You know my writing process is

1762
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:19,392
It's all about inspiration you know it hits me and I don't really do too much and all that

1763
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,160
70 likes

1764
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:22,720
Hey dudes what are you trying to get a job at

1765
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:29,120
Any other outlet with that anywhere but info

1766
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:35,776
Not a f****** chance tell me oh I love doing stand-up then f****** care about working at it assholes

1767
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,592
And I John

1768
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:43,200
Work at Infowars you have for a long time because you're unemployable in any other capacity

1769
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,480
Is what you do sucks

1770
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:48,576
Yep anyway Greg says something really stupid here

1771
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:50,112
Skip isn't because it's kind of like

1772
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,136
It's fun

1773
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:55,232
And you can feel the psychology the moment Trump won in the hospital

1774
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:59,072
And I would argue that even people on the left

1775
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:01,376
He offered a sense of security

1776
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:05,216
In the past few years

1777
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,800
Now you feel it oh wait it's not

1778
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,080
Yeah yeah man

1779
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:16,224
No but I feel like when Trump went to the hospital that was the last was really like oh no

1780
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,016
Here's the invention for

1781
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,600
Did the doctor who killed drop

1782
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:24,416
All right here's the invention that he has to make

1783
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:28,512
It's a little device that attaches to every right-wing commentators

1784
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,816
Shoulder right here on the right wing

1785
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,584
Exactly

1786
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:36,448
Whenever they say something like I think Trump has made us all feel a sense of security

1787
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,728
A little hand comes out

1788
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,496
Slaps him in the face

1789
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:43,872
I don't know if it's his groundbreaking is like a telephone is

1790
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,152
Honestly it might do more for

1791
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:45,920
Society

1792
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:47,456
Play one last clip and it's

1793
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,736
It's Alex

1794
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:55,136
I would say you spent the better part of this hour at just having a Christian Zealot recession with these two dudes

1795
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:57,952
Answer me it's kind of funny that he's promoting the next

1796
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:01,792
Show as being the one where they can really have the time to get into the topic wow

1797
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,656

Long time ago rolynos

1801
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:18,688
But just remember the enemy wants you to feel power

1802
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:21,504
And not realize the power you have

1803
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:24,576
To tell folks about this show right

1804
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,648
We are so close to winning so close to losing

1805
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:39,168
That's fascinating but you have the power

1806
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,216
Promote my stuff for free

1807
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,800
I got to go to bed

1808
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:47,616
Of somebody who knows my audience

1809
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:48,896

Too threatening to their sense of self who abandoned me at the point

1813
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,136
Play car show Dan

1814
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,160
They know

1815
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,440
Inside

1816
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:02,720
I'll just

1817
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,488
Turn it off

1818
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:04,256

To do a good job

1822
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,632
I think I just also would feel pretty bad

1823
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,704
With or without

1824
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,520
In audience

1825
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:17,312
Remember when we didn't have an audience

1826
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,080
Wow

1827
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:20,640
You could do

1828
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,408
Just be like

1829
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:28,064
Drunk

1830
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,392

1832
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:41,376

1833
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,656
My intern Harris

1834
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,424
Smith

1835
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,192
Isn't that

1836
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:47,008
Excited

1837
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,032
Is not exciting

1838
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,056
Can chest guy

1839
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,336
You just turn it off

1840
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,360
Now

1841
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:57,504
It would be nice if they did. Video it seems like a lot of folks

1842
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
At the weather

1843
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:01,344
I think a lot of people were like come on man

1844
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,160
Poisoning m f****** Walter Reed doctors

1845
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:09,792
I don't know how those comments are Vinny like generalized Shillings

1846
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:12,864
I'm sure if I don't I don't track the comments on there

1847
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,912
Generally

1848
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:19,264
How different that is from normal trolls f****** around

1849
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:23,872
I did enjoy seeing it people saying grow up

1850
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:26,688
Warms your heart when somebody finally

1851
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,736
Appropriate response

1852
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,576
Interesting Lee

1853
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:36,416
I mean we come to the end of this this weekend coverage into

1854
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:38,464
Slam dunk

1855
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:43,840
Yeah that's what I was going to call that a slam dunk of the weekend

1856
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:44,864
It doesn't

1857
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,144
Feel like

1858
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,168
Alex

1859
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:47,936

1860
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,704
Thanks

1861
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,544
Trump realize the president might die in the next few days

1862
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:57,920
Of the United States clearly is aware of that he said that

1863
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,712
He says it is as much

1864
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:04,832
He's not acting as if that's the case and that's kind of weird to me and I don't know what the deal is

1865
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:05,600
Spell the way he

1866
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,392
He said he would act if it were the case

1867
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:12,768
To start a f****** war that is true it seems like right now they're all trying to like

1868
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:16,352
Psych themselves up because they know that they have no interest

1869
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,888
Did a war

1870
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:24,288
If my Sunday Alex's drunkenly talking about he's sure that they hit Trump with something in the trying to kill her

1871
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,312
Women Hospital

1872
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,616
Like what are you doing about it

1873
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:30,432
If you believe that's in any way true

1874
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:37,856
How are you still on the radio talking with your two friends or I'd see you some headlines

1875
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:41,440
Single like Alex it said that he's going to go fly to dc2

1876
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:43,744
Help Trump or whatever

1877
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,352
I didn't hear that on his show he must put out like some kind of the other video

1878
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:53,216
Where you said that on Friday but then you changed

1879
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:59,616
His mind it was like a that's why I was like like at the at the airport

1880
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:06,016
Alex might be going to BC maybe not also Marathon money bomb on Wednesday Lottery stuff

1881
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:09,344
Coming up now but hate this

1882
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:12,672
I'm glad that I found something else this little side project

1883
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:13,952

1884
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:14,720
Keep me

1885
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:19,328
Really interested and my attention away for like how much I think

1886
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,632
This is all spiraling down the drain

1887
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:24,192
Yeah but I will be

1888
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:28,032
Deep coverage that money Bob that's for sure

1889
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:33,408
But before we get out of here today Jordan let's take some voicemail

1890
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,176
The people

1891
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,712
Hey pack

1892
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:37,504

Is on rifle

1894
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,184
And a couple weeks ago

1895
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,304
Which I think is a shame because they offer up

1896
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:52,864
Problem

1897
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,400
Like this section of

1898
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,168
Roar

1899
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,192
Alexis

1900
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:58,752
Pretty wild

1901
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,288
Weird boys

1902
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,056
Icycle

1903
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:02,336
Powerful oryx

1904
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,128
Focal point

1905
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,408
For the energies of

1906
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,944
Consciously generated

1907
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,968
By their green tea

1908
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:11,040
Energy that binds them together with a

1909
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:11,808
Common purpose

1910
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:12,832
Unfortunately

1911
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,112
Your voice

1912
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,208
Light slash around it

1913
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,000
Sparks fly from his eyes

1914
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,536
And Rob powersearch

1915
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,304
Dribble from his

1916
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:30,240
Unless it weird voice find somewhere that elusive

1917
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,288
Head will explode

1918
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,312
Reborns

1919
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,128
The other boys

1920
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:37,664
Towanda

1921
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,688
About an hour

1922
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,968
Max wearing warning Bells

1923
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:42,528
Inevitably

1924
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,088
Disturbed

1925
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,048
Other than that

1926
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:56,864
I really love the show love you and Dad

1927
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,632
Take it easy

1928
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:05,824
Do you think every leader of a proud boy cell is called a weird boy

1929
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:14,016
Yeah but I would say I'm a notice at the Grand wizard of the KKK.

1930
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:15,296
Honorific title

1931
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:18,112
Feel like I feel like I actually do know this

1932
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,136
Yeah

1933
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:25,536
No I don't I just I'm thinking of like various people who were probably like Rufio panman

1934
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,864
Truthettes based Stickman

1935
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,888
One of them

1936
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,448
If any one of them has stolen Raptor princess

1937
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:34,752
We literally personally have to go fight the power

1938
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:36,032
Probably

1939
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:38,080
Next article

1940
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,128

What superpower would you abused

1945
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,904
That's it that's the call.

1946
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:56,256
Asked I think I'm a terrible Australian

1947
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:59,328

1948
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:05,728
The city hall of the best ice cream shop in America Betty Ray's check it out if you're online and I into it all

Superpower would you what is abused mean

1953
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:18,272
Like I understand it like peeping on people with x-ray vision is definitely abusing our I wouldn't do that

1954
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,808
What is it like

1955
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:23,392
If I could have like you power to grow plants sure

1956
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:26,464
I would have use that power for how would I abused it

1957
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,608
People up with plans cuz I wouldn't do that here's my question

1958
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,376
Do you like

1959
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:36,960
Cuz I think it's kind of what we're going to talk about

1960
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:39,008
I don't want to abuse people with

1961
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:42,592
With the power that's the issue how do you abused

1962
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:45,664
The power right now here's my

1963
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:48,224
Siri on how you abused just the power

1964
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,504
We have to get to

1965
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,552
Be wasteful with it exactly

1966
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:52,576
I can

1967
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,344
Create

1968
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,368
Anyting

1969
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:57,184
I can turn anything into diamonds or gold

1970
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,976
And I just never do

1971
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:01,024
Like I can

1972
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:04,608
Any any any financial problems

1973
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,632
I just never do

1974
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:12,032
I abused that power responsibly by not using that power

1975
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:15,616
I would be like I just refuse to make food for anybody

1976
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:18,688
That would be an abuse of your power I wouldn't do that

1977
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:20,480
I wouldn't be with a power I guess

1978
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,272
Yeah I mean I guess if I could like

1979
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:24,064
Let's be honest

1980
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:28,928
If I could like communicate with ATMs with my mind and like take out money sure

1981
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,696
I might do that

1982
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:33,280
That's not an abusive urpower that's the only responsible way to use it

1983
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:35,584
That money's not even real Deb

1984
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:40,192
Yeah that's where the debate comes in what does it mean to abuse your power

1985
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,216
I don't know

1986
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:43,008
Use flying

1987
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,800
Just do it too much

1988
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:49,664
Is it you're stealing it from the birds ceiling are from the birds

1989
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,200

01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:53,248
Happy birthday

1991
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:57,856
Intrinsically abusing the superpower means that you're doing it in the villainess way

1992
01:44:58,112 --> 01:45:01,696
To another person like you're using your

1993
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:03,488
Brain powers

1994
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:05,280
To force people to do things

1995
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,840
I wouldn't want it I wouldn't want to mess with any of that stuff

1996
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,376
I don't know I

1997
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,400
If you

1998
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:16,800
Well it's like it's like going to a gun range like you're using me if your superpower is your gun and you go to the gun

1999
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,848
Ranger using your superpower responsive

2000
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:21,920
You're not abusing that power your your shooting

2001
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,712
You know it is safe space

2002
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:29,088
I thought of one maybe sure like okay so if I could breathe underwater ok

2003
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:31,136
Go and live in the water

2004
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:36,256
Using the power cuz I be isolated myself from all the humankind living with fish

2005
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:40,352
I mean if you weren't susceptible to cold you live in Antarctica that's

2006
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,400
That's a really abusing your power

2007
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:49,056
I mean it would just be using the power to facilitate me live in the middle of nowhere

2008
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:55,456
Activist by moving into the middle of nowhere it's not abusing anybody that's just me

2009
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,224
Light under the wood

2010
01:45:56,992 --> 01:46:03,136
I don't know why that's an interesting philosophical question about how one would abuser power

2011
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,160
Bring us to answer that's why

2012
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,184
No

2013
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,232
I don't have a good answer I guess me neither

2014
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,280

I heard about you

2022
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:22,848

I guess that's too generous

2025
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,760
But you captured

2026
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:30,784

Thank you very much weird is that that's very weird

2035
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,640
Unexpected the idea that someone would

2036
01:46:56,896 --> 01:47:03,040
I never thought anyone would like the show to begin with the idea that someone would like it and then their parent would be able to enjoy it with them

2037
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:05,088
We heard that from a couple folks

2038
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:06,880
Set over the course of doing the show

2039
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:12,256
Way more than expected them and like it's just really neat that there is some sort of a generational appeal

2040
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:17,120
There are parents out there who don't mind my potty mouth

2041
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:21,728
I understand on a certain level because

2042
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:24,032
You know I can go watch a movie with my dad

2043
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,848

2044
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:30,176
Peace of culture in a similar way and we'll be like

2045
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:32,992
But not anything where it's like

2046
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:39,904
I'm talking about politics and s*** like I was just that intergenerational sharing of

2047
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,696
It's very Fastenal podcast is not a p

2048
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:48,096
Peace of culture exactly

2049
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:50,144

2050
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,216
