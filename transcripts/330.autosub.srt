1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Damned important

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,064
Alex B

4
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088
Fight.com

5
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
Stop sign

6
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,216
Even though I started what's up

7
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,568
My first

8
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
First cellular phone

9
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,064
I have a lot of memories of my parents having one of those

10
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Turn Wheel song

11
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,696
In the hole

12
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
Terrible

13
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,792
We are both

14
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
What they decided

15
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
Like that was a presentation

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
You think back on that

17
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,104
I don't know if I had

18
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Some point

19
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
But I don't remember any

20
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
Specific Like A Garfield phone

21
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
Cell phone I got

22
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
Really late

23
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
He's ready to have a thumb.

24
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
I had no interest

25
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,120
No

26
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,936
I removed my parents house

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
Second house phone

28
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,824
I really enjoyed at that point in my life the ability to

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
To not because

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,200
Yeah I give it is all before social media

31
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,016
I would go out and I come home and there be

32
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,576
And I really enjoy

33
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,976
I wasn't that popular I enjoy the aspect of like there if I'm out and about I don't

34

Like

36
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Something

37
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
I won't be necessary

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,960
Found ya

39
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752

Don't even remember that

41
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
I can remember it I don't

42
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
It's hard for me to remember exactly what I love so much about it is dealt with time

43
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
But I remember enjoying

44
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
When I was 18

45
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
I got a cell phone I got a flip phone

46
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
And then I had

47
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
Forever

48
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,536
I didn't get an iPhone or any kind of

49
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Smartphone

50
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096

00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
4

52
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
It's pretty close to that

53
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
A very long time

54
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480

And then I got a I got a smartphone just cuz I kind of gave in

59
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
The flip phone was breaking

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,144
Years overdue for an upgrade you just wanted

161
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,583
For a long time people have been asking that we get back into Jim Bakker

162
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,887
No

163
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,447
What were you people have

164
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:18,847
There have been a lot of recommendations

165
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,175
How did Jim Bakker stuff is one-note it's so the same

166
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,319
Spoiler alert tried to record an episode that we in the middle of it

167
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
This is not an episode

168
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:35,487
Episode banquet

169
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:40,095

170
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,911
Oh my God look at this great pancake

171
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:49,311
If we take a day off of the Epic

172
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
We recorded

173
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:56,479
Not 99% of the time but sometimes I think I was probably one of them

174
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
Bisbee Breakfast

175
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903

176
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,511
Pouring a disaster

177
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,839
I think 20 minutes and we were doing it we realized

178
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,423
What are we just going to say this is stupid over Everett

179
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
This is from a bucket

180
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
Hahaha

181
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,103
The best parody of yourself

182
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
Absurd

183
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,967
So

184
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
For Jim Bakker

185
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,295
Much like people who eat his buckets to do

186
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,671
Episode

187
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
That is recent

188
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Episodes

189
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
And I was like

190
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
I was almost

191
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,095
I almost fell for the siren song again

192
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
Because there was a 3

193
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,727
Part episode that is the clearing out the warehouse sale

194
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:56,639
3 full episodes

195
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:06,623
Exact same place

196
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,463
So I decided I was going to

197
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,767
I was going to do in a rare instance

198
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
Other media coverage

199
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Direct me

200
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,911
I decided to cover an episode

201
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
That actually got a bit of

202
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,335
This is something a little bit

203
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687
The episode where Jim Bakker

204
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Invites

205
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
Michelle

206
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Sure

207
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,623
Just got your selling a gold coin

208
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,743
And prayer to each other and also

209
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,071
Donald Trump goddamnit I

210
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
The media covered

211
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
I was making fun of

212
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,079
A minute-long clip of him trying to sell this coin

213
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,687
I want to see what else happened on that episode

214
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
Is that was best for the tree

215
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,807
Of course so I decided to check in on that

216
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:12,927
Episode this is as good as I can do for you

217
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,279
I could take somebody out something somebody else cover to be like what else is going on here

218
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Specifically about

219
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,471
Well after that we can specifically

220
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,335
More f***** up things that a guy selling a magic coin

221
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
Well the most f*****-up thing is he

222
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
It is actually true

223
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,551
So here is the first clip where we get our Dancing Queen

224
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:45,951
Introduction given us the other voice over and then

225
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
When we get to meet

226
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255

Great to have you here on Gray Street and our special guest

234
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,471
Today

235
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Wow

236
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
You are on The Cutting Edge

237
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
When did God first

238
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Call you

239
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
To be a voice

240
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
4

241
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
The church

242
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
4

243
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
It really

244
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Electing the write-off

245
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
The right presidents the right

246
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Senators record

247
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:57,119
So real quick first question is

248
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
Theocratic politics

249
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
Kind of going

250
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:14,015
What religion is a scam to guy politics

251
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
George conservative

252
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,903
Call you Tyrone

253
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Real blunt

254
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
I personally think that

255
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,071
It was when I started hearing

256
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,887
A Frenchman like Rick Joyner and you

257
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Talkin about

258
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
Where America was that

259
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
Because like so many Christian

260
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
I just wanted to preach spiritual

261
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,871
Kingdom optimistic messages are focusing revised

262
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
But I heard something in your voice

263
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
Andy and the way in which you would grounded in real concern

264
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,599
It was a cash register

265
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
Oh my God

266
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
I myself

267
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
And part of the problem

268
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Because Ashley

269
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
As a as a preacher as somebody had it had an audience

270
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
I was

271
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Ignoring

272
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
What was happening

273
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:07,263
In the controversies of my country in the world in order to focus on Solutions

274
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
That's our Christ Center

275
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:15,711
I would say that solutions that are christ-centered is what your church is about that should be what you're focusing on

276
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,295
I believe

277
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,855
Beyond

278
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,975
Diffuser which is always dissatisfied

279
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
I was really afraid of losing

280
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
C3 status

281
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,863
So what you doing okay

282
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:38,239
Thunderdome

283
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
Floor give a s***

284
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,359
I do love I do love the Brilliance of the

285
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Buttering up Baker

286
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Strategy

287
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Waterbender

288
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
It was because of you

289
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
Jim Bakker

290
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,463
Actually talk about religion

291
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,607
It's really difficult about something like this is like

292
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
People who are

293
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,191
Taking in the message

294
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
Probably are doing so in

295
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,079
Yeah or at least without

296
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Swimsuit

297
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:21,759
They are taking it in Macon

298
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:28,159
I want to get conned by this guy

299
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:35,071
The consequences Witcher - are precipitated

300
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
That's barely I don't believe all of them

301
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
For signing up

302
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
Specifically for the

303
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Guile

304
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
I supposed to be the way to put it

305
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
Maybe

306
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
Think about something

307
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,319
But this is just proof that if there was a God these people would be

308
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
Very little research into

309
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
Episode because

310
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
Who gives a s***

311
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:09,119
Absolutely but I did want to find out a little bit about who Lance wallnau

312
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
Absolutely

313
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Which makes sense

314
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
Seeing that either got your on the

315
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
The Jim Bakker Show

316
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,847
Board member for the oak

317
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,479
Group listed by the Council on american-islamic relations is part of the islamophobic network

318
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,783
In America

319
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
To combat climate

320
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,951
Atwork initiative the Royal Oak initiative

321
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,279
There are groups

322
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:43,167
August 2011 the oak initiative published a book called Islam versus the United States

323
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,031
Which purported to expose the quote all-conquering characters many of the followers of Islam

324
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
They were to disseminate material that

325
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,919
62 invalidate the idea that a mosque is a form

326
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Church

327
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,503
It argues that quote even in the watered-down version

328
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
And it's clear that this religion promotes

329
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
The destruction

330
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
Or enslavement of all who do not adhere

331
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,975
Quote watered-down bright as though that's a

332
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:12,095
Rights

333
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
Come on guys you guys are

334
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Someone else who sits on the board of the Oakland A's

335
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,263
Is Alex Jones General William

336
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
Noted islamophobe of the highest order

337
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
Name is Walnut

338
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
Driving me insane

339
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
They're going to have to

340
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
Then sort of similarities

341
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Lagoon

342
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
It'll come up

343
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Slant rhyme

344
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
Support

345
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
Made a video

346
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,239
You're back

347
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:55,871
Sorry video for initiative in Islam is not a religion

348
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
It should not be protected by the First Amendment

349
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,479
I believe he based on is on determined

350
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,783
Islamic belief that Muslim

351
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
How to destroy the United

352
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
State score

353
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,135
In order to bring in Sharia law

354
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
Muhammad

355
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,047
Eventually there's going to be a whole country

356
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Take down

357
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,351
Institution that's what we got to do

358
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,679
The initiative is a major portion

359
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
Major player in the world of

360
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
Islamophobia

361
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
These narratives being

362
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
Perpetuated

363
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
Right wing

364
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
Conversation

365
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
But it's not

366
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
So they don't like

367
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,087
The oak initiative is also fiercely anti-lgbt

368
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,439
And in 2015 Michigan

369
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,511
Rainbow painted on it

370
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
Accompanied by the text

371
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Not born this way

372
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,399
And homosexuality is a behavior not a civil right

373
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:57,567
This is a run-of-the-mill bigot organization to do whatever it takes to support

374
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,847
Straight white male Christian

375
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
Supremacy

376
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
So of course

377
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,967
You not be surprised to learn that their super into Trump

378
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,991
I basically think

379
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
Absolutely

380
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:12,927
Anyway that's about all you really need to know about Lance wallnau organization

381
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,767
So you know

382
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
Succession of evil convent

383
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
World

384
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167
He's appearing on another grifters

385
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
Religious scam program

386
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
So you can

387
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,335
But I don't want to be one of these guys who goes ad hominem

388
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,271
Let's put that aside and let the man speak

389
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,367
So it is like sklep we find out when

390
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,927
Lance got politically involved

391
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
Apparently was after hearing

392
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Jim Bakker

393
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
That doesn't give us

394
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,191
To the moment that I got called by accident to the a trump meeting

395
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
And I came out of

396
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
And

397
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,615
And I walked out I was supposed to be there was like

398
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
I went up to the doorman

399
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:11,039
So real quick

400
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,599
But

401
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,696
That's in the original of the audio

402
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Like

403
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
Might have forgotten her

404
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,560
I'm not sure but I think you have

405
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,864
Yeah it's a murder his way through her dad

406
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
Gotcha

407
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
And I said

408
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:31,520
List because I thought it was a mistake made a big Ministry of something

409
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
And the guy says

410
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,872
That's what who are you

411
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
He said I heard you in a little meeting down there in Florida

412
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
You better say something

413
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Oh my God

414
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,968
Be humble just watch

415
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
I spoke

416
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
And after I

417
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,792
All I knew was.

418
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
I heard the Lord say

419
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:37,056
Some people

420
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:43,456
He gets invited to a trump meeting that makes him politically motivated I suppose which is

421
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,552
Men on some live over you

422
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
These meetings are

423
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:54,976
As much recruitment as they are bored

424
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,048
Let's get the monarchs look at all these meme makers

425
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
Galvanized

426
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
And there's that there's a strata

427
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
OG doll desk

428
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,960
I don't believe that God said

429
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Wrecking Ball

430
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
Correctness

431
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Woodside

432
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,360
I don't know it's got

433
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:18,528
Is there a is there a First Amendment in the Bible

434
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:25,440
You get to call people all kinds of racial epithets and you have to

435
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,328
You don't have full free will that is really f***** up that I've never thought about but their conception of Heaven

436
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
Mustang

437
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
Include absolute

438
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,216
The Edward around all

439
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:46,176
Should I lose my job

440
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:52,576
No they honestly believe that it in their Heaven neighborhood if I

441
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
These people are so so

442
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,768
I never thought about that but that is pretty weird

443
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
Is a wrecking ball

444
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,144
And this is Miley Cyrus

445
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,192
Sure

446
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
While he was there at this

447
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592
Specific

448
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
Went to there was

449
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,712
What he describes as a black TV channel

450
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
But it's not

451
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
And they were doing some

452
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,368
Put it there shooting some footage or so

453
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
The details on this or sketch

454
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,232
Right right right

455
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
True it might be true

456
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
If it's true

457
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
Also Jim and Lori

458
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Love this

459
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
They think this

460
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,520
Unreal

461
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
One of the

462
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
It was

463
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:52,480
But it had like a hole

464
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:58,112
African American

465
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,952
I know they see me standing

466
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,512
And they said

467
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,912
Number to Michael Cohen

468
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,176
Microphone

469
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
About

470
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
Wrecking Ball

471
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:51,104
Everywhere you go

472
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,688
I was made out of bed maybe I don't know how I got in

473
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:59,552
I don't know how I got on I guess this is what I'm supposed to do

474
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
Supernatural problem pastor

475
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,160
Answered

476
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,280
He got a catchphrase

477
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,816
That's great

478
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,680
So I guess maybe this happened and then people

479
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,472
Maybe someone wrote an article of it

480
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,032
Crazy weirdos as sharp as a wrecking ball

481
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,080
I don't know

482
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,872
There's a couple of other instance

483
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,664
Taking credit for starting

484
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,552
I'm not positive I'm going to give him credit for any of them

485
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:40,768
Ball type language highly stressful situation

486
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,304
Ricky's Michael Cohen

487
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,680
Subconscious pulls up

488
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:54,080
You've already heard Miley Cyrus

489
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,360
Borderline

490
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,176
Back to the Future Marty McFly playing

491
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
Rock and roll

492
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Music

493
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
Like that kind of

494
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
That kind of

495
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
Bananas

496
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,000
So this episode

497
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
Is largely

498
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
Contingent

499
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Jim Bakker

500
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
Having

501
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,472
And about how Trump

502
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
What is here because

503
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
The divine inspiration

504
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,872
Thanks to the actions of the church

505
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,152
Have brought Trump

506
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
Into office

507
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
To save the church

508
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
From the scourges of

509
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,296
PC culture at the Socialist

510
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
All the other

511
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,160
Koenigsegg

512
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,488
Absolutely

513
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
So

514
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,584
That be really what this whole interview is about

515
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,656
It's really weird to hear him say this about

516
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,960
The Democratic Party

517
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,520
Has been taken over

518
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,080
It's not the Democratic Party

519
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,152
Your mom is death like my mom could be

520
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
A Kennedy.

521
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,016
Mcrat a Reagan Republican

522
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,648
Right

523
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
The left

524
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
Has a movement within it

525
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,096
To seize power switch

526
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376
New element

527
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
That is

528
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,472
Taking over the party and pulling

529
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,824
That's for the socialism comes from switch you got is there from

530
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
They're saying

531
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,224
The normal Democrat

532
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,016
In their own parties taking over

533
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,064
But he's not going to be able to

534
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,368
He probably won't he probably won't

535
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,256
Insane for them to be doing this weird via Craddock propagate nonsense

536
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:54,656
Like God brought us Trump that show and then be like

537
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
Their party

538
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
It's been pulled

539
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,336
Extreme

540
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,944
He didn't realize what he was explaining

541
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,296
Realized

542
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
Democrat

543
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
And a Reagan Republican

544
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,976
Bike race

545
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,256
I think you might have

546
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
Been aware of that on

547
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Subconscious

548
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,584
Perhaps

549
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
It's it's

550
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,888
Definitely

551
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,960
It's just because the left has gone too far it's not that

552
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:33,568
Democrat may have changed after the Civil Rights Movement

553
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:38,688
And the Republican Party may have gotten more extreme when we elected a black president

554
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,480
For everybody

555
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
Drip too hard right

556
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
It definitely has nothing to do with race

557
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
Doesn't feel like

558
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,208
Because actually what's going on is

559
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:54,048
Is the Justice Democrats have come around

560
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
So the justice

561
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
Democrats

562
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,144
What they're doing

563
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
Is being sneaky

564
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:05,824
Alright alright alright alright

565
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,152
No justice Democrats of that organization that I Grande.

566
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:13,760
Okay

567
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
Jesus

568
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,856
I've read some interviews with

569
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
People who are involved

570
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,976
Like getting it going at their whole idea was to create

571
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,280
Centralized fundraising

572
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Type of thing

573
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:31,680
So they could run wouldn't have to worry about going out and doing fundraising

574
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,752
Taking care of a lot of that so the politician

575
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Good Apollo

576
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,080
Because you can't have publicly-funded election

577
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
They were trying to do this

578
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
Maybe that's

579
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,296
Woefully idealistic of Us 2

580
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:53,696
Any human could actually follow through with that well

581
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Planet Fitness

582
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
That's just another strategy

583
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
It's totally legal

584
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,168
These folks around the Jim Bakker Show

585
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,472
They got other ideas about what they're up to

586
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,568
Earlier about

587
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
American Idol

588
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,664
Election for President

589
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Another word

590
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
You could also

591
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,040
For congressperson

592
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
I don't

593
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Because

594
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,816
Pretty much

595
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,864
Congresswoman congressman

596
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,192
And if you were out to go get a movie role

597
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:42,592
So there's a new job

598
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:47,200
So as long as you're an activist in your community

599
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
Is you if you have the charm

600
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,344
You're the candidate they're going to be behind

601
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,232
Social media

602
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,560
To get to your grandkids get some people

603
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
It's a new America

604
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
It's a new America

605
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
Irene

606
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,448
Don't think

607
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,496
Thinks that he said something

608
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
I didn't say anything bad

609
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,408
No cuz all he's describing is like all right there's an organization that helps

610
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,688
Support activist

611
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,248
Who are charismatic ineluctable get elected

612
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,576
Isn't that pretty

613
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
That's what it is

614
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
Yeah

615
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
How is this different

616
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
Like

617
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:35,328
Corporation

618
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,240
These are these are

619
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,776
Middle

620
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
Center-right or

621
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Center-left

622
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
Candidates

623
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,360
I just want everybody

624
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
Come to the middle and I'm

625
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
I'm sure that giant Corporation

626
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
Really are pushing

627
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Center

628
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,808
Centrist

629
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,624
Democrats of is it not

630
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:05,280
Weird

631
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:17,056
The third-party has a farm

632
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
Weird

633
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,992
People

634
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
Next

635
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
The narrative

636
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,648
I think there's some pretty races

637
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:37,024
Framing going on here

638
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,584
Your your top 3 most

639
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
Controversial

640
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
Freshman Concord

641
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,728
Women all coming through

642
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
Come on

643
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
To get some

644
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
The demography

645
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,712
So this is how

646
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,272
This is how fast

647
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,880
Real quick easy

648
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,464
Three non-whites congresswomen are from Central

649
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
Demographic

650
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,328
Write the only reason

651
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
Possibly be elected

652
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,632
It is because they are now

653
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,424
And Justice Democrats

654
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
You can literally

655
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,360
Breitbart

656
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
Which means this

657
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Acting

658
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,480
Your Hollywood entertainment

659
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,760
Your

660
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,320
Academia your media it's

661
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,112
Stage

662
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,160
Search for what people want

663
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,976
Then you have to go find the empty suit

664
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:43,584
That you could fill with a candidate who will do what you want them to match

665
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,376
What the market wants

666
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
The media

667
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
Outlets

668
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
With

669
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
This strategy

670
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
So is to create

671
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
Innocent

672
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,944
You don't think there's other Congress people with more experience and more intelligent things to say that

673
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,088
It's really weird that intelligent

674
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
Experience are so important

675
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
To him when he thinks

676
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
From God

677
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536
Bugatti

678
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Really

679
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Clear

680
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,888
What

681
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,984
This is the narrative

682
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
People that like

683
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
They're empty suits

684
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
Every f******

685
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
Congressperson

686
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,640
Is a

687
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,528
It's like it's all Alexandria ocasio-cortez

688
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:41,184
Revising s*** over and over and over again

689
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:48,352
Solitary

690
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
The present

691
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
I think it's still there.

692
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
I8

693
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
Just dumb

694
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
Something up with that

695
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,296
How dare you you idiot the whole f******

696
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,344
Is there a representative

697
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
Represent

698
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,488
A larger group of people right

699
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,280
Well now

700
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,704
That's a fair point

701
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,752
You get to off the hook for all that like

702
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,848
Yeah okay if this person was so terrible that people would vote them out by

703
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,152
No it's impossible

704
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,968
Because all elections are rigged 3 million illegal immigrants

705
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
And then words

706
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
Nowhere to go

707
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,600
AOC

708
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:46,464
Tlaib Omar

709
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,536
But

710
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
Gio's

711
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:55,936
The stupid the mediator stalks them cuz they report after casting

712
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Now Trump

713
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
Bike

714
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
Contract

715
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Virginia

716
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,408
Either Communications genius really want to hear the Jessie

717
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
Certification for this

718
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,248
It's going to be disappointed

719
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,832
That's the amazing thing

720
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Canby

721
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Reelect

722
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
In spite of the fact

723
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,792
That all the Machinery is being worked against

724
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,096
Absolutely

725
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,888
The social media purging that's happened

726
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,448
But he's a smart man

727
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,728
So what is she been doing

728
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,800
What is Brad Parts Galpin

729
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:36,128
They've been collecting the data of everyone they wanted

730
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
Talk to

731
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
So that

732
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,736
Regardless of what social media gets shut down

733
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,832
They're prepared to talk to their 50 60 70 million people

734
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:45,856
Directly

735
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
The presidents got

736
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
Plans to stay in communication

737
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
He's really

738
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
Communication

739
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,304
He's a genius because he has 89

740
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:01,728
Innovative

741
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,032
Trump brings you

742
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,104
An email list

743
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,408
Shity bar comedy show

744
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,688
Strives to create

745
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,856
But you've been involved with them that's I don't use email

746
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,744
He's a genius

747
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,792
Elementary

748
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,352
Rules of the internet

749
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
Social media

750
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
You get an email

751
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,728
That's the whole trip

752
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
I

753
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,056
Really

754
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,592
Alex has been kicked off MailChimp

755
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:43,200
Those companies can still give you the boot

756
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,760
Single people send out an email every day they'll just

757
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,856
Beautiful tree

758
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:53,952
So

759
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
To my grandma

760
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,792
This next Club involves

761
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
His name

762
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
So much that I don't remember his

763
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
I can't wait

764
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:08,544
The argument

765
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
The church

766
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
Trump elected

767
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:17,760
Ankle support

768
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,808
It's it's

769
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
You know

770
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,392
The constituent parts

771
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,208
They were the one

772
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,304
Which is kind of part of

773
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,840
The mythology that keep

774
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
People on board

775
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,912
Businesslike while we were the one

776
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
Who made

777
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
This happened

778
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,128
Got a fallacy like we we did all this we can't give up now

779
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Then

780
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,944
After he makes that argue

781
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
He said he explained

782
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
Like

783
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,880
It knocked me out of my

784
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,208
Okay

785
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,512
The church doesn't understand

786
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,792
What's

787
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,328
We were the decisive

788
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,096
Factor

789
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,400
Got Donald Trump in

790
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
Donald Trump has been

791
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,472
Greatest gift we have had

792
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
In terms of

793
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
A resistor

794
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Against

795
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,568
The devil

796
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,848
And a promoter

797
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,176
Of a world economic prosperity

798
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:23,296
Hold on. Hold on.

799
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:29,696
Hey buddy

800
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:38,656
Is it the old one

801
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:42,752
What song is this

802
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,336
What are we what are we doing

803
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
What are you doing here

804
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,176
For somebody who's existing in this space

805
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,224
I cannot believe he would die

806
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,856
Great because he's establishing a world order of prospect

807
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
He's doing it

808
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:05,280
About George h.w. Bush about

809
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,632
For 30 years

810
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,752
Nudestix

811
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,568
It's so unfair

812
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
Yeah

813
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
It is

814
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
Wall now

815
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,576
Paul Wall now

816
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,280
It's Lance

817
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
Discusses

818
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,912
The Trump had disturbing

819
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
But

820
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,704
He

821
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
Baker

822
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,776
And Lori Bakker

823
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,056
I think it's hilarious

824
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,616
And so every please

825
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
But what time you having a Freudian slip

826
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,479
He said I want to make my company

827
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:03,135
I don't think my country but her

828
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,183
Business

829
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,487
It's not funny

830
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,023
Because

831
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,303
CEOs on

832
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
CEOs are in

833
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,447
The mentality should be very different

834
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,983
So the Freudian

835
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,031
Slip of this is my company

836
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,079
I think it's even f***** up

837
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,383
To look at running the country like a busy

838
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,735
Is unhealthy

839
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
Unproductive to

840
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,087
Public Works

841
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,879
Yes that's what it is

842
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,415
My company

843
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,439
Holy

844
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,487
Here's the here's the worst part

845
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,815
Understands what Freudian slip

846
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
Right

847
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,399
He said

848
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,471
Slip of the tongue would be fine

849
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,823
Instead he said Freudian slip

850
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,615
Which means that he believes

851
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,663
Trump literally meant

852
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
Tuesday

853
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
6

854
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,527
That he's running his company

855
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,159
His company

856
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,999
I guess that means we could be fired

857
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,047
Well

858
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,071
Very literal

859
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
Yeah

860
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,191
So earlier

861
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
Continue

862
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,127
Lance is making the argument that Trump is a gift from God he is divine intervention

863
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,687
And I haven't really learned that yet

864
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,783
We've had a face

865
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
Christian cult

866
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,343
That has been prophesied

867
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,623
Nnc

868
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
Provide

869
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,839
I've been feeling a burden of Prayer

870
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
Fasting

871
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,447
A divine

872
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
The form of a wrecking ball

873
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,263
That would be Donald Trump

874
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,055
For the sake of God's people

875
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
So get that get that cash

876
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,175
Came in like a wrecking ball

877
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,759
Divine intervention for church

878
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,039
So

879
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,575
You know that's one catchphrase

880
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
Sell his products

881
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,743
And we find out another catchphrase

882
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,815
We definitely heard Alex uses a lot

883
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,911
No it's not that one

884
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:26,239
Atlanta claiming to come up with as well

885
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,823
And then this really becomes your prophetic intercessory prayer guide

886
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
Because

887
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,687
Regarding Trump

888
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
Regarding who it would be what he would do

889
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,039
When I'm down

890
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:44,671
Bring up the fact that the media would enter a. Called Trump derangement

891
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,207
I was the one

892
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:50,047
Point Reyes

893
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,055
The right-wing media

894
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,615
Actually invented lockherup

895
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:09,247
But I really regret that I really like my operator equipment

896
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,319
But it was just for Roseanne

897
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,159
This this is one of the many

898
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,951
We have with Alex

899
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,279
You have

900
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,303
Trumpets

901
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
Divine

902
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
Trump

903
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:27,935
Prince Andrew

904
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,287
Cool with daneshjoo

905
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
D'Souza

906
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Get er done

907
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Haha

908
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,919
More of that before

909
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
He's got a cell

910
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
The prayer guide

911
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,319
Right that's part of the package

912
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
Prayer guide

913
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,207
90 minute lecture on DVD

914
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,487
Gold coin

915
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,071
Now we're going to learn a little bit more

916
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
Doughboy

917
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,239
It starts

918
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,567
I didn't say that I said it starts back

919
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
Now

920
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,431
24-karat gold-plated

921
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,967
Is

922
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,551
Set me a silver coin

923
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:20,159
Silver

924
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:24,767
And we put the 24 karat gold

925
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
Trump Cyrus image and

926
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,375
Isaiah 45 in the back the reason I wanted to do this

927
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
Is because

928
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,447
I was saying we have to have a

929
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
Prayer call

930
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,775
Which one

931
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
End

932
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,151
And what we need is a point of contact to be praying

933
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,455
That the spirit of God will continue

934
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
To put

935
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
Donald Trump in a position

936
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
Where they

937
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,855
Wrecking ball is going to exposed

938
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,671
Structure of the institution

939
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,207
Corrupt

940
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,535
And that every weapon

941
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,583
Boomerang

942
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
Edxposed

943
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,447
So there's a couple things that are real sucked out there

944
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:10,847
I mean

945
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:15,455
A laughing about that story

946
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,503
I just feel like

947
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:24,415
There's a there's a

948
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,231
Advantage story of

949
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,791
The Bible is

950
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:38,495
By Bartholomew Kayla brought him a silver coin

951
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,775
That was a really interesting

952
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,055
Things are weird story

953
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,359
Man I wanted I want to know

954
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,431
Because Jim Baker's laugh right

955
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,623
Audience

956
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:01,279
Spitting in their face and you'll still love me

957
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,351
I'm telling you that God has brought about this

958
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
President

959
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:10,239
Who demands gold

960
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,031
It's insane

961
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,175
It's really it's like Testament

962
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:18,943
2 house

963
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,759
Get people on board with x

964
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,343
Scream work you can make that framework you can mold it however you want

965
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,903
People on board

966
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,439
Ostensibly for

967
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,999
These like a Christian principle you can

968
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,303
Go whenever you want

969
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
Yep

970
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,631
It's not that people are not going to hold

971
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,911
Your feet to the fire

972
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
Astonish

973
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,727
It is absolutely

974
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:43,775
How they have

975
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,127
Same thing with

976
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:08,607
In the past he got everyone on board of his aunt's herne Anti New World Order I can specifically

977
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,335
You want

978
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,383
Because what's behind it isn't

979
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,151
What is a

980
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:25,247
In front isn't what you're actually operating

981
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,551
Jim Bakker wants your Goddamn money

982
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,879
You found religion

983
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,927
Is a really good way to get people's money

984
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,975
He's not allowed at now Trump is

985
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,559
Working real well for him and turned the grift

986
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,863
Something about Trump

987
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,703
Directly contradicts something about religion

988
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:47,263
You're going to be able to make it work

989
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Got it because he

990
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,359
You don't have to worry about what God ever

991
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,175
The Bible yes is 100%

992
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,807
But Trump is a nude

993
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,367
No big deal and then

994
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,415
You have Alex

995
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Who like

996
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,791
It was white

997
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,839
That was behind everything

998
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,375
Icky packaged it

999
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,655
In such a way

1000
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,727
Very attractive

1001
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,287
KSI New World Order

1002
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,871
You know someone comes around

1003
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Even pulse

1004
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,063
Joke

1005
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,903
Every single one of the people in the audience

1006
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
Just kidding.

1007
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
Every single

1008
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,767
Fwiw they all look like

1009
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,535
Retirees

1010
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:45,631
They're all pretty old

1011
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,423
Slow Hands

1012
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:50,495
I feel bad I don't make fun of the elderly

1013
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,311
It made me feel even more sad

1014
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,127
Pennywise tricking old people

1015
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,943
If you want to know why

1016
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
Is Lance

1017
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,015
Just listen to it

1018
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,463
This is a religious show

1019
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,767
This is a

1020
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,327
Jim Baker's Evangelical hour

1021
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,119
Commercial

1022
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,679
I mean it is.

1023
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
You know it's

1024
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,007
Supposed to be a show about Christianity

1025
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
Right religiously

1026
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,103
Focused all of this is

1027
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,223
Quote scripture

1028
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,551
There is a scripture on the back

1029
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,319
Bitcoin

1030
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:42,463
Help you connect with other people praying at the same time as you

1031
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
Fair enough

1032
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:49,375
So what about politics

1033
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,959
It's important to also take other context clues from pigs

1034
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,007
See if you should listen to him

1035
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
This one

1036
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:59,359
Strikes me is like

1037
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:04,479
I really didn't have a civics

1038
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,759
Less than in my head

1039
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,295
Know the difference

1040
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,087
Between the day out

1041
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:18,815
I thought in education

1042
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,375
Nope I'll watch Christian television

1043
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
Then I realized

1044
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,471
Inch of ground that we have an occupied

1045
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,775
Is being occupied and weaponized

1046
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,591
So what he's saying

1047
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:34,687
Is that I didn't know anything

1048
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,015
And then all of this propaganda that is

1049
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,063
So anti deep state

1050
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,135
Type stuff came around and I learned so much

1051
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:51,583
Strongly argue that you still do not know anything about that

1052
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,887
Number of

1053
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:54,911
It's the

1054
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,703
The exact

1055
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,055
Play doubt by

1056
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
Conservative right-wing

1057
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:05,151
They are so

1058
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,687
Effective

1059
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,711
As

1060
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,503
They are only effective

1061
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,063
In terms of attack and being under threat

1062
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,367
So as long as an office

1063
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,391
Or there is

1064
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,975
The presumption of democratic control of Congress

1065
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,511
Or the presidency

1066
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
Then they can

1067
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,327
They can make all the money they want

1068
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,911
Congress and the presidency is in the hands

1069
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,679
Republican

1070
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,495
They cannot function anymore and therefore has to

1071
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Create

1072
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,543
Entirely new

1073
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,079
Bigger bad guy

1074
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,359
Exact same problem

1075
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,919
Gyros

1076
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:42,527
Like you got Sylar and he's like completely overpowered what are you going to do

1077
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,415
How to create some sort of other Chick Bad Guy seriously

1078
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,487
Has been there all along know about

1079
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,767
It's complete b*******

1080
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,815
This is the strategy that the right with median

1081
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,839
Needs to use

1082
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,863
This is what

1083
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,703
Now I have a second layer

1084
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,495
Bulshit

1085
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,031
Like

1086
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,847
He is one of the board members of the oak Institute

1087
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:12,223
I do not believe that before Trump got in he didn't have any understanding of some

1088
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,039
No kind of Civic

1089
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,927
He's trying to pretend that he hasn't been involved in like this

1090
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,999
Agitating islamophobic anti-lgbt

1091
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,535
You world

1092
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,583
Previously to Donald Trump

1093
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,399
This is this is what he's about

1094
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,959
Just presenting it this way

1095
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:38,847
Probably because he knows a lot of other people didn't know s*** about Civic

1096
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:43,967
Fix before he's validating strategy

1097
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:50,879
Just like you idiots out there

1098
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,159
It's a manipulative strategy

1099
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,439
At best

1100
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,023
It's evidence you shouldn't listen to him because he's just been

1101
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,071
Suckling off the tee

1102
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,119
Of right-wing propaganda

1103
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
Let's learn

1104
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,191
Either way

1105
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,727
Get the f*** out

1106
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
You suck

1107
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,543
Absolutely

1108
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,407
It is next week we get a little bit of an indication

1109
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,199
A similarity without

1110
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:19,295
Just basically repeating one of Alex's big narrative

1111
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
On the debate

1112
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,135
We are we are literally

1113
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:23,903
1

1114
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,927
Market adjust

1115
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,719
Without Trump in office

1116
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,279
Of a collapse of our entire economic sis

1117
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:33,631
So we had a financier protecting us

1118
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,679
Everything would fall apart

1119
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
The globalist

1120
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,031
Stop

1121
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
Boy

1122
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,919
Really really really want to know what Bible

1123
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:51,295
Market adjustment is what you're talk about in what year

1124
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:53,087
Calling us

1125
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:53,855
Church

1126
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,671
Yeah unreal

1127
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:03,071
401k

1128
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,863
And make sure that you start

1129
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,007
What the f***

1130
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,287
Are you guys doing

1131
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,311
It's pretty strange

1132
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,591
It's almost like

1133
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:21,247
You know if Jesus were around he would slip over Jim Baker's desk

1134
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
Smitten

1135
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,295
These dudes be

1136
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:31,999
Obviously apocalyptic

1137
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,559
Feelings on the rise of corn

1138
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,607
Or whatever

1139
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,423
Yes but the Antichrist is coming

1140
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,959
And also that means

1141
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,495
There's got to be a false prophet

1142
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,287
Right I mean they work together

1143
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,407
Has done some thinking about it

1144
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,687
It's

1145
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,967
Seems like

1146
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:55,295
Well I'll let him explain it may not be a person

1147
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,343
1 broadcast

1148
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,159
Price.

1149
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:00,927
Is in the Earth

1150
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,695
And we could see that

1151
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:05,535
Yes yes to work with the false prophet

1152
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,327
I no longer

1153
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,119
The false prophet

1154
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,191
Is originating as a purse

1155
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,727
Heading up a religion

1156
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,287
I think the false prophets already there

1157
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:19,359
I think the false prophet is a world ruler

1158
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:22,175
Just like if you see perversion it's a

1159
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,991
World ruler it's the same spirit

1160
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:29,087
In Thailand and Bangkok in the sex slave industry as it isn't what

1161
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,879
A world ruler

1162
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,415
What's the spirit called

1163
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,183
The false prophet

1164
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,487
Operating through false media

1165
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
Wow

1166
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,071
The false prophet

1167
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,863
It's in the media

1168
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:45,727
Preparing the way for the Antichrist Spirit which is a

1169
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,495
Killer

1170
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,543
Counterfeit angel of Light

1171
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,823
That's going to deliver

1172
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
What sounds a lot like

1173
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Wow

1174
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:58,783
The media is the false prophet is bananas

1175
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,575
Grayson Harold

1176
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,647
The coming of the Antichrist

1177
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,927
Video to the Antichrist

1178
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:11,327
Fat

1179
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:17,727
Misrepresenting everything unreal destruction

1180
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:22,591
They always live in like a Harry Potter like

1181
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,919
Everything is interpreted and it turns out to be like

1182
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:30,271
What we missed was when they said false prophet we thought he meant one per

1183
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,671
The spirit

1184
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:41,279
Warmed-up Protocols of the elders

1185
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,559
Bionicle

1186
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:43,839
828

1187
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,631
Logically

1188
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
It's fall

1189
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:54,079
They're coming to be a false prophet and he's going to convince

1190
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,103
Like

1191
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,639
Right

1198
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,511
For Trump

1199
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,815
To be the false prophet in there

1200
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,095
Worldview

1201
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,655
Because none of the one

1202
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,679
Isn't

1203
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:23,263
No no cuz there's a cool smart people

Can be everybody

1206
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,447
That's how you get out of this box

1207
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,751
So we've got

1208
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,543
Lancewallnau.com

1209
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,847
Overtly political

1210
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,895
Zoe knows nothing about civics

1211
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,783
This world order

1212
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,111
Is farming

1213
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:15,999
It is next clip we hear a couple of people

1214
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,303
This wall now he's into

1215
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,119
We just met with the President also

1216
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,911
And he's a Christian

1217
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,959
His is actually

1218
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,727
Wanting

1219
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,519
The great strength of God

1220
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:32,127
What's really funny here is a flash up the picture of the former

1221
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,015
Excellent

1222
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,295
The president of Brazil

1223
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
Is it Christian

1224
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,415
Who wants the strength and grace of God

1225
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:49,791
Four nations unprecedented Harvest and blessing coming

1226
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,607
So he's like he likes bolsonaro

1227
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,631
Cool

1228
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,935
Save-A-Lot

1229
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:58,751
F*****'-a Authority

1230
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:05,151
Yeah I'm surprised they didn't bring out too as well

1231
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
Criminals industry

1232
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,855
I don't think that would affect

1233
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,135
I don't think so

1234
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:17,951
Something to me

1235
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:19,999
Consist

1236
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
Cincy with witch

1237
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,815
You see these right-wing

1238
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,095
Weirdo figures

1239
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,679
You are super cool with bolsonaro

1240
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Insane

1241
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:33,311
Cyrus

1242
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
Cyrus l

1243
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,127
Matson's big thing

1244
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,943
Is gold coin has a picture of

1245
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
King Cyrus

1246
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,367
I had to describe it

1247
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,951
In this booklet

1248
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,231
He argues that

1249
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,279
70 years before

1250
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,559
Osiris

1251
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,351
Did what he did

1252
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,143
There is a prophecy

1253
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,959
Prophecy

1254
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,751
Then Cyrus came along

1255
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,543
Fulfill that prophecy

1256
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,639
Trump was elected 70 years after their Israel is created and so therefore

1257
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,687
Bada-bing bada-boom

1258
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:19,135
I wish I could explain it better but

1259
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,511
Whatever

1260
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:29,631
So bolsonaro and the current president of El Salvador

1261
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,423
AR

1262
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,471
First president

1263
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,031
There are sheep

1264
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,055
Goatman

1265
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,895
I remember this one

1266
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
This isn't good

1267
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,247
No this is this is pretty bad

1268
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,807
What what

1269
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,343
Is about to lay out for

1270
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:57,279
To do does he have to find a way to not care about most of the world

1271
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,583
Yes if you're going to support these

1272
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,631
Sort of authoritarian

1273
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,935
You have to you have to brush off

1274
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,983
A lot of the world

1275
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,799
Most especially the meek

1276
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:16,991
Got to watch out bolsonaro

1277
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,807
So here is Lance laying out

1278
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,855
His philosophy about sheep and goat Nation

1279
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,903
And who matters

1280
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:24,671
And who doesn't

1281
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,975
And ultimately comes down

1282
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,511
Two sheep and goat Nation

1283
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,607
Very powerful New Renaissance

1284
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,143
A nation-state

1285
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:38,495
Becoming Street Nations

1286
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,055
Yeah New Renaissance of Nations

1287
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,383
Okay yep careful

1288
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,663
A global

1289
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,687
In office

1290
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,479
The system is stable

1291
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,551
And these nations are starting to run

1292
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,575
A different

1293
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,599
The nation that

1294
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,391
As much as you've done to the least of these

1295
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,415
My brother

1296
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,951
Specification

1297
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,743
Most people think by brother

1298
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
That's the key word

1299
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,327
At least of these you done it to me

1300
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,631
Refers to

1301
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
The Jews who are his

1302
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,191
Who are his

1303
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:08,959
Is blood

1304
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,751
Inheritance

1305
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:15,615
When they knocked on the door when Jesus was teaching I said master your

1306
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:19,199
Your mother and your brothers are outside

1307
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
Who's my brother

1308
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,527
Stretching for the Santos disciples

1309
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,295
She says

1310
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,087
Behold my mother and my brethren

1311
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,111
Those

1312
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,391
Who hear the word of God

1313
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,975
Will not molest

1314
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,743
Persecute

1315
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,023
The right of Israel

1316
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,303
And Christians to exist

1317
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,839
Donations

1318
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,863
Shut you down

1319
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,911
And steal your property

1320
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
Wow

1321
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:46,847
I agree zit-like states that

1322
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,871
Suppress

1323
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
People's rights

1324
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,919
To exercise

1325
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:50,943
Their religion

1326
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,735
That's not good they shouldn't

1327
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:56,319
Human rights

1328
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,487
That their country

1329
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:07,583
Matter can kill them with no consequence

1330
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:13,727
The least of these

1331
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:18,847
That doesn't apply religious rights

1332
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
Jesus was

1333
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,663
All about making

1334
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,199
I'm sure people knew

1335
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,735
Who could be killed

1336
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,759
Whatever they wanted

1337
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:29,599
Jesus was like

1338
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,903
You guys are cool and then let's go

1339
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,463
I remember in the book of Bartholomew

1340
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:46,751
Some real f*****-up excuses for

1341
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,287
In order to explain

1342
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,079
All of the

1343
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,871
Myriad ways in which you

1344
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,431
Justify Your Ex

1345
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,479
Set

1346
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,527
Thing that you can turn what you do to the least

1347
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,111
Versus like

1348
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
And what

1349
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,159
He means by that

1350
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,719
Is you can bomb a run

1351
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:10,815
Aaron is less than the least efficient

1352
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:15,935
F*** off

1353
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:18,495

1354
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,287
For this year gold gold coin

1355
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
And the bundle

1356
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,103
And then we find

1357
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,967
Very strong feeling that

1358
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,295
World Order

1359
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:36,415
Nuts to babies that's it's so over

1360
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:40,255
Like I don't care if you were uses language

1361
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,559
Some context I don't really give a

1362
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:48,191
If it weren't for it being the central argument of anti-communist

1363
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,983
New World Order conspiracy theory

1364
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,775
Which this is an extension of

1365
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:55,359
All about my pay

1366
01:06:55,615 --> 01:07:00,479

Just discover the prophetic patterns

1377
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,207
In this

1378
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,231
Lisa Leslie

1379
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,023
So that the hidden

1380
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,303
Truth in the Bible

1381
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,607
The rice

1382
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,215
And the Cyrus and then what

1383
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,239
That's what

1384
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,031
What's coming next

1385
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,311
And that's what you're saying

1386
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:02,687
Telling him and there's a

1387
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:07,551
We want responsible without Nations the Devils playing for Nations to Jesus

1388
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,599
Was promised Nations for his

1389
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:16,255
No borders kind of theorist

1390
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,351
We also have

1391
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,167
3 for $100

1392
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,703
Aspirus

1393
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,263
Pandora

1394
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,055
Firetrap coins

1395
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
Jessica

1396
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:35,199
Have $100 that's amazing.

1397
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,087
And we also have the baker's dozen

1398
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,391
For I guess

1399
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:45,439
After just $450 to the

1400
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,975
Straight

1401
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,023
At the same thing. You're eating

1402
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,935
And at a DVD

1403
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,959
And the booklet

1404
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:00,031
Y'all love it love it love it and I suggest

1405
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
You

1406
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,079
Get the baker's dozen

1407
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:05,407
Simply because you're going to want to share this

1408
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:10,783
So many people

1409
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
What's the weather here

1410
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,855
Just maybe

1411
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,879
Blanket

1412
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:18,207
I think so too

1413
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,023
Can really and give them Clarity like

1414
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,631
Lance has really brought clarity

1415
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,655
Not good

1416
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,423
That is

1417
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,703
So Insidious

1418
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:30,751
Do exactly

1419
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,543
So we can get the Panthers

1420
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,311
We get there

1421
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:37,151
Congregation know I don't have much luck with a lot of Pastor

1422
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,431
I think

1423
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,199
Most

1424
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,759
I'd actually disagree with you 100

1425
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:48,159
I think there are a lot of congregation that wear their Kuechly aware of who Jim Bakker is

1426
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,255
Because this is not but you Baker is not indicative of

1427
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,279
By God

1428
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:55,583
Majority of Christian

1429
01:09:55,839 --> 01:10:00,447
Text unfair

1430
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,751
Let somebody think that we're trying

1431
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,031
To the pain

1432
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,615
Christianity as a whole

1433
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:10,687
That is

1434
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,967
Part of a strategy

1435
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:15,551
Angling for

1436
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,951
You like say I don't know maybe you have

1437
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:28,351
A grandchild

1438
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:34,751
Yeah get the baker's dozen you could send them this gold coin in booklet

1439
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,287
If you a gift of this

1440
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:40,639
It reminds me of a lot of gifts

1441
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,271
This is still fresh

1442
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:52,671
Grover Cleveland

1443
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:58,047
I can't remember if it was Christmas or my birthday

1444
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,583
That was a tour guide

1445
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:08,031
It legitimately was like I was scrolling through the pages room

1446
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:14,943
I was flipping through the pages at one of them was like people often ask are there actually going to be gold streets in heaven

1447
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,759
Absolutely

1448
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:21,087
Wife

1449
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,415
Twice this grifters the Tale As Old As Time

1450
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,311
I get shocked when I got that one

1451
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,615
And then work out a second time

1452
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,175
Trying out a baker's dozen

1453
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,759
It took me a long time to realize that like

1454
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,319
Possible they got these from their Church

1455
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:56,159
Local Christian bookstore

1456
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:59,999
Baker himself

1457
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,023
Orcon

1458
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,863
Well Christianity

1459
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,423
To me what that's always

1460
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:11,007
Church

1461
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,287
Any word from like

1462
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,823
3200

1463
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:17,663
That's always been what I thought of as a

1464
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,967
3200 isn't a church

1465
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,247
Right

1466
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,623
The reason that it's hard to

1467
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,391
Get that

1468
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671
Image

1469
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:31,999
Cuz the large

1470
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,047
AR

1471
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,911
Churches

1472
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:43,263
Franchise

1473
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,127
So big and very public

1474
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,943
You don't

1475
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:51,711
Good

1476
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:55,295
Because often they're not getting mixed up in

1477
01:12:55,551 --> 01:13:00,159
Stuff that the media needs to cover up things

1478
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,255
Is

1479
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,535
Jamaica statistic

1480
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,559
6 Bear Outfitters

1481
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,863
Way more than you would expect

1482
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,655
Supportive of Evangelical Christian

1483
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:15,775
Bike

1484
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,055
Who's calling themselves

1485
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:17,823
Avenger

1486
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:25,503
In my life I've had a lot of negative experience

1487
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:27,295
But I've also had positive

1488
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,087
It's not

1489
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:33,951
I don't know I'm trying to defend Christianity or anything

1490
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:34,975
Other than

1491
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,743
Just a like

1492
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,535
I think there's a lot of Grey

1493
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,119
Because a lot of this show

1494
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,959
I will never ever defend Christianity or appreciate

1495
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,495
I will always defend

1496
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,263
Churches

1497
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,567
To me the church

1498
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,847
You can pick a religion

1499
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,639
Whatever toss it in there but

1500
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,663
The church is what

1501
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,943
Is a whole difference

1502
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,735
Community

1503
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,759
That is very

1504
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,295
Each unit

1505
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,343
Whatever

1506
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Oh God I love

1507
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:06,975
This clip

1508
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,743
Is so dumb

1509
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:11,071
So you know how Paul Joseph Watson

1510
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:12,863
Embarrassing things

1511
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,567
More good and better accommodate makes people nervous as earlier

1512
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:25,407
This guy is killing it with Jim Bakker

1513
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,687
Murdering

1514
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
Spell just watch

1515
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,599
Just dumped on him for

1516
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,159
Conservatism is the new Counter Culture

1517
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,767
In this next clip takes that

1518
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,327
Ball and runs down court with it

1519
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,607
Tries to dunk

1520
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,631
Hits the rim

1521
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:52,799
Falls Lexie heart breaks his neck when he falls down to the ground

1522
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,175
What's good about this is the fact that

1523
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,455
Young people like to be

1524
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
Counter

1525
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,503
Culture

1526
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:05,599
And so now that the culture has become dominant away

1527
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,647
It's our turn to enjoy being radical

1528
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,719
Up until now we've been the polite people

1529
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,791
Now we have a whole new chapter

1530
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:17,631
And and college campuses are a perfect

1531
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,703
Incendiary environment

1532
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,727
Young Chris

1533
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,263
Start Gathering Together

1534
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,639
To be the radicals

1535
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:30,431
So it's actually a good sign

1536
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:40,671
Or totally out of time

1537
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:45,535
Steamrolls

1538
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,863
You're dumb ass questions quite reminiscent of Lake George

1539
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:51,167
Lincoln Rockwell strategy of antagonize

1540
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:51,935
Living on campuses

1541
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,215
Also

1542
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,007
This is what I really really need

1543
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,079
In the entire time

1544
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,871
That I have been aware of Christy

1545
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,919
Which is to say

1546
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,247
I was involved in an angelical Church

1547
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,015
When I was younger

1548
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:09,343
There is nothing there was a bigger part

1549
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
Of the like

1550
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:15,231
Keeping kids involved to argue that they were the radical

1551
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,303
Jesus Freak

1552
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:22,143
Intelius

1553
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,191
Do not think

1554
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,215
Okay also

1555
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:25,983
Awesome

1556
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,287
Every single time

1557
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,591
There has also been

1558
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,639
He's never

1559
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,479
Like a version of it that's going to be like you know what

1560
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,271
We should be

1561
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,599
Conservative the counterculture is

1562
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:43,903
Always going other directions

1563
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,439
Because

1564
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,743
Like even if

1565
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:50,303
The culture at Large

1566
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,351
Accept the premise that the culture at Large

1567
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:55,167
Is degenerate

1568
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,447
Call Kyle Fuller

1569
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,031
The counterculture to that

1570
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,567
Will not be

1571
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:07,199
Straight lace Christian

1572
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:13,599
Play more of that s*** or a refinement of absolute

1573
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:18,719
Like yet I guess you could argue in some ways like ethical non-monogamy

1574
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,767
Culture 2

1575
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:25,887
Promiscuity

1576
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,423
That is in opposition

1577
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,007
Into whatever the prevailing cultural tide was

1578
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,287
That is

1579
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,311
What

1580
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,127
The idea that anybody in their youth

1581
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,455
Large groups

1582
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,735
People in their youth

1583
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,527
Are going to be like

1584
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:46,623
Anti Conformity I'm going to appeal to a

1585
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,415
Ridiculously conformist

1586
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,439
World Co

1587
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,975
Not how that works

1588
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,743
It is

1589
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:54,047
It is the conundrum of the youth pastor

1590
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,583
The youth pastor

1591
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,351
Who is

1592
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,631
30 years old

1593
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,423
Is hanging out with a bunch of teenagers

1594
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,895
Those Bible verses

1595
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:09,919
But what if we

1596
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,967
Just saying some hip new Tunes

1597
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,247
By the beach

1598
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,087
Youth pastor insisted on

1599
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,647
Meet Virginia

1600
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:23,231
Don't understand exactly why

1601
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:26,559
The crazier ones are bananas

1602
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:28,095
Because it's now it's

1603
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,143
It's the next step of that

1604
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:32,447
The youth pastor who's 30 years old need

1605
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,215
He's got

1606
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:35,519
Tatted up beyond all recognition

1607
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,287
And he's like man

1608
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:49,087
All the tattoos

1609
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:52,927
Heroin pass

1610
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,975
You got a trump

1611
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,511
Cyrus tattoos

1612
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,327
Yeah I have to do is press it and then you can talk

1613
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,607
Everybody has a coin

1614
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:04,703
Also the other thing too is that like this idea of

1615
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,727
Sexy

1616
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:08,799
Christian Youth is going around on campuses and being a

1617
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:09,823
Incendiary

1618
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,103
That's not new

1619
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,127
Like I was

1620
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,175
It's cool

1621
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,199
In college

1622
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,991
Early 2000

1623
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,343
Of my goddamn college experience

1624
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,903
It's good you could get away from it was brother Jed

1625
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,975
The Evangelist people on campus all the time

1626
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,511
He would make the rounds

1627
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,815
Tons of colleges around the Midwest

1628
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:33,887
He wasn't the only one there were a bunch of these

1629
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,703
I've heard from the show one time

1630
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,983
I got a bunch of emails

1631
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:42,591
Also knew brother Jed and didn't go to Mizzou

1632
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:45,919
Or they had their own version

1633
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,687
Very

1634
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:51,551
Consistent strategy for a long time this isn't anything new

1635
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,343
You're trying to

1636
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,671
Trick kids into doing it instead of an old

1637
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,695
But

1638
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:00,767
Not new

1639
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,791
I remember

1640
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,351
Just come around

1641
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,631
Grab

1642
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
People who

1643
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:07,935
Basalt heads

1644
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,239
Drifted from the faith or whatever

1645
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:11,775
Let's go have a cup

1646
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,311
Yeah

1647
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,336
Go get a cup of coffee

1648
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:20,480
That's whole thing over and over and over to his house for a dinner

1649
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,296
At least my guy wasn't that great

1650
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,600
Maybe he knew we need to go to a neutral

1651
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,648
A buddy of mine was almost there

1652
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:33,024
What's up

1653
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:37,120
I don't think you did I think I talked him out of it cuz I recalled but

1654
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,192
Resist the siren

1655
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,008
Clip here

1656
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:47,616
Idea

1657
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,920
Earlier

1658
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,200
I said

1659
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,992
Alex

1660
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:55,808
Oh

1661
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:58,368
Do sheep Nations that are rising up

1662
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,672
The leaders are less about party

1663
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,952
And they're more about

1664
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,720
The people

1665
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,744
And bringing in

1666
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,560
The prosperity in the principal's that'll make a nation great

1667
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:08,608
This is a popular smooth

1668
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,424
The enemy hates that the globalist

1669
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:15,008
First of the populace is what you're starting to see now globalist

1670
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,544
Want to control by the way

1671
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,104
If it's socialism happen

1672
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:23,200
It doesn't necessarily go bad for those people that are the elites

1673
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,224
Because

1674
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,576
The government will tell you what you doing what you don't do

1675
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:31,648
And these Diesel eats already have influence over the governor

1676
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,952
The globalist elite

1677
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,488
Goddamn

1678
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:44,192
Michelle

1679
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:50,592
Because yeah he's going to create this nationalist hellscape dystopia but I'm going to be fine cuz I already haven't

1680
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:53,152
Over him

1681
01:21:56,992 --> 01:22:01,344
All they really want like all these people really want is to continue their Griff

1682
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,928
And people having more

1683
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,720
Let's say let's cleaning

1684
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:09,024
Policies and regulations coming

1685
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,304
Into favor

1686
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,096
Jeopardizes double their Griff

1687
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,936
I would assume that they are very aware that they want to keep

1688
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,520
From any possibility of that ever coming to pass

1689
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:22,592
Especially on this show

1690
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,616
They want to talk

1691
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,432
Laws in place that you can

1692
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:31,296
Discriminate against people based on

1693
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,344
They want they want to

1694
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,368
To be able to

1695
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,672
Just seeing if I want to

1696
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,208
If I want to do politics

1697
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:44,608
The pulpit I'm going to f****** do it if I want to try and create a political machine small town

1698
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
I still want to have

1699
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,400
Ataxia

1700
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,336
Re-up they want to protect

1701
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,872
The scam and they want

1702
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,640
To move things

1703
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,920
Closer to

1704
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:59,456
Authoritarian

1705
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:01,248
In line with God

1706
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,904
And there's bruising

1707
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:13,280
Is it true

1708
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,888
Is aligned with the people

1709
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,424
They're not in a party

1710
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:22,496
All that

1711
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,032
They're putting up

1712
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:26,336
Is the same thing that they're doing with religion

1713
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:28,384
Yep to protect their scam

1714
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,664
They hide it with religion

1715
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,760
To hide their authoritarianism

1716
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,784
And fascism

1717
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,808
They hide behind

1718
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,344
The populism

1719
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,136
We're against the globalist

1720
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:41,184
Socialism will wreck everything

1721
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,464
Again

1722
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:48,864
Globalist even though we are going to bring out a new Global World world Arvin

1723
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:56,544
Functioning with global World borders

1724
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,872
We don't need borders in the global world

1725
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,552
It's like a lot of it

1726
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,320
Is all crib

1727
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,344
Sing from the same notes

1728
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,160
It's all so many parallels

1729
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:17,792
The guy who if you believed it had no idea about any civics

1730
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,840
Before Trump got elected then

1731
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,912
Took a steady diet of religious and right-wing

1732
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:26,240
Media and it's come to this conclusion that he's come

1733
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,288
To Andy's just regurgitate

1734
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,080
Same thing

1735
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,896
A religious

1736
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,200
Presentation

1737
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,992
Yeah I know it's goes to

1738
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,296
So I guess they're not really that different at all

1739
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:43,648
But they're doing different audience

1740
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,304
That's the thing about the right-wing media

1741
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,072
David sober

1742
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,376
That I think they stumbled onto probably by

1743
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,448
Best SEO

1744
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:58,496
Because they agree with each

1745
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,152
This is for retirees

1746
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,176
Trying to get

1747
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:06,944
Like

01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,272
Barbie not anymore that's early but there was

1749
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,808

Houston the market

1751
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,648

Libertarian

1754
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:25,120
It's all it it's all focused on whatever corner of the market you can do to penetrate it with

1755
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,888
This

1756
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,424
Exact same worldview

1757
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,240
Algorithm has killed us all

1758
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:33,568
Because you watch one of these videos from Jim Bakker in your life

1759
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,592
Haha

1760
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,896
Stupid I'm not a religious wacko

1761
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:37,920
But YouTube is like

1762
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:38,944
Well you

1763
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,248
