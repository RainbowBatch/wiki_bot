13
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
Is

14
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640

Time we

19
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,840
Master lights the light full time

20
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
I was at

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,704
Around the bartender asked me to leave

22
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
I guess I can't have that be my my bright spots

23
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:58,016
Got a message from one of our listeners a policy wonk out there

24
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,320
Who had the music

25
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976

00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560

Listen to the album here's to better misery

31
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,360
And I enjoyed it quite a bit

32
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,504
And I can say that sincerely and I think that's probably why it's a bright spot it's because I don't have to be

33
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
I don't have to

34
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808

I waited until you had your mouth so you couldn't respond

45
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
That was kind of cheating on my part

46
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,976
Today's episode of a recording us

47
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
One of the reasons why I wanted to do this episode for the Sundays I wanted to see you

48
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
C-pack is running

49

Of course you are

50
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,264

51
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
Such Heights

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,592
It was a big deal last year

53
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
So much

54
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,968
So much going on it was a celebrity field affair

55
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,856
Exactly

56
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,256
He missed his own speech at the end is supposed to be the headliner Nick Fuentes behind took over the show

57
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Fireworks

58
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
It was a Enrique tarrio made a joke about how there's probably enough be a conformist

59
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,752
Which is funny

60
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
They was

61
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Outrageous

62
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
It was such a good time

63
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
That Z-Pak event

64
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
There was so much going on

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,992
So much nonsense

66
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
And it's just

67
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
Such a sign

68
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
How sad

69
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,184
It's now like he's not even going

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
BC

71
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
Z-pack is Anya

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,536
He's just sitting in the studio

73
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,631
Having a show last year it was like it was

74
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,167
Is full-on the Gathering of

75
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
The Juggalos

76
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
Level but forget a white mask

77
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
Grateful to not have to have payday

78
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
A single Iota return

79
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,623
Attention to seapac

80
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
As some have

81
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Because I just do

82
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
Don't care

83
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
The value of this

84
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Episode

85
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Is that

86
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,775
Going on during Trump speech it's a program

87
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Which means that Alex

88
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Who plays the speech most

89
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Play 21st hours

90
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:09,759
And a little bit of commentary but there's still a couple of things that I find

91
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
Circularly important and one thing

92
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,367
They drove me a little bit

93
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Crazy

94
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927

98
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,423
Miscellaneous

00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447

This is going to be a little bit of a briefer episodes going to be a little bit shorter and one of the reasons

134
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
Like I said

135
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Right

136
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071

Condense things to

00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
Reflections

140
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
I know it's a big old

141
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:48,735
A little bit of running commentary of trump speech sure with a couple of

142
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
Completely absurd thing

143
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783

You know it starts pretty much

146
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
How you would expect it to

147
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,559
February 28th Sunday live transmission just started speaking

148
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,631
Florida

149
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,983
Control corporate press in big Tech are trying to censor and block

150
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,079
Everywhere where we hear from the real

151
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
President

Music clip of Biden

161
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
Saying some words that

162
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,935
It sounds like he is confused

163
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
That his

164
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
Brain is deteriorating right

165
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
This makes quite this kind of

166
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
Like indicative of how

167
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Good Lord

168
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Chunk of this

169
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
The show ghost

170
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,295
It's really just Alex getting excited

171
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
Well Trump gives a speech

172
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:04,255
We will be victorious

173
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,143
Herbalist

174
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
Alright

175
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
Alert

176
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Portion of the speech

177
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
That errors on Alex's

178
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,431
Is it version of trump speech

179
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,271
Is a lot of fear-mongering about

180
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,087
Sure why not what are we what are we doing

181
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,183
It's pretty heavily hitting that that tone

182
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,999
Yeah and I found it to be alarming

183
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
Upsetting

184
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
I was surprised by one

185
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
And that is

186
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
There's a little bit of time to

187
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
F*** around

188
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,239
Best beef stew

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,751

00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,591
Play Rush

197
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383

201
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Sebring Crossing his finger

202
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,439
He strangle of parole in front of everyone

203
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,767
To celebrate the little hamburgers

204
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
A while back

205
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
50 years ago right after the election

206
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
Okay

207
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
After Trump had lost

208
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
There he was going to

209
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Start his own party

210
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
People pretty excited about this because

211
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
There

212
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,391
Intercourse rightfully people on the left are like please do that

00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,695
Yeah yeah yeah absolutely

214
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,839
Google go white nationalist and equator

215
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,959
Unblock

216
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
It turns out this is fake news

217
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,079
Never going to do that

218
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
Cancel the Republic

219
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
Yeah basically announcer

220
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,271
We're not starting new party

221
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
We have to Republic

222
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,775
Craigslist

223
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
The fuk up

224
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,039
Mr McLoughlin just gave me numbers that nobody's ever heard of me

225
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,767
Just like you saw with green and Jordan other people

226
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
5.71 point

227
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
5.70 points

228
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,935
All the super hardcore Trump candidates

229
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
50/50 before

230
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
20 point

231
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
Marjorie Taylor Greene want her race

232
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
Essentially unopposed

233
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,271
The Democratic candidate had withdrawn from the race due to personal matters

234
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Why she won

235
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,647
Also a simple scan of the history of that District Georgia

236
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
Is 14th it disproves Metallica saying

237
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:51,327
In the 2018 election Republican Tom Braves won with 76.5% of the vote

238
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
Pro-slavery platform in 2016 2014 and 2010 Graves ran unopposed

239
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,055
In 2012 he won with 73% of the vote

240
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,151
According to the Cook partisan voter Index this is a republican Plus

241
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:09,503
27th District heavily Republican

242
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,599
That in addition to her opponent withdrawing his wife Marjorie Taylor Greene one

243
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,183
Not because pro-trump candidates are so exciting and then

244
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,487
Super-mega popular

245
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
How

246
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Dario

247
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
You don't care about voting

248
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
You think that the election was stolen

249
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
Election

250
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Well

251
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,543
Yeah because the election was stolen

252
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
B b like

253
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
If it happened

254
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
But still like they would want to like

255
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
80% of 90%

256
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,759
Popular people are

257
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
Well I guess I stand correct

258
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
You should know better

259
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
At this point I'm so Jordan

260
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
I

261
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
You know

262
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Super Bowl

263
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
I

264
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
I definitely got into Alex's

265
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
Commercial styling

266
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
It's a very weird a breed

267
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
It was

268
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
Super Bazaar

269
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
Now

270
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,431
This episode of listening to through the gcn

271
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,479
Genesis Communications network speed

272
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,527
Which is the company that does Alex

273
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Syndication

274
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,111
So all of the radio station

275
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
Forget this feed

276
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,463
Play Alex

277
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
The show

278
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,535
These are the commercials

279
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
That are put on

280
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Along with the back

281
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
These people who sponsor Genesis

282
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
Communications Network

283
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
And

284
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
I listen to one of these commercials

285
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
And it really really upset

286
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Oh no

287
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,895
Here is the thing that blew my mind and almost drove me crazy

288
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,479
The Final Phase of extermination

289
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,039
Is population

290
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,695
They cover for mass die-off is evolution and global warming

291
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,999
Used

292
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,839
From the lines that were disinherited 2,000 years ago

293
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
Go to nfl.com

294
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
That's unv

295
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Whoa

296
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,663
Wow

297
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
Wow

298
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
Do you have any idea

299
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
Wow

300
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
Did you make sense

301
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
His his at his voice

302
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,671
And the way he's delivering it and the kind of

303
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
Choppy nature of the end of the

304
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Since in the beginning

305
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,535
Give a new one makes it sound a little bit like

306
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,863
He's a synthetic robot voice or somebody

307
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Speaking like

308
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Somebody wearing a mask speaker

309
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,983
Vocalizer

310
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:43,103
My time of trying to get into voice-overs for commercials they like a lot of the time

311
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
If you're not a

312
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
Pretty good editor

313
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
It'll sound rough

314
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
Because you're trying to jam it into a very

315
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Specific

316
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,831
Span of time

317
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
Got to be 30 sec

318
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
It cannot be 28

319
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:00,767
Whenever you're not that good you'll end up sounding like that

320
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,583
And that's that's kind of important

321
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
You stood in the content

322
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
And how is that like

323
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Did you take away from

324
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
What ice

325
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
Thought I heard was that some people are claiming to be

326
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Christ

327
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:18,431
Are related to Christ may be alright because it is unveiling them

328
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,991
Them so there's a group of people

329
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Haha

330
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Who are doing that

331
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
Now what I don't

332
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Understand is

333
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
How the

334
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
Population die off

335
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,207
And the fake climate change and such

336
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,535
Ties into the people they're selling

337
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
That's a good question for it's nothing

338
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Alright

339
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,007
Commercial hit me a little weird

340
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
And honestly it's

341
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
Speak to the level of sponsors that Genesis

342
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,663
Communications network is able to attract

343
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
That's terrifying

344
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,343
I checked out this website and apparently the person behind it believes that the MMR vaccine is created Iron

345
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
Poisoning in the population

346
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:04,255
Which is the cause of all disease

347
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Now I should be

348
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,607
Be clear there's actually the iron poisoning goes much

349
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Deeper than this

350
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
It goes back

351
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:16,287
Quite a long ways and the MMR vaccine is really creating it as much as exacerbating it

352
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,359
It causing problems for people who are already iron poisoning

353
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,687
All right so even if you didn't get the MMR vaccine is what

354
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
You don't worry

355
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
Worried you're still f***** you're still iron poison apparently the Euphrates river is actually the Mississippi

356
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,463
In the real population of the United States

357
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
Just about 200 million

358
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
As it turns out only people with

359
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,655
A b blood type are safe from this iron poisoning

360
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:48,287
I have to admit this site's argument is a little bit difficult to follow

361
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
Kind of

362
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:55,711
Inevitably drifts into a little bit of British Israel ism

363
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
America's you're reading through

364
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Through this

365
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,623
There's one page on the site titled round them up

366
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:08,767
Which argues that everyone in any position of influence in the world is in on this plan to poison everyone with iron

367
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
I need they would have to

368
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
This includes

369
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,727
All of mainstream and alternative media which I think would include Infowars includes damn near everybody up

370
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,287
About these media entities there's a note

371
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
In bold letters

372
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,943
Quote commandeer these immediately there's a note

373
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,479
Wheatland on the website

374
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
Yes

375
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
Like it's something that's a

376
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,671
Like it's on the refrigerator if I commandeer those first

377
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,743
Like literally everyone is in on the plan

378
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,839
Including quote all nursing and assisted living homes all corporations

379
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Water treat

380
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Facilities

381
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,703
And food and beverage industry farms and ranches

382
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
What would I think

383
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
Is that kind of thing

384
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,103
I have to work but ignore that have

385
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Is

386
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
Iron poisoning the other half

387
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Well

388
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
Apparently

389
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,015
This breaks down

390
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,831
30 people who are a b blood type

391
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
They're not

392
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
Iron poison

393
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,719
Okay their blood type is not susceptible

394
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,279
To the iron poison

395
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,095
Yes

396
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,143
Something to do with a question

397
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,983
Quite able to figure this out but it's something to do with like a b blood

398
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Being

399
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,311
Found on the Shroud of Turin okay

400
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,615
Alright Jesus

401
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:34,015
I don't know

402
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,623
Not so they're not going to be hurt by things like the covid-19 vaccine

403
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,951
It'll take out all of the people who have iron poisoning

404
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,023
They are the vaccine will like

405
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,095
Exacerbate the parasites or whatever the inside

406
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
You do to iron poisoning

407
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,935
Can we do a follow-up on

408
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Like can they

409
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,799
Because we will know in the future whether or not her correct

410
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
So I would imagine that

411
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
Next year

412
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,663
Let's meet let's make a gentleman's wager

413
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Me

414
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,015
Into the British Israelites

415
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,343
I don't know if this is mainstream British as realist thought

416
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
As much as visit

417
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,951
A very weird geocities ass page

418
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,767
Starting a very convoluted

419
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,863
I think that's basically what's going on

420
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,423
There's these people who are a b blood type

421
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
And there

422
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
Poison they want to get the

423
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,567
Vaccine in people who have a or b

424
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
Cuz it'll kill all of them off chair

425
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,175
And in order to avoid this horrifying conclusion

426
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
The page literally says quote

427
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,759
Round up everyone of them

428
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
Account for all 40

429
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,831
13.3 million in the United

430
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
States place them in holding areas

431
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
For out-processing

432
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,279
Now I'm against a b blood type

433
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,375
They are those

434
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,519
I hate found this

435
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
Very

436
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,359
Confused that's a little that's a little

437
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
I don't think they're going to win in the end

438
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
I'll put it that way

439
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,599
On the one hand is a deeply pathetic state of affairs that Alex's radio syndication Woods

440
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,928
Website like this that doesn't actually appear to be selling everything

441
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
On the other hand it

442
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,256
It's deeply disturbing something for them

443
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
To be intentionally or a

444
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,328
Accidentally promoting to Their audience

445
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,704
This website is explicitly accusing people at everyone who has a b blood type of being part of the

446
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,496
Conspiracy to kill off the publican

447
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
Rounded up

448
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
Big people little irresponsible

449
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,664
Yeah I was curious about this a joke around a little bit more

450
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
Apparently this page

451
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,016
Has been up since 2003

452
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,320
And there are some snapshots of what

453
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,880
Used to promote on the Wayback machine

454
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,720
It turns out my feelings about this seeming a bit anti-semitic or act

455
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
From the page

456
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,304
As it existed in 2004

457
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
Quotes they are murderers and

458
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,424
Thieves and destroy the truth and destroy the Earth and Mankind

459
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,472
Now is the time to destroy these two

460
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Destroyers

461
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,056
They are the ones who claim to be Jews who are not

462
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
All right there we go

463
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,640
Alright

464
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
The board

465
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,736
This point does not appear to have any connection to the iron poisoning

466
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
Conspiracy but

467
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Instead

468
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,832
It's just classic anti-Semitic screeds

469
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,136
Basically the protocols of the Elders of Zion

470
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,976
Great white 2008 decided a turd added the iron poisoning

471
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,304
Clear the argument being laid out by this website

472
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Is that

473
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,424
Jewish people who aren't really Jewish are running around

474
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,240
And they're going to poison the world that iron in order

475
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
Vertical iwanoff down the road

476
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:41,920
All right so this a b blood type I think it is a way of talking

477
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:49,088
When Alex complains about how everyone thinks he's a Nazi it's important to remember that his radio buddy you know run

478
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
All of his

479
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,416
I'd like radio syndication affiliates

480
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
You know

481
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
He's he's responsible

482
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
Paralysis radio career

483
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,584
That guy is willing to accept advertising money

484
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,144
To promote a website but essentially Advocates rounding up

485
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,752
Jewish people I would really prefer and I'm going to go out on a limb here

486
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
And I think this

487
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
Look there's going to be an unpopular play

488
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
But I don't

489
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
Care what side of

490
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,408
The political aisle you're on

491
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,968
I think rounding people up is usually a bad

492
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:22,368
Yeah it just going to go out there I'm going to say that I know it's an unpopular thought then yeah it's

493
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
It's not a sign of a healthy

494
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Body politic

495
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,280
Let's think of all the historical examples of people being rounded up

496
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,584
All of them worked out well

497
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Nevermind

498
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
I found this

499
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,216
Bizarre

500
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Confusing

501
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,288
I would never have imagined

502
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
Isn't that something like this would be

503
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
Able to

504
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
Secure and advertising slot on Alec

505
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,992
I was going to say it must be really fun

506
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
F****** cheap

507
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,880
Dirt cheap for just a random ass website to be like Al by

508
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,488
Consider what is maybe this person is independently wealthy

509
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
So maybe

510
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,560
It's not that cheap and there's like f*** it

511
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,840
I can't get the word out about iron

512
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
Possible

513
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
Second possibility

514
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,680
Is it is that you

515
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
Just think about it like

516
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,568
There's no big businesses knocking down pad 200ml

517
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
On this s*** no one wants

518
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,712
Yes bottom-of-the-barrel stuff absolutely also see this as just us

519
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Favor

520
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:27,392
Almost all advertising on TC and just being dead being my man

521
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
Batman if that's a favor then

522
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,256
Opens up another can of worms and that is like

523
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
They know what's being

524
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,376
And they are willingly disseminating

525
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
Supporting this

526
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:42,240
I would have to I mean there's no way that somebody does

527
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Doesn't know what's B

528
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
You know what I would

529
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,616
I would believe a world exists

530
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Where no one knows what

531
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
Wait the check cleared

532
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
I don't give a

533
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,832
Exterminate that works for us

534
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
What's this iron poisoning

535
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
Okay

536
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,720
I'm not going to look into this for

537
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,072
Just a little while to find out that you are a deeply anti-Semitic

538
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,680
K clique

539
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Close enough

540
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:18,848
Getting ready to get on the network come on. Going to check in on what your

541
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,152
Pausing to the point where I run

542
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:25,248
Alternative media

543
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
Becoming beer demita

544
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
Where is that

545
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
I could do like the idea that

546
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,160
There is a 30-second spot

547
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
With the website

548
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
In it

549
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
And no one bothered

550
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
To look at the web

551
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,632
I'm not positive what I think is more upsetting

552
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,936
The idea that they didn't check

553
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,728
Is it someone checking it

554
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Spine

555
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,800
Neither either is pretty a pretty scary

556
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,592
Give me a VIP event like

557
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,920
Some of Alex's audience might go to that website be like oh my

558
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
My God

559
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
If Alex would promote this

560
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
You'd allow this on his show then there's got to be something

561
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
Time to it I think the only thing we can

562
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
Can do is

563
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,904
Get our own ad spot on gcn

564
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Wow

565
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
I think we

566
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,256
I think we should try it maybe we know

567
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
We could

568
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,584
Yeah we got to get another website

569
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:16,704
Oh yeah I know we can't be

570
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,032
That is good that we're planning is on there

571
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:31,552
Alright I'm going to I'm going to work on this I'm going to see if we can

572
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,880
The point is Bill never know when it's coming

573
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:39,744
We can announce it's going to happen and you maybe that's the real torture there they'll always

574
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Be wondering

575
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:45,888
When is it going to rain

576
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:51,264
Alright so we get back to Alex now

577
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
That is deeply upsetting

578
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,848
Little row. I went down

579
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:00,736
Also deeply upsetting Alex is really thrilled that no one is wearing masks

580
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,832
And she was almost done with wearing masks in the seat back event

581
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,024
These are good people

582
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
Elizabeth Smart

583
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
Slacking to look great

584
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Good night sight wow I would assume

585
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
Wow

586
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,216
Alex started the show talking about how Trump

587
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
Why is the rightful president

588
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
Upsetting

589
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,664
It's more upsetting when Trump himself

590
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,480
Says that on stage at sea bass

591
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:38,368
You're watching coverage of President Trump's ongoing live speech

592
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
About 20 minutes behind

593
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,792
We are going to the live show

594
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,240
I may even decide

595
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,288
To beat them for a third time

596
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,688
Okay

597
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,504
Hitches

598
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Yeah

599
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
That's what you need

600
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
That's alarming

601
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
Rainbow

602
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,416
Just can't we you can't keep doing this

603
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,464
No no no no

604
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
No

605
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
No

606
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
Refutes

607
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,096
Yeah you know what like

608
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
When 2000

609
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,424
The election in two

610
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,824
The Supreme Court awarded the presidency to Bush using all of the president that was available to

611
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,384
But the time which is not and then they were just like

612
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:37,760
I think little lot of people rightfully or inaccurately felt like that was a

613
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,784
Stolen election

614
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:44,416
I don't work all people insisting that Al Gore was the rightful president

615
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,000
And I don't recall Al Gore giving speeches

616
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:52,096
Where he said I'm actually the president instead he went

617
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Focused on

618
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Climate change

619
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,728
Yeah I don't focus on climate

620
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,592
Old Monroe.

621
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,920
Bungled go back inside of a very small hole and stay there

622
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,688
I just

623
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,480
Find this to be untenable

624
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,296
I can't I can't

625
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
Imagine

626
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,344
These kinds of rhetoric

627
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,136
These these kinds of things

628
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
But leading anywhere positive it's it's

629
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,536
It's going to get another storm another cannibal what does rape it happened on the 6th

630
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:26,912
And in response to that they changed none of their rhetoric so it will happen again

631
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
That's how

632
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,008
It does seem that way

633
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,544
So Alex

634
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,104
Steve's one of those influential voices

635
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,944
In the world

636
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,832
The true most influential voices in the world

637
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
And there might be surprised

638
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
Hula hula

639
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,280
The famous Alex Jones saying my son always says it was a joke

640
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,816
Podcast

641
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,936
Target

642
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
Snow

643
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,288
Authoritative

644
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
Influential

645
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
General Public

646
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,128
Thought leaders

647
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,408
Across the planet

648
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,456
You can probably imagine who listen to the show

649
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,040
One of them died just a week and a half ago

650
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
He listened everyday

651
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Real

652
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
So this is not about brackets but understanding

653
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,536
This broadcast is a Brain Trust

654
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:27,840
Catfish Hunter

655
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
And lied about

656
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,936
Demonize because we go to the source document

657
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,496
And you're over the Target store get the most

658
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,056
We got great products you already need

659
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
Straight

660
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,152
Yeah there's no way Rush Limbaugh listen to Alex everyday

661
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
I can't think

662
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,968
Give anything Rush Limbaugh did less

663
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,992
Then listen to Alec

664
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,528
Text jokes you do you know what's

665
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,320
I mean like he's on air

666
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
4 hours

667
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Himself

668
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,952
And then you imagine like oh yeah he's going to spend his off time listening to

669
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:58,048
Someone do a

670
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
Exactly

671
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:05,216
I find this to be so fascinating idea that Alex thinks that his audience

672
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,288
But he thinks that his audience will believe that

673
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,568
Like really

674
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,152
Serious people take him seriously

675
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,176
I can't imagine

676
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,968
Anybody who is like

677
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,296
Critical thinking they're engaged

678
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,368
Listening to showing up being like this is stupid

679
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,160
Insanely stupid

680
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
It is

681
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,976
Stupid on a level

682
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
Mobile vet like

683
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:32,096
Can truly comprehend understand being tricked by like a little

684
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,704
Clips or Snippets Ooltewah something into thinking that I want to show you something that it's not

685
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,496
It is dumb it is

686
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
Incredibly dumb

687
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,592
It's Meandering is often pointless

688
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,640
Eight so full of emotional outbursts

689
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,224
It's a Psycho Drama that he's having

690
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
He's engaging

691
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
The audience

692
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
Just bizarre

693
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
Well I mean we

694
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880

Trump saying nonce

703
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,912
No reasonable person would

704
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,192
Seriously at all

705
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,472
Everybody

Indeed

712
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
Sometimes he has to be dragged

713
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Screaming

714
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160

There was one making fun of that

737
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:45,216
What was that that guy who had his cat on Zoom

738
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752

Choosy moms

751
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,592
Choose anal probes covered in blood

752
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,384
This is

753
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,688
Wild I mean like I would have listened to his wife

754
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:33,088
Does sound like it's a little bit much I would have listened to her tennis partner

755
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
Text Beth

757
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,440
Alex plays this video of

758
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
Australian journalist

759
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,840
I feel like journalists might be a little bit

760
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
Generous

761
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
Editorial commentator type

762
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,960
He plays video of an Oscar

763
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:54,080
Yeah and this guy is giving a speech about globalism

764
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,152
TiVo

765
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,432
Fine whatever

766
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,760
I also thought maybe this was a little bit racist

767
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,320
He's talking about like how you got to be

768
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,904
Skeptical of any organization that has the word world in it

769
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,928
Like a world

770
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,208
World Health org

771
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,000
Organization world food

772
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,304
Sure and then he throws this in

773
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,936
Part of the United Nations

774
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,384
Until you remember that Barack Obama won in 2019

775
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,688
Having the right skin color

776
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
Wow

777
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:39,136
I think it's a problem that Alex can't seem to find any of anybody who breaks down

778
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,928
Complaints about globalism

779
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,792
Beer into that directions to Bentley boils down to somebody's going to say skin

780
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
Yeah

781
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
Yep

782
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,400
He understands

783
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,680
How

784
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,984
He got tossed Aurelia right

785
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:01,408
Mikey understands the routes that'll Colony think it was a was perhaps a word

786
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,200
Journey if you will

787
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
He understands.

788
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
Right

789
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,112
Concept that he gets I would assume so yeah

790
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
Because it seems like

791
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,952
He is absolutely

792
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,488
If he's making this argue

793
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,768
White

794
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
People should leave

795
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
Australia

796
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,352
You should go away

797
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,376
Well

798
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,168
Interesting

799
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,264
I just I I find it really interesting the way that

800
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,592
Like UK and I obviously I think it's

801
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
Partially because

802
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,664
These kinds of things are attractive Allison

803
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,040
But you can't like find somebody to talk about these issues

804
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,088
Always liked are the challenges of

805
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,136
Globalized connection

806
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:47,232
Living in a modern world

807
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
You can't find somebody to

808
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,792
Play the

809
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
It doesn't say

810
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
Obama wanted

811
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,120
Peace Prize cuz he has blacks

812
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,656
Skin like that

813
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
Bucked up

814
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,472
You can't find somebody that isn't

815
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Like

816
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
Subtly racist

817
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Subtly

818
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,872
And it's the same thing with like

819
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
Genesis Communications Network

820
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,784
Big advocate of cracked anyway to give ads except for

821
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,832
Sweetly nonsense

822
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,136
Nicole website I mean what

823
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
Wild about that is

824
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,208
Not since you know

825
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
Like there

826
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:22,816
Plenty of great reasons to say that Obama shouldn't have that Nobel f******

827
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
Peace Prize

828
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,424
There's a lot of critique

829
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,288
No sounds Yuki shouldn't have her Nobel Peace Prize either but here we are

830
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,080
Oh yeah and and the fact that

831
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,896
Like you have to distill it down to throw that kind of like

832
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,200
Do you know what the audience

833
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:44,064
Want poking at

834
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:50,208
Got it and they didn't know that he was going to drone bomb the f****** world

835
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:57,632
But the audience wouldn't find that funny you're satisfied

836
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,960
And they just don't like that you have the wrong skin color according to them

837
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,544
So what are the more delightful things that came out of

838
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
Of the sea pack

839
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,360
I think was the video

840
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:12,480
Of the people getting booed for trying to tell people to wear my hat

841
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,064
Did you see that no I didn't see I I want

842
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,368
No I wanted nothing to do with this year CB

843
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,160
A guy comes on stage

844
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
We're going to listen

845
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,744
He's going to give you like a little bit of a breakdown

846
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,376
Masks I know you don't want to wear them but

847
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
We believe in property rights

848
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,680
And

849
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,520
We are in someone else's Hotel they get to make the rules

850
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
Good angle

851
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:42,432
Good angle way to do it what is the f****** pull that one through

852
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:47,296
That's a good Landing understand you don't want to wear a mask

853
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:51,392
Conservative principles demand that we respect the property rights of the owners of this hotel

854
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:56,256
Twitter allowing us to hold this second dungeon here and I assume all the people with there were like

855
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,072
We don't have principles go

856
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
To a young woman

857
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
She says

858
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,032
You know I know you don't want to wear masks

859
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
But

860
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,592
Can you work on that

861
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,664
That's also Fair

862
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,992
It's like

863
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:21,344
The children

864
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,160
Somebody

865
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,720
It's outrageously funny because it is

866
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,256
It is so

867
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,840
I'm just so so much of a clear illustration

868
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
Vista Fire

869
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,400
Yas Oppositional defiant

870
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
Manslick characterizes

871
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,960
These crowds

872
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Yeah

873
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
That's it

874
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,592
It's childish tears my pet

875
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:47,200
Alright z-pack but we get all the conservatives in there when we just play Schoolhouse Rock

876
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,528
And maybe we would be at least a better off

877
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
You know

878
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,856
Hippie wouldn't fix everything

879
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
But maybe when they understand how bills

880
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
Tumblr

881
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,744
Might be globalist

882
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,584
Soros brainwashing after the kids right

883
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,424
Anyway Alex plays this clip of the people booing

884
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
He loves

885
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,264
It's very weird

886
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
Oh my God

887
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:20,224
All-weather mask and they didn't and they booed

888
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
Almost no one was wearing the stupid mask

889
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,672
That was all a giant fraud saying I'm not wearing your little

890
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,976
Scumbag

891
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
Post Bude

892
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
Muzzle

893
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,912
We conservatives

894
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
Believe in the rule of law

895
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
Because we know that when

896
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
The laws enforced

897
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
Horizon 4

898
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,896
They got practice

899
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:49,920
Back to talk about the

900
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
Brownsville dementia month

901
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,504
And I know this might sound like

902
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
Little bit of a downer

903
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
Property rights

904
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
When does the private home

905
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
And we believe in the rule of law

906
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
We need to comply with

907
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,696
The laws of this

908
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,464
County that were in

909
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,768
There's a long private Hotel just

910
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
Like your house gets to set its own rule

911
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,096
I am the law

912
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
TPAC director

913
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
Well as

914
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,776
Dan mentioned we are in a private facility and we do want to be

915
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
Tactful of

916
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,080
The

917
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
Ordinances that they have

918
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
As there

919
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,992
Private property so please when you're

920
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,808
Seated do suck

921
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,368
So if everybody can go ahead

922
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,648
Work on that

923
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:36,000
I know I know it's it's not

924
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,888
You have to ride William Wallace ladies and gentlemen

925
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,216
You have to let us in your own house

926
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
And where

927
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,776
Barley

928
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,104
Just

929
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,919
I can't imagine

930
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,735
Having a response to that other than like

931
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,503
Wow

932
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
That's

933
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
Bummer

934
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
Like it if

935
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:04,415
Even if I were somebody who is like opposed to wearing masks are being required to

936
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,463
We're here

937
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
If the rules of it

938
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
The place

939
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
Okay I understand

940
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,351
All of these people should be embarrassed

941
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,679
Yeah they should really be embarrassed because they're f****** chilled

942
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,215
And it's kind of sad

943
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,031
Credibly said

944
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,103
It bums me out and the fact that I'm going to go home and say

945
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,663
Think about how stupid they are is an even bigger

946
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,199
Bummer to me

947
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,247
The club just so fully like

948
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,551
Demonstrate that behavior

949
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,855
Someone gently trying to

950
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
Come up with

951
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,927
An excuse for why

952
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,719
You need to do this

953
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,839
How to put kids into eating vegetables

954
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,143
Deal that you would have to somebody

955
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,959
A group of people got together more like

956
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,519
We've got to try and get these people to wear masks

957
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:57,151
They're not going to listen to Medical ideas that are going to listen to they'll give a s*** about other people

958
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,015
Person could die right now and if they didn't like them they would all Chi

959
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,063
Yeah so what do we do

960
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,951
These people really loved property rights

961
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,999
Borderline like you have to be hey

962
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,535
If we want to carry guns

963
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,815
In this place

964
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,607
We got to wear a mask in this place

965
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,935
That would that would my work

966
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:23,007
I mean that's about all you can do

967
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
To deal with

968
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,055
He's f***************

969
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:25,823
Yeah

970
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,847
But like I said

971
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,151
There's a little bit of a shorter episode because it's

972
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,687
So much are just trumps

973
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,759
You know whatever

974
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,551
I feel like

975
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,831
Like it is

976
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,135
The greatest privilege in the world

977
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,183
Speak ever again

978
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:41,951
Yeah and it's

979
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,999
There's one there's one part where Alex

980
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,047
Refreshing

981
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
Gloucester weeks of Biden

982
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,887
Call just so B.

983
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
Disgrace

984
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
Nemo

985
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
What was the Paula

00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Policy platform

987
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
From the came out of CPAP

988
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Is your dad

989
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:03,967
Avoid canceling

990
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:07,295
No bother with like we want lower.

991
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,391
Texas none of that just straight-up Non-Stop

992

Bayou animal

993
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,999
I was looking at the speakers list

994
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,047
That is pretty surprising

995
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:18,815
Ike

996
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,863
Trump

997
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,887
You got Trump jr.

998
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,423
Yeah then that's like

999
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,239
Don't know why computer needs to be there anymore

1000
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,823
I kind of understand trap you got a excuse the diluted

1001
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,127
Text Blake

1002
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,407
James O'Keefe

1003
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,711
Who's giving the speed drill

1004
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,735
Rollie

Lauren boebert

1006
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
Oh my God

1007
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,111
Wow this is

1008
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
Wooboi

1009
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:50,047
So we have one last clip here and it's

1010
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:50,815
Alex

1011
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,143
Someone has found a clip of him

1012
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
Talking

1013
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,215
About his Rockefeller

1014
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,287
But he calls me lockstep document

1015
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:03,615
Which is not that's not what it is

1016
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,687
Watch that was one of the four scenarios that are painted

1017
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,711
About

1018
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,759
Possible ways the technology

1019
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
And governor

1020
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Can.

1021
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
The future

1022
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,391
And

1023
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
It's interesting

1024
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,487
Someone tried to clip him talking about it back in 2010

1025
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,815
No really hit Alex plays this clip

1026
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,143
As if like this proves I've always been right every

1027
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,727
I will make an argument on the other side of this clip

1028
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,775
This makes things worse for Ally

1029
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
I would make sense

1030
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,383
And that's with my prediction 11 years ago the lockdown

1031
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,431
And then I'll show your coming

1032
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,199
With

1033
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,247
Sunday live please spread the word

1034
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
God bless you all

1035
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:48,415
The Alex Jones Show there is a war on for your mind I mean I'm not even worthy to be bringing you in

1036
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:54,815
Information is powerful hope that

1037
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,351
Because I've had chills

1038
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,887
Since last night

1039
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,239
This just confirms everything else we've already research

1040
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:08,639
Envisions future dictatorship control by Elite

1041
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,455
Millions being killed mandatory quarantine

1042
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,247
Checkpoints the end of the family

1043
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:19,647
Everything that's in the other documents but this DuckTales Vol the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food

1044
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:26,047
Sterilize you enforced vaccines and the hell we're already living in this just going to continue to intensify until we take our government

1045
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
Back flip

1046
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,863
It's just another headline

1047
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
At this point

1048
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:34,239
He doesn't call it operation lockstep because that wasn't the branding on it at this

1049
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,055
Here is why I think this

1050
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
The worst

1051
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,615
I wouldn't have played

1052
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
You didn't

1053
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
Keep talkin

1054
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,479
It's not like

1055
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,527
It's shocking that someone was able to find a cliff

1056
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,343
Complete I'm covering this sack of that

1057
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
Yeah

1058
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,695
I guess it probably someone picked it up and ran with it didn't have much legs

1059
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
Some people just forgot about it

1060
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,023
It's not like

1061
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,815
2011 2012

1062
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,607
He's still talking about this document

1063
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:04,447
He completely forgets about it and tell Jim Fetzer

1064
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,495
Start yelling about it on his blog

1065
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,519
In 2020

1066
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,799
Like he doesn't

1067
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,591
This is this is worse

1068
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,151
Because if you actually believe like Alex

1069
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,479
Pretending to that this document lays out the globalists plan share

1070
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,759
You had it in you with

1071
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,039
Yeah

1072
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,575
Again

1073
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,879
Yeah for the millionth time

1074
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,975
It's astounding to me the way the way in which you eat

1075
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
I like

1076
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,559
He he thinks that this is a win and it's actually like

1077
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,607
Kind of raises more questions

1078
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,911
About a prophet

1079
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:40,287
I mean I make it look more full of s*** I would probably argue that the

1080
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,079
It is really bad for him because it's

1081
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,127
Basically saying that this is

1082
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
Cuz it's not

1083
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
The same document

1084
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,479
That he's talking about

1085
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,759
Yeah either way

1086
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,087
It just means that he said the same thing about God damn near every

1087
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Document

1088
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,135
2010

1089
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,207
Yeah it's been 10 years and not only has

1090
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,511
Talking about it

1091
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,535
None of it is happy

1092
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,607
So

1093
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
What is a prophet

1094
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,655
Sure

1095
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
He's a psychic

1096
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
Everybody

1097
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:18,687
That's why I found a little weird and what are the things that I decided that I think I want to do is

1098
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,223
I want to go try and find that epi

1099
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,575
I think I'm going to go try and do that

1100
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,879
Maybe we'll do that for when

1101
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:31,743
Wednesday or something

1102
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:35,583
I hear his coverage of it and compare it to the present day

1103
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
Coverage

1104
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,375
Do this document

1105
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:41,215
I wonder if he knows what the document is back in 2010 really good

1106
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,239
Oh yeah

1107
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,775
You got to do that now

1108
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,847
Yeah you literally have no choice I'm getting to work on it

1109
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:50,175
Now so

1110
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,295
You know I think this is

1111
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:00,159
This is a shorter episode but I think it's worth it if only for the weird commercial

1112
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,559
Is the kind of thing not only

1113
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,839
Should you not accept

1114
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
Commercial

1115
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,143
Advertising

1116
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,935
Money from that

1117
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,471
You should denounce it

1118
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:20,127
This is the kind of thing that person should be forced to apologize for accepting advertising money to are that

1119
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,663
Is something that like

1120
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,711
There would be a scandal

1121
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,271
Any other media Outlet

1122
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:30,367
Bed with something like this

1123
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
It's like hugging

1124
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,439
Somebody running a

1125
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
Advertisement

1126
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,279
Hitler in 1937 in the New York

1127
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,071
Times just like straight up

1128
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,607
Rose Goku

1129
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,167
So it's

1130
