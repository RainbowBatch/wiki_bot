1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan 5 sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody sit around and talk a little bit about

7
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,376
Jones

8
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,680
We all know that you're

9
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,472
Appreciator of dunks

10
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Is quite a setup

11
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,568
Last night was the dunk contest

12
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,104
When was the last dunk contest

13
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
I mean I've died from the YouTube clips that you watch all the time back when I get to watch basketball and I was like

14
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
Diener's

15
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:32,672
So you haven't watched clips of like more recent ones

16
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,720
Whenever I go back and I watch dunks

17
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,072
Yeah I'm watching 90s don't contact I'm not not because I

18
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352
I think that they're bad

19
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,168
Is there something magical about like those

20
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,240
Terrible uniforms

21
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
I think about it this way

22
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,152
Really excited I know it's probably cuz I was

23
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,480
Young man was I was watching

24
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,528

00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
Find vets

27
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
That the present-day about NBA.

28
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,816
Rex Chapman baby

29
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,960
Vince Carter was really Innovative a lot of fans

30
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
Remember back when I was in I don't know I don't know if he was ever really relevant player but I prefer Isaiah Rider was some

31
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,480
Talks about is like a great dunker

32
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,880
The Browns of the world who would like a little

33
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512

00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
The dunk route the novel

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
Maybe you didn't notice or remember I didn't

38
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,896
He also was on the same team is like Alonzo Mourning and Larry Johnson rhinos guys were

39
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
Elizabeth dump truck

40
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,296
There was just some controversial as that right

41
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
Oh yeah yeah

42
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624

00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
Perfect score

46
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,168
Tacko falls for the finals 05

48
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
He's real tall

49
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,240
And I

50
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
Grab the ball

51
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
Out of his shoulder

52
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
Manage to Dunkin

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Jumped over

54
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,408
Taco 47.5

55
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
Wound up getting a 47-in

56
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,784
And losing wow perfect up till that point

57
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,136
Yeah they were apparently the story was they were the judges were trying to

58
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,720
Set up a tie for the final course 48

59
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,048
But they couldn't do the math right so he got 40

60
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
P71. Losing

61
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
Is so bad

62
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,728
Conspiracy theory I'm not sure if I buy into it I was trying to pay attention to your story but

63
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
I kind of got lost

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Thought

65
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
I can't decide lyrics

66
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,152
Men can't jump over Taco Falls RX-7 could do anyting

67
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
Cannot

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
Read the thing that I was lost in thought about was

69
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:11,392
I can't decide whether or not I'm opposed to like when people dunk over cars

70
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
I think that I'm against it cuz I think that I don't like that aspect of it

71
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
You

72
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,167
And the ball and maybe another person you're jumping over

73
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,543
How is the person any different than the car am I being a stick-in-the-mud and every question over car is really cool

74
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,639
Trampoline I think not

75
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,503
I agree with the trampoline

76
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Performance enhancer

77
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,575
Drug situation rubber slam ball

78
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,415
What is SlamBall

79
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:50,815
Started I think it was on like FX or something like that one of those Spike TV probably it was just a basketball

80
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,375
But it was a trampoline

81
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
All right now I want that last bit wasn't it fun

82
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,031
I want Taco Fall zotos recipe for

83
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Neck injuries

84
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,175
Apparently I have a lot of feelings about dunks

85
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,271
And the controversy from last night's Dunk Contest I hope everybody

86
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
Is being sued appropriate

87
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,927
But I do know a lot about Alex Jones

88
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Right

89
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:23,071
So Jordan today we got an interesting media episode in front of us we are going over February

90
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607

00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:29,471

Yeah they're like real serious moods change from day-to-day

99
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:51,231
Okay and it's interesting a lot of the times we end up focusing on like one episode or maybe two episodes

100
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
Sometimes it's kind of difficult

101
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
The trace V like

102
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,399

So here is an out-of-context drop

141
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
Today's Show which gives you

142
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
One of the tone

143
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
But we're going to be Xperia

144
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,399
Trump should fire

145
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Who has it

146
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
Already shown themselves to be loyal

147
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
Okay wow

148
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
Okay there is

149
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
A theme

150
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:21,759
Consolidation of autocratic power definitely running through these episodes

151
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,599
Trump should remove anyone that he murders from a photo

152
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,951
Also I forgot about this but I need to take care of a couple

153
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
Things really quick

154
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
End of the show

155
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
1

156
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
Apple cider

157
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,911
I wanted to do is make a sound drop of like a bunch times Alex Lange

158
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,983
Amanda introduced the segment

159
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Forgot to do that

160
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:48,383
One is a giving a lot of people who like treated at me and said messages about Coach Dave

161
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
David Mayer

162
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,711
Apparently he's suing the NFL or wants

163
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
Sue the NFL could you got to horny during the halftime show

164
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
Some along those lines

165
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
People accuse you

166
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
Check in on your boy and somebody has a further

167
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
Second

168
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
I have made a conscious decision

169
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
That's out

170
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,095
I don't want to cover that I've no interest in that even though it's getting like

171
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
No people

172
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
Water retention was

173
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Put you on making

174
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
Fun of that dude

175
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,079
And one of them's a recognizes that like he has probably a couple hundred

176
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
Viewers on his YouTube show

177
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,711
It's not like he has a syndicated radio show that the outline

178
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,759
We would at this point the amplify

179
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,319
Yep I covering him getting horny

180
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:33,951
For the Superbowl this is something

181
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
Best left alone

182
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
No so that isn't going to happen

183
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
I'm sorry that disappointed Veep

184
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
Second thing

185
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
I keep getting messages about is

186
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Jim Bakker

187
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,495
And his silver sales

188
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
I have received

189
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,151
Because it's running the same path is Alec right he's trying to sell his silver solution

190
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,967
As a way that you can fight the Coronavirus

191
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
And

192
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
I'm pretty excited about that

193
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,111
Not because I think Jim Baker's going to get in trouble

194
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Because of something

195
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,695
That you you notice and that it is

196
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
That was everywhere

197
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,351
That was all over Twitter people posting the video of Jim Bakker selling the silver Inn

198
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
Just like what the fuc

199
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Is this

200
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
And what didn't

201
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
You see on Twitter

202
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
Alex Jones exact

203
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,287
We have been covering this goddamn still

204
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
I'm not saying like we we deserve more attention or anyting I see tons of people talking about Jim Bakker

205
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
Doing this

206
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,551
Literally no one talking about Alex Jones doing it

207
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:37,951
And that tells me that Alex Jones is less relevant than Jim Bakker

208
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,255
Bad sign for our career

209
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
Jim Bakker just being allowed to

210
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
Beyond the internet

211
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,191
Be kicked off. I mean it's not great that anyone

212
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
You know Jim Bakker

213
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
More relevant

214
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,335
But if we're grading it on sliding scale it's good that I'm

215
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Alex Jones

216
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
Is so unimportant

217
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,711
People that they don't even notice that he's doing this

218
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
Exact same thing

219
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
That they're climbing on Jim Bakker

220
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
That's good

221
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
The tells me that is

222
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
His impact

223
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
Acting his reach

224
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Is minimal

225
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
I appreciate the

226
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
So are those

227
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
Has been sighted

228
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Sorry to hear

229
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,143
So we've got a business here on February 12th

230
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191
And what has happened

231
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
At this point

232
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
Is that

233
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,055
Trump has you know he's fired

234
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
Lieutenant colonel vindman

235
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
Ambassador sondland

236
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
And

237
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
Alex is really exaggerated

238
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,271
He's in a mood where Trump is f******

239
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,367
Can Clearinghouse everyone everyone's got to go

240
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:44,767
There's no longer be any doubt President Trump isn't waiting until he wins the

241
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:50,143
Auction in 264 days launch

242
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,335
Storm nailed it

243
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,943
Golfing the swamp in d.c.

244
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,039
Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of operative

245
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,599
Inside

246
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,951
Department other agencies are being

247
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Ashley

248
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
We speak

249
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,167
So we got the air raid siren very reminiscent of Bill Cooper and Alex

250
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
I'll be able to Diana government are being purged

251
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Is the globalist

252
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,943
I need the people who've been impeding Trump's agenda.

253
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,991
I'm going on Alex's show at this point for a couple

254
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
Full days and honestly it definitely sounds like something Trump would do

255
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,927
The outrageously anti-democratic

256
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Ecowise

257
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
The shity president

258
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
Problem is that I can't find any evidence

259
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
This is actually happening

260
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
The hundreds

261
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
Hundreds of people

262
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
Drop-dead fire sondland

263
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
In vindman as well as his brother

264
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
And prior to that former Ukrainian Ambassador Bridge Ivanovic

265
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
Had resigned

266
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
The state

267
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
Be honest I don't really see any

268
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
Proof that there's a mass purging

269
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
The people within the cover

270
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
And you think people would make a big deal

271
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,599
A post on Raw Story mentions an advisor to Mike Pence

272
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Leaving her position

273
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,463
Trump withdrawing a couple of people have nominated for the positions of

274
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
The pentagon's Comptroller and

275
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Chief Financial Officer

276
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,887
And the treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes

277
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,447
There are those that still not really that

278
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,287
Outside of these examples I can't find any other globalist Purge

279
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
Does that are happening

280
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
An interesting way all of these people that

281
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Have been

282
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Records from the government really seem like they're just instances of trump retaliating against people who weren't 100% on Ford

283
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
Clearly

284
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,855
Criminal and anti-democratic agenda

285
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Etsy

286
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:51,743
How to show starts with a voice-over of a guy saying you want to fight against corruption was

287
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
So does he

288
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,095
To be painfully off-brand browse just be like hooray for explicit

289
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Corruption

290
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
He has to reframe

291
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
And this is the easiest way to do that

292
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
This isn't Trump retaliate

293
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Against

294
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Current employees

295
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,591
Getting Soros globalist people out of the administration

296
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
And it's not like

297
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,991
Five or six really egregious examples of retaliation no it's hundreds of embedded globalist

298
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
He's giving the boot

299
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,319
This is what I've been waiting for

300
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
Play does indictments are unsealed

301
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Yeah

302
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,463
There's a serious downside to this strategy that Alex is employing

303
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,095
And that's the kind of leaves them without any plausible excuses for why Trump still sucks and isn't getting anything done

304
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,959
Forever the excuses been that there's globalist in the mix or sabotaging things and leaking

305
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,775
Hundreds of ne'er-do-wells

306
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,127
That's really easy and readily accepted excuse is going to be off the table

307
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
Seems like a bad play

308
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,271
It seems like a reality of what Alex is talking about cuz it's not like

309
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
Tons of purges or anyting

310
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:54,719
What he's actually talking about is there's a story that came out on February 8th about National Security advisor Robert O'Brien

311
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
Announcing some cats

312
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
To the National Security

313
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Council staff

314
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,119
The feeling was the council Stanford got into big Andresen

315
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
You're so there was an interesting

316
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Streamlining

317
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,519
O'Brien had been interviewed by mpri January 11th

318
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:12,127
And he said that he'd hoped to have 6270 staffers off the council by the end of February

319
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
But it's important

320
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:18,015
Point out that they're specifically staffers that actually work for other government bodies

321
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
Like the Pentagon State Department or the Department of Homeland

322
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
Security

323
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,439
These are people who are on loan to the National Security Council staff

324
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,999
And this move isn't purging them or firing them

325
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,815
It's really just sending them back to their home or office

326
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
I think this is what our two stock

327
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
We said the hundreds and hundreds of people

328
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,495
I think he's talking about these people who Robert O'Brien

329
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
Is eliminating

330
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
There

331
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,455
Their role on the National Security Council but not purging the bridges going back to the Pentagon or the state

332
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,503
I'm going to go with he's just making

333
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,343
Well I think he's making it up based on this

334
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,391
As the story he's ripping from

335
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,207
I doubt he even knows does he bring up that story I think eight

336
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,047
It does come up definitely don't know if I don't remember if it's Alex

337
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Bring it up or guess

338
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
Yeah but I know that

339
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,911
The story of eventually does come up on the show

340
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,239
But what's important here is not

341
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
This is

342
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
Purge of all dissenting the government

343
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
What's important is that Alex's work

344
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Hoarding it as if it

345
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Is

346
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
And he's normalizing that idea

347
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
He's making his audience

348
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,015
Comfortable with the idea that a president like

349
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:26,879
Positions of people are blindly loyal to whatever he wants

350
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
Whether or not they're qualified for

351
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
For the position

352
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
This should not be a surprise

353
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:35,327
Because this is what Alex does all the time and he is not into democracy

354
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,911
A functioning government

355
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,751
Appointed how many justices do every

356
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
F******

357
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Possible Court

358
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,127
Can all of them unqualified and insane

359
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
So why would we be surprised that he won

360
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,295
So on our last episode that came out on Wednesday of last week

361
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
We discussed how Alex

362
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
TED talks about

363
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
Rodger Stone

364
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
The sentencing

365
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
Recommendation

366
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
79 years

367
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,559
Immediately after we put out that episode

368
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
Little bit Wild

369
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Doesn't matter

370
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,703
Bill Barr attorney general came out

371
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,495
And giving

372
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Made an amended

373
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
Sentencing recommendation

374
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
Location

375
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
Alex is super into that

376
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
You really into this

377
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
And

378
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
I hear you talk about that a little bit

379
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,855
What President Trump had to say yesterday

380
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
He's resigned because

381
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
I want to give Rodger Stone a record-long sentence

382
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,423
The real quick also the sound is terrible because at this point Alex is like he's using one of his wandering Mike's

383
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
So it did

384
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:50,079
Infowars does not know how to get this sound right there whenever he wants to stand up

385
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Happy as a different bike

386
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
It's just a

387
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,431
The disaster the segments

388
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,271
Over the course of these three episodes that I was like this and it's just not good enough

389
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:04,927
Even use have you ever been hired to work on a professional show it has a sound guy

390
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:10,559
You do all the sound for the show up sometimes I'm not a professional

391
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
However

392
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,727
You are better than the entire staff of info like 7 years ago

393
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
I mean I've learned

394
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,335
And you're not getting paid as much no problem

395
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
SUV

396
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
Prosecutor

397
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,343
Then resigned only to learn that that nomination was with Iran

398
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
President-trump

399
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
Rodger Stone yesterday afternoon

400
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,703
That's no I didn't figure that yes I'd be able to do it if I want it I have the absolute right to do it

401
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,495
I stay out of things

402
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,055
I don't agree that people wouldn't believe

403
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:02,015
I don't listen to anything he says and every time he talks I want to light this entire country on fire so amazing

404
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
Those like turns of phrase

405
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
And the way you talk

406
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
I-80

407
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,927
Do the Bojo absolutely

408
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,975
Why would the Press even

409
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
Pretend that he

410
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:18,655
Believe the conversations I don't have

411
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,959
And I didn't talk to them but I totally could have

412
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
It feels familiar and

413
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
Also in two weeks I'm going

414
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,431
You tell everybody that I did commit that

415
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
Crime rate and nobody's going to

416
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,551
So anyway as it relates to Rodger Stone was found guilty

417
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Crime

418
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
By a jury

419
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
And it sentencing is coming up

420
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
The end of this month

421
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,999
The prosecution who work for the US government recommended that Rodger get 729 years

422
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Prison

423
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
I'm editorializing

424
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
I'm here but I assume this is

425
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
Was partially inspired by his

426
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Career of the

427
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:54,751
Destroying people's lives as long track record of playing Shady political games to help authoritarian

428
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
Red States and abroad is consistent Behavior

429
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,127
The derail that trial that he was in as it was happening

430
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:06,527
Yeah that is charging

431
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
Intimidation

432
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,111
He did tamper with Witnesses that's true

433
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:15,231
Editorializing I'm just guessing maybe if I were a prosecutor I'd be like a look

434
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
He's not been punished

435
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
Hundred percent done

436
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,447
You don't hey maybe he doesn't have a criminal record but you bet he does

437
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
But whatever the

438
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,007
Rodger that this sentence

439
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
From the cross

440
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
Then Trump tweeted out that is recommendation

441
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,895
Very unfair

442
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:37,247
Do you know just after that the doj overruled its own recommendation

443
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
Suggested Stone get less time in jail

444
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,111
Honestly it's a pathetic move on

445
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Attorney General

446
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
William Barr's parts

447
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
That recommendation doesn't

448
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Dictate the ax

449
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
That's still the judges

450
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
Decision

451
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
All this does is send a message

452
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,143
And that messages that isn't really real

453
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,959
Even even in terms of the Department of Justice

454
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Trump doesn't give a f***

455
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,871
That is a yeah I'm going to go with I'm calling it

456
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,431
Democracy

457
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,223
The message is clear

458
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:13,599
In response to the revised sentencing suggestion all for the prosecutors on Stones case withdrew

459
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,184
From their positions in the case and one of them straight up resign from the barber

460
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
Justice

461
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,768
All that is fairly serious stuff

462
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
Because they're sending a message

463
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,840
With these withdrawals

464
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,168
And that is that this is a corrupt operation that they can no longer be apart

465
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,008
We've touched on the Rogers stuff like I said in the last episode

466
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Before all this news

467
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
I said

468
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,408
That I don't really care about is 729 year sentence

469
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
Faith that he would have any punishment at all

470
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,296
I have a strong suspicion that this move by Trump in the department

471
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Justices

472
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Trap the judge

473
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:49,184
So if she sentences Rodger to a term in line with the initial recommendation

474
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,584
Shopkin have a pretend justification to pardon I have to Pardon him I told you this was an unfair sentencing

475
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
You guys didn't reduce it so I have no choice but to part

476
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,448
It gives cover today

477
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,496
Kind of how I see this but it would

478
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,336
The case I have no idea of my sense of it is accurate

479
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
But that just

480
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,688
That seems to be what purpose this would serve

481
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
To give cover and justify

482
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:18,880
Vacation all this activist never Trumper judge wemic gave a recommendation 6 months

483
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,208
Prison but I got to just get rid of them

484
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
II

485
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,048
I hesitate at anytime to

486
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Attribute

487
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,840
Reasonable

488
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
Motivation behind

489
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,168
Anything like that.

490
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,264
That sounds so reasonable I think Bill Barr would come up with that.

491
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,360
Yeah that's true on the level of Rajasthan

492
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,920
Rodger Staubach

493
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
Exactly

494
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,552
For now

495
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,392
For now larger picture Trump is making moves unsure

496
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,720
The power is clearly indicating the dissenters and people who eat

497
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,768
Perceived as Crossing it will suffer consequences

498
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,816
Sniper people he perceives as allies

499
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,864
He'll attack the foundations of the law to do

500
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,728
We're entering seriously f***** up territory and now it's a cheering for all of it

501
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
Because of course he

502
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
Alex isn't into

503
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
Democracy or functioning

504
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,128
Yeah if there's any way that they

505
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
If there's no way the field

506
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Fuck12

507
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
Man I don't know

508
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,832
That's just beyond been used to push back a little harder on your claims that

509
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
I'm still pushing back on it a little bit

510
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:27,488
But when I see I don't want I don't want alarmism here but it's not the problem

511
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
Overtime

512
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
Things have gotten more to what I was

513
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
Being hyperbolic

514
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,240
Little like back then

515
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Seems like a

516
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Yeah

517
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
I mean who knows

518
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Huh

519
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
Who knows

520
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,712
Anyway Alex's world there's a purge going on he's

521
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,296
Super into it get all non Trump loyalists out

522
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,368
If Trump has done it he's launching

523
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
Legal Law Firm

524
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
Purge

525
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
Hootie Hoo

526
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
Dog catcher

527
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:09,472
Customary to remove the political apparatus of the

528
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,104
And office that you remove the

529
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
Adjunct

530
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,200
Now that we're working a on party usually because they

531
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,992
Are loyal to put them in

532
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,040
Not even the party cell for the people

533
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,648
A major major major blunder

534
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,696
He did not remove

535
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
Those individuals

536
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,584
And so they were working again to the whole time as Obama and Hillary

537
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,960
Neocon deep state

538
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,848
He is going to fire

539
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Excellent

540
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408
Anyone

541
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Excellent

542
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
Excellent

543
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,576
Here we have a very clear-cut signal that Alex is fully aware that the behavior he's hoping

544
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,672
Z Trump engaging is the definition of a dictator consolidating power

545
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:06,816
Distress is a legal and lawful Purge of people

546
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
I can find no evidence

547
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,400
Is describing attacks

548
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,800
Is carrying out a large-scale purged of all the globalist Soros types in the government

549
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,336
But that's what Alex is reporting

550
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
Is it good

551
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:25,760
So I can say I consulted Infowars website see they give me any clues about the situation

552
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,600
Add one interesting article about a guy in the state department who is quote

553
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648
Fired by President Trump is part of the

554
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
Cleaning in the state

555
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,232
The article goes on quote

556
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:39,328
President Trump is taking a more active role in running the day-to-day Affairs of the White House

557
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
By grabbing the rain

558
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Trump is preventing

559
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:47,776
Himself for being isolated by his own staff a real danger given how others have acted as biki

560
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
By preventing information

561
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,616
Flowing to the president and they have been drugged

562
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
In his Diet Cokes I believe

563
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:59,296
Are they still doing that or do they stop doing that article that I just read from was posted in March 2018

564
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,600
There we go all right

565
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
I looked around a little more.

566
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,696
About Trump purging descent in the White House

567
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,744
Written by Paul Joseph Watson

568
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:12,608
President Trump is about to take the gloves off in a purge of White House adviser they could begin

569
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
Is early as today

570
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,984
That article is from May 2017

571
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,568
It's really funny when you start poking around a little deeper on their website

572
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,640
You really need to hire someone to clean up all that s***

573
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
From a January

574
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,736
26 2014 article with a sheared byline

575
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,600
From Alex and Paul Joseph Watson with the headline Obama launches chilling Purge against

576
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
GoAnimate

577
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
From the article

578
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:42,816
Throughout history every culture has had Maxim's in-law denouncing the openly corrupt sitting in judgment

579
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:48,960
The Obama justice department is openly launching a night of long knives style Purge of their political enemies

580
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,264
Did you send chills up the spine of All American

581
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,872
This article is mostly about Dinesh D'Souza being prosecuted for

582
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:00,992
Campaign-finance scribe witchy absolutely good today

583
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
Anything here

584
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
It's really

585
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
It's really a struggle

586
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
Really struggled not to judge

587
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,328
This article from November 1st 2013

588
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Quote

589
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,912
In Obama's America the military must forsake their concert

590
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
In favor of blind Allegiance

591
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
It's their new Commander

592
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
I'll be really interested to hear the 10

593
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,080
Colonel vindman steak on that

594
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,432
Of course terrified of the Obama purchase

595
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Consolidating

596
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,064
Empower is the dictator we all knew he was right

597
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,160
The boy here is that this is a super common feature of the Infowars of rhetorical

598
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
Turned on its head a little bit

599
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
The Trump era

600
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,584
In the preceding years every single thing that Obama did was considered an

601
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
Unconstitutional Purge

602
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,424
Attack on Patriots or some s*** well he was black

603
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Dan Wright

604
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:57,312
But as soon as Alex joined up with Trump two-tone completely changed an editorial line has been wanted Amanda

605
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
Trump fire everyone

606
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,664
That's cuz he's orange what this is because added

607
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,272
Core Alex's ideology is not libertarian or Americana or whatever he pretends it

608
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
He wants to serve a dick

609
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
And honestly he couldn't have been more clear about this

610
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,648
Is the writer's career

611
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
It just has to be the right dick

612
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
Because he believed

613
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
But he's classes

614
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
Persian person is safe

615
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:23,936
I'm not sure if Trump said he's going to fire all never trumper's also Rose people in anyone who worked with Hillary

616
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,752
I can't find proof of that but I wouldn't be surprised

617
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
At this point

618
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:31,104
The reason Alex's presenting things this way however is because if

619
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,152
Alex says the Trump is doing these things

620
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:38,016
What could otherwise be seen as reorganizing of the security Council staff is now frame

621
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
Does the long way

622
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Fulfillment

623
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
This is Trump

624
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
In the form that they've been begging

625
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,464
Who's going to purge all their perceived enemies from office

626
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,256
What you want

627
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,328
Amir two possibilities

628
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,984
Either Trump is doing that and now it's a cheerleading an authoritarian ruler consolidating power and silencing all those voices

629
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,288
Or Trump isn't doing that

630
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,848
In this cycle will just repeat all over a

631
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,176
Weirdly drop still won't do any of the things that Alex

632
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
Consistory totally wants to do

633
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,016
But can't cuz of all these globalist mettler's

634
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,064
Like really is magical cures

635
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
For every

636
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
So no excuse will be needed

637
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,024
And when that time comes I'll predicted Alex's just get some high-level Intel that there's another Soros mole in the admin

638
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
The last Purge

639
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,096
And they were what

640
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:29,216
Stopped us from getting the miracle cures all along and the cycle will continue over and over and over again

641
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,544
If none of this means anything else or just making it up

642
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,080
The one thing

643
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
That

644
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,408
Alex should be like going on with

645
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
With Trump about

646
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:44,064
Is the recent release of all the Pentagon stuff about how they've got

647
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,672
Alien UFO research going on and everybody's like

648
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:52,768
Well they might actually have something

649
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,560
That's the one thing Alex should be like

650
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
Release all the UFOs

651
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
Just do it

652
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,168
You've done that in the pasties

653
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
Music called

654
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,728
The past

655
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:06,336
Seem to recall even Rodger was saying the Trump is going to do that

656
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,384
That's not a standard feature

657
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,480
I want it now but maybe next week who knows Alex is

658
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:16,832
By the time we get through this Alex's on quite a rollercoaster

659
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
Need something like that

660
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
Alex

661
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
His position on this is like

662
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:29,376
Trump can do whatever he wants Delta poj to do whatever.

663
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:33,216
Hey that is totally independent that he does not have control over its

664
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,336
Pardoning Rodger Stone

665
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
She says that she thinks is he legal

666
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
Who does

667
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
Sunrise Leander

668
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
What should be reasonable

669
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
Justice Reform movement is about

670
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,744
Nonviolent people not serving lunch time

671
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,840
Just Department Shea

672
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Do not give this

673
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,960
Person a longer sentence than you normally would

674
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
1

675
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,312
Hundred percent

676
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,384
Alex's of muddying up the issue here

677
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
And that's

678
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,176
Like it's it's

679
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,272
It's a question of abuse of power for Trump to have it.

680
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
Doj change their sense of recommendation

681
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
This case

682
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,160
It's not like the prosecutors in that case were just out

683
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
To get Rodger for no reason and Trump is trying to

684
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,256
Defend an innocent man has no connection

685
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,376
Rodger was found guilty in a jury trial and the prosecutors had their recommendation

686
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,216
Clearly Trump tweeted his disapproval and barmaid moves to address

687
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
Recommendation

688
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
That's all very

689
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,920
Clear and it's a very over case of corruption and most likely reasons going this way as best I can tell is because

690
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
Someone explain to drop that he

691
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Couldn't just

692
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
Pardon Rodger

693
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,832
That would almost certainly cause a severe reaction because Rodger was sentenced

694
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,184
For interfering in a case related to trump it doesn't seem like that would be

695
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,536
Be corrupt Attorney General Metal innocence aggreko

696
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,328
Invitation to create a free text where Rodger

697
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
Either get the super light

698
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,192
Possibly no time at all or the judge ignores the new recommendation

699
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,008
It gives him nine years and you can easily justify apart

700
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
All the games being played here

701
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
That's very lame

702
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,384
Yeah I do that like

703
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,712
All these issues about whether or not

704
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,784
Criminal Justice Reform could be something a president

705
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,576
Advising the doj on

706
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,112
General guidelines

707
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,416
That's not even the conversation here

708
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,464
He's a case that specifically involved

709
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
Who's the president

710
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
Okay so

711
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,864
You're telling me that if Rodger Stone kildoo guy directly at the

712
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
Commando

713
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,216
And then he were to Pardon him

714
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,264
That would send the bad

715
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,360
That is the imagine that

716
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,176
The election is

717
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
Korean pear

718
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,736
And the results are

719
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,832
He's just going to pull in hwa

720
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,136
Pardon everybody who committed a

721
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,184
Like everybody

722
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,488
And if he did

723
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
That

724
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
I don't think

725
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
I think I'm going to be like

726
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,632
F*** you alright let's move on

727
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,704
Get up go go and

728
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,032
Some of them would probably face other charges

729
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,056
You can't pardon

730
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,384
State-level charges

731
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
Prosecution

732
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,688
Is it still end up happening

733
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,016
That would be the time when that could happen be like

734
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,624
Are you lost the election but you're not out of office yet whatever

735
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
Fine just

736
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
Divine

737
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
Just leave now

738
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
But it's not going to

739
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
Whenever a loser

740
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,608
Baby

741
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:44,704
So anyway I was really thrilled about this imagine purged of all the globalist

742
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472
Soros

743
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,008
Putting people in the government

744
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
And look man

745
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,568
We can celebrate that

746
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,872
But there's something else that needs to happen

747
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
Celebrate knowing after

748
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,320
The Democrat deep state

749
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
Replace

750
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Himself at the head of that

751
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
Ademco comes over and have dinner with him and Ivanka

752
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,560
And Sheridan

753
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,632
You know what maybe I was going to come

754
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Ahead

755
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
Just got to let apple and Tim Cook

756
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
Control everything and end

757
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
Sensor and block

758
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,664
And and not let it be available

759
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
Put me back on Facebook

760
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Dangerous

761
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
That's

762
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Destruct

763
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,320
I want to be on Twitter

764
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
Tyranny

765
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
And taking place now

766
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,488
What is basically

767
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,328
With your prediction

768
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,168
But yeah that is that is kind of what what is Pourquoi

769
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,216
I will back on Facebook

770
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,008
The Purge that you're doing a volvulus

771
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
Love love it

772
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:56,640
I need back on Twitter

773
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
Time is legal

774
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
But put me back on

775
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
So you know Alex says

776
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
It's hiring hundreds

777
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,808
100

778
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
The Hitman

779
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,136
It's fine because other people have done

780
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
Something

781
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
About the

782
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768
Finally

783
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:22,240
She's getting rid of any Obama people any Hillary people

784
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,848
When clinton.in in 1993

785
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,664
Every us attorney

786
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,784
Trump didn't fire any are they said that he was misusing his power

787
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:41,184
Alex is absolutely completely lying though I remember Obama did all of that

788
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,464
So anytime

789
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
Substantiate this flood of firing

790
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,816
She keeps talking about

791
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,168
Cuz even now days later I still have no idea who these deep Staters are the Trump was elected

792
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:51,936
Viron

793
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:56,544
More importantly though Alex is definitely gaslighting his audience about the firing of u.s.a.

794
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,848
Let me just read to you from a March

795
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,920
10th 2017 article in Politico with the headline

796
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Trump team house

797
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,248
Obama appointed us attorneys

798
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,344
President Donald Trump's Administration task remaining us attorneys

799
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,416
Appointed by President Barack Obama to offer their resignations

800
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Friday

801
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,256
That's weird cuz I just heard Alexei the truck didn't

802
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
Fire any of them

803
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
Wow

804
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:25,472
They offered resignation that's what all the president do

805
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Something for president

806
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,568
It's due so it isn't some kind of horrific thing Trump did or anything are you

807
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
Is worth

808
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
Getting

809
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,200
The battery was kind of being disingenuous

810
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,992
Cuz it was trying to take shots of trump

811
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,392
Interesting Lee this strategy of pointing the finger at Clinton's firing of us attorney's to justify governmental firing

812
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,184
It is a very specific origin

813
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,232
And that is the George W bush just

814
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,096
In 2006 they wanted to get rid of eight us attorneys who they didn't like

815
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,632
Need to deflect criticism

816
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,168
The talking point they deployed was

817
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:59,264
To say the Clinton broke with tradition and fired all the US attorney's when he took office

818
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,080
This is disingenuous and also not true

819
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,128
From the Bush Administration

820
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
For one it was rigged

821
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:12,320
Who began the practice of replacing attorneys back in 1981 when he replaced 71 out of the 93 us attorneys that we

822
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
Replace

823
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,672
2006 bearings were a bit of a different situation

824
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,464
Because they were being done at

825
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,744
As part of a transition

826
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,792
As

827
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,072
Initially I took office

828
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,096
2001

829
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,656
This so was very out of the ordinary

830
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,752
The inspector-general ended up releasing a report of Investigation

831
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
The sound that the firing

832
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,312
Politically motivated

833
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,616
Which is still frowned upon back then

834
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,944
Mingling of the Justice we were also

835
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:46,880
The flight from what ended up being a pretty big Scandal for Bush they use the talking point they Clinton fired all the attorneys when he took office

836
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
And since then

837
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,232
It's just been repeated Ad nauseam in right-wing media whenever they need to just

838
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,024
Fire politically-motivated fire

839
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,072
Replacing people in these positions

840
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,656
As part of a transition isn't normal part of riding a presidential Administration

841
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
These days

842
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
But firing a bunch of people for political reasons

843
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,008
3 years into your term

844
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
Is not

845
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:08,384
That is very abnormal and you can't just say what about the clintons and make all these troubling aspect

846
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Text disappear

847
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,456
What's fascinating

848
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,736
Is that this is what

849
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
Right-wing hack

850
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
Do

851
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,808
This is what Alex

852
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,344
Pretended you I wasn't

853
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
Yeah in a bit

854
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,952
This is what Glenn Beck would have done

855
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,024
This is what I don't know Rush Limbaugh would do

856
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,328
Not me man I'm above the political divide

857
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,400
Hockey GOP talking points

858
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,192
I wouldn't be surprised if

859
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
In 2000

860
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,240
3 he went after

861
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,640
Not Shock me at all an easy place for him to score some points

862
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,176
It's the bushes so

863
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
So Alex gets to some

864
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,784
Interesting territory here

865
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
Starts

866
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,880
Search talking about not like

867
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
Can Q

868
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:55,488
Cunot we've noticed in the past couple months

869
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,768
She's been going pretty hard again

870
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
Committed when he was talking to

871
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,120
Steve

872
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:06,240
Co-opted from

873
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,312
This clip has a little bit of both of those things

874
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
By the way

875
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,896
Information from

876
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,432
And you'll make

877
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,712
Mostly easy predictions

878
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,784
Party line

879
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
Not going to fight with

880
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,904
You and like it

881
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,560
I am q

882
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
Infowars.com

883
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704
Infighting

884
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,176
How to kill your all-powerful

885
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:49,248
We just have the sticker there now that

886
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,576
Infowars.com we love you

887
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
It's wonderful

888
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,744
So Alex is now selling these stickers that you put on your rallies and one of them says I am cute

889
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
Profit off of

890
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,096
It does

891
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
Dammit

892
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:08,704
Fuckyous bulshit

893
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,496
5 bucks a pop

894
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
And you get

895
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,800
I guess

896
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,616
Carry out my weird little Vendetta

897
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,664
Nonsense if you need any

898
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,480
Indication of how insincere and full of s***

899
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,504
Krass marketing

900
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,808
Motivation Alex has

901
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,624
Look no further than I think he was bullshittin selling

902
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
Sticker that says I am

903
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,952
Thank you and and we get

904
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,280
Another example of the first clause

905
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,304
Being

906
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,328
Demolished by the second

907
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,376
I've never been a big fan of info

908
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,728
But you suck

909
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:47,872
I've never been into inviting us also.

910
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,808
So Alex keeps

911
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
Calling this

912
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,368
Being the Trump is doing this

913
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,160
Purge the Red Storm

914
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,464
Is really trying to brand that pretty hard

915
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:08,096
Has launched the Red Storm hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

916
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:15,008
Whining or complaining there. Their little boxes waddling out of the federal government

917
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:21,408
National Security Council the State Department of Justice Department

918
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,224
Americares and now finally

919
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,600
So I just hate I hear things like that in person. I hear like man

920
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,880
Misbranded going on

921
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,904
Does Red Storm thing

922
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:38,304
Cuz the storm is a q thing that is a big Q through the storm

923
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,584
Is upon us that that service

924
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,376
I'm so glad I never look in

925
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:46,240
And the second thing I think when I hear a clip like that is like

926
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,776
Alex will be so fine

927
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,312
With like the night of long I

928
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:53,407
Absolutely all about it

929
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:58,527
Can you buy into whatever the state propaganda was surrounding it and you repeat it

930
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,599
You would not be worried at all it just be like look at this

931
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,999
Hitler's great it's great it's fantastic you purging the bad guys everybody

932
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:14,399
Was he was he was

933
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:19,263
It's that he was with him

934
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,543
The debate

935
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,847
Just replace that with their we're globulus

936
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431
It's unfortunate that we

937
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
We use not

938
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
Coffee too much

939
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,247
In the previous

940
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
12 years

941
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
Because now

942
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
We really are living in Nazi

943
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
And it's been overdone week

944
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:41,791
Mechanic told me that matter and I think there's an interesting distinction between two like the

945
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:48,447
The specifics of Nazism and all that not necessarily matching up with the larger

946
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,007
Themes

947
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,079
Descent into fascism

948
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,895
Season that's required with that languages something anything

949
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,199
Even we are really necessarily equipped

950
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,015
Right handle and certainly Twitter isn't

951
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,647
Is Twitter equipped to handle not much fake Joker

952
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,767
And getting everyone like a beach safe

953
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,095
You would that you never did that

954
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
You're not going to start now

955
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Alex ghost

956
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,215
Call Zane takes calls and I'll pretty upsetting

957
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,287
I think it's time to put the military in here

958
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
Cool

959
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,455
Can't deal with these people

960
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,855
And you know they're not going to stop

961
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,415
They were Americans doing it

962
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,231
Hi, global us-funded

963
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:49,119
They say America shouldn't shouldn't exist

964
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:53,215
And you're working

965
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:58,847
All these Bernie Sanders people say they want to put us in death camps

966
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:11,391
Okay

967
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,439
Totally

968
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,463
Sense

969
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:20,863
I'll just like just to keep track of that Alex is still pushing the outlaw the Democratic party narratives which is

970
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,935
Deeply upsetting

971
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,495
Is definitely for the military to

972
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,031
To cross the Rubicon begin

973
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,079
As we know that worked out

974
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,943
Alex wants not only to Outlaw democratic

975
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,015
Party People existing door that party at Celtics

976
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,807
He also

977
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,599
As mirroring I call her

978
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,647
Do you want to do process

979
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
Revoked

980
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:50,303
Enemies

981
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,863
Brought the war they brought

982
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,911
Americans

983
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:59,007
Did EXO how do you address something with normal mean

984
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,311
Normal measures what it's not normal

985
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,063
All the way up to Hillary have committed treason

986
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,111
We can't go to the courts

987
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
Military Tribunal

988
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,303
It's real

989
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,607
Ona political

990
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,655
Works in unison

991
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
Country

992
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
Is it

993
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Right

994
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,455
So Alex is kind of right after WWII Military Tribunal

995
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,479
Those were the Nazis which

996
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
The Nuremberg

997
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:47,647
Right over technically Military Tribunal also held under the authority of international law which I don't think Alex

998
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
To be so into

999
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,951
Actually heard him speak

1000
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:56,351
Disparagingly of the Nuremberg trials for that exact

1001
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,655
Maybe I'll have crypto sympathies

1002
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,423
Sporanox

1003
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,519
Also do make the argument that its international law and I'm against

1004
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
Of course

1005
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,967
But the Nuremberg trials weren't some kind of like summary Kangaroo Court nonsense Alex wants to use to send his enemies to Skype

1006
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,503
Guantanamo or whatever

1007
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:19,903
Military tribunals are appropriate for matters related to military Justice which is to say crimes committed by and list

1008
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:25,279
There's a very specific term for the use of military law enforcement or courts on civilian

1009
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
Which is what Alex is advocating

1010
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,375
That term is martial law

1011
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,423
Which you think Alex would understand

1012
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,519
Considering his Maiden entire career yelling dire warnings about absolutely

1013
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,335
No I was in favor of martial law

1014
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,615
Vapor everybody's against

1015
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,407
Write using favorite cuz he thinks

1016
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,711
With Trump in charge of it people like himself

1017
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,735
Are in the clear

1018
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:50,111
This is pathetic stuff but would it really Reveals His House surface-level any of his understanding is

1019
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,415
Eat but even the main topic seat covers

1020
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,207
Or any of that his position

1021
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
It's all it's all bull

1022
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,279
They all wanted

1023
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
Yes

1024
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
And

1025
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,959
This is where things take a real weird turd

1026
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,543
Discover Alaska

1027
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,079
All he's really

1028
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,615
The top leadership of the globalist

1029
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,687
Maybe twenty people that all died in kayak accident this week

1030
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:21,087
Michelle but I would support cover

1031
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,135
Support the president

1032
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:34,399
People that wax you do that there's people that can be trusted to carry out

1033
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
That's upsetting

1034
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,311
Why would why would you even play that music

1035
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,615
They know they're not the good guy

1036
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:51,551
Alex Coates Palpatine all the time

1037
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:57,951
Bad guys assassination teams to covertly murder the heads of

1038
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,743
The global estructura whatever

1039
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,583
I guess David Rockefeller is already dead so he's not going to be at Target

1040
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,887
But if you're a regular listener the show you know what this

1041
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,191
A rose

1042
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,199
First name

1043
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Of course

1044
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,551
Mules are Bill and Melinda Gates have Hillary Clinton Obama

1045
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
And here's the thing

1046
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,111
All those people

1047
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
Rusc

1048
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:31,999
Alex is explicitly calling for the targeted murders US citizens by a President

1049
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,047
He just can't be clear they would Alex

1050
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,583
Wants is to live in the most

1051
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,143
Brutally repressive dictatorship imaginable

1052
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,215
Just with his class of person not affected by that

1053
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,751
Dictatorship

1054
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,287
Is the secret police

1055
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
To become deaf

1056
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,151
Squads and covertly murder all of his political enemies

1057
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,455
I don't understand what the problem here is that this is

1058
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
Is normal behavior

1059
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:58,879
Sending in the Marines using military tribunals martial law outlawing rival political parties assassinations of City

1060
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,415
Listen to you politically disagree with

1061
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,439
This stuff is Oprah

1062
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,231
Pre-classic anti-democratic

1063
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
Stop

1064
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,535
It's time to get real about things

1065
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,583
Alex Jones doesn't hate liberals

1066
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,119
Liberalism

1067
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,679
As in free and open Society

1068
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,215
And functioning democracy

1069
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,287
Yes cuz then you have people who don't act like

1070
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:22,943
Write anybody who took Chinese money including the I guess all of us

1071
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,015
I don't I don't know how you can not picture of Ally

1072
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,975
Anyway Alex you know

1073
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
He gets out of talking about

1074
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,535
And

1075
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,095
He really starts talking about a lot of murders

1076
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,911
Is really on a murder kick here on the 12th

1077
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,471
70 years ago

1078
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,543
What's 97%

1079
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,871
Maybe 2% of them had electricity

1080
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,919
Maybe 10% at running water

1081
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,199
He's talking about China

1082
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
Sorry I should have

1083
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
Better

1084
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,087
Globalism

1085
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,679
Said anybody

1086
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:22,079
That is in bed with a chai comes once they got more Eragon the last twenty years or so

1087
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,383
They make you put one of their officers in your cup

1088
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,687
What

1089
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:32,063
Chinese intelligence agency

1090
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,623
We don't need

1091
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
To sit there and let that

1092
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
Damage the economy

1093
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,071
What you talk about what you actually did we kill

1094
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,351
All the Chinese agents

1095
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,143
Not me I'm talking about

1096
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,935
LeapPad the military gokilla

1097
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,311
It's not acting top it's not a long big man guy

1098
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
What's the default

1099
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,151
You got a foreign intelligence operative inside the Senate

1100
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,455
Inside the house inside of us Corporation

1101
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
Kill him

1102
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,527
I got it's not a big deal

1103
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,111
Grab them out of their house at 9

1104
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,391
What you supposed to do

1105
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,183
Stop playing games

1106
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,487
Kill the Chinese agents now

1107
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,511
Woodstock

1108
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,815
I don't really trust Alex

1109
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
To have a good

1110
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:19,423
Dejon who is a Chinese Spy Who maybe is

1111
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,215
Is a Chinese business person in order

1112
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,751
Chinese person

1113
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
I think this is

1114
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
Pretty bad

1115
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,335
Departure

1116
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,383
Found a weird Road

1117
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:32,735
Alex is really just straight-up calling for a lot of murders on this episode

1118
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,503
Like

1119
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,551
I don't know whether or not to be

1120
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,879
Terrified of everything or just remember that

1121
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,903
He's a ridiculous

1122
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
Like

1123
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
Nonsense

1124
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,999
You know like

1125
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,047
He's a clown but at the same time

1126
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,839
So was Pennywise

1127
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,887
It's like I don't know what to

1128
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,935
I think of

1129
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,287
Yeah I don't know I have a difficult time with cuz I can't help take

1130
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
You can't take him

1131
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
Too seriously

1132
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,615
Of course not

1133
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,407
Because if you did you just be like

1134
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:06,015
I don't know what I would do if I took this seriously

1135
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Yeah

1136
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
What are you

1137
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,087
I just

1138
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:13,183
Like it's it's one of those things where if we're vivalive always said that he

1139
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,743
He's like the weakest link of the right-wing propaganda

1140
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,303
And what worries me about this b*******

1141
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,095
Is how far

1142
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
The chain does this

1143
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
Kind of thinking

1144
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,167
I don't think

1145
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:29,311
This goes very far but I wouldn't have thought yesterday

1146
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:34,687
Before we started out right call from military tribunals and secret murders

1147
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:39,039
But I think that he's touched on that in the past does not as overly and insist

1148
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,927
I can't I can't stress this enough we're going to hear a lot about killing people

1149
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,719
I really don't feel comfortable

1150
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,999
Keep going

1151
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,303
Kill the foreign agents now

1152
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
Bob

1153
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,679
I know you got the people ready to do it at don't be scared

1154
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,727
To the media than car

1155
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,519
Everyone's going to bite you

1156
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,311
Sheldon

1157
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,079
Chill now

1158
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
Duet

1159
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,991
Did he get some bad news about Sandy Hook

1160
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:12,575
See that's what I kind of feel where I'm coming from right now

1161
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,855
It seems to me like I'm a

1162
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:17,439
Of course Alex is a gigantic narcissist like

1163
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,511
Negative things are happening in his life

1164
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,303
Medifast

1165
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,071
Like

1166
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,119
Severe things that need to happen

1167
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:28,447
Trump needs to murder

1168
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:34,079
I wonder about that but it would probably be irresponsible to assume that without any kind of evidence

1169
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,615
So glad he does feel like

1170
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,943
Something personal

1171
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,063
In some way that we will have

1172
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,855
More information to go on even

1173
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,159
From there that something might be going bad

1174
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:53,023
Gotcha but I don't know I have no idea what that would be for now it's just

1175
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,303
Murder talk

1176
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:58,911
Turn loose the US military unknown Chinese agents inside the United States

1177
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
Country

1178
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:07,871
We're not going to have trials are big long events are a bunch of

1179
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,175
Frying pans

1180
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,831
You do with the child comes do if they catch USA

1181
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
I really don't think

1182
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:22,463
These people because China

1183
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,767
If I'm not much mistaken

1184
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:29,375
I believe

1185
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,655
Just seems dumb to just

1186
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,959
Buy your own behavior by saying the China would do it

1187
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,031
Perhaps our better countries to Aspire to when you want to come

1188
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,055
Compare yourself to something

1189
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:37,823
Well

1190
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,359
Their satanic and Evil

1191
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,407
So it's a good idea for us

1192
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,175
Just to be safe

1193
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,199
Anakin evil that makes

1194
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,551
That's basically the argument

1195
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,855
Alex loves the Bible and

1196
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:55,999
Clearly in the Bible it says Jesus mentioned us or wants the other cheek

1197
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,303
Anyway borvir talk

1198
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,423
What you start there

1199
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
Let's just start there

1200
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,007
Watch the Democrats

1201
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,335
Yellow bellies as soon as their controllers are all dead

1202
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
Stopped

1203
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
Playing games

1204
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,039
Show easiest like pumpkin pie man

1205
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,087
I need a piece of pumpkin pie with whipped cream on top

1206
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,135
This is not hard to do

1207
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,695
And it needs to be done America needs to stop

1208
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,743
Rolling over this BS

1209
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,423
We're supposed to do

1210
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:39,775
So I think this is obviously a more real version of Alex that we're seeing here

1211
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,335
That's why you said it feels good to say things like

1212
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,103
Kill them now

1213
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,895
It's because he's been holding back

1214
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:48,223
I'm openly expressing these violent fantasies for a long time it happened

1215
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,015
Couch that weird language

1216
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,807
Take them out politically or

1217
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,879
Rapping himself into a pretzel of a sentence trying to maintain

1218
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,183
Supplies Bowl deniability legal in Laughlin

1219
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,975
Yeah that's go in Laughlin

1220
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,791
Right but having to do those sort of things are kind of uncomfortable

1221
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:05,887
Super Bowl

1222
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,935
Redbarn Tri-Rail

1223
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:09,983
Trump is doing

1224
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,519
Ask you the purge hundred

1225
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,287
Globalist

1226
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,567
Centers in the government

1227
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,127
And Alex knows what comes along with that historic

1228
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,663
Targeted killing

1229
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:23,295
Trump is not firing all of Alex's imagine operating as if that were the case

1230
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,087
He's doing is creating a

1231
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,391
Pretext for in justification for Trump

1232
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,183
Taqueria political assassination

1233
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,487
Which would be the next logical step down this road

1234
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:37,887
Alex is even creating a rationale to ignore the very understandable backlash that would come from Trump doing something like

1235
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,959
I want to sing that the Democrats would freak out

1236
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
Naturally

1237
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
They would

1238
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,543
President were carrying out extra

1239
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,079
Judicial assassinations

1240
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,127
Alex Dupre framing

1241
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:51,455
I'm freaking out cuz they're supposed handlers are being taken out

1242
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:56,319
If Alex were specifically trying to prepare his audience to accept a dictator

1243
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,343
You could barely

1244
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,135
Ever do a better job than what he's doing

1245
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,159
Hi Tyson

1246
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,183
One of my biggest

1247
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:05,023
Problems here is that not only is he normalizing this language

1248
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,303
And this kind of

1249
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:09,887
But I can

1250
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,655
Can feel it

1251
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
Hitting me

1252
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,519
Like oh is this the level of conversation that were at

1253
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,543
Ivory Ella

1254
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,615
I know that's what I'm saying but I can feel that

1255
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,383
Desired

1256
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,151
Participate

1257
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,687
As as like

1258
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,271
That's our conversation now you know that might be you

1259
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,295
I don't mean that

1260
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,343
I don't mean that in a

1261
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:30,879
I'm just

1262
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,839
Because it's so far outside the realm acceptable that it

1263
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
States like a

1264
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,911
Exactly

1265
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,447
It's like the Overton window.

1266
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,727
Just got exploded in

1267
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
Guess what

1268
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
There's more

1269
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Lawyers

1270
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,479
The lawyers will lose this country for us real fast

1271
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,527
Warriors didn't start this country

1272
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,575
Warriors didn't win World War II

1273
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:04,927
When the War of 1812 they won't do anything but lose the country

1274
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,511
What

1275
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,303
8

1276
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:13,887
About it

1277
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,679
Tricom came here

1278
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,007
Overrun us and defeat us

1279
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,287
Instead they die

1280
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,103
Stop talking about that know your phone calls

1281
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:23,871
Okay

1282
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,431
A good I do recall it was Lawyers

1283
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,967
Specifically who allowed Canadians

1284
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,735
Bird on The Wire

1285
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:34,367
That was the lawyers sure they were like am sorry we passed a law just recently

1286
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,159
Everybody has to uphold the law

1287
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,439
The Canadians get to burn down

1288
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,511
Yeah so we

1289
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:47,935
That was that was bad chunk of this episode of murder Alex really wants Trump to

1290
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,983
Dole out some murder

1291
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:57,151
And

1292
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,199
They universally don't

1293
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,503
Some of my other point

1294
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,039
And one of them

1295
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,623
Bring some normally cause Alex to really freak out

1296
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,647
But weirdly doesn't

1297
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,183
I discovered you

1298
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:14,047
A shortwave radio and I've been listening to you

1299
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,911
That was back in the William Cooper days

1300
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,191
That's weird

1301
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:23,519
Cuz generally when a color brings up William Cooper Alex

1302
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
Gets mad at

1303
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:29,919
The Alex now refers to the shortwave.

1304
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,991
That's very weird to me

1305
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,039
I don't know what it means but I

1306
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:38,367
I always try and pull an anytime is name comes up

1307
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,951
I always take a take notice of it it's usually anger

1308
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:48,351
This case is like I'll William Cooper and everything from him and he was still alive salad

1309
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,143
Now I'm just stealing everything after is

1310
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,727
A caller wants to talk about the Coronavirus

1311
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,495
Which is

1312
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,799
Suspiciously much less important

1313
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:06,783
Seems like maybe the product is sold out and no need to scare people about that anymore

1314
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,879
Burner for when the supplies come back and I can build those merited

1315
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,927
Keep the plates spinning a little bit

1316
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,463
No need to freak everyone out

1317
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,999
By saying s*** like

1318
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:19,839
It's over for Humanity survivors

1319
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,631
So this caller wants

1320
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,167
Talk about it as a theory

1321
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,191
About what's going on

1322
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,471
I like to bring up

1323
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,543
Virus over there in China

1324
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,455
What's happening

1325
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
We are using.

1326
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,343
Can a matter of

1327
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,959
What do you think

1328
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,847
They were losing the fight with the Hong Kong and Taiwan he's Pro

1329
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
Protesters

1330
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,687
Chinese government lost its fight with Trump on the

1331
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,479
Gwar

1332
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,063
We know they're using it

1333
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,623
Protection around the block list and so

1334
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,439
So Alex's got this caller who suggest

1335
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:23,839
Is that the coronavirus is not real at all it's just a pretext it's being used to round up apolitical.

1336
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,423
What was a race specific bioweapon

1337
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,471
But now it's a false flag

1338
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,263
What is happening don't even worry about it

1339
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,847
Anyway Alex is Francis Boyle coming back on the show

1340
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,383
And

1341
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,431
It's interesting to me about this

1342
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
Like

1343
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:45,087
This interview is completely set up based on a lie

1344
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,367
The next hour

1345
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,671
We got Francis boil popping in

1346
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,231
Talk about how you called Friday for Trump

1347
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,023
Maybe a bioweapon

1348
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,887
Later and now the Chinese have Asperger's respond to such all coming up

1349
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,911
This is a lie

1350
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,191
Isn't he talking about

1351
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,215
Cotton

1352
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
Didn't

1353
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:07,103
Tom Cotton Senator Senator lunatic Tom Cotton come out and say that it's

1354
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,383
Bioweapon or something

1355
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,151
No he's

1356
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,687
Tom Cotton speech

1357
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:15,039
I'm not sure if you said it was a man-made thing but he speaks the cotton gave

1358
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,087
Alex has played has to do with

1359
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:20,927
It not coming from the seafood market and not being

1360
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,463
Specifically known

1361
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,511
What is completely lying about the Francis

1362
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
Spoil things

1363
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,559
Announce

1364
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
Meant from

1365
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
Trump science

1366
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,911
This guy was the day before

1367
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:34,495
Does boiled interview on Infowars

1368
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,775
In order to make it be like

1369
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,799
Trump is listening

1370
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:39,359
Infowars

1371
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,639
We made that happen

1372
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,967
A boil to not push back on that is

1373
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,991
Deeply f*****

1374
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,295
He has an interview coming up

1375
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,087
Alex comes back

1376
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,647
In the break it was some music

1377
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,439
This is kind of fun

1378
01:02:55,743 --> 01:03:01,887
Democrat

1379
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,911
What

1380
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:09,311
Democrat

1381
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:15,711
Don't know much right

1382
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:22,111
Little Wonder Who pedophile

1383
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:33,119
It didn't work out. It's really funny that you love the devil part that's great

1384
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,655
Imallexx karaoke

1385
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:38,495
But I think that was really funny is along the way is like

1386
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,287
I don't know much about history

1387
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,919
When it gets to the French I took don't know what's with the French I took he doesn't know where to go with that

1388
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,455
Hulu

1389
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,527
French

1390
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,367
Throw for a curved without one

1391
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,927
Yeah

1392
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:03,071
50 people with going

1393
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:06,655
The French are weak and they love them

1394
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:10,495
He's trapped by the lyrics to this song Because all the Democrats have to

1395
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,031
Right

1396
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:18,943
So we get into another new coronavirus conspiracy thing going on here at the behest of another caller

1397
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,223
And this

1398
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,759
This one hasn't come up yet

1399
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,783
But it's really

1400
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:26,111
Future Healthline how flu and HIV meds mail

1401
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,135
The Coronavirus

1402
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,207
How

1403
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,255
How the HIV medication Cipro

1404
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,839
Virus or whatever you want to call

1405
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:44,543
Donut delivery system

1406
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:49,919
This is one of the coronavirus conspiracy

1407
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,991
Basic ideas that some medications that are used

1408
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:58,879
To treat HIV are also being used three cases of coronavirus in thought they must be the same conditioner

1409
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,927
Coronavirus has parts of HIV mix

1410
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,695
Intuit

1411
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,231
This is a really sloppy

1412
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:07,071
Conspiracy and pretty easy to explain why medications are used to treat person

1413
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,863
Stage IV would also have application

1414
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
In this context

1415
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,935
Sounds like they don't know much about biology

1416
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,495
That seems I haven't give it a crack

1417
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:19,871
One big issues here is that the list of FDA approved antiviral drugs is not a long list

1418
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,919
And a lot of the ones that do exist

1419
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,967
Sister used as part of normal treatment plans for

1420
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
For people with HIV

1421
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:28,575
When a new virus pops up oftentimes doctors will try these

1422
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,855
Existing antiviral

1423
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:30,879
You play work

1424
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,719
And this will ultimately always be someone that you could claim his quote

1425
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,767
Treating a new virus with HIV

1426
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,327
Antivirals

1427
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,863
Jubilee be called HIV map

1428
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:46,239
The issue here is that these drugs will not likely be effective in the treatment of Coronavirus

1429
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,519
The issue is that

1430
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,823
The heightened Panic surrounding

1431
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,591
Sing the virus

1432
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:57,247
There's a real fear that the demand for the antiviral drugs will increase to the point where people with HIV could have a more difficult time

1433
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,527
Getting there Matt Wright

1434
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,855
The concern is that there are people pushing misinformation

1435
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:06,719
Like a these antivirals are a cure or solid preventive measure against the Coronavirus

1436
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:11,327
People would take that misinformation and rush out to buy out the antiviral meds

1437
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:15,423
Would you leave the supply not able to meet the demand of people who actually need them

1438
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,471
The actual picture of the situation

1439
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,239
Pretty complex

1440
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,031
There's some doctors who are

1441
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,823
Experimenting with using medication

1442
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,151
Things that are used to manage HIV with patients of other Coronavirus

1443
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:28,223
But that absolutely doesn't mean that there a treatment for the virus

1444
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,783
Nor is it proof that there's some sort of Coronavirus

1445
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,551
Virus

1446
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,575
Conspiracy going on

1447
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,415
Coronavirus.

1448
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,695
Can't make it work

1449
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,863
It's at WeChat

1450
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,399
So Alex

1451
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,679
Gets to this interview with France

1452
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:52,799
Boil and he once again repeat that timeline lie in the introduction which again

1453
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
I have to stress

1454
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:54,847
You can't

1455
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,895
If your friends but you can't allow yourself to

1456
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,663
Be presented like

1457
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
It's disqualified

1458
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,039
Alright joined us last week

1459
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,623
Bio weapon

1460
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:10,207
And we bad one Trump's spokespersons come out

1461
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,767
The same thing it's a few hours later

1462
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,655
Oil-rubbed the u.s. biological weapons

1463
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,751
A convention to then got adopted the most of it by the United Nations

1464
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:26,335
So everything is wrong about that timeline in the intro

1465
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,871
Like we pointed out a hundred times

1466
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,919
The interview that he did

1467
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
I was

1468
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,455
After

1469
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:34,527
Trump science guy came out and made that statement

1470
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,319
But the other problem

1471
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,087
Timelines

1472
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:40,159
Where is it at

1473
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:43,487
Zach was adopted into the UN biological weapons

1474
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,511
Convention

1475
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,535
But that's backward

1476
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,351
The UN version was adopted on March 6th

1477
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,887
1975

1478
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,423
Biological weapons

1479
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:56,031
Anti-terrorism Act was adopted by the United States on May 22nd 1990

1480
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,567
The US version was built

1481
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,847
From the UN version

1482
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,127
Not the other way around

1483
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,663
Want that to be

1484
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
Be the appearance

1485
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,735
If Alex allows reality take

1486
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:10,623
Existing one who took international law and applied it to our own Sovereign Nation

1487
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:14,207
Which is globalism in the very definition of evil according to Alex

1488
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,255
Absolutely if it's the other way around

1489
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,791
The boil wrote the law was

1490
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,815
Do you and then adopt

1491
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:25,215
Pretend that it's just good Americana that they ended up forcing the UN to enact if it weren't for us

1492
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,495
The UN never would have

1493
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,519
Done it.

1494
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,543
So there's a hero

1495
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,847
These are the little things that most people probably would

1496
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:35,199
See and think about the stupid or has no idea what he's talking about and I agree

1497
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,991
He is stupid and he doesn't know what he's talking about

1498
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,807
It's important to understand that there are reasons

1499
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,855
What do you mix glaring errors like this

1500
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:42,623
Consistently

1501
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:46,207
If Alex is Boyle's Law became you once

1502
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,231
I probably wouldn't

1503
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
Think twice about it

1504
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,303
I just ate was a slip-up or he's being stupid

1505
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:56,447
Alex says that all the time and the reason is to cover up for the fact that boy was in favor of international law

1506
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,727
And by Alex's rubrik

1507
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
He's a global

1508
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,775
Rye Rye

1509
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,055
He's as bad

1510
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:01,823
Except for when

1511
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:02,847
Brightwin

1512
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,615
He's good he's on my

1513
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,991
Timeline issue though with the interview and Trump spoke

1514
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,783
Hangout is murky

1515
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,575
Because if you'll recall

1516
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,367
Alex didn't read the article

1517
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,391
The about Trump spokes

1518
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,743
One of the people who gave comment for that article Anthony fauci

1519
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,535
And decided that he's trumps

1520
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,607
Top science advisor

1521
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,143
This thing's man-made

1522
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,167
He's a hero

1523
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,447
Unfortunately

1524
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,727
Francis Boyle

1525
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,519
Has news about Anthony fauci

1526
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,919
How to is eyeballs in this Nazi biowarfare work

1527
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,455
Years

1528
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,735
Same is true

1529
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,503
For the

1530
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,551
Center for Disease Control

1531
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:49,951
So now I do Alex's big special special expert

1532
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:55,327
Me beeping Nazis as project right so I imagine Alex

1533
01:09:55,583 --> 01:10:01,727
It's going to he's going to immediately agree with him and then scrub the article from Infowars

1534
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:06,079
It's a difficult position this puts Alex in because

1535
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:10,175
The whole narrative was that Anthony fauci is Heroes coming out

1536
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:14,783
Prompted by Francis boils interview on Infowars that Trump hurt and he forced

1537
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,575
Anthony fauci to come out in

1538
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:18,111
And blow the alarm

1539
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,391
All this

1540
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:22,719
Tries to save this a little bit but I don't think he does it well

1541
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:25,535
Without me asking the questions you're the expert

1542
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:35,519
The Indian Institute saying it looks man-made showing words clearly been gene-edited

1543
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:39,359
He's good or not

1544
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:45,503
There are responding and incomes come out again and now the Chinese ambassador

1545
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:52,159
No big deal with without cheese and Nazi scientist or whatever

1546
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,975
Leave that aside

1547
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:58,559
That's that's real weird s***

1548
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:03,679
He's doing now Shores another bar illogical science but you know what

1549
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
Even the blind

1550
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:09,311
Squirrel find the occasional lie Nazi project have you done for me lately

1551
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,335
So

1552
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,383
Francis Boyle has nothing really

1553
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,919
To offer that's a really boring it

1554
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,687
Interview

1555
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,991
Until when I can listen anymore of it

1556
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,783
Alex gets back to

1557
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,807
Murder

1558
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,111
Why doesn't he utilized a black eye

1559
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:23,903
Daenerys

1560
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,303
City of them but

1561
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:34,143
We're entering a wheelhouse now or the Deep State confront overthrowing where

1562
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,423
He won't have a choice

1563
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,447
Wish

1564
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:40,031
Happy about this but it is what it is

1565
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:43,103
They're bringing us to a place

1566
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,943
Once we get there that make sense

1567
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,759
Yeah totally not our fault when we

1568
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,551
Politically sexy people

1569
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575
We did

1570
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:59,231
You are you guys are going to murder for a long time now you don't get to say it

1571
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:04,095
Just stop it don't believe it on us you want to people you disagree with

1572
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,375
Say it

1573
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,911
Can't because they

1574
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,495
Even Alex knows that that isn't appropriate

1575
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,543
This leaves Alex

1576
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,079
Listing people that Trump needs

1577
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,407
Yasso Alex you were talkin about

1578
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,943
I'm sorry the caller

1579
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,479
Credit

1580
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:24,063
For the guys we got to get out of there was Zorro's

1581
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:25,855
Brennan

1582
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,791
DC

1583
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,607
We just got to go out for the snake and I'm not saying we're going to do it

1584
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,423
Trump

1585
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,471
Needs to cut the head off the snake

1586
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,751
Says caller list

1587
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,055
Like specific people the Trump riots

1588
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,847
Skill and Alex says

1589
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:49,151
He doesn't like Obama's work with

1590
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,967
Netflix

1591
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,503
Is about

1592
01:12:55,039 --> 01:13:01,183
One last clip here from February 12th and that Alex is like getting into this weird headspace about like they've come at me

1593
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,231
They've come at me

1594
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:07,839
He's already been in this like I didn't need to murder all these people

1595
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,863
Slightly adjust

1596
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,655
Navigation like I've been wrong

1597
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,935
And it's just such a

1598
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
9 months ago

1599
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,543
Department of Justice

1600
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,823
Under these people

1601
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,383
My dad

1602
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,431
Because some Bookkeeping on the prod

1603
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
Development

1604
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,735
They knew I love my dad

1605
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,015
What else

1606
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,647
You ready to go to prison the Asia I'm ready I got to get we're not backing down

1607
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:36,255
Anyway

1608
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,559
He's an old man he's ready to go

1609
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,887
I said you can literally

1610
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:46,495
Crazy actually put the behind-the-scenes

1611
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,519
They realize that

1612
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,287
I don't care about me

1613
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,871
My dad and my dad was like

1614
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,151
Destroy me

1615
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,455
Totally made out there like

1616
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,223
Your father

1617
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:02,623
The level of the scum you cannot even imagine

1618
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:07,231
So there's a good reason to be able to run the Department of Justice might of making inquiries to Alex

1619
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:12,863
Rodger stone is on trial and he was an employee

1620
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:18,751
As much as Alex wants to say his dad barely involved in the company on many occasions Alex's dad David

1621
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,287
Has been presented as the head of

1622
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,823
HR human resources

1623
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:24,639
I didn't forward parent company Free Speech system

1624
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,199
When Alex was facing EEOC can

1625
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:29,759
Complaints from Ashley Beckford and Rob Jacobson

1626
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:34,367
David Jones was the Human Resources Director that he fielded media requests

1627
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:38,207
In other news stories he's been given that title and by all appearances

1628
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:42,303
He's the person who's in charge of Staffing employee related issues for the company

1629
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,863
On December 18th 2018

1630
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,887
Alex's dad was

1631
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:48,191
Deposed in the Pepe the Frog

1632
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,727
But what's this

1633
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,519
He wasn't supposed

1634
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,287
Himself

1635
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:55,359
He was the corporate representative of speech system

1636
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,895
Which led to this Exchange

1637
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:59,199
Would you want to wet back and read the deposition

1638
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,479
I read it a while back

1639
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:04,575
But now after the Rob do deposition this is particularly funny

1640
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,111
Thought it was question

1641
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:06,879
Lawyer

1642
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,951
You understand you've been designated as a corporate representative

1643
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,975
Free Speech systems

1644
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
Today's deposition

1645
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,511
Incorrect

1646
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,279
Response

1647
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,327
Who designated me that

1648
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:21,215
I suppose I was advised by email sometime ago they're going to have a corporate designate

1649
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:24,287
And I had agreed at the time that I'd be willing if it was prudent

1650
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,311
Question

1651
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,079
Okay

1652
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:30,431
Did anyone advise you that you were in fact going to be the corporate desert

1653
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,967
Take me for free speech systems

1654
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
Answer

1655
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:37,087
I think I was advised but I didn't really realize the full impact of that but

1656
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:37,855
Yes

1657
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,671
The pattern for Alex in his lawsuit

1658
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:46,047
Just making someone he thinks he can trust me the corporate representative for his company and having them going to the deposition

1659
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,583
Completely unprepared and

1660
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,863
In Stonewall

1661
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,167
He did that with Rob do in the Sandy Hook

1662
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,447
And he did with his home

1663
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,983
F****** father in this case

1664
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,287
It's very clear strategy

1665
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,823
Alex and his lawyers employed

1666
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,615
The derailment slowdown trials

1667
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:01,151
That they know they're going to lose

1668
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:07,551
And man it's just wild to read that transcript of the 2018 deposition and realize that altitude willing to put his dad

1669
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,111
In the position of being a pain in that kind of a game

1670
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,647
He's a real piece of s***

1671
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:16,511
They know I don't care about myself so they went after my dad surprise

1672
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:22,911
I don't care about him either

1673
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:27,519
The globalist and I were trying to take out Alex's dad

1674
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:33,407
Alex made him the head of enforce Human Resources so we can have a person who trusts in that position

1675
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:36,223
And their consequences to moves like that

1676
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,015
Coincidence with one of your employees

1677
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,295
Facing federal charges

1678
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,623
Maybe a thing where you're getting a message from the prosecutor

1679
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:47,487
Or I don't know let's say another one of your former employees let's just call him Jerome corsi

1680
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,511
She tries to sue you

1681
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,535
It is contention

1682
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:53,375
Isaiah he was wrongly terminated as part of this part of the discussion

1683
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,399
It might have been dubbed

1684
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
Getting your head of Human Resources

1685
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:59,007
In this case your father involved in that legal matter

1686
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,055
This is a narcissist operator

1687
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,359
When they're facing the consequences of their own action

1688
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:08,479
They're not able to accept them on realities terms so the consequences themselves become a part of a larger

1689
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:12,575
Thereby allowing Alex to maintain and even expand his own victim

1690
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:18,719
Alex's dad in his capacity as the enforcer HR director gets contacted by prosecutors of lawyers

1691
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:22,047
About legal issues related to former Infowars employer

1692
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:22,815
Employee

1693
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,375
That is completely normal and if

1694
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,655
Predictable thing to have happen

1695
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,447
But Alex has become

1696
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:32,287
Globalist tried investigating takeout in poor innocent completely uninvolved father

1697
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,335
Any Target your loved one

1698
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,895
This is really sad levels of Alex

1699
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,687
Acting out his own issues on his audience

1700
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:40,735
It's wild thing cuz dad hasn't check

1701
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,015
Check the stuff by this point

1702
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,039
This allows it to

1703
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,319
Continue

1704
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,367
Must be a lot of money

1705
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:49,695
Dad must be way

1706
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,231
Crazier on the John Birch

1707
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:51,999
Step then

1708
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,535
Yeah

1709
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,351
It's very plausible that like he is

1710
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,399
It's far more of a zealot than we know cuz

1711
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,703
We keep such a low profile

1712
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,727
Come on Alex's show

1713
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,543
Version of that

1714
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:09,919
Yeah yeah I mean obviously if you're the head of HR there's a tacit endorse

1715
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,711
Whatever it is

1716
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,503
Alex says

1717
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:16,575
I mean if you don't get becomes murky whenever it's like

1718
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:20,415
Your family and maybe didn't want to be a dentist anymore whatever you know

1719
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,183
Nose

1720
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:24,255
So we jump to the 13th and Alex's feeling real good

1721
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,047
About to Rogers chances

1722
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,583
And makes a little bit of a predict

1723
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
Sitting here out of the gate

1724
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,143
Massive outrage of

1725
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,471
Adjusting you at the world no one is buying

1726
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,519
This miscarriage of justice and

1727
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,287
I predict

1728
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,823
That way then

1729
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,359
2 weeks

1730
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:41,151
Rogers town will be back

1731
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,967
Co-hosting this broadcast and the War Room

1732
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,807
And thus the silencing of this American patriot who was pain

1733
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,623
Trump

1734
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,159
Getting president

1735
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:54,463
Want to run for office making President Trump

1736
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,231
Believe

1737
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,255
Goodwin

1738
01:18:56,511 --> 01:19:00,607
President Trump would not be president if it wasn't for Rodger Stone

1739
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,935
Dangerous mentality that Alex's expressing

1740
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:09,311
Because at its core what it does is it makes it so anyone on your team can commit any crime they want

1741
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:12,895
When Alex says that Rodger is being prosecuted cuz he helped Trump get elected

1742
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,687
One level what you saying is

1743
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
True

1744
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,735
But on a deeper level

1745
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,527
It's also very not true

1746
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,135
The issue was that Rodger is not being prosecuted for

1747
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:28,255
He's going to prison for actual crimes he committed and was found guilty by a jury for

1748
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:32,863
I've never actually even heard Alex discuss the real charges that Rodger was convicted

1749
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:36,447
Not once have I heard Alex discuss be very clear open

1750
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,215
Shut Witness

1751
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:37,983
Intimidation

1752
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,031
The Rodger engaged in with Randy credico

1753
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:43,103
He never talks about the reality of the charges because

1754
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:46,431
The reality Rogers actions has been replaced with a facade

1755
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:52,319
Which can be easily summed up his it doesn't matter what the charges are because he didn't do it and even if he did they're only charging

1756
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,343
Sports Trump

1757
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,647
No matter what you do if you're on the

1758
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,671
Team 1000

1759
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,463
I've heard that

1760
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,999
The ends justify the means

1761
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:07,423
Can't think of any possible morality that would contradict that it's important to understand this dynamic

1762
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
Because

1763
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,239
It's the way Alex needs

1764
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,519
Present this person

1765
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,543
They have to be a

1766
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,311
Pure hero

1767
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,616
So whatever the reality of this

1768
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,384
Stuffed it is

1769
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,408
Actually happening

1770
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,432
Don't even talk about

1771
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,992
Alex knows what charges

1772
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,016
Roger's been convicted

1773
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:24,320
No

1774
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,088
Jury

1775
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,368
Found him guilty

1776
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,904
But he knows all these things

1777
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,720
Discuss any of that

1778
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,512
Because he's a good guy

1779
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,536
He's on the T

1780
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,560
This is important

1781
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,096
I need to make a point of this

1782
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,144
Is is relevant later

1783
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:38,912
Always

1784
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,680
I just can't

1785
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,704
Can't believe that he

1786
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
He still has

1787
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,264
Figured out that Rodger stone is

1788
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,056
Greatly contributed to ruining his

1789
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,408
It's insane how

1790
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:52,480
Severe you can't possibly want Rogers

1791
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,528
Just don't back he ruins your f******

1792
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,296
Lifemap

1793
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,088
Yeah but if you ruined his life maybe he

1794
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:59,904
We can save the ship

1795
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,208
Care about you

1796
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,488
Alex

1797
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:06,304
Trump's going to Pardon Rodger and that's cool

1798
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,096
Currently

1799
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,888
Arrington

1800
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:10,656
Arden

1801
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,960
Rodger Stone

1802
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,616
Function of Justice

1803
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,920
That's why you have an executive branch

1804
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,992
Co-equal to the legislative and the judicial

1805
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,624
Right bicep

1806
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,904
Separation of powers

1807
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:35,232
And it's part of our federal system

1808
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:39,072
I apologize it's just good old-fashioned separation of powers stock

1809
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,936
It's not separation of powers on the executive branch intervenes to overrule the

1810
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,472
Judicial Watch

1811
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,520
Specifically related to the criminal Affairs of

1812
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,056
Zippy head of the Executive Branch

1813
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,128
What else is describing as how a normal pardon my

1814
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,408
But in this case

1815
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,200
Trump would be absolutely out of line

1816
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:58,784
Departing Rodger given that his conviction Again by a jury

1817
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,112
Was it related to impeding the investigation into the criminal Affairs of

1818
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,184
Pardoning Rodger would be more less just Trump

1819
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,512
ABCmouse sending out a very overt message that if you commit crimes to

1820
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,792
Protect his crimes

1821
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,584
He's got your back and you won't do any time

1822
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:12,864
The

1823
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:13,888
Anaprox

1824
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:17,728
And I suspect that's why I again they're going with the bill Barr route first

1825
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,264
I need to be a protector

1826
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,056
For this really feels like

1827
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:24,896
Has eroded is our system is now it still seems like that would be a breach

1828
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:25,664
Norms

1829
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:30,784
By using a presidential pardon to get your friend who's in prison for lying to peden investigation into your actions

1830
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,320
It seems like even

1831
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:35,136
As bad as things are now that's still too on the nose

1832
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:38,976
Probably right but

1833
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:43,328
Is it is getting really frustrating that nobody in the media is willing to

1834
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,680
Point out that the big reason Trump is getting away with all of this s*** is

1835
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:50,752
Because we're all kind of afraid that if we hold them accountable

1836
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,520
His supporters

1837
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,288
Will start murder

1838
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:57,664
That is kind of a big deal that is unspoken

1839
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,224
I don't know if he will but there's the

1840
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,064
Fear of it I don't know if that's motivating

1841
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:04,832
As much

1842
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:05,856
Izzy's

1843
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,928
Remind me it might be a piece of it for some

1844
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,512
Folks but I don't know I don't know how widespread that is

1845
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,792
As a motivating factor

1846
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,072
For the people in the meat

1847
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:21,472
I don't know it could be I think I would prefer that to the admission that

1848
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:25,056
Both the Democratic party and the media are

1849
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,848
Essentially useless and pointless

1850
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,128
Ascend

1851
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:29,920
Really wished

1852
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,200
But that word wasn't true

1853
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:33,760
What type of beer is like Obsession of

1854
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,808
Appearing neutral

1855
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,088
Do you have to take

1856
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,368
The Democrats love battle

1857
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,648
It was appearing

1858
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:43,232
Hey Irene you have to present climate change denial is

1859
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:47,584
Exact absolute mentality does

1860
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,864
MP people

1861
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,680
2 in expanded probably more than a fear of

1862
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,216
Trump supporters murdering people

1863
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,240
Maybe

1864
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,520
Anyway

1865
01:23:56,032 --> 01:24:00,640
Alex has decided that tell you probably going to maybe I don't know possibly go to sleep

1866
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,664
C-pack to Kazu

1867
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,688
Publicity stunt

1868
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,224
A complaint about seat

1869
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,248
A little bit here

1870
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,040
A new obsession

1871
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,576
You talked about it a bit on

1872
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,880
On this episode like how much he doesn't like seapak

1873
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,160
How they're all cowards

1874
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,488
NOC

1875
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:17,024
C-pack so cowardly

1876
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,912
People like Rodger Stone

1877
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,448
Aren't even welcomed there

1878
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,008
Actually got Trump elected

1879
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,056
Trump's up against

1880
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,456
I don't need to do that so I'm

1881
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,504
But

1882
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,552
Really thinking about it

1883
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,320
Okay

1884
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,672
Jordan the notoriously restrained and cowardly seapak

1885
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:51,072
Who could forget how cookie cutter and safe there a speaker list wasn't 2019 but they had Sebastian

1886
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,608
Diamond and silk

1887
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,400
Candace Owens Charlie Kirk

1888
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,960
Going back to Dennis Prager and Oaks

1889
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:02,592
Donald Trump speakers of maybe two or three people on that list

1890
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,616
To have an outright

1891
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:10,784
C-pack is not afraid that complete yet heads in Convent is speakers they just don't want 1/2 or bad for the brand

1892
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,832
That's why they disinvited Milo

1893
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:16,416
After people started talking about those Pro pedophilia comments he's made in the past

1894
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:20,000
That's why they disinvited gatewaypundits Jim hoft

1895
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,536
After he started spreading cancer

1896
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,560
Theories about

1897
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,584
Survivors of the park

1898
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,352
Oakland shooting

1899
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:27,168
That's why they didn't let Laura Loomer and Jacob Wohl

1900
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:31,008
They don't care if you're lying s*** head just so long as you're not too embarrassing

1901
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,824
At this point Alex and Rodger are really embarrassed

1902
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:38,176
Also c-pack might not want invite Rodger because in 2018

1903
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:42,528
He was involved in the first year of a rifle conservative conference called the American

1904
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,296
Priority

1905
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,600
Which was trying to Brand itself as the

1906
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,624
Bcpac for Trump

1907
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,416
That conference

1908
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,208
Probably going to that lose altitude

1909
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,232
Hotel in

1910
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,024
Involve the whole lot of s*** head saying dump

1911
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,048
Conspiracy stop in

1912
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,072
Selling idiots knick-knack

1913
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,424
Think of any problems there

1914
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,448
Priority conference

1915
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:03,520
2018 overhead speakers like Stephon

1916
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:07,104
Mike cernovich

1917
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,176
Whose speech apparently was mostly about how qanon is real

1918
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,480
This is the lane that Rodger belong

1919
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,784
And even f****** c-pack understand

1920
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:18,112
They are afraid to have him come speak it's just that he's an embarrassing

1921
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:21,952
Criminal

1922
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:26,304
Stefan molyneux we prefer other embarrassing criminal assholes

1923
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:31,936
The funniest thing here though is that Alex probably wouldn't even be invited to speak American priority conference

1924
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:34,496
To toxic

1925
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,032
For the junior varsity

1926
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,592
Super toxic Brands welcome version of

1927
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,360
C-pack

1928
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,896
And that's a good call on their part

1929
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,432
You can't invite Alex

1930
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:44,480
Because that he would make your event all about him

1931
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:47,040
He's so desperate at this point that he could be

1932
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:50,880
Completely welcome somewhere and eat still show up in a tank with a bullhorn

1933
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,416
Acting like he's breaking in

1934
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,744
Focus 2.0

1935
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,536
Just calm down dick

1936
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,840
Whatever benefit or game there

1937
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,120
Could be from having a lie

1938
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:01,888
Anywhere

1939
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,448
Far outweighed by having Alex

1940
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,472
Yep

1941
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:07,264
At this point Alex

1942
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,872
Like it's actually a little bit refreshing in some ways even though what he does is terrible

1943
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,640
An awful

1944
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,408
But like

1945
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,200
We've been so starved

1946
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,736
Different

1947
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:19,552
Contact because of obsession about the Coronavirus

1948
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,088
And now like it

1949
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:25,696
Take out the Rogers stuff really taken over and the doj and Trump pardoning

1950
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:32,352
Which leads into the murderer Obsession on the last episode of regret wishing for a change from the Coronavirus

1951
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:35,424
Stuff if the change is

1952
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,448
I do

1953
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:42,336
I do regret feeling a little a little desire that seems like it's been a long time since they're just been like

1954
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,360
Straight headlight

1955
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,432
Yeah

1956
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,200
Teachable

1957
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,504
Yesterday where to

1958
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:52,064
Somali migrants

1959
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:56,416
Went on a spree robbing stabbing attacking

1960
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,744
What you got to give it up

1961
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,536
Afraid

1962
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,864
It's a religious virtue signal

1963
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,912
Can you show yourself

1964
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:11,776
Why are they doing that it's a plan to bring down the civilization

1965
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,568
I think this is a perfect

1966
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,872
Example of how bad Alex is at his job

1967
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,152
Like what is he talking about

1968
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:23,040
No clue you hear him telling story about some Somali immigrants who went on a spree of crimes but would like go cuz

1969
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,600
You know the left isn't the letting non-white people get away with

1970
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:28,416
Crime supposed to bring about the end of civilization

1971
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,952
That's what I would you know

1972
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:30,976
Always.

1973
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,768
But when you take a step back

1974
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,816
What do you know about the underlying story that

1975
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:39,168
Based on the details Alex provides we don't know anything about this

1976
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:39,936
I don't know where they're at

1977
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,472
Country it took

1978
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,240
Play snoke

1979
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,288
This isn't covering a story this is

1980
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:46,592
Gossiping about a headline he might have skin

1981
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:52,224
Or more likely it's just now it's making up a story in order to justify him going into a xenophobic

1982
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,808
Which is what he was going to do whether or not I had a story to base it on a 90

1983
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,856
Why are you even pretending

1984
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:02,720
You can't track down this story based on the details Alex provides and that's intense

1985
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:07,328
He doesn't want to portray reality or help his listeners come to a better understanding of the world

1986
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,608
He wants to reinforce an

1987
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,888
And Harden Their Fear of the laugh

1988
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,168
And people who don't look like

1989
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:16,032
I decided to see if I could place down the story that Alex is covering you know for fun

1990
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,080
Infowars website with no help

1991
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,872
There wasn't any story like

1992
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,664
It's on there so I started Google

1993
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:24,992
I just like that

1994
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:31,392
Infowars website with no help

1995
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,928
Story that matched some keywords

1996
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,232
From February 2nd 2020

1997
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,560
Judge refuses to vacate Somali pirates

1998
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:40,608
Got to give it up to

1999
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,888
This was a story from the

2000
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:47,520
The Elko Daily Free Press covering a federal judge's ruling in Virginia that is Somali pirate could not have a sentence

2001
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,288
Thrown out

2002
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:52,128
What you were seeking because he claimed that his lawyer was ineffective in the underlying trial

2003
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,664
The judge said nope

2004
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:57,504
And that's Molly man still in prison and they let him go free that way what

2005
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,808
So that's kind of the opposite of the story that Alex

2006
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:03,648
You think it based on the narrative that Alex is selling aspire to be

2007
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,672
Exactly the sort of person

2008
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,208
The federal judge would release

2009
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:08,000
Is a perfect religious virtue

2010
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,024
Two signals sacrifice

2011
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,072
It looks like the reality is the opposite of

2012
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:11,840
Miss queso

2013
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,120
I kept looking

2014
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,400
And there's only one

2015
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,168
Somali pirate

2016
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:17,472
I believe I don't know I just kept looking

2017
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,008
I couldn't find any evidence

2018
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:21,056
Do judges releasing any Somali immigrants

2019
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:25,152
A stabbing so I started searching for Smalley and spree

2020
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:30,016
There was one story from September 2019 out of Minneapolis

2021
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:32,320
But this wasn't about a Somali immigrant going on

2022
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,344
Stabbing spree

2023
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,440
A guy named Harlan St John getting arrested for going on a vandalism

2024
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:40,768
Free smashing out the windows of Somali owned businesses

2025
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:41,792
Because

2026
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,328
He told the police quote

2027
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,376
Somali people are selling meth and heroin

2028
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,144
Native people

2029
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,192
That's not the case Alex

2030
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:48,960
To talkin about

2031
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,752
I also don't think that guy

2032
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,312
No

2033
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,080
Think he was

2034
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,872
I think he was talking about a different

2035
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,896
Yes quote

2036
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:02,016
I want to be cute about this but honestly I have no idea what story Alex is talking

2037
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,808
About and that's kind of my main point

2038
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,344
If I someone who's

2039
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,184
Actively trying to figure out what story out to talk about having no idea

2040
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:14,560
People who just passively listening have no clue what's going on and what's real and what Alex is just making up

2041
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,608
When people in positions like Alex

2042
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,376
Are vague

2043
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,912
Because they're making things up

2044
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:25,568
If Alex really had a case of a small lease priest Abaddon free because it was religious sacrament of virtue signaling for the laugh

2045
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,104
LaFollette immigrants commit crimes

2046
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,432
To probably be in his interest to actually cover the details of the

2047
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:36,320
Go over there what's the name of the stabber the alleged stabber what's the name of the judge what's the

2048
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,112
What country did it happen in

2049
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:38,880
What are the circle

2050
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:39,648
Status of the case

2051
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:42,208
You didn't do any of that cuz he's not covering the news

2052
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,744
He's creating a Feeling

2053
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,024
Stealing is supposed to be

2054
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,304
Purity Auntie left

2055
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,840
An auntie non-whites

2056
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:51,424
Details just get in the way of that could really mess things up

2057
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,728
The truth there's

2058
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,264
Is a lot of nuance and

2059
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,104
Contacts that goes into it and that really makes it hard to

2060
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,384
8

2061
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,408
You know you have to

2062
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:03,200
Wade through all the stuff in the year

2063
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:05,504
Tired at the end of it

2064
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,552
Computer screens or

2065
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,600
Maybe just hate

2066
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,880
Hey kids

2067
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:12,416
Because another headline

2068
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:15,488
North Korea shoots coronavirus patient after

2069
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,768
Be seen at public

2070
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,632
This is a race specific

2071
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,424
Bioweapon it is man-made

2072
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:26,496
That's why governments are freaking out

2073
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:32,640
This is mutating and it's very very serious and I love you

2074
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:34,944
Show me the day before Alex got a call from

2075
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,528
Some guy was saying that the virus is just a cover-up to round up people were protesting against

2076
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,576
The Chinese government

2077
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,112
It's not a race specific

2078
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:42,880
I got released

2079
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,904
Now it's agreed with

2080
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,208
I'm slightly at all.

2081
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:51,328
With each other specific

2082
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,120
He has no consistency

2083
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:55,424
Cages by Design This is so much

2084
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,008
Andy Daly as l.ron Hubbard

2085
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,848
Ted office podcast look like

2086
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:04,384
I said it's

2087
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,480
I listen to the show all the time and honestly I don't even think that I could

2088
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,272
Could tell you what the show's position is

2089
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:12,576
On the coronavirus I really don't know

2090
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:16,160
I think he's rooting for the Coronavirus

2091
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,184
Coronavirus

2092
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,488
Some days it's a race specific bioweapon

2093
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:23,584
Some days the bioweapon China wanted to use on us that got loose accidentally

2094
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,912
Sometimes it's all a cover for something completely unrelated to Public Health

2095
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,216
Sometimes it's not even real

2096
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,752
Makes nose

2097
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,288
It's abusive to his lesson

2098
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,128
Like this day today what up

2099
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,920
He's not saying anything

2100
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:38,688
But he's also

2101
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,480
Suggesting a whole lot of stuff

2102
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:44,832
The presentation that he is saying these things and that's not cool

2103
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,160
Also that story about the North Korean official may or may not be true

2104
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:51,488
It was from the South Korean source

2105
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,280
Information about it I'm not entirely sure

2106
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:55,840
I have no idea if it's true and neither does Alex

2107
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,888
This is reading a headline inserting it a

2108
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,656
Is back.

2109
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,192
Details of the story

2110
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:02,240
Just kind of irresponsible

2111
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:05,568
Alex is another color

2112
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,640
And the virus is now

2113
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:15,552
Maybe not afraid specifically was like this immediately after

2114
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,952
Only people who have died

2115
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,048
Where in China

2116
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,096
When they got the disease

2117
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,424
I don't even think it was

2118
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,216
Something else is killing them

2119
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,824
You know what I mean

2120
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,152
Kill some people but there's no doubt

2121
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,712
Putting some fake videos out in China

2122
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,832
Cape Fear

2123
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:55,232
Where's the race specific part of North Korea and now you have this car

2124
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,024
Call who sang it wasn't

2125
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,304
The disease that killed them

2126
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:01,632
They're trying to crack down on you with you

2127
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:07,520
Of course of course this is so inherently incoherent it's just

2128
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:12,896
It's it's really believe whatever it is you believe I agree with you so long as you by my

2129
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:14,944
So Alex

2130
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,760
A little bit about The Purge

2131
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,576
The Trump is doing of people in the government which I still don't

2132
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:21,344
No

2133
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,112
Is accurate

2134
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:24,672
He's really trying to make this red storm thing

2135
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:25,696
At work

2136
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:28,512
What I do know is the red storm here

2137
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:31,072
Urging the traitors

2138
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:33,376
Accelerating in the attack and I love it

2139
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:38,752
Can you Jean man I love it

2140
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,336
And let loose the dogs of war

2141
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:47,456
So at this point I was really marveling at how desperately trying to make the red storm happen

2142
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:49,504
Was curious about what's going on here

2143
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,576
Obviously he's trying to evoke the storm

2144
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,600
Stunad

2145
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,392
Probably also the red

2146
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:57,952
Terror which of course is the. Of political terrorism

2147
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,744
Who preceded the Russian Civil War back in

2148
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,512
1918

2149
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,792
However

2150
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,584
I have a slight suspicion

2151
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,864
This might be a Steve pieczenik

2152
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,656
I base that on

2153
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,936
The interesting coincidence

2154
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,984
There's a Tom Clancy novel called

2155
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,264
Red Storm Rising

2156
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,056
A company that licenses

2157
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,336
Does Tom Clancy properties

2158
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,104
Video games

2159
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,640
Just called Red Storm

2160
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,664
Course

2161
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,712
Steven nothing to do with any of this

2162
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,248
The time

2163
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,272
But he's notoriously

2164
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:24,832
Real life Jack Ryan

2165
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,368
Need some so heavily with all things

2166
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,136
Clancy

2167
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:30,208
This is probably on my part of complete stretch

2168
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:33,024
I've no reason to believe this Theory even make sense

2169
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:37,888
But there's something super weird but I was incessantly drive to Brandis the Red Storm

2170
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:41,472
Which happens to be Charmed it's only really widely associated with a

2171
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,520
A former business partner of Steve pieczenik

2172
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:46,336
Most likely it's just Alex trying to Launch

2173
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,128
A phrase that he can put on some

2174
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:48,896
Shirts

2175
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:52,224
But you have to forgive me if my mind wanders sometimes I was a show-off in his

2176
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,040
Very bored I'm going to go with

2177
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:57,856
It is Steve pieczenik and also Steve

2178
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,648
Is Rasputin

2179
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,672
I'm going to say that

2180
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,720
100% positive you heard it here

2181
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:05,536
Irfu I never died

2182
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,328
Have you been to Korea bunch

2183
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,632
I just heard that this red storm stuff and I'm like

2184
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:10,656
What's the name of this song

2185
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,680
Plantation

2186
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,984
Steve Garvey looming in the background somewhere

2187
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,544
You have this whole thing with Rodger

2188
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,408
Department of Justice this is prime pieczenik stuff like

2189
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,944
He's coming

2190
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:27,552
I don't know I just wanted to know

2191
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:30,880
Red Storm would be

2192
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:31,648
Phrase

2193
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:38,560
Is related to see now I'm like putting yarn up on the wall

2194
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:40,096
You can hear Steve pieczenik

2195
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,632
Footsteps behind you

2196
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:48,032
He's always also

2197
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:50,336
Red Storm is also the nickname for the sports team

2198
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:52,128
St John's University

2199
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,664
So it's probably trademark

2200
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:59,296
And I really hope Alex tries to launch some Red Storm birds and then get sued.

2201
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,576
God

2202
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,112
More lawsuits

2203
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:05,440
So Alex takes call from a guy and

2204
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,208
This guy

2205
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:06,976
Is like a man

2206
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,024
The street

2207
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,072
Should support Trump more

2208
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,864
And the rationale is bad

2209
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:17,984
They are conservative Alex

2210
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,032
It's not

2211
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:22,336
Gay marriage they're not for

2212
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,272
People that are in these streets

2213
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:32,832
And I truly believe that they will get behind Trump

2214
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:33,600
Hundred percent

2215
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,328
Losing

2216
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,376
Troll of the plantations

2217
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:48,960
If I understand this caller's argument he seems to be saying that

2218
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:54,080
Street should be supporting Trump because they're all the dolls on the phone

2219
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:59,712
I don't know if that's a good argument when you're trying to present the idea that Trump is a uniting force

2220
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,248
Whatever

2221
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:04,832
About Trump having record Black and Hispanic support

2222
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:06,880
Deputies not being specific about that

2223
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,672
Because if you was you probably be lying

2224
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:12,512
If you go back to speech that Trump gave on the campaign Trail back in 20

2225
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,792
16 he said quote

2226
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:19,168
At the end of four years I guarantee you that I will have over 95% of the African-American vote

2227
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:21,472
I promise you because I will produce

2228
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:26,336
This is in stark contrast to a November 2019 hill-harrisx poll

2229
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,616
It sounded

2230
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:29,920
An overwhelming majority of black voters

2231
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,968
85% said they would choose

2232
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,272
Any Democratic presidential candidate over Trump

2233
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,600
In reality is probably never going to get anywhere higher than like

2234
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,904
Like 10% and that might even be generous

2235
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,440
That is not record-breaking

2236
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:43,488
Unless you're talking about it being a record for true

2237
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,256
Himself

2238
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,536
Which is a little distant

2239
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,864
I think this is all a little bit silly for Alex

2240
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:52,448
The Advocate to be bragging about Trump

2241
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:54,752
Support while discussing with a collar

2242
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,520
Streets

2243
01:39:55,776 --> 01:40:00,128
And Trump can find Common Ground over the agreement the trans people shouldn't be allowed to exist in public

2244
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:02,432
And not heterosexual couples should be allowed to marry

2245
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,456
It's a weird

2246
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:05,760
She was talking about the British

2247
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:07,040
Rapper the street

2248
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:10,368
It's Danny was talking about.

2249
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,416
And I didn't know that guy was at homophobic

2250
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:13,440
It turns out

2251
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,208
If you got this

2252
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:18,816
Streets play in your prefer Lady Sovereign

2253
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:23,936
So this caller goes on to talk about how great Alex's iodine is

2254
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:24,960
And I don't

2255
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:28,288
X2 and without Donald Trump

2256
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:34,432
Liberal left-wing crazy believe in the mainstream media pop culture in Hollywood

2257
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,712
Help me

2258
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,272
Take me to Clarity and focus

2259
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,064
Understand

2260
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,600
Really going on out here so

2261
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:42,880
That's not

2262
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,160
My IQ

2263
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:52,864
So except in cases where someone is severely iodine deficiency

2264
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,168
These products aren't going to do anything other than Apple

2265
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:55,936
Placebo effect

2266
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:58,752
So long as listeners are eating salt

2267
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,032
There's nothing these products

2268
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,104
Do for them except trick them into thinking they're somehow seeing through the Matrix

2269
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:07,712
How to speak real s*** head when he say to these studies about iodine increasing IQ

2270
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:13,856
Because he knows or has every reason to know these studies are not saying that if you take iodine that will make your IQ go up

2271
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:16,672
They're showing IQ differences between people heads

2272
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,976
Severe iodine deficiency than those who did not

2273
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,768
Most of the studies at Alex

2274
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:25,120
Actually about maternal iodine levels and effect I can have on fetal development

2275
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:29,472
Alex who I should point out are grown adults

2276
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,752
Taking iodine

2277
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:33,824
There's a classic case of Alex creating

2278
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:34,848
The fake problem

2279
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,128
First products to solve

2280
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:40,480
He tells his audience at the globalist or trying to dump them down and iodine can fight back

2281
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:41,504
Against the onslaught

2282
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:44,576
Listeners take the iodine have that placebo

2283
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:48,416
Which is a company by listening to a ton of Alex's s*** on question

2284
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:50,208
They adopt his narrative

2285
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:52,000
That looking into any of it themselves

2286
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,304
And pretend that that's them seeing through the maitre

2287
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,584
Which they were able to do

2288
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,912
Thanks to the miracle brain boosting power of iodine

2289
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:02,240
Really sad Griff we can see that it definitely does work some

2290
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,568
Ideology

2291
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,384
That doesn't

2292
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:12,480
So Jordan I have given you a stout

2293
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:16,320
Yeah we're we're going to crack open here a morning latte

2294
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:19,648
From the toppling Goliath Brewing Company out of Iowa

2295
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:24,256
And against Iowa but I will make it

2296
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,048
Not sponsors of

2297
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:28,864
Michelle but I felt like it would be appropriate for us to have a

2298
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:30,400
Have a mid show

2299
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:36,800
Everybody's been clamoring for new novels to know specifics

2300
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,616
But another reason they were having a little

2301
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:41,152
Stout here is because

2302
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:43,200
I'm pretty convinced that Alex

2303
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,480
Yeah ends up drunk

2304
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,552
Although I'm pretty sure

2305
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:51,648
A lot of people have suggested it over the course of the last month

2306
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,696
Drinking on this episode

2307
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:57,024
I don't really necessarily agree based on certain behaviors

2308
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,816
That I find to be uniquely

2309
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:00,608
Sometimes that I think Alex

2310
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:01,376
Alexa

2311
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:02,656
If you will and

2312
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:03,680
And I believe

2313
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:05,472
I bet it is Mike

2314
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,496
Conjecture

2315
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,520
Guys that Alex

2316
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:09,824
Towards the end of this episode

2317
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,104
We has

2318
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,640
Norm pattis

2319
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:15,200
Call Michelle

2320
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,480
Of course and I don't think

2321
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,016
Alexander Palace like

2322
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,040
I don't know why

2323
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:25,184
And I think well I mean certainly that time that I would put out a bounty lawyer

2324
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,488
Bike

2325
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,816
I had to sit there I don't think that

2326
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:33,376
Lends itself to a friendship

2327
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:37,216
I don't think that they like each other very much and I think that Alex news

2328
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,496
He's going

2329
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:42,336
Becoming on the show we're going to talk about Rodger Stone related legal issues

2330
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,616
I might need a drink

2331
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:45,664
For that yeah I think that's what happened

2332
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,944
Because hallux

2333
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:47,968
And him

2334
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:49,248
Holyshit

2335
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,016
This goes bad

2336
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,296
It starts bad

2337
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:56,160
Cuz I was makes an announcement that Norm has to immediately retract

2338
01:43:56,416 --> 01:44:00,512
We should go ahead and make this announcement even talking about this for a few days in the main

2339
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,560
Pull the trigger earlier

2340
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,376
We are going to intervene

2341
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,912
And the Rodger Stone

2342
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:09,984
Okay simmer also to me working with Mike cernovich on this

2343
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:11,520
I answered

2344
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,824
To go in and show in the car

2345
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,360
Court records which are very expensive

2346
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,640
Records

2347
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:19,712
With these jurors bragging the Democrat

2348
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:23,552
The southern sure whose husband was a top lawyer on the Mueller probe

2349
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:35,328
For the intent of even finding out in a conflict

2350
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:38,400
Sure the whole house of cards for Paterson

2351
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,704
Starting to clap

2352
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:46,592
Correct the record when you say intervene that to turn with legal significance

2353
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:48,896
Party but my office is right now it's

2354
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:50,944
Locate and obtain

2355
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,224
Copy of the trial

2356
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:01,696
Have meanings in the world of the law

2357
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,768
Consistently throughout this interview Alex

2358
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:05,792
Keep saying things

2359
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:09,888
We don't do the Supercut of

2360
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:12,704
Norm responding to Alex

2361
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,496
Supermarket

2362
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:17,568
You know I can't

2363
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:19,616
Go that far I'm still in Oxford Accord

2364
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:21,920
That's news to me

2365
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:25,760
Comment on a case-by-case basis

2366
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:32,160
Does a lot of just like I

2367
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:34,720
Alex

2368
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:41,632
So it's interesting because I mean what's going on here is that they're trying to create this argument that they

2369
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,168
Jurors were biased

2370
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,216
Sure. Rodger Stone case

2371
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:48,544
Like Norma's on here and he's even said

2372
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,080
I don't even have

2373
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:51,872
The transcript

2374
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:52,640
I'm just

2375
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:53,664
Texting them

2376
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,944
If you listen to the language

2377
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:55,968
Tuesday are like

2378
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,016
It's very clear that they're just guessing

2379
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,296
You're entitled to a

2380
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:02,624
Jury of your peers impartial jury historic

2381
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,440
Play what that smell

2382
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:07,488
Or musica quesos

2383
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,816
Evaluate the address

2384
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:12,352
I'm in some courts that means

2385
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:15,424
People don't know anything about the parties or the party

2386
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,728
Kiss offense that's rare in a high-profile case

2387
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
Berkeley they just have

2388
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:25,408
Impartial they have to set aside whatever they've heard and commit to being able to try the case based on the evidence in the courtroom

2389
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:27,200
However do the

2390
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:30,016
Anticipatory entitled to an honest answer with

2391
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:32,832
Respected sources of bias that yours may have

2392
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:36,416
Mike cernovich is reporting that one of the jurors I'm head run

2393
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,952
Is a Democrat

2394
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:38,976
Prior to trial

2395
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:44,096
Unclear to me as I sit here today whether that was disclosed to the lawyers in the

2396
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,632
On this day

2397
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:46,656
Sure has now come

2398
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:51,008
Forwarding and written to her about her outrage over the resignation of the four

2399
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:51,776
Biofrost

2400
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:52,800
Peters this week

2401
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:56,640
Suggesting that in fact she had very strong views at the time of trial

2402
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:59,200
So if you listen to that he's saying

2403
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:03,808
His language is completely clearly has no idea that person who ran for office desk

2404
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:08,160
Closed in the jury selection phase of the trial

2405
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:10,976
Norm's just speculating that it wasn't but guess what

2406
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:16,352
Anybody who wants to speculate that it was brought up has as much ground to stand on their not saying s***

2407
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:17,632
This isn't a claim

2408
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:18,912
It's just a marriage

2409
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:19,936
What's being built at

2410
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:23,264
Considering all of this is just information

2411
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,544
From Mike cernovich

2412
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:27,104
Cernovich is going after the jurors in the

2413
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,664
Mistrial

2414
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,688
Disqualified

2415
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:33,248
And I guess get Rodger out on a technicality

2416
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,320
It seemed to have a new trial

2417
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:39,648
Seems weird to spend as much effort on something when you have a pretty good-sized

2418
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,440
Probably just get a pardon

2419
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:45,024
But that's where it gets important to understand what this is really about

2420
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:48,608
Cernovich and Alex are trying to get the case retried

2421
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:51,424
They're not trying to get the overturn the verdict

2422
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,728
Create narratives that provide cover

2423
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:55,520
Rodger

2424
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:58,848
Because all of these jurors are all biased

2425
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:00,896
Add have to Pardon him still

2426
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:02,432
Still larger than that

2427
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,480
To essentially say that

2428
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:06,016
Trump is the Arbiter of

2429
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,088
Notaries are

2430
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,112
If anybody

2431
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:13,696
Is convict anybody in the Trump orbit of a crime

2432
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,232
Because they're part isn't

2433
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,280
There is no rule of law

2434
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:19,072
It is purely Trump win

2435
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:24,192
That about a largely and then more specifically give Trump the political cover that he need

2436
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:29,056
Thanatologist week shift like I went and looked at with crnkovich

2437
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:31,872
Just putting out and one sort of itches gotcha moments

2438
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,920
Is it mentioned

2439
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:35,712
Rodger Stone on Twitter in the past

2440
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:39,552
Though the jurors were asked if they posted on social media about the subject

2441
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,344
Which would be Rodger

2442
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:44,160
The Smoking Gun that's shown here is a jerk

2443
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:46,464
Just wonder retweeted

2444
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:47,744
Bakari sellers

2445
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,768
Tweet that said quote

2446
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:51,584
Rodger Stone has y'all talking about reviewing the elusive

2447
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,608
Force guidelines

2448
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:57,216
Not Alton Sterling not Eric Gardner not Walter Scott knots on Sandra Bland

2449
01:48:57,472 --> 01:49:00,032
Not Keith Lamont Scott not philando Castillo not

2450
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,056
Terence Crutcher

2451
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:03,104
Not DeAndre Hamilton

2452
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,384
Rodger Stone

2453
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,152
Think about that

2454
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:10,784
This is clearly not a tweet about Rodger Stone it's about the treatment of African-American so excited

2455
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,856
Police also she just tweeted it that wasn't even her tweet

2456
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:17,440
I think you could very accurately say that you never tweet about Rodger

2457
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:19,232
Just don't even if you retweeted that

2458
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,256
This is thin

2459
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,280
F****** broth

2460
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,072
The rest of his Brew

2461
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:25,376
Is that you created some negative things about Trump in the

2462
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:27,680
The past and to that I say so what

2463
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:28,448
It wasn't

2464
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:29,216
Trial by

2465
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,752
It was about Rodger committing

2466
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:31,520
Crimes

2467
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:36,896
It's very possible for a human adult to not like Trump and remain unbiased about a legal matter

2468
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,664
Involving water

2469
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,432
Associate

2470
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:42,784
Just because Alex can never be impartial if he were a juror in a case involving a

2471
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,064
A friend of Hillary Clinton

2472
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,344
Doesn't mean that normal

2473
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,368
People are incapable of

2474
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,392
Like friends

2475
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:49,440
I f****** hate Alex Jones

2476
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:52,512
But I could be totally impartial in a case involving his cousin buck

2477
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:53,280
Princeton

2478
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:54,048
Yeah that would be

2479
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,072
No

2480
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:57,376
I would not be able to be by

2481
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:00,192
Actually I probably

2482
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,008
I think I should I hate the crew

2483
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,032
System so much

2484
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,568
It's it's a real cat

2485
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:08,640
22 I honestly think that I could be impartial in a case

2486
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,920
Even involving Alex

2487
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:12,992
But I texted me saying that no one would believe it

2488
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:15,808
So I'm going to make that claim

2489
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:20,928
And also not stand behind you could be impartial in any

2490
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:23,488
I agree with that

2491
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,792
You do not belong on the tree

2492
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:26,816
0 faucet

2493
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:30,400
Was really stupid and would never hold up in court

2494
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:31,424
But that's okay because it

2495
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,192
It's not designed

2496
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:35,008
It's meant to be played for a public opinion narrative

2497
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:39,872
The provides cover for Trump to abuses power and pardon his friend for trying to obstruct an investigation

2498
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:46,016
Which makes it particularly sad for Alex's lawyer to debase himself by lending this week s*** credibility

2499
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,344
Barnes really needs to give Nora McCall and get him up

2500
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,392
Just be that it's time to bail

2501
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,672
This isn't going

2502
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:54,464
To go where you want it to

2503
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:56,000
So

2504
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:57,280
Alex

2505
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,304
Is like

2506
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:02,656
Norm to talk about the the case and Rodger being innocent and all that

2507
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:03,936
But also he's

2508
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:05,216
Fixated on a headline

2509
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:05,984
Find these red

2510
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:07,264
About this Cambridge

2511
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,032
Professor

2512
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,312
Has written a book

2513
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:14,176
Basically making the argument that humans should stop reproducing

2514
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:15,200
Nubian Africa

2515
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:15,968
Cove in grievance

2516
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:16,992
Stop reproducing

2517
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,272
Because of all the

2518
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:20,832
Systems that we've brought into the world that are

2519
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:21,600
Destructive

2520
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:22,880
And that you know

2521
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:25,184
Unpacking unpacking all of the things

2522
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,464
Capitalism

2523
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:30,048
All the systems

2524
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:30,816
Things that we have

2525
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:31,840
Foreign

2526
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,376
To Nature

2527
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:35,168
And we need to dismantle those

2528
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,448
The only way to do that

2529
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,008
Is through our gradual

2530
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:40,544
Getting

2531
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,312
Gone

2532
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:47,456
People have made these sort of argument the idea of a

2533
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:50,016
Extinction by choice

2534
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,040
That's

2535
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:53,344
Bananas well I mean there's a voluntary human

2536
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:57,952
Engine movement for a very long time I just don't think it's possible for any organ

2537
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:58,720
M2

2538
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,768
Cause it so next

2539
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,048
I think I mean

2540
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:02,816
Kill itself

2541
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:04,864
It is possible but it's

2542
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:06,144
It's also all Valen

2543
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:06,912
Ontario

2544
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,704
First thing

2545
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:12,288
It's not about murder it's not about telling you to kill yourself

2546
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:14,592
And it's not even something that

2547
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:15,360
I would guess

2548
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:17,408
This Cambridge Professor believes

2549
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,944
Could be implemented

2550
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:19,968
It's just

2551
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:22,784
Ethical dissertation

2552
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,064
That she's putting up

2553
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,880
Now also she has tattoos and kind of looks like a witch

2554
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:29,952
Well there we go Bears are bigger issue

2555
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:34,048
Bears are bigger issue it's surprising to me that he isn't talking about all of these types

2556
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,328
Books that have been written

2557
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:39,168
Choose this one particular

2558
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:42,752
Well because it's current do you read a headline about it

2559
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:45,312
And this lady looks like a

2560
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:47,104
Fixated on this and insist

2561
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,128
The chi needs to kill her

2562
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:53,504
Norm is not happy about this and we will learn why in a little bit

2563
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,272
Look at

2564
01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:01,696
Human race must become extinct to save the planet

2565
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:03,744
Rebellion

2566
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:10,912
Guess what she's got Medusa on her arm

2567
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:15,008
Yourself a big old

2568
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,080
Honey some barbiturates who kill yourself

2569
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:23,712
You're in to death you're in destruction you given up on Humanity I don't want you to hurt yourself

2570
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,040
You got that broadcast

2571
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:27,808
Go take care of

2572
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:29,856
Dub's lithograph

2573
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:31,392
Go see Jesus

2574
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:34,464
Map Norm is got to be thrilled that he showed up like

2575
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,232
He's got to be

2576
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:40,608
The point where like Alex got drunk and yelled about wanting a bounty on the

2577
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:42,144
He had to be like

2578
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:48,800
It always goes bad when I go out about Rodger everything's fine I was just being the

2579
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:51,872
A little bit you know saying we're going to intervene that's not

2580
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:55,712
I can correct that we can get by on this

2581
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:57,504
Now you talkin about how this

2582
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,296
Professor needs to kill herself

2583
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:03,904
Can I get your take on this she should kill herself Keralis

2584
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,976
Young lady lead-by-example

2585
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:09,536
Some respect

2586
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:13,888
If you jumped off a building today or Switzer rest

2587
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,680
I'm not saying she should do that

2588
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:18,752
We should all die while her first Norm

2589
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:24,384
I mean I don't know where it was how he'd intended what what to make of that

2590
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:31,040
Norman he doesn't like her argument and he actually has a pretty good response to it

2591
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:36,160
About like love being transformative

2592
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:37,952
Is I hate

2593
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:39,232
Don't hate on her baby

2594
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:42,560
If we all show compassion and love it'll change

2595
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:44,352
A perspective on this

2596
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:48,192
That's kind of the angle he's coming from

2597
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:48,960
The f****** hatch

2598
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:49,984
Well he does

2599
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,264
Is he does make that point

2600
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:54,336
This goes so bad

2601
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,128
Aiam look dude

2602
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,408
Norman is next

2603
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:58,432
Say something

2604
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,456
That Alex should

2605
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:00,736
Take as a

2606
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:02,016
Can stop it

2607
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,880
Play u gopher

2608
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:11,488
We commit suicide China wish that on anyone

2609
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,280
That is the pole

2610
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:15,328
F*** it which

2611
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:19,680
You immediately start practicing empathy towards the person

2612
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:22,752
You're like

2613
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:24,800
Some jokes II

2614
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:26,080
This is disrespectful

2615
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,360
I'm sorry for your loss

2616
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:33,760
I apologize for inviting you onto this episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm apparently is how this is going

2617
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:36,064
Human

2618
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,600
Decency dictates

2619
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:44,000
That you take that as a sign like an enormous being very polite and saying I just lost someone to suicide and

2620
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:46,048
You know Sia and I'm not into this

2621
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:47,584
What he's really saying is

2622
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,352
Stop

2623
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,912
He's putting a boundary

2624
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:52,448
Don't like

2625
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,984
Him and even I would

2626
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:58,336
Immediately apetamin empathetic

2627
01:55:59,360 --> 01:55:59,872
Alex

2628
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,408
Doesn't take a quiet

2629
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,944
The same way that humans might

2630
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:05,504
I just I just want her to go first

2631
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:16,512
And I'd go easy Alex upgraded we all need more all in need of Grace and she needed more

2632
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:19,072
If you want this all the Dodger saying let's go

2633
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:21,632
You know that's not song from Elf

2634
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:25,216
Yeah I thought

2635
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:29,568
My husband honey

2636
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:31,872
You ain't got no place to go

2637
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:33,664
Put your arms around me

2638
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,944
Real tide

2639
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:42,624
Yeah I was around here when I realize like these are the drunk Behavior I haven't seen in awhile like this sort of stuff is

2640
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:43,648
Is very

2641
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:44,928
Like in the Alex

2642
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,464
Drunk

2643
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:50,816
The inability to understand the slide

2644
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:52,096
IQs that are actual

2645
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:53,632
Screaming out of

2646
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:54,400
Norm

2647
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:55,424
About like Alec

2648
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:57,216
Cut it.

2649
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:01,824
Are insane Alex just won't stop

2650
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,848
And I

2651
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:04,128
Really get the science

2652
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:05,920
Norm

2653
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:06,944
It's Alex

2654
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,624
When

2655
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:17,696
Giving her what she wants

2656
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:22,304
Glove in the power of Grace is overwhelming and certainly to transform my life and I hope it would hurt

2657
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:24,352
As well

2658
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:28,960
Form of having a little fun today

2659
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:31,264
Got me a text a lot

2660
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,056
How to make me speechless you have that gif

2661
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:37,664
Alex

2662
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:40,992
The lawyer way of saying

2663
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:41,760
I hope

2664
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:46,624
You like yourself on fire f****** murderer

2665
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,208
Got hummus

2666
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:53,280
He must need that money he must be getting paid so much

2667
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,560
I don't even

2668
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:56,096
Maybe also like

2669
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:59,424
High-profile can't hook me up a lot of publicity out of it

2670
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,960
Conceivably Isaac gets

2671
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:02,752
Closer to when it goes to trial

2672
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:06,080
If you really think that there's a chance he could

2673
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:08,896
Like weasel through this case on a technicality

2674
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:10,688
It could be a huge thing for his

2675
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:12,992
If you lose a case

2676
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:14,272
I like it hurts him

2677
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:16,320
Whatever publicity

2678
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:19,648
You get out of it get a lot of money from Ali there is a you know

2679
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:21,184
Quit like you can get

2680
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,464
In those little moments

2681
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:23,744
Like I am

2682
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,304
Almost never at a loss for words and you have that gif

2683
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,096
Very polite

2684
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:30,144
A smart person's way of saying

2685
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:32,704
F*** you yep go f*** you

2686
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,472
Yourself

2687
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:36,032
I told you 5 minutes ago

2688
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:37,568
Bit someone near me

2689
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:38,848
Committed suicide

2690
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,384
Recently

2691
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:42,688
And you won't stop taking every

2692
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:43,968
Single like hey

2693
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:45,760
Light reflection that I make

2694
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:47,296
And weaving it right back to

2695
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:49,856
Support Athlete on yourself b****

2696
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:50,624
Weezy

2697
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:52,928
How to spell Adeline

2698
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:53,952
That is

2699
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:58,560
I just kind of point to be obsequious notes of of the right

2700
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:01,376
Just like there's no way that I'm just

2701
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:02,912
If that's

2702
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:05,216
After that and he keeps going it's like

2703
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:06,240
Cool Alex

2704
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:08,544
This is as good as we're going to do I'm going to let you

2705
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:11,360
Man I don't know

2706
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:13,920
Employer-employee relationship or at least like

2707
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:15,200
There's the business relation

2708
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:21,088
You know if your Norm you also recognize like there's some performance on Alex's part

2709
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:21,856
That like

2710
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:23,904
Maybe after the mics

2711
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:26,464
Went off and went to commercial he apologized

2712
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:30,816
I don't know probably not but maybe I do because I'm so sorry look I just got out of

2713
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:32,096
Control

2714
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:34,656
It was too good I couldn't stop

2715
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:36,704
The BET was great lowriders too good at

2716
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:37,728
Ready for me to stop

2717
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:40,032
I had a suspicion that Alex was

2718
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:41,824
Maybe it back in his drunk

2719
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,384
Behavior that was kind of like

2720
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:45,664
This next clip is world's like

2721
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,248
Let's go ahead and take a call or hear

2722
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:51,808
Who's in all the longest for Norm pattis

2723
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:56,928
That would be

2724
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:05,888
What's going on here at

2725
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:11,776
Sounds like a soundtrack from The Exorcist

2726
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:15,360
Go ahead

2727
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,640
Maybe Alex just like

2728
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:17,408
Gentleman

2729
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:23,808
That's the level he's at

2730
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:28,160
Like these are the behaviors that I signed in times and he's very clearly drop

2731
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:29,696
But also

2732
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:33,024
I could see it as a possibility that he's not drunk you just hate snore

2733
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:35,840
Like a two of them just hate each other and they only exist

2734
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:39,168
Because Alex can't get any other lawyers threatened f****** bar

2735
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:48,384
Carry out his case without some sort of a lawyer who's willing to represent him and Norm is that

2736
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:51,968
So they're stuck with each other in some way and they f****** hate each

2737
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:55,040
That's a possibility that he's so checked out in like

2738
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:59,136
I hate this guy but he doesn't want to act like that alright

2739
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:02,464
Need some lawyer to come on and talk about Rogers situation

2740
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:06,560
There he needs a lawyer to come on and talk about Rogers situation

2741
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:08,608
Which they are absolutely not to

2742
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:10,656
There's not much of a

2743
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:13,216
So yeah

2744
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:15,776
This ends

2745
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,592
Not all that dramatically or anyting

2746
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:19,872
Alex

2747
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,152
Let him go

2748
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:22,176
Amen

2749
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:22,944
He comes back

2750
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:24,224
From break

2751
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,248
And here's another guess

2752
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,784
Another guest

2753
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:27,552
I was like

2754
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:28,576
Okay

2755
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:29,856
It's got to be Steve

2756
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:34,720
Allison saying these Red Storm things should I expect Steve to come in

2757
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:37,024
Hey when you going out to the gas was I was like

2758
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:40,096
The rest of the hours I'm going to host some of the

2759
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:40,864
40 hour

2760
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:44,192
Eminem

2761
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:47,264
Watch this guy for 6 7 8 years on

2762
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:48,800
YouTube East

2763
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:50,336
Billions of

2764
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:54,176
Author editor Video Creator and Gardner

2765
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:56,992
Daddy goes by styx666

2766
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:59,552
Panda

2767
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:03,648
You're just more of an obnoxious handle that he can describe that for you

2768
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:09,536
This is a hilarious booking for Alex on his show

2769
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:12,096
Do you know who this dude is no I have no idea

2770
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:15,168
So he's full of a 6

2771
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:15,936
66

2772
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:18,240
And he's a real s*** head on YouTube

2773
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:21,568
YouTube caca

2774
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:22,848
If you was on the left

2775
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:24,384
That would handle would be what

2776
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:30,784
Hundred percent the thing that Alex dreams about an hour

2777
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,320
Have to be obvious about it they have

2778
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:34,112
Tell you that are so evil that

2779
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:39,744
They have to do

2780
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:44,096
He's on my side

2781
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:46,400
I should tell you he is illegitimate

2782
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:47,936
Orleans to Houston

2783
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:52,288
He left the Church of Satan a few years back and is now a self-described pagan

2784
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:53,056
Anacortes

2785
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:55,360
Switch Alex would still described as

2786
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:56,384
Satan

2787
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,152
Kohl's

2788
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:58,432
People that are

2789
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:02,016
Regular you never come from Christian to Satanist

2790
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:10,208
His 666 Campbell is not just being abrasive obnoxious he was a real Satanist

2791
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:14,304
Unlike all the Democrats believe in a liberal policy

2792
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,840
The great Beast alastor

2793
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:16,864
Crowley

2794
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:18,912
So sticks is real dumb dumb

2795
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:21,728
Do you suppose videos on YouTube themself doing drugs

2796
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:25,824
Buddy stopped at every overdosed on fake weed back

2797
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,360
In 2010 and got clean

2798
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:29,408
He's advancing real fun

2799
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,688
Conspiracies like he believes

2800
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,224
The Charles Manson is innocent

2801
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:37,344
Not fun once like arguing with the Nazis didn't use zyklon-b in the gas

2802
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:41,184
You sent that one back a little bit but in my book

2803
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:41,952
If you're using

2804
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:45,280
Your platform to spread Holocaust revisionism that stays with you

2805
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,816
Even when you walk it back.

2806
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:49,632
Good on you for realizing you were wrong but the

2807
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:50,400
The problem is

2808
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:53,216
You didn't realize you were wrong before you started preaching that s***

2809
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:57,824
Realizing your position was wrong doesn't change the fact that you were still the same person

2810
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:58,848
Even afterwards

2811
02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:01,408
Ever you made up your mind you were wrong

2812
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:03,200
Missing person who thought it was a great idea

2813
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:05,248
Question well-established history of the Hulk

2814
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:06,528
So go f*** you

2815
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:08,064
Yourself

2816
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:10,112
I think one of the big problems with

2817
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,952
YouTube creators being

2818
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:14,720
Self-employed

2819
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:16,256
Is that the only person who

2820
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:18,560
You can fire them or punish them for their bad behavior

2821
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:19,840
Doesn't particularly

2822
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:21,888
Seems like there's a problem

2823
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:24,448
So beyond that sort of stuff like

2824
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:25,472
Note some weird

2825
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:30,080
Conspiracies and Holocaust revisionism that you sent pretended I didn't mean that

2826
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:34,176
Beyond that he's is pretty much a run-of-the-mill YouTube reactionary right-wing commentators

2827
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,200
Except

2828
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:36,480
Did he have a seat

2829
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:37,248
Aesthetic

2830
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:43,904
Easiest long hair is a leather jacket and he often wears no shirt under that leather jacket

2831
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:48,256
Easy Rider resale

2832
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:50,304
This dude just straight-up sucks

2833
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:56,704
But honestly I would have thought that he was would consider himself above coming on Infowars

2834
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,776
Because it's like YouTube accidentally watched a couple of

2835
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:01,824
Condescending XVideos

2836
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:04,384
But I got from him would be like

2837
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,152
No I would

2838
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:06,944
Alex is crazy

2839
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,224
Why would I do that

2840
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:13,344
The fact that this interview is happening is embarrassing for both parties engaging in theater

2841
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,368
Yeah that's not good

2842
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:16,160
Hey Wade interviews are stupid

2843
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:19,232
Play the Sixers just doing some bucket list shity like he got

2844
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,512
Ballroom

2845
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:23,072
Appleton

2846
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:25,888
Does Owen Shroyer show is definitely

2847
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:26,656
More

2848
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:27,680
Tailored towards

2849
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:32,288
The younger reactionary proud and so like he'll have a lot of these people who

2850
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,848
Frame spaces on YouTube

2851
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,408
Because you want to reach out to those already in Sycamore

2852
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:40,992
A cool Owen Shroyer guy Destroyer

2853
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:44,064
Make some sense

2854
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:45,856
Alex

2855
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:48,416
Now it's bad luck

2856
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:49,184
Yeah

2857
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,488
If the whole interview is really just

2858
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:52,512
Exists

2859
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:54,304
Styxhexenhammer666

2860
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,328
Can come on in Bosch

2861
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:59,936
Bernie being bad Neverland bad

2862
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,472
Motorola

2863
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:07,872
The band it's very unimpressive interview

2864
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:09,408
And I just

2865
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:11,456
The only cuz I'm going to play from it

2866
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:12,736
Is sticks

2867
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:16,064
Explaining that know his handle is from back when he was a Satanist

2868
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:19,136
I was just response to this

2869
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:19,904
Is

2870
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:20,672
It's up there

2871
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:26,048
Far as the username goes that actually many years

2872
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:30,400
Actually an atheistic stay behind long ago

2873
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:33,472
I have nothing to do with it anymore but the name stuff so I just

2874
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:34,496
The same

2875
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:35,520
Make sense

2876
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:38,336
Sure

2877
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:44,480
God I just hate the double standards

2878
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:46,784
Passe and cliche

2879
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:47,808
Dammit it's so annoying

2880
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:52,672
Stock price

2881
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:53,952
I'm surprised

2882
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:54,720
I'm surprised

2883
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:58,048
He barely imagine that in his head was like

2884
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:00,352
That means you're still a Satanist it what to Satan

2885
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:02,656
He's like oh s*** he's on my side

2886
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,192
Okay

2887
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:09,568
He probably has way more of a reach than Alex to it's a pretty popular on YouTube

2888
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,360
I would I would assume that Alex

2889
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:13,920
To enlist him

2890
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:14,944
As part of the phone

2891
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:17,504
That's not feel like

2892
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,272
You're still the same

2893
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:20,576
You look UK once you got the Donk

2894
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:23,392
Once you got the meme machines

2895
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:24,672
You're going to need a stick

2896
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:27,744
That's it for the 30

2897
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:33,888
The wrestler shows mostly Alex Evans interview with sticks

2898
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:37,728
It's not it's not interesting

2899
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:46,176
That's a phrase that I've never heard that since I've never heard before on fake weed

2900
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:46,944
That would be interested

2901
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:48,480
You OD on

2902
02:07:48,992 --> 02:07:51,808
Some of that stuff is not good

2903
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:52,832
I totally believe that

2904
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:56,672
And not doesn't know this is to make fun of people's

2905
02:07:56,928 --> 02:07:58,976
Had bad drug reactions or anything it's just

2906
02:07:59,232 --> 02:07:59,744
Kind of

2907
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:02,560
It's kind of funny giving him know

2908
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:05,632
I wouldn't want that to be my rock bottom Bowman

2909
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:08,448
Of all the all the rock bottom

2910
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:11,264
That's not the one I would want

2911
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:12,544
Bucked up

2912
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:13,824
F***** up on fake weed

2913
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,104
Get the f*** out of

2914
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:16,128
88

2915
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:16,896
It's a weird look

2916
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:20,480
Much like a leather jacket without a shirt

2917
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:21,504
Weird

2918
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:24,320
Cowboy

2919
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,856
And now it's something

2920
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:27,648
And that is

2921
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:30,464
That an interview with William Barr has come out

2922
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:36,864
Or he's trying to do damage control salute about the fact that these prosecutors removed themselves from the cake

2923
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:38,144
So now

2924
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:40,704
Alex has an interesting Dilemma on his hands

2925
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:44,544
We know that attorney general Barr has really come out against the Press

2926
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:48,128
Some people are saying that it's elaborate

2927
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:49,920
Kabuki

2928
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:54,016
Heat off the Attorney General

2929
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:56,576
Stone to an exorbitant amount of time

2930
02:08:56,832 --> 02:08:57,344
Correct

2931
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:04,000
He does know all people

2932
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:05,280
In the deep deep state

2933
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,048
Disagree

2934
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:08,864
Not the lawyer bureaucracy but the other folks

2935
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,424
The military

2936
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:12,960
Those areas

2937
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:14,752
Also just really has a big toe

2938
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:15,776
Bar

2939
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,592
Particularly want to come on the show today

2940
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:24,480
Barney's resign and anything's bars going to make a move on the president

2941
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:27,552
And I just deleted them because of the pedigree of bar

2942
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,088
You know bar

2943
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:31,136
He's up to his eyeballs

2944
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,416
In Jeffrey Epstein

2945
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:33,952
Okay

2946
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:38,560
Like I told you I knew that Steve was looming in the background somewhere and here we go

2947
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:41,632
You're like a quarterback with Brian Urlacher

2948
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:45,216
I got my Maya Steve's

2949
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:48,800
So by the 14th William Bard sat down for a highly

2950
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:50,592
Staged interview where he basically made the

2951
02:09:50,848 --> 02:09:54,176
Point the Trump's tweet about Rodger Stone sentencing recommendation me

2952
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:56,992
Impossible for him to do his job as the Attorney General

2953
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:58,784
You kind of see what you mean

2954
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:01,088
But we put them in a very bad position

2955
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:07,744
If you sincerely did believe the recommendation was too severe he then had to choose to either not amend the recommendation

2956
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,304
For fear of appearing compromised by Trump's tweets

2957
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:13,888
Or amend the recommendation and give literally every appearance

2958
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:15,424
Prince of being compromised by Trump

2959
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:22,336
Amazing for him to be in a

2960
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:23,616
Complex situation

2961
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:24,640
Where is protect

2962
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:25,408
Checking the president

2963
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:29,248
I've never heard of him doing that before multiple president

2964
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:33,088
F****** trust bar in this light

2965
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:34,368
He's describing

2966
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:36,416
It is a real problem

2967
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:38,208
Like that is

2968
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:41,024
Sincere like Trump's tweet does introduced

2969
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,560
That possibility

2970
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:43,840
The way Trump Act

2971
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:45,632
Makes every decision completely

2972
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:46,400
Complicated in

2973
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,168
Suspicious

2974
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:49,216
There's no action that bill Barr can

2975
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:49,984
Take

2976
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,520
Particularly in cases that affect

2977
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:52,544
Trump directly

2978
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:55,360
They can never really be seen as independent or legitimate

2979
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:56,640
Because of the way Trump

2980
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:58,944
I don't believe that this is

2981
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:02,528
Sidebar is really concerned about that

2982
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:03,296
But

2983
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:04,320
Just looking at it

2984
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:06,368
From a neutral position

2985
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:07,904
Person one does this

2986
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:08,928
Person to hastur

2987
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:09,696
Respond

2988
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:11,744
It does make sense

2989
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:14,560
Just put them in a f*****-up pic

2990
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:16,352
No absolutely I'm just

2991
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:17,120
I just get

2992
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:18,656
Frustrated whenever they

2993
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:21,216
Like just just say that

2994
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:22,496
He told you to know

2995
02:11:23,776 --> 02:11:26,080
We all know he told you to do it

2996
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:27,616
You're going to do it

2997
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:28,896
Just saying

2998
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:30,432
Just be done

2999
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:35,040
I have a strong suspicion that the interview he did was intentional and was a calculated Act

3000
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:36,064
Designed to cut off Curtis

3001
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:39,904
Isn't that as attorney general he was basically just acting as Trump's personal attorney

3002
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:41,440
Doing his bidding opposed

3003
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:42,976
As opposed to protecting the interest

3004
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:46,304
Which is why you was f****** higher than the first

3005
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:49,120
Whatever the reality of Alex's

3006
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:49,888
Pissed

3007
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:52,704
He sees the interview with a broadside attack on Trump

3008
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:54,240
And now bars on the outs

3009
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:55,008
With the Patriots

3010
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:58,336
Which is hilarious considering how much Alex loves the bar not a few days ago

3011
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:00,384
Steve is going to come on in Bash

3012
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:04,736
Bars associated with a neocon to Steve f****** hate

3013
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:06,016
The standard stuff

3014
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:08,320
Just Steve working in some of his own material

3015
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:12,672
Going into business for himself on Alex's show as they say in the world of wrestling

3016
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:14,720
But I would have been sharp

3017
02:12:14,976 --> 02:12:16,512
Castillo is how now Alex

3018
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:18,048
Doesn't like William Barr

3019
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:19,328
And because of that

3020
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,888
A whole new set of facts are available to him

3021
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,448
Like that bill Barr is a Hoosier

3022
02:12:24,704 --> 02:12:26,496
Eyeballs in the Jeffrey Epstein's.

3023
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:28,032
Here's the thing

3024
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:31,360
Alex Kim just learned his father was quote

3025
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:33,920
The Headmaster of an elite New York City School

3026
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:36,992
It hired College Dropout Epstein to teach math and physics

3027
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:41,344
That wanted is read to you for it was from an August 2019 article in time

3028
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,624
And it wasn't news then

3029
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:44,928
How to know that

3030
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:48,000
But he strategically doesn't mention it ever

3031
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:50,816
While he's in the cycle of presenting bar as a hero

3032
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:52,096
Doing the heroic work

3033
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:53,888
Backing up the arch hero Trump

3034
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:59,008
Now that he said something in the interview that Alex is going against the dear leader all of a sudden

3035
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:00,800
How does a where this long reported

3036
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:01,824
Piece of information

3037
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,360
Super weird how that works

3038
02:13:04,384 --> 02:13:05,152
Wait is he

3039
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:06,944
He's genuinely mad at bar

3040
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:10,016
Yeah does he not get the game is he that stupid

3041
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:15,648
Huge doing this in defense of the president that's our sense of it

3042
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:21,024
Just feel that way that way

3043
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:24,864
Alex thinks that he's turned on Trump

3044
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:27,168
Making the best possible move

3045
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:28,192
Fort Rucker

3046
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:31,008
God these people are so f******

3047
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:37,408
He's a he's he's he's made an attack on Trump in this interview cuz Alex thinks he's trying to save himself

3048
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:38,176
4 something

3049
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:38,944
I hated the

3050
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:40,224
It's stupid and violent winds

3051
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:41,248
So

3052
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:44,064
I was listening to this and all I could think about was pro wrestler

3053
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:48,160
You may not know this Jordan but they're different styles of wrestling

3054
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:50,208
Heels and faces generally engaging

3055
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:51,744
Because they're trying to elicit differ

3056
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:52,512
Reactions

3057
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:53,280
From the crowd

3058
02:13:53,792 --> 02:13:57,120
You don't want to crowd generally genuinely cheering for the heel

3059
02:13:57,888 --> 02:14:00,704
Typically don't allow them to do boobs that are too

3060
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,472
Excited

3061
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:04,032
A good recent example of this is Seth Rollins

3062
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:07,616
When he was a heel he didn't do any of the high-flying moves

3063
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:08,640
The people really pop

3064
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:10,432
Once you turn space

3065
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:16,832
He started breaking out the superplex into a falcon arrow and the Phoenix Flash

3066
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:20,672
I was jumping off the top rope and everybody's like all that

3067
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:22,208
So when Seth was a heat

3068
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:24,256
He knew how to do those moves

3069
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:28,352
He was perfectly capable of pulling them out at any point in any match

3070
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:29,120
But he didn't

3071
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:30,400
Because his goal was

3072
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:34,240
That's what I was does with information

3073
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:38,080
And that interview Alex thinks William Barr is turned heel on Trump

3074
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:41,920
And now the moveset is opened up and he can now connect the bar with f

3075
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:44,224
Alex could have done that at any point

3076
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:47,296
And it would have been just as true but he never did

3077
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:52,160
Because that would jeopardize the face reaction that he wanted to listeners to have towards William Barr

3078
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:53,952
This little thing is a joke

3079
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,048
He knows so much more than he says on air

3080
02:14:58,304 --> 02:15:01,632
Particularly about the people he's trying to paint as good guys who are actually trash

3081
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:07,776
It also strongly indicates that he was totally fine with having an attorney general in office who was up to his eyeballs in the

3082
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:08,800
Epstein stop

3083
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:11,360
So long as they didn't dare question Trump

3084
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:12,896
How to make you think

3085
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:15,712
But how much Alex knows about Trump that he pretends not to know

3086
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:17,248
So you can keep presenting him in the face

3087
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:18,272
I just

3088
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:21,856
How to makes you wonder that I'm mad at him

3089
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:23,904
For not doing this the right way

3090
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:28,256
I'm mad that Alex is not being the right kind of corrupt

3091
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:29,792
That is bumming me out

3092
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:33,120
You should be smart enough your mother is not on the script

3093
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:34,400
He's doing it up

3094
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:35,424
He's doing a bad job

3095
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:40,288
But but it's what he knows to do

3096
02:15:40,544 --> 02:15:41,056
Of course

3097
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:41,824
Of course

3098
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:46,944
It's just like a jerk kind of Defense

3099
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:50,272
He's not really that smart he's not and so like yes

3100
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:54,368
This appears to be an attack on the president we will respond as if it is

3101
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:56,160
It's just such an own-goal

3102
02:15:56,672 --> 02:15:57,440
What are you doing

3103
02:15:57,696 --> 02:15:58,208
Not great

3104
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:01,280
Alex also has learned on this site

3105
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:02,304
February 14th

3106
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:06,400
By the time it's episode air season in vet

3107
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:07,424
This is come out and said

3108
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,448
That they're not going to

3109
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:10,752
Pursue prosecution against Andrew McCabe

3110
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:15,104
That's why this one argument okay

3111
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:21,504
Another argument might be that it is also another placating move and that like this prosecution wouldn't have worked out

3112
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:24,832
But you could have left it hanging sure but you get you

3113
02:16:25,088 --> 02:16:27,392
You dismiss it in order to also appear

3114
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:28,416
Morphe

3115
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:30,464
Prosecutor

3116
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:34,048
This is the criticism of prosecutors

3117
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:37,376
Responsibility

3118
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:43,520
It's more William Barr trying to save himself and he's pretty mad about this

3119
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:44,288
Complaining

3120
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:46,336
About John

3121
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:47,104
Brennan

3122
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:53,760
Walks around Connersville

3123
02:16:56,576 --> 02:17:01,184
Imagine a full grown man walking around

3124
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,168
Certifiable lunatic

3125
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:11,936
Right there

3126
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:14,752
Didn't fight his way out of a paper bag

3127
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:18,848
Forever

3128
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:21,920
Dishonorable scumbags out of there

3129
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:27,040
I hate America and the Communist Party

3130
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:28,832
You shouldn't be the CIA director

3131
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:31,136
Twice

3132
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:32,672
Cuz he's a shack

3133
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:33,952
Filth

3134
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:38,560
So because of the Andrew McCabe news Alex is just ranting about all this standard enemies

3135
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:45,472
It's all pretty boring

3136
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:50,080
I think I'm very here Alex claimed that Brennan voted

3137
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:50,848
Communist

3138
02:17:51,104 --> 02:17:51,616
Twice

3139
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:53,408
The wild piece of information

3140
02:17:53,664 --> 02:17:57,248
That our country's former CIA director voted for a communist twice

3141
02:17:58,016 --> 02:18:02,112
In reality John Brennan is discussed publicly how he voted for the Communist Party candidate

3142
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:04,160
President 1976

3143
02:18:05,184 --> 02:18:06,464
But he was never a member of the party

3144
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:10,048
In fairness Gus Hall got over 58,000 votes

3145
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:12,096
In the 1976 election

3146
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:16,960
Things he actually beat Lyndon larouche was running on the US

3147
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:17,728
Take it that year

3148
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,008
Regardless

3149
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:21,824
It's super interesting that a guy who in his younger life

3150
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:24,896
I would have voted for a non-mainstream candidate in a general

3151
02:18:25,408 --> 02:18:27,712
But they could eventually end up in charge of the CIA

3152
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:32,576
I don't think it means anything in the larger sense but it's pretty fascinating as trivia

3153
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:37,696
Anyway the reason I pulled this clip is because it's another prime example of that Alex cannot help him

3154
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:41,792
He have to embellish everything to make his narrative sound bigger and more convincing

3155
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:44,352
There's no evidence that Brennan voted communist

3156
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:45,120
Twice

3157
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:46,656
The Faculty voted communist

3158
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:47,936
Once just doesn't do it

3159
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:54,336
Do you have to take an already interesting and surprising piece of information and turn it into a y by exaggerating it

3160
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:56,128
Because he knows his arguments

3161
02:18:56,384 --> 02:18:56,896
Suck

3162
02:18:57,408 --> 02:19:03,552
On some basic visceral level Alex knows that you can easily write off a guy voting for the Communist Party once in the mid-70s

3163
02:19:04,832 --> 02:19:05,344
Or maybe if you

3164
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:06,624
You feel this way you can

3165
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,416
Call it an indiscretion of his youth

3166
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:10,720
If you voted for the Communist party twice

3167
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:13,024
Patterns

3168
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:14,048
Alex Azar

3169
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:15,072
Sounds better

3170
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:18,656
He knows he doesn't have the information because argument sound better sutures lies

3171
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:19,680
That's all he's doing

3172
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:21,728
These exaggerations are such

3173
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:22,496
Fingerprint

3174
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:23,264
Of like

3175
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,544
You know your s*** sucks

3176
02:19:25,824 --> 02:19:26,336
Week

3177
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:28,384
The f*** out of here

3178
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:29,664
Shame on you

3179
02:19:30,176 --> 02:19:30,944
Call Mimi twice

3180
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:34,016
I am the evil CIA director who is

3181
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:35,040
Who's coming after Trump

3182
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:37,088
So Alex and Steve

3183
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:38,112
Steve pieczenik

3184
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:40,160
Comes in

3185
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:49,376
And of course it's all just kind of like bars got to go

3186
02:19:50,912 --> 02:19:57,056
He does reveal that Steve did vote for

3187
02:19:58,592 --> 02:19:59,360
Probably working

3188
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:00,128
Woodland Rouge

3189
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:05,248
He probably would say

3190
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:08,576
Sam Lyndon larouche yes

3191
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:14,208
He does reveal the Daniel Ellsberg releasing the Pentagon papers within a limited Hangout

3192
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:16,256
That was

3193
02:20:17,024 --> 02:20:20,096
CIA what else is what else is Forrest Gump doing now

3194
02:20:20,352 --> 02:20:26,496
I wanted to cut clips of that but it is just way too long of a ramp I can just tell you reset it

3195
02:20:28,288 --> 02:20:30,336
The rest of it is largely just bill Barr sucks

3196
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:31,360
He's got to go

3197
02:20:31,872 --> 02:20:33,920
I'm with you but

3198
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:36,224
The way they start the interview is Alex

3199
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:38,272
Presents this is like Trump is list

3200
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:39,552
Forget him your mess

3201
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:44,928
Joints in the background but

3202
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:51,328
Because of eclipse

3203
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,144
What is your disk quick synopsis in 5 minutes.

3204
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:54,912
Mechanics

3205
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:59,264
Run of the present knows you are in your background the things you've done it different different agencies and thanks

3206
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:01,056
What is your

3207
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:02,848
Five-minute synopsis with

3208
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:05,664
Show me a synopsis of the

3209
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:09,248
Number one William Barr has to go

3210
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:10,784
I said it a year ago

3211
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:12,064
The reason for

3212
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:13,856
Not only has he

3213
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:15,136
Really

3214
02:21:15,392 --> 02:21:16,160
Insulted

3215
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:17,952
And set it in a pro

3216
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:21,024
In fact

3217
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:23,328
And interfere with the

3218
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:26,144
You can do whatever you want

3219
02:21:27,168 --> 02:21:32,800
So maybe some of this is coming from Steve uncle Alex's like bar is turned onto maybe some let's go

3220
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:34,592
Yeah whatever

3221
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:37,408
I wonder what he saying on we're recording

3222
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:38,688
I wonder if

3223
02:21:38,944 --> 02:21:41,248
What is somebody had to explain to him

3224
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:42,784
Between Friday

3225
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:43,552
And Sunday

3226
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:45,856
Everybody

3227
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:49,696
His children damn his employees don't know shitt

3228
02:21:49,952 --> 02:21:51,232
Kids are smart enough to

3229
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:52,512
Spell maybe not

3230
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:55,840
Imagine that wrecks in between being

3231
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:57,376
Told very weird sex

3232
02:21:57,632 --> 02:21:58,144
Disinformation

3233
02:21:58,656 --> 02:21:59,680
Heize is like

3234
02:21:59,936 --> 02:22:00,448
Hey Dad

3235
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:01,728
This is a smartphone

3236
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:04,800
I think anybody who is interviewing

3237
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:09,152
Gavin McInnes and is excited about it and maybe doesn't get it

3238
02:22:11,456 --> 02:22:14,016
Alex's interviewing Steve but that doesn't stop him from taking

3239
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:14,784
Brakes

3240
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:16,064
Desales

3241
02:22:18,368 --> 02:22:20,160
Texas A&M 2007

3242
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:28,352
That's all the letters right here we show TV viewers

3243
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:31,168
This is the nanosilver that we have

3244

American biotech Labs LLC

And this is the silver at the Pentagon found with wounds shall in all of the private label

3248
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:42,688
That was a bad

3249

Family

At the end Alex is saying it's

Prove

3264
02:23:23,904 --> 02:23:24,416
For that

3265

And he specifically talking about the gargle

3266
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:30,304
So now he is implying that there is FDA approval

3267
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,328
For this

3268
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:32,608
And what you

3269
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:34,144
End up seeing here is really like

3270
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:36,704
I've seen a progression of Alex

3271
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:37,984
Testing the waters

3272
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:39,520
No consequences happening

3273
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:41,312
Any just getting bored

3274
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,848
Explicit the lies

3275
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:44,896
But he's telling about this

3276
02:23:45,152 --> 02:23:46,688
DSL for product and

3277
02:23:47,456 --> 02:23:50,016
I mean I don't know if there's ever going to be any consequences for it but

3278
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:52,064
I mean eventually just going to be saying

3279
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:53,344
The Crazies

3280
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:56,416
This is going to be making factual claims that are true

3281
02:23:56,672 --> 02:23:57,952
Because you'll be able to get away with it

3282
02:23:58,208 --> 02:23:59,232
Well there's two things

3283
02:23:59,488 --> 02:24:00,000
Things that I think

3284
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:01,792
Is 1

3285
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:02,560
Trumps

3286
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:05,120
Agencies

3287
02:24:05,376 --> 02:24:05,888
Are not going

3288
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:07,424
It seems unlikely

3289
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,704
Unless you direct

3290
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:10,752
She's totally legal

3291
02:24:11,264 --> 02:24:12,288
+ 2

3292
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:13,312
You must be stoked

3293
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:16,128
Jim Bakker is getting all of that attention because

3294
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:21,504
If anybody is going to be your hog up all the regulations

3295
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:27,904
It's still go under the radar sell it is evil in his inexplicable easy likes and Jim Bakker is going to be also

3296
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:30,464
Into this but it might be a

3297
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:31,232
Completely

3298
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:32,000
Front product

3299
02:24:32,256 --> 02:24:32,768
The Jim Bakker

3300
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:35,584
They got might be just a colloidal silver

3301
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:37,376
Suppose that the nano silver

3302
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:38,144
Whatever the case

3303
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:41,216
I mean I get really self-conscious about like

3304
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:43,008
But I don't fully understand

3305
02:24:43,264 --> 02:24:44,032
And a lot of the laws

3306
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:46,848
Suggesting

3307
02:24:47,104 --> 02:24:49,920
Did Alex is out of line when I realize like

3308
02:24:50,176 --> 02:24:50,944
No I found

3309
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:57,344
Very specific cases where the FDA is told like doctor Rhema labo

3310
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:01,952
It's a it's all I mean who knows we'll see if any consequences come

3311
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,024
I'm on this weird

3312
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,560
Position because like

3313
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:08,608
Some people have reached out been like

3314
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:12,448
Are you going to tell the FTC

3315
02:25:13,216 --> 02:25:13,728
No

3316
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:15,264
I'm I'm not going to

3317
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:16,288
But I also

3318
02:25:16,544 --> 02:25:17,568
Don't care if other people

3319
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:22,432
Yeah generally speaking of such a non-engagement policy with Alex but like

3320
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:26,272
If other people are going to take the information they were putting out and act on it

3321
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:27,040
Nothing I can do about

3322
02:25:27,808 --> 02:25:30,112
I'm not going to not cover this for fear of

3323
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:32,160
Like Mike

3324
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:33,184
Right

3325
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:36,768
If there were a situation where

3326
02:25:37,024 --> 02:25:37,536
I

3327
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:39,328
Had good reason to believe

3328
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:41,632
What Alex was doing could actually hurt

3329
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:42,912
The people who are buying

3330
02:25:43,168 --> 02:25:43,680
Supplement

3331
02:25:44,192 --> 02:25:44,960
Then I would

3332
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:46,752
Then I would

3333
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:48,288
Definitely make a

3334
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:49,824
Report

3335
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:51,104
Just haven't crossed that line

3336
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:51,872
And it's just like

3337
02:25:52,128 --> 02:25:53,408
Unethical scam

3338
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,432
Betty White

3339
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:56,992
Alex gets to talking to Steve

3340
02:25:57,504 --> 02:25:58,016
And

3341
02:25:58,272 --> 02:26:01,088
This is really interesting to me cuz you know the term deep state

3342
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:03,136
You know that means right nothing

3343
02:26:03,648 --> 02:26:08,000
It means nothing

3344
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:13,632
Just f****** regular is anybody in the Secretary of State position

3345
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:14,656
Yes

3346
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:15,680
The working again

3347
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:16,448
Well

3348
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:17,472
There are good

3349
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:18,752
Staters who are working

3350
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:19,776
Against the bad beef

3351
02:26:20,288 --> 02:26:22,336
He has made a book called The Deep state

3352
02:26:22,848 --> 02:26:24,384
Oh they're called the Patriots

3353
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:31,552
That mean I guess our conversation as highlighting ambiguity

3354
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:32,576
Yes right

3355
02:26:33,088 --> 02:26:34,368
It is always like

3356
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:35,392
These white

3357
02:26:35,648 --> 02:26:38,208
To the Alex calls at the

3358
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:38,976
Intelligent

3359
02:26:39,232 --> 02:26:42,304
Princeton government

3360
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:43,840
To Harvard

3361
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:44,608
What have you

3362
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:46,656
Alex's in the snow

3363
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:48,704
He seems we trying to

3364
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:51,520
Reclaim the term deep State and apply it to something

3365
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:52,544
Completely different

3366
02:26:55,104 --> 02:26:55,872
Populist

3367
02:26:57,152 --> 02:26:59,968
Mom taking care of anak populer

3368
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:02,272
Biscuits and gravy is the real deep state

3369
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:08,928
That's a real deep state

3370
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:13,536
Slate of the D in the corrupt elements of these states

3371
02:27:14,048 --> 02:27:14,560
I can get the fight

3372
02:27:14,816 --> 02:27:15,328
They won

3373
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:21,472
America show awake now the military so everybody I know so awake

3374
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:23,008
Want to go out and start

3375
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:24,032
Having a civil war

3376
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:26,080
What are the Communists in the Democrats

3377
02:27:26,336 --> 02:27:28,640
Bernie Sanders the world

3378
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:35,296
This big Happy Hunting Ground in America it's not going to go the way it did Rodger other places

3379
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:39,136
Want to go into a civil war

3380
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:40,928
Keep going well for the other side

3381
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:44,768
There won't be a civil war number one

3382
02:27:45,024 --> 02:27:45,792
People on

3383
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:48,864
The Socialist side

3384
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:52,192
Probably win but as I said a long time ago and I've

3385
02:27:53,984 --> 02:28:00,128
You have to be a multi-millionaire

3386
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:02,432
Meanest

3387
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:04,224
I'm here hello

3388
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,016
You should meet a lot of people

3389
02:28:06,528 --> 02:28:09,344
I'll look through the 8,000

3390
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:14,976
Some of the people in the the DSA rolls or do you want to do

3391
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:17,536
Ivan - thousands there

3392
02:28:17,792 --> 02:28:18,560
The

3393
02:28:19,328 --> 02:28:22,144
The thing I really

3394
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:24,448
Because it's Alex is like there's going to be a civil war

3395
02:28:28,032 --> 02:28:29,824
And his his reasoning is just

3396
02:28:30,336 --> 02:28:34,176
The left can't put up enough Noble slapping down

3397
02:28:34,432 --> 02:28:34,944
Basic

3398
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:38,016
Fear narrative is hilarious

3399
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:39,552
State as the mom

3400
02:28:40,064 --> 02:28:43,648
The cop making biscuits and gravy biscuits and gravy

3401
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:45,952
Face changing an old ladies Tire

3402
02:28:46,464 --> 02:28:51,840
If that's the real deep state that the evil version of the deep state would be a cop popping someone's tires

3403
02:28:52,608 --> 02:28:53,888
Give me the real cops

3404
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:57,728
Steve

3405
02:28:58,496 --> 02:29:00,800
How is like to have at least one really

3406
02:29:01,056 --> 02:29:02,336
Insane thing that he says

3407
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:05,664
I'm here is that one

3408
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:07,712
He's talking about the education

3409
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:09,504
Department in the United States

3410
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:12,832
And to his credit he does say that there should be better education

3411
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:15,904
Goodonyou Steve okay

3412
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:18,464
Interesting recommendation that I actually also

3413
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:19,232
Agree with him

3414
02:29:19,488 --> 02:29:21,792
Shoot Devil's into space

3415
02:29:22,048 --> 02:29:22,560
She doesn't come up

3416
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:26,144
He has he has a recommendation that I agree

3417
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:27,936
But Alex should hit him

3418
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:29,984
And I will mandate

3419
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:34,080
Every young person has to serve

3420
02:29:35,872 --> 02:29:39,456
Where their services but like Israel you was a service

3421
02:29:39,712 --> 02:29:40,224
2 years

3422
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:42,784
22 service to this country

3423
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:49,184
Powerful interview I hope the president listens to you

3424
02:29:49,696 --> 02:29:55,328
Sam who has also advocated somebody in specific I remember

3425
02:29:55,840 --> 02:30:01,984
Who advocated for just something similar to that Jordan is really interesting that when you listen to Alex for long enough it just be

3426
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:03,264
Becomes a farce

3427
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:08,896
Everything is internally inconsistent nothing means anything and think they were once seen as words of villains

3428
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:11,712
Expressing their evil plans are now the wise guidance

3429
02:30:11,968 --> 02:30:12,480
Of Heroes

3430
02:30:12,736 --> 02:30:13,504
Hope the president

3431
02:30:14,016 --> 02:30:14,528
Emotions

3432
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:18,112
Goodnight clip Steven saying when he takes over the Department of Education

3433
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:20,672
He would make volumes due to years of

3434
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:22,208
Compulsory service to the country

3435
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:24,256
Not necessarily to the military button

3436
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:25,536
Service to the country

3437
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:29,888
This is legitimately one of the first things that Alex covered in

3438
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:31,424
The Obama Deception

3439
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:37,824
Obama's Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and selling big ideas for a mare

3440
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:39,872
Which proposed that all Americans

3441
02:30:40,128 --> 02:30:41,920
Between the ages of 18 and 25

3442
02:30:42,176 --> 02:30:43,200
What do 3 months

3443
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:45,248
Of some form of community service

3444
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:47,040
Steve wants them to do

3445
02:30:47,296 --> 02:30:49,088
8 times that much service

3446
02:30:50,368 --> 02:30:52,672
In The Obama Deception and Analysis narratives

3447
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:57,280
That's Rob's plan was Clear Proof of Obama Obama youth

3448
02:30:57,536 --> 02:31:00,096
Course his own gigantic team of indoctrinated young person

3449
02:31:00,352 --> 02:31:02,656
Who do his bidding that was just planted it takes 3 months

3450
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:04,448
Naturally in the film his

3451
02:31:04,704 --> 02:31:09,056
The argument was accompanied by shots of young black men in ROTC exercises

3452
02:31:09,568 --> 02:31:11,872
The drive home the racism that was behind this narrative

3453
02:31:12,384 --> 02:31:13,664
But let's not get bogged down on that

3454
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:15,712
A very obvious aspect of the naira

3455
02:31:16,992 --> 02:31:18,272
Alex never thought that the

3456
02:31:18,528 --> 02:31:21,344
The act of suggesting some kind of mandatory community service

3457
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:24,416
Why is that the same thing as creating Obama you

3458
02:31:24,928 --> 02:31:25,696
Because if he did

3459
02:31:25,952 --> 02:31:26,976
He would have the same response

3460
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:27,744
Text Steve

3461
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,280
Suggesting a more severe

3462
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:31,072
Version of proposed

3463
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:32,608
This was never since

3464
02:31:33,376 --> 02:31:34,912
It was always just a cheap way Alex

3465
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:35,936
Could attack Obama

3466
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:37,216
And waked Stoke race

3467
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:38,240
Spheres in his audience

3468
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:40,032
All right did they already had

3469
02:31:40,288 --> 02:31:41,312
About a black president

3470
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:42,848
Not only is the president black

3471
02:31:43,104 --> 02:31:45,664
He's also creating a gigantic Army of young black men

3472
02:31:46,176 --> 02:31:46,688
Get scared

3473
02:31:47,456 --> 02:31:50,272
It's an easy way to get get away with that sort of s***

3474
02:31:50,528 --> 02:31:51,296
This case is

3475
02:31:51,552 --> 02:31:52,320
Really good example of why

3476
02:31:53,088 --> 02:31:53,600
Because

3477
02:31:54,112 --> 02:31:59,744
If you really listen it does make a lot of sense to explore some kind of mandatory public service program for the country

3478
02:32:00,256 --> 02:32:03,328
Not just for the country sake but also for all the individual citizen

3479
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:06,144
The experience of volunteering at a soup kitchen

3480
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:07,424
Cleaning up a forest

3481
02:32:07,936 --> 02:32:08,448
Transformative

3482
02:32:09,216 --> 02:32:09,984
Aw X

3483
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:10,752
Them folks

3484
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:11,520
Need a little push

3485
02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:14,336
Do things that benefit themselves as well as the larger society

3486
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:16,896
Because this isn't intuitively pretty

3487
02:32:17,152 --> 02:32:18,944
Decent idea it doesn't some nuts

3488
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,224
Received we suggested

3489
02:32:20,736 --> 02:32:23,552
Unless you listen to Alex for years and actually paid attention

3490
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:25,856
You never remember this is a major talking

3491
02:32:26,112 --> 02:32:27,648
Borders anti-obama coverage

3492
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:30,208
But he was going to enslave your children

3493
02:32:30,976 --> 02:32:33,792
Clearly a philosophical opposition to mandatory public service

3494
02:32:34,048 --> 02:32:37,632
What was motivating Alex's coverage of Raleigh

3495
02:32:38,912 --> 02:32:39,936
That raises the question

3496
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:40,960
What was

3497
02:32:41,216 --> 02:32:42,752
Oh well I mean he was black

3498
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:43,776
Right

3499
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:49,920
Then why is it so hard forever to just be like

3500
02:32:50,176 --> 02:32:52,480
But that's that's what allowed the narratives are

3501
02:32:54,784 --> 02:32:57,600
Easy thing to adjust

3502
02:32:57,856 --> 02:32:58,880
This all is

3503
02:32:59,136 --> 02:33:00,160
Especially now

3504
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:02,208
The light of this

3505
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:03,232
So

3506
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:05,792
It's just so easy

3507
02:33:07,584 --> 02:33:09,120
I think so

3508
02:33:09,376 --> 02:33:14,496
The case for anti-trump rhetoric

3509
02:33:15,008 --> 02:33:15,776
Of similar

3510
02:33:17,056 --> 02:33:17,568
I don't remember.

3511
02:33:17,824 --> 02:33:19,872
Specifics

3512
02:33:20,384 --> 02:33:22,688
What we talked about earlier the ideas that when

3513
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:23,456
He came in

3514
02:33:23,712 --> 02:33:24,224
Transition

3515
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:25,248
Firing the attorney

3516
02:33:26,784 --> 02:33:31,904
Positive that there are people who

3517
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:39,328
That is the same thing it turns like that's easy easy thing to do

3518
02:33:40,608 --> 02:33:41,376
Mandatory service

3519
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:43,424
Easy easy narrative

3520
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,192
Bailed

3521
02:33:44,704 --> 02:33:48,544
I think it's what frustrates me for those easy narratives

3522
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:49,568
Is if we want

3523
02:33:49,824 --> 02:33:50,592
What's on the left and

3524
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:51,360
Easy narrative

3525
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:52,384
We have

3526
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:53,920
10 million of them

3527
02:33:54,176 --> 02:33:55,456
That he is provided us

3528
02:33:55,712 --> 02:33:59,296
Instantly like if you want an easy narrative he came into office

3529
02:33:59,552 --> 02:34:00,576
Violating the

3530
02:34:01,344 --> 02:34:04,672
Dump and go if you want another easy narrative it's that

3531
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:08,000
If you want another easy narrative

3532
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:11,072
We can just do one we can just do one and repeat

3533
02:34:11,584 --> 02:34:13,120
It's over and over and over

3534
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:14,400
Instead everybody asked

3535
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:16,960
Talk about the new Dushore thing that he

3536
02:34:17,472 --> 02:34:18,752
Priming

3537
02:34:19,008 --> 02:34:19,520
Getting away with this

3538
02:34:20,032 --> 02:34:20,544
It's over it's

3539
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:21,824
It's too much

3540
02:34:22,336 --> 02:34:23,616
So I agree with you

3541
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:26,176
And we now say goodbye to Steve

3542
02:34:26,688 --> 02:34:30,784
Now he has made this very rational suggestion that Alex should punch him for

3543
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:32,064
Absolutely

3544
02:34:33,344 --> 02:34:34,112
We now get

3545
02:34:34,624 --> 02:34:35,136
Another guess

3546
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:39,744
Oh no I might have just ignored this guy asks if he's had a couple of really stupid things

3547
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,048
Also Alex does introduction

3548
02:34:42,304 --> 02:34:45,376
Along With You Belong To The City

3549
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:46,912
And we always need some nice taste

3550
02:34:47,168 --> 02:34:53,312
Text Master 6969

3551
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:55,104
These grooves

3552
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:56,128
Are sick

3553
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:03,040
Saxophone is amazing

3554
02:35:06,368 --> 02:35:08,928
Call Victor

3555
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:20,192
Lakeland is a

3556
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:25,824
Intelligence agency

3557
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:31,968
Talk about a whole host of subjects

3558
02:35:38,624 --> 02:35:42,464
I never heard of this guy in Alex's introducing him as a guy who's with the defense

3559
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:43,488
Intelligence agency

3560
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:44,768
That's a

3561
02:35:45,536 --> 02:35:46,304
Albee Al legitimate

3562
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:47,584
Kind of thing

3563
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:50,912
He is a recovering lawyer

3564
02:35:51,424 --> 02:35:57,056
I'm not sure if I necessarily believe that this guy Ivan reikland was ever employed by the defense intelligence

3565
02:35:58,336 --> 02:36:04,480
That's something that is bio claims that I was reading but in the world of Infowars I've learned that often times claims and working in

3566
02:36:04,736 --> 02:36:07,552
Intelligence are not to be taken at face value

3567
02:36:08,064 --> 02:36:11,392
Importing 18 Ivan was a guest on the John Batchelor Show podcast

3568
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:12,928
When is Bayou

3569
02:36:13,184 --> 02:36:16,512
He doesn't mention working for the DIA however there is this B

3570
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:20,864
Quotes Ivan holds a ba in Russian Spanish Russia and East

3571
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:22,144
European studies

3572
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:24,704
Igd and

3573
02:36:25,216 --> 02:36:28,544
The MS in strategic intelligence program at the defense

3574
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:29,568
Intelligence agency

3575
02:36:29,824 --> 02:36:30,336
Okay

3576
02:36:30,848 --> 02:36:32,128
Now that freezing is

3577
02:36:32,896 --> 02:36:33,664
It's a little bit different than

3578
02:36:34,176 --> 02:36:34,688
He worked for the day

3579
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:36,480
It is a little bit little bit

3580
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:40,832
41 the Russian Spanish degrees as well as the Jade either

3581
02:36:41,088 --> 02:36:42,624
The lawyer degree

3582
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:43,904
Degrees that he

3583
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:45,696
He holds those degrees

3584
02:36:46,464 --> 02:36:47,488
Conversely just as the

3585
02:36:47,744 --> 02:36:48,256
Attend

3586
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:50,816
The MS in strategic intelligence program

3587
02:36:52,864 --> 02:36:53,376
Completed it

3588
02:36:54,144 --> 02:36:57,728
It's also the MS in strategic intelligence that's a master's of science

3589
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:00,032
Conferred bias

3590
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:01,568
Generally speaking

3591
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:03,872
You can get that degree in a bunch of schools

3592
02:37:04,128 --> 02:37:08,992
Quick Google search finds programs available at Northeastern Georgetown St Louis University among other

3593
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:10,272
But here's the thing

3594
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:12,832
The defense intelligence agency is not

3595
02:37:13,088 --> 02:37:13,600
Academica

3596
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:17,440
It doesn't make sense to claim that you have a degree from the DIA

3597
02:37:17,952 --> 02:37:18,464
Since they're not at

3598
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:19,488
Degree granted

3599
02:37:19,744 --> 02:37:24,096
He also has a degree of the Hard Knocks tan I guess

3600
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:27,936
The correct version of this claim would be to say that you have a masters

3601
02:37:28,192 --> 02:37:29,728
Science in strategic intelligence

3602
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:31,776
It's from the National Intelligence universe

3603
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:34,336
Who do the school that's Metro prepare people for work

3604
02:37:34,848 --> 02:37:36,128
Relations like the defense intelligence

3605
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:38,688
That is where he would get the degree

3606
02:37:38,944 --> 02:37:42,016
You would have got it at another establishment of fireworks

3607
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:43,808
This kind of leads me not

3608
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:45,856
This piece of Ivan's Back Store

3609
02:37:46,624 --> 02:37:50,976
I've no idea. Maybe he just botched his bio but that doesn't seem like something intelligent

3610
02:37:51,232 --> 02:37:56,608
Professional look do I have no idea information is sometimes important for enemies and allies

3611
02:37:59,424 --> 02:38:05,568
No that's that's another method on rational eyes is being wrong all the time is part of the plan

3612
02:38:07,104 --> 02:38:08,128
Sun Soo level

3613
02:38:08,384 --> 02:38:09,664
That's that's Art of War

3614
02:38:10,944 --> 02:38:13,504
Is Sun Soo

3615
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:20,160
Que son to what about you I think you you solved it thank you solve the puzzle

3616
02:38:20,928 --> 02:38:23,488
Sam ekstrom Confucius

3617
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:27,072
Okay so even if that piece of Ivan story is a little murky

3618
02:38:27,328 --> 02:38:27,840
Some pieces

3619
02:38:28,096 --> 02:38:28,864
Are little clear

3620
02:38:29,632 --> 02:38:34,240
He's probably most notable publicly for trying to run for Tim Kaine senate seat

3621
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:36,800
In Virginia in the 2018 midterm election

3622
02:38:37,824 --> 02:38:43,968
I've engaged the viability of his campaign by doing a 1776 mile run through all the time

3623
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:45,504
Towns and cities in Virginia

3624
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:47,296
Back in August 2017

3625
02:38:47,808 --> 02:38:50,880
Alright parently that went well Sue decided to throw his hat into the ring

3626
02:38:51,392 --> 02:38:54,720
Ultimately he was denied inclusion from the ballot for the Republican

3627
02:38:54,976 --> 02:38:59,328
Primary with the Virginia GOP saying that he failed to gather the required number of signatures

3628
02:39:00,352 --> 02:39:04,960
I've been claimed that he had enough signatures and he's being kept off the ballot for some unknown political reason

3629
02:39:05,728 --> 02:39:07,264
According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch

3630
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:10,592
The Virginia Republican party contacted Ivan on his Facebook

3631
02:39:10,848 --> 02:39:12,384
Book page which seems a little weird

3632
02:39:12,896 --> 02:39:15,456
Seems like Communications like this might be appropriate somewhere else

3633
02:39:15,712 --> 02:39:16,480
Maybe I've no idea

3634
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:19,552
Anyway they contacted him saying quote

3635
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:23,904
Unfortunately many of the signatures collected in the 9th congressional district were not valid

3636
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:25,696
And for that reason you would disqualify

3637
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:29,536
Odds are this isn't an issue fraud or anything like that

3638
02:39:30,048 --> 02:39:34,400
It's likely that a ton of signatures he got were fake names or non registered voters

3639
02:39:34,656 --> 02:39:39,008
So they wouldn't make it past the verification step that the party goes through when putting people on a bow

3640
02:39:39,776 --> 02:39:43,360
So you know to get on the ballot in Virginia you have to gather 10,000

3641
02:39:43,872 --> 02:39:44,640
But more important

3642
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:46,432
You have to have 400

3643
02:39:46,688 --> 02:39:47,456
From each of the 11

3644
02:39:47,712 --> 02:39:48,480
Districts in the state

3645
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:52,832
It's entirely possible that he had over 10,000 total signatures

3646
02:39:53,088 --> 02:39:56,672
But like 450 in the Ninth District and 100 of them were bogus

3647
02:39:57,184 --> 02:39:58,208
And that'll end up getting you qualify

3648
02:39:58,464 --> 02:39:59,488
Got disqualified right there

3649
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:03,072
Probably along the lines of what happened

3650
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:04,352
Anyway

3651
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:06,400
I've decided to sue the Virginia Republic

3652
02:40:06,656 --> 02:40:08,192
Party City would end up losing

3653
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:09,984
Things got a little bit ugly

3654
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:12,032
Was Ivan claiming the party and told him to

3655
02:40:12,288 --> 02:40:13,568
Just go vote for another candidate

3656
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:17,408
Which prompted the Virginia GOP to release a statement saying he was full of s***

3657
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:21,248
Didn't use that kind of Old English but that was their main point

3658
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:23,296
So well I was going through all day

3659
02:40:23,808 --> 02:40:26,112
It just so happened to be around the same time

3660
02:40:26,368 --> 02:40:30,208
Did Alex went to DC to do that press conference of his

3661
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:36,864
And the press conference is so inconsequential in hindsight that I really don't remember what the goal is it was

3662
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:40,448
It was about Alex getting sued and may be kicked off Facebook Lionel I don't know

3663
02:40:40,704 --> 02:40:41,984
I think it's usually about 4

3664
02:40:42,496 --> 02:40:45,312
Somewhere another

3665
02:40:45,824 --> 02:40:48,896
But our friend Jared Holt over it right wing watch was there

3666
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:51,712
And there's an interesting blurb in his article

3667
02:40:51,968 --> 02:40:53,504
That he wrote about going to the event

3668
02:40:54,016 --> 02:41:00,160
Steven raichlen who's seeking election to the Senate in Virginia and has earned the endorsement of Mike Flynn June

3669
02:41:00,672 --> 02:41:02,208
Stop Jones near the Vic

3670
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:02,976
Compress pit

3671
02:41:03,232 --> 02:41:06,560
Handed him a business card and asked if he could speak in front of the assembled crowd

3672
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:09,632
Shortly afterward Jones introduced on stage

3673
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:16,544
Franklin told the crowd that contrary to reports he had actually earned enough signatures to run in the Republican primary

3674
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:18,080
Republican party officials

3675
02:41:18,336 --> 02:41:19,104
Unfairly just koala

3676
02:41:19,360 --> 02:41:20,384
I'm sure

3677
02:41:21,152 --> 02:41:23,456
Great this is where the two men pass

3678
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:24,224
First cross

3679
02:41:24,480 --> 02:41:24,992
Then they met

3680
02:41:25,504 --> 02:41:28,320
And Alex not knowing this guy at all he just let him get up

3681
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:29,600
Speak I can't believe

3682
02:41:30,112 --> 02:41:32,160
He complained about not getting on the bus

3683
02:41:32,416 --> 02:41:33,184
I can absolutely

3684
02:41:36,512 --> 02:41:39,840
Ivan speech was followed up by Jerome corsi giving a speech

3685
02:41:40,096 --> 02:41:41,632
That included this line

3686
02:41:41,888 --> 02:41:48,032
Qanon is military intelligence and close to Trump

3687
02:41:52,128 --> 02:41:53,152
It's hard to remember anything

3688
02:41:53,408 --> 02:41:54,944
There's so many different

3689
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:55,968
Narratives that

3690
02:41:56,224 --> 02:41:56,736
Contradict

3691
02:41:56,992 --> 02:41:57,760
Each other that shouldn

3692
02:41:58,272 --> 02:41:58,784
That

3693
02:41:59,296 --> 02:42:00,064
Keep coming up

3694
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:01,344
Is a bomber

3695
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:05,952
But speaking before corsi defending qanon vitamin foreshadow

3696
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:09,792
Because in August 2019 bra story reported on a conference

3697
02:42:10,048 --> 02:42:12,864
It was being organised to raise money for Mike Flynn.

3698
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:15,424
They had a real heavy qanon overlap

3699
02:42:15,936 --> 02:42:19,264
The organizer had posted a ton about Q on Twitter

3700
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:20,544
The conferences logo is

3701
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:22,592
Does the US flag with stars rearranged

3702
02:42:22,848 --> 02:42:23,616
BBQ

3703
02:42:23,872 --> 02:42:24,640
Speakers included

3704
02:42:24,896 --> 02:42:27,200
Two weirdos like Bill Mitchell and joy Villa

3705
02:42:27,456 --> 02:42:28,736
Add one of the other speakers

3706
02:42:28,992 --> 02:42:29,760
You guessed it

3707
02:42:30,016 --> 02:42:31,296
Ivan Rangel

3708
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:32,320
Hey

3709
02:42:32,832 --> 02:42:35,392
It clear that ranklin did serve in the National Guard

3710
02:42:35,648 --> 02:42:37,952
I can find evidence of that

3711
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:39,232
2010 he was at

3712
02:42:39,744 --> 02:42:40,256
Captain of the Guard

3713
02:42:40,512 --> 02:42:43,840
I don't have any reason to necessarily doubt his claims that he was a Green Beret

3714
02:42:44,096 --> 02:42:46,144
The other stuff in his bio just doesn't sit right with me

3715
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:49,472
It seems pretty dubious defense intelligence

3716
02:42:49,728 --> 02:42:50,752
Particularly

3717
02:42:51,008 --> 02:42:55,616
Also in 2015 tried to kick-start a documentary about Vladimir Putin called

3718
02:42:55,872 --> 02:42:57,920
15 years riding the Russian bear

3719
02:42:58,432 --> 02:43:00,224
The cover of witches just a shot of Putin

3720
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:03,040
Oh I would have gone with Putin on the Ritz

3721
02:43:03,296 --> 02:43:06,368
Oh that's good that's not a bad

3722
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:07,392
I want to the

3723
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:12,512
Trailer for his documentary and I read a press release that he put out trying to raise funds and honestly I have

3724
02:43:12,768 --> 02:43:14,816
No idea what the angle on the film was

3725
02:43:15,072 --> 02:43:16,352
I don't know if it's pro-putin I don't know

3726
02:43:16,608 --> 02:43:18,144
I don't know if it's neutral

3727
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:19,168
I have no idea

3728
02:43:19,424 --> 02:43:20,704
He's just a bear you're riding a bear

3729
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:27,104
All this stuff is irrelevant Ivan's just on the show today cuz he tweeted the Trump should pardon Rodger Stone they got Alex's it

3730
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:28,384
Santana Row

3731
02:43:29,408 --> 02:43:29,920
Anyway here's the

3732
02:43:30,176 --> 02:43:31,968
Intro to the interview which is

3733
02:43:32,224 --> 02:43:32,736
The bad news

3734
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:36,576
Thanks for joining us I see you're there in your car

3735
02:43:37,856 --> 02:43:39,392
Probably somewhere in Virginia

3736
02:43:39,648 --> 02:43:45,792
Have a great start to this interview Ivan is Skyping in from his car here in the car are you driving

3737
02:43:46,048 --> 02:43:47,072
Right now cuz that's safe

3738
02:43:47,328 --> 02:43:48,096
That's almost

3739
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:49,120
Like Alex

3740
02:43:49,376 --> 02:43:55,520
What are you doing what are you doing well I can't leave my dog in here and I was going to go to Target but you called me a little

3741
02:44:02,176 --> 02:44:08,320
I've been living here about 3 weeks and it's mainly due to the wonderful and perfect

3742
02:44:08,576 --> 02:44:14,464
, policy put together but I don't have an office in my wife won't let me call him but

3743
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:15,232
How you doing

3744
02:44:18,304 --> 02:44:19,072
I know you will

3745
02:44:19,328 --> 02:44:20,352
Not call fashion

3746
02:44:22,656 --> 02:44:24,192
I am the primary money-maker

3747
02:44:24,704 --> 02:44:26,752
Honey are you calling fascist again

3748
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:28,544
We have a conversation

3749
02:44:30,848 --> 02:44:31,872
It seems like a

3750
02:44:32,128 --> 02:44:38,272
It's mostly just about how like you need to Pardon Rodger Trump needs pardon Rodger

3751
02:44:38,528 --> 02:44:40,576
You did nothing wrong all this

3752
02:44:41,344 --> 02:44:44,160
Also he really specifically wants to talk about Mike

3753
02:44:44,416 --> 02:44:44,928
Flynn

3754
02:44:45,184 --> 02:44:45,952
Getting

3755
02:44:46,208 --> 02:44:47,232
Light off

3756
02:44:47,488 --> 02:44:49,024
The

3757
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:51,584
And some of this has to do with a good to clear Association

3758
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:53,632
I'm in like Flynn I'm not entirely sure what it is

3759
02:44:53,888 --> 02:44:57,728
Mike Flynn son Michael and Junior endorsement when he ran for

3760
02:44:59,776 --> 02:45:01,312
And you know that

3761
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:03,872
Conference that he spoke at those to a nonadjacent

3762
02:45:04,128 --> 02:45:07,200
Also was in order to raise money for Mike Flynn

3763
02:45:07,456 --> 02:45:09,760
There's some sort of connection there but

3764
02:45:10,528 --> 02:45:11,552
I honestly can't be bothered

3765
02:45:11,808 --> 02:45:13,344
Figure it out I don't really care

3766
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:17,440
They get to talkin about like the Democratic race

3767
02:45:18,976 --> 02:45:19,744
And

3768
02:45:20,256 --> 02:45:21,024
Ivan

3769
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:22,816
He speculates that if Bernie

3770
02:45:23,328 --> 02:45:23,840
Run

3771
02:45:24,352 --> 02:45:27,680
Tulsi gabbard probably going to be his running mate be too

3772
02:45:28,704 --> 02:45:29,472
Sure sorry

3773
02:45:29,728 --> 02:45:30,496
Sorry for the laughter

3774
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:34,592
Apologize for the

3775
02:45:34,848 --> 02:45:35,616
To condemn

3776
02:45:36,128 --> 02:45:36,640
If I can

3777
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:37,408
Syrian War

3778
02:45:37,664 --> 02:45:38,432
Apologies

3779
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:43,552
So that's one thing that he speculates about in that you can laugh at that but I really care.

3780
02:45:43,808 --> 02:45:45,856
Construct it like it's not really interested

3781
02:45:46,112 --> 02:45:47,904
Now his theories about Bloomberg

3782
02:45:48,416 --> 02:45:48,928
On the other hand

3783
02:45:49,696 --> 02:45:50,976
Far more interesting of it

3784
02:45:51,744 --> 02:45:52,256
Bloomberg

3785
02:45:54,304 --> 02:45:56,352
To take a look and see the biggest indicator

3786
02:45:56,864 --> 02:45:59,424
Is being accurate is that

3787
02:46:00,192 --> 02:46:00,960
If Hillary Clinton

3788
02:46:01,472 --> 02:46:02,752
Text her residency

3789
02:46:03,008 --> 02:46:04,287
And moves it from New York to

3790
02:46:05,055 --> 02:46:06,079
Arkansas or elsewhere

3791
02:46:06,847 --> 02:46:09,407
Give me the biggest indicator that she's going to be the running mate with Bloomberg

3792
02:46:10,687 --> 02:46:13,759
Because if you look at bloomers

3793
02:46:18,879 --> 02:46:23,487
Play accordion Constitution I can't I can't cite the exact statue

3794
02:46:23,743 --> 02:46:24,767
Surprise

3795
02:46:25,023 --> 02:46:27,071
You cannot have that so the president and the vice

3796
02:46:28,351 --> 02:46:29,631
Constitution

3797
02:46:30,655 --> 02:46:34,751
Two different states Illinois or Arkansas

3798
02:46:36,031 --> 02:46:38,079
Done deal she's going to jump in the race immediately after

3799
02:46:39,103 --> 02:46:42,943
It might surprise you to learn that noted constitutional scholar Alex Jones

3800
02:46:43,199 --> 02:46:44,735
Defense intelligence agency

3801
02:46:44,991 --> 02:46:48,831
The guests are completely wrong about the Constitution

3802
02:46:50,623 --> 02:46:53,951
Shut up that fun speculating

3803
02:46:54,207 --> 02:47:00,351
How they might get to yell about Hillary Clinton again Basics misunderstand

3804
02:47:00,607 --> 02:47:02,399
The Constitution

3805
02:47:02,655 --> 02:47:03,167
And which says quote

3806
02:47:03,679 --> 02:47:08,031
The electors shall meet in their respective States invoked by ballot for 2-person

3807
02:47:08,287 --> 02:47:11,359
So who won at least she'll not be inhabited

3808
02:47:11,615 --> 02:47:13,151
Of the same state with themselves

3809
02:47:13,919 --> 02:47:18,783
It's important to understand that until 1804 members of The Electoral College would vote for

3810
02:47:19,039 --> 02:47:19,551
To Canada

3811
02:47:20,063 --> 02:47:23,135
And the top vote-getter would be president and the runner-up would be Vice

3812
02:47:23,647 --> 02:47:24,415
And that's why we had

3813
02:47:24,671 --> 02:47:30,559
Had so many great wonderful President Thomas Jefferson love his

3814
02:47:30,815 --> 02:47:32,607
After that point the process change

3815
02:47:32,863 --> 02:47:33,887
And now lectors

3816
02:47:34,143 --> 02:47:36,191
Book spratley for President and Vice

3817
02:47:36,447 --> 02:47:40,799
Which is to say that just because in 2016 Hillary was running with Tim Kaine

3818
02:47:41,055 --> 02:47:43,359
It doesn't mean that every electoral votes for her

3819
02:47:43,615 --> 02:47:44,639
The president has to vote

3820
02:47:46,687 --> 02:47:48,223
This actually happened in the 20s

3821
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:48,991
16 election

3822
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:54,111
There was an elector in Texas who voted for Mike Pence for vice president

3823
02:47:54,879 --> 02:47:58,719
Is this kind of rare but it does happen from time to time

3824
02:47:59,487 --> 02:48:01,535
In the Constitution the rules that elect

3825
02:48:01,791 --> 02:48:02,303
Doctors could not

3826
02:48:02,815 --> 02:48:03,839
Both their vote

3827
02:48:04,351 --> 02:48:06,143
For candidates from the same state

3828
02:48:06,655 --> 02:48:07,167
So if

3829
02:48:07,423 --> 02:48:08,703
I were in elector

3830
02:48:09,215 --> 02:48:11,263
I could cast a vote for someone from Illinois

3831
02:48:11,775 --> 02:48:14,847
My other vote would have to go to a candidate from another state

3832
02:48:15,615 --> 02:48:17,663
This was a rule designed to lessen the influence

3833
02:48:17,919 --> 02:48:18,687
The larger States

3834
02:48:18,943 --> 02:48:21,503
I need to encourage folks not to just vote for their local allies

3835
02:48:22,527 --> 02:48:24,063
This became a bit of a talking point

3836
02:48:24,575 --> 02:48:26,367
During the 2016 GOP

3837
02:48:26,623 --> 02:48:27,135
The primary

3838
02:48:27,391 --> 02:48:29,951
Because Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio were both from

3839
02:48:30,207 --> 02:48:30,719
From Florida

3840
02:48:30,975 --> 02:48:33,023
And Ted Cruz and Rick Perry we're both from text

3841
02:48:34,047 --> 02:48:39,679
Shallow analysis and misinformed talk right people to believe that these combos of president and vice president couldn't

3842
02:48:39,935 --> 02:48:40,447
Not happen

3843
02:48:40,703 --> 02:48:41,215
But that wasn't

3844
02:48:41,471 --> 02:48:41,983
True

3845
02:48:42,239 --> 02:48:47,359
In reality the conversation was that it would be super unwise for these combos to happen and here's why

3846
02:48:48,383 --> 02:48:49,407
If Bush and Rubio tea

3847
02:48:49,919 --> 02:48:52,735
All of Florida's electors could vote for bush for president

3848
02:48:52,991 --> 02:48:53,503
But they could

3849
02:48:53,759 --> 02:48:55,551
Not vote for Rubio also

3850
02:48:55,807 --> 02:48:56,319
For vice president

3851
02:48:56,831 --> 02:48:58,367
In the same would hold True For Crews

3852
02:48:58,623 --> 02:48:59,391
I am.

3853
02:48:59,647 --> 02:49:00,159
In Texas

3854
02:49:00,671 --> 02:49:06,303
If these dudes one by gigantic margins it really wouldn't matter too much but if it were close race this could be a huge

3855
02:49:06,559 --> 02:49:09,375
Problems since Florida has 29 electoral votes

3856
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:10,655
And Texas has 38

3857
02:49:11,423 --> 02:49:13,983
You never want to feel either of these

3858
02:49:14,751 --> 02:49:17,311
Since you d'essential to be playing at a severe disadvantage

3859
02:49:17,567 --> 02:49:20,127
And risk the possibility of electing Bush or Cruz

3860
02:49:20,383 --> 02:49:24,479
Call Tim Kaine ends up getting most votes for VP right and that would be f****** weird

3861
02:49:25,503 --> 02:49:29,343
In terms of the current day it's fair to assume that the Democratic party would not want to have

3862
02:49:29,599 --> 02:49:32,415
A presidential candidate and vice president from New York

3863
02:49:32,671 --> 02:49:34,463
Since I have 29 electoral votes

3864
02:49:34,719 --> 02:49:35,487
And that would introduce omit

3865
02:49:36,511 --> 02:49:37,791
So what's interesting here is that the

3866
02:49:38,047 --> 02:49:41,119
The phenomena that Alex and I are discussing his kind of real

3867
02:49:41,375 --> 02:49:43,167
Literally no idea what they're talking

3868
02:49:43,935 --> 02:49:47,519
He thinks the Constitution doesn't allow people from the same state to run on the same ticket

3869
02:49:47,775 --> 02:49:48,543
Absolutely not

3870
02:49:48,799 --> 02:49:50,335
True however behind

3871
02:49:50,591 --> 02:49:52,127
They're searching that if Hillary

3872
02:49:52,383 --> 02:49:54,175
To somehow make herself from Arkansas now

3873
02:49:54,431 --> 02:49:55,455
It would be an indication that

3874
02:49:55,711 --> 02:49:56,223
She's Angling

3875
02:49:56,479 --> 02:49:58,271
Do not block electoral voting restrictions

3876
02:49:58,527 --> 02:50:00,063
Since we're being Bloomberg VP

3877
02:50:00,319 --> 02:50:01,087
How to make sense

3878
02:50:01,343 --> 02:50:01,855
It does

3879
02:50:02,111 --> 02:50:05,951
I'm not sure what the official rules are about changing your home state but I don't think it would work

3880
02:50:06,207 --> 02:50:06,975
Working this case for Hillary

3881
02:50:07,743 --> 02:50:08,511
She's established

3882
02:50:08,767 --> 02:50:10,815
For years that a primary residence is in

3883
02:50:11,071 --> 02:50:12,351
Chappaqua New York

3884
02:50:12,607 --> 02:50:13,887
She was a senator from New York

3885
02:50:14,143 --> 02:50:18,239
And I don't know if she could be like whoops I'm actually resident Arkansas and then everyone's going to be like okay

3886
02:50:18,495 --> 02:50:19,007
Cool

3887
02:50:19,263 --> 02:50:21,055
If it would then why would

3888
02:50:21,567 --> 02:50:24,895
And anybody could just pull out the rules the Electoral College by having two homes

3889
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:25,919
See ya

3890
02:50:26,431 --> 02:50:28,223
I mean I don't think it even

3891
02:50:28,735 --> 02:50:29,503
I don't think anybody

3892
02:50:30,015 --> 02:50:30,527
Okay

3893
02:50:30,783 --> 02:50:34,111
That was back whenever it took a long time to move

3894
02:50:39,231 --> 02:50:40,511
Because it would take

3895
02:50:41,023 --> 02:50:42,303
6 weeks to move

3896
02:50:43,071 --> 02:50:45,119
New York to Florida

3897
02:50:45,631 --> 02:50:48,191
I don't think anybody cares about that just

3898
02:50:48,447 --> 02:50:50,751
Because all of our politicians are from a million different

3899
02:50:51,007 --> 02:50:53,055
Prince States and they all move around all the time

3900
02:50:53,311 --> 02:50:55,615
Everybody knows that they'll move somewhere if they want to run

3901
02:50:55,871 --> 02:50:57,663
In a better or more

3902
02:50:58,687 --> 02:50:59,455
Favorable play

3903
02:50:59,711 --> 02:51:00,991
Placer items

3904
02:51:01,247 --> 02:51:03,295
Mean that I couldn't find

3905
02:51:03,551 --> 02:51:05,343
Like these specific regulations about like

3906
02:51:05,599 --> 02:51:09,183
Requirements for your home state

3907
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:11,487
Comes down to like you have to have lived in the United States

3908
02:51:11,743 --> 02:51:14,047
14 years

3909
02:51:14,559 --> 02:51:16,095
I don't know what the cut and dry

3910
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:18,655
But I really don't

3911
02:51:18,911 --> 02:51:19,935
Think Hillary could get around

3912
02:51:20,191 --> 02:51:20,703
Being from

3913
02:51:21,215 --> 02:51:21,727
New York

3914
02:51:23,263 --> 02:51:24,799
Even as far as that goes like

3915
02:51:25,055 --> 02:51:27,871
She probably if you want to have this conversation you wouldn't use Ark

3916
02:51:28,127 --> 02:51:29,407
Consol you wouldn't use Illinois

3917
02:51:29,663 --> 02:51:31,711
You would say that you changed being resident of

3918
02:51:31,967 --> 02:51:32,479
DC

3919
02:51:32,991 --> 02:51:34,015
Did the clintons have an SP

3920
02:51:34,271 --> 02:51:35,807
Where she live when she was in office

3921
02:51:36,575 --> 02:51:40,415
That's a much easier salad return by Kyle rages going to say that she lives in

3922
02:51:41,951 --> 02:51:45,535
God they want Hillary so bad cuz she's

3923
02:51:45,791 --> 02:51:48,351
The easiest everyone hates their now

3924
02:51:48,607 --> 02:51:49,375
Everyone

3925
02:51:49,631 --> 02:51:53,215
Like nothing but we still voted for

3926
02:51:53,471 --> 02:51:57,311
But now everybody hate Hillary ticket would be like

3927
02:51:57,567 --> 02:51:59,103
The most alienating

3928
02:51:59,615 --> 02:52:01,151
From Psych

3929
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:03,455
From getting out the vote

3930
02:52:03,711 --> 02:52:04,223
Respect

3931
02:52:04,479 --> 02:52:05,503
Oh yeah

3932
02:52:05,759 --> 02:52:06,271
Pick some of the

3933
02:52:06,527 --> 02:52:07,039
Most

3934
02:52:08,063 --> 02:52:12,415
The analysis that makes the most sense to me is like this is an election where you're not changing

3935
02:52:13,183 --> 02:52:13,695
There's not

3936
02:52:13,951 --> 02:52:15,487
There's not people you need to sway

3937
02:52:15,999 --> 02:52:16,511
To your side

3938
02:52:17,023 --> 02:52:18,815
It's about energizing

3939
02:52:19,071 --> 02:52:19,839
Getting people out

3940
02:52:20,095 --> 02:52:21,375
To actually vote

3941
02:52:21,631 --> 02:52:23,679
And Bloomberg and Hillary

3942
02:52:27,007 --> 02:52:33,151
My two favorite candidates for president actually get people who would be otherwise inclined to

3943
02:52:33,663 --> 02:52:39,039
To not know I think we would have more people leave the United States

3944
02:52:39,295 --> 02:52:40,063
Then vote

3945
02:52:40,319 --> 02:52:40,831
In that election

3946
02:52:41,343 --> 02:52:42,111
Because that's

3947
02:52:42,367 --> 02:52:43,135
F***** up

3948
02:52:43,647 --> 02:52:45,183
I think that there are

3949
02:52:45,695 --> 02:52:46,975
People who are running who

3950
02:52:47,231 --> 02:52:49,023
No on the sound espectro mode

3951
02:52:49,535 --> 02:52:52,351
You know energizing to not energize

3952
02:52:52,607 --> 02:52:53,119
Not energized

3953
02:52:53,375 --> 02:52:54,143
Isn't be mostly Biden

3954
02:52:54,399 --> 02:52:57,215
Yeah but they're people along that scale

3955
02:52:59,007 --> 02:53:00,031
I think I think

3956
02:53:00,287 --> 02:53:02,079
If there is worse than Biden

3957
02:53:02,591 --> 02:53:03,103
Is Bloomberg

3958
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:05,663
Absolutely

3959
02:53:05,919 --> 02:53:08,479
That's the only way you could get less interesting

3960
02:53:08,735 --> 02:53:10,271
Yeah but I don't know

3961
02:53:10,527 --> 02:53:14,111
Anyway so that means that we're going to have a blizzard

3962
02:53:14,623 --> 02:53:17,951
Desperately

3963
02:53:18,207 --> 02:53:22,303
Do you want Hillary to headlines about like Hillary's going to be blooming

3964
02:53:22,559 --> 02:53:24,607
A b b y the conversations happening

3965
02:53:24,863 --> 02:53:25,375
Begin with

3966
02:53:26,911 --> 02:53:28,191
Drudge story about the out

3967
02:53:28,447 --> 02:53:28,959
God

3968
02:53:29,215 --> 02:53:30,495
Larger point

3969
02:53:30,751 --> 02:53:33,823
These dudes think that it's in the Constitution you can't have a VP and press

3970
02:53:34,335 --> 02:53:34,847
Same state

3971
02:53:35,103 --> 02:53:36,127
I don't know what they're talkin about

3972
02:53:36,383 --> 02:53:36,895
So stupid

3973
02:53:40,223 --> 02:53:43,807
Scream about I'll also I should point out that Ivan is a recovering lawyer

3974
02:53:44,575 --> 02:53:46,879
So yeah

3975
02:53:47,135 --> 02:53:49,183
I don't think he was ever a good lawyer to begin with

3976
02:53:49,439 --> 02:53:54,815
So I haven't leaves and Alex's another gas that we're not even going to cover cuz who cares it's not

3977
02:53:55,327 --> 02:53:59,935
It's not a worthwhile interview it's important cuz it has the potential to be like something real

3978
02:54:00,703 --> 02:54:03,519
Explosive Chessmaster 777

3979
02:54:03,775 --> 02:54:05,055
Okay is Tyler Knicks

3980
02:54:05,311 --> 02:54:08,383
Who is Rodger Stones personal

3981
02:54:08,639 --> 02:54:09,919
He's awesome

3982
02:54:10,175 --> 02:54:14,271
So you like this all bullshitkorner have you but of course

3983
02:54:14,527 --> 02:54:16,831
Super close association with Rodger he can't do too much

3984
02:54:19,903 --> 02:54:22,463
He can't he can't go far enough to make it interesting

3985
02:54:22,719 --> 02:54:24,511
And

3986
02:54:24,767 --> 02:54:26,815
Meaning calling for the murder of

3987
02:54:27,327 --> 02:54:27,839
Sure

3988
02:54:28,095 --> 02:54:33,471
Interview of Alex talking about some

3989
02:54:33,727 --> 02:54:34,495
Some other news

3990
02:54:34,751 --> 02:54:35,263
I'm good also

3991
02:54:35,519 --> 02:54:36,799
Tyler Dixon

3992
02:54:37,055 --> 02:54:41,407
I think his phone didn't work so I was kind of a for a while he plays a couple Special Report

3993
02:54:41,919 --> 02:54:44,479
And covers a couple of headlines that he's ill prepared to cover

3994
02:54:44,991 --> 02:54:45,503
Here's one of them

3995
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:54,463
Good thing I've ever heard.

3996
02:55:07,519 --> 02:55:08,543
Criminal charges

3997
02:55:08,799 --> 02:55:11,871
Giant billboard

3998
02:55:12,127 --> 02:55:12,895
Hell yeah

3999
02:55:13,919 --> 02:55:15,199
Daily Planet

4000
02:55:15,455 --> 02:55:16,735
First of all

4001
02:55:16,991 --> 02:55:18,015
Disrespect your

4002
02:55:18,271 --> 02:55:19,551
Your your hatred of country

4003
02:55:19,807 --> 02:55:22,111
No no I do not hate country music

4004
02:55:22,367 --> 02:55:23,135
That sucks

4005
02:55:23,391 --> 02:55:26,207
You don't like that talk about hanging out with Willie and Waylon

4006
02:55:26,463 --> 02:55:29,279
Song Go fuc yourself

4007
02:55:29,535 --> 02:55:32,607
Sirius you're disrespecting my Missouri heritage

4008
02:55:33,119 --> 02:55:35,423
Alex

4009
02:55:35,679 --> 02:55:37,215
Encouraging women to cheat

4010
02:55:37,471 --> 02:55:37,983
Yeah f*** yeah

4011
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:40,287
Headline is being like

4012
02:55:40,543 --> 02:55:41,055
It's a thing where he's at

4013
02:55:41,311 --> 02:55:41,823
Offended

4014
02:55:42,079 --> 02:55:44,639
This notion of like cheating on your spouse being encouraged

4015
02:55:46,431 --> 02:55:50,015
How dare anyone cheat on their spouse

4016
02:55:50,271 --> 02:55:51,551
Jordan isn't important detail

4017
02:55:51,807 --> 02:55:53,599
That might be motivating his coverage

4018
02:55:53,855 --> 02:55:54,367
Said he's leaving out

4019
02:55:55,135 --> 02:55:56,415
This billboard says quote

4020
02:55:56,671 --> 02:55:59,231
Married to one man but fantasizing about others

4021
02:55:59,487 --> 02:56:01,535
You need to try is vita.com

4022
02:56:02,047 --> 02:56:08,191
I guess he could be mad about that if he wants but I don't remember to making a big deal out of all the Ashley Madison Billboards that

4023
02:56:08,447 --> 02:56:09,471
Popped up over the years

4024
02:56:09,727 --> 02:56:11,775
So maybe there's something else going on

4025
02:56:13,055 --> 02:56:18,431
Alex is actually just mad because this billboard along with that text include the picture of trump and Melania

4026
02:56:18,687 --> 02:56:21,247
Melania's looking lovingly away from Trump

4027
02:56:21,503 --> 02:56:25,087
And towards Justin Trudeau that's hilarious that's very funny

4028
02:56:25,343 --> 02:56:31,487
Alex's is mad about infidelity he's just mad at his billboard making a joke at Trump's expense

4029
02:56:31,743 --> 02:56:35,583
That's almost annoying because shouldn't be Trump looking at all of his other one

4030
02:56:36,607 --> 02:56:39,167
Perhaps an easier haggle I would do that one

4031
02:56:39,679 --> 02:56:43,775
So Paul Joseph Watson Road an article about this on Infowars and it's the saddest s*** in the world

4032
02:56:44,287 --> 02:56:50,431
With the divorce rates in depression at all-time highs and birth rates at an all-time low

4033
02:56:50,687 --> 02:56:56,831
Countries need is websites encouraging women to cheat on their partners

4034
02:56:57,087 --> 02:56:59,391
I'm suffering in The Break-Up of relationships

4035
02:57:00,415 --> 02:57:01,183
Unreal

4036
02:57:01,439 --> 02:57:02,975
That article n

4037
02:57:03,231 --> 02:57:07,583
Wanting to take care of your spouse in the context of a happy stable monogamous marriage is bad

4038
02:57:07,839 --> 02:57:13,983
Wanting to be a w**** and stab your husband in the back is apparently something to be celebrated

4039
02:57:15,519 --> 02:57:17,823
I think you're taking this a little

4040
02:57:18,079 --> 02:57:20,127
Personally buddy I think I think there's some

4041
02:57:21,407 --> 02:57:27,551
Bones are so weak they just can't admit that this billboard makes them very angry because they can't stand to see that

4042
02:57:27,807 --> 02:57:33,951
King made fun of Untold pain and suffering and encouraging the downfall of civil

4043
02:57:34,207 --> 02:57:37,023
Elevation hilarious but it's honestly also

4044
02:57:37,535 --> 02:57:38,559
Pretty sad it is

4045
02:57:38,815 --> 02:57:41,631
Pathetic we have one last clip and it's Alex

4046
02:57:41,887 --> 02:57:42,911
Just saying something that is

4047
02:57:43,167 --> 02:57:45,215
Absolutely unacceptable on any level

4048
02:57:45,727 --> 02:57:46,239
And

4049
02:57:46,495 --> 02:57:47,007
Inaccurate

4050
02:57:47,263 --> 02:57:51,359
Admire people that are Cruiser cost

4051
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:57,759
Believing others

4052
02:57:58,015 --> 02:58:02,623
They willingly came to America

4053
02:58:02,879 --> 02:58:03,647
Squalid

4054
02:58:04,159 --> 02:58:06,463
World fellows or women had no power

4055
02:58:07,487 --> 02:58:09,279
Assassins of

4056
02:58:09,535 --> 02:58:10,303
Stockholm Syndrome

4057
02:58:11,327 --> 02:58:13,375
Conquer us because they're open hearts

4058
02:58:13,887 --> 02:58:15,167
Rashida tlaib was born in

4059
02:58:15,423 --> 02:58:15,935
Detroit

4060
02:58:16,447 --> 02:58:22,591
No she's not from here have you seen the

4061
02:58:23,103 --> 02:58:24,639
Color of her

4062
02:58:25,919 --> 02:58:27,711
Seems it seems like Alex is operated on

4063
02:58:27,967 --> 02:58:29,759
I love her no it's her shirt

4064
02:58:30,271 --> 02:58:31,807
Better really throwing them

4065
02:58:32,319 --> 02:58:33,855
So anyway Alex's

4066
02:58:34,111 --> 02:58:35,903
I've been a racist here

4067
02:58:36,159 --> 02:58:36,927
Anyway

4068
02:58:37,439 --> 02:58:38,719
Black dude this episode was

4069
02:58:38,975 --> 02:58:40,511
Was range is all over the place

4070
02:58:41,791 --> 02:58:43,583
When I told you the beginning this episode like

4071
02:58:43,839 --> 02:58:45,119
You get to see these different

4072
02:58:45,887 --> 02:58:47,679
Stages over this discourse

4073
02:58:47,935 --> 02:58:48,447
3 days

4074
02:58:48,703 --> 02:58:49,727
None of this is coharie

4075
02:58:50,495 --> 02:58:53,823
You have the first day on the 12th Alex's rambling about murder

4076
02:58:54,335 --> 02:58:55,103
And is being like

4077
02:58:55,359 --> 02:58:56,127
High on the hog

4078
02:58:56,383 --> 02:58:59,199
Because Trump is going to come to the defense of Rodger

4079
02:58:59,455 --> 02:59:02,015
It means that he's clearing house and all these globalist

4080
02:59:02,271 --> 02:59:03,039
Going to go

4081
02:59:03,295 --> 02:59:05,855
And all of this and then the 13th comes and

4082
02:59:06,111 --> 02:59:08,415
I always kind of settling in in like

4083
02:59:10,719 --> 02:59:11,999
Forgot to get Rodger then

4084
02:59:13,023 --> 02:59:14,559
Retrial cuz the jurors

4085
02:59:15,071 --> 02:59:16,095
Gets mad at

4086
02:59:16,607 --> 02:59:17,375
His lawyer friend

4087
02:59:18,143 --> 02:59:19,167
On the 14th

4088
02:59:19,423 --> 02:59:21,215
Bill Barr has come out and done his

4089
02:59:21,471 --> 02:59:22,239
Face-saving

4090
02:59:22,495 --> 02:59:25,567
Interview and now Alex's got to turn things around

4091
02:59:25,823 --> 02:59:27,359
Flip the script on

4092
02:59:28,383 --> 02:59:29,151
And I just

4093
02:59:29,407 --> 02:59:30,431
All of this is is

4094
02:59:30,687 --> 02:59:33,247
It's just so incoherent listening to it is

4095
02:59:34,527 --> 02:59:35,295
Experience

4096
02:59:36,319 --> 02:59:38,879
I like the thing that I come to from the end of this

4097
02:59:39,391 --> 02:59:40,927
After going through this whole roller

4098
02:59:42,719 --> 02:59:43,231
If this is

4099
02:59:43,487 --> 02:59:44,767
This is such like Twitter

4100
02:59:45,535 --> 02:59:46,559
This is so much

4101
02:59:47,071 --> 02:59:48,863
I've just this random nonsense being

4102
02:59:49,119 --> 02:59:49,631
Tossed about

4103
02:59:50,143 --> 02:59:50,911
Often

4104
02:59:51,167 --> 02:59:52,191
Ridiculously violent

4105
02:59:52,447 --> 02:59:52,959
Always

4106
02:59:53,215 --> 02:59:53,727
Incoherent

4107
02:59:54,239 --> 02:59:54,751
And

4108
02:59:55,007 --> 02:59:56,799
It's just that whole Marcos

4109
02:59:57,055 --> 02:59:58,591
Of the world that we live in with the

4110
02:59:59,359 --> 03:00:00,127
With the hard right

4111
03:00:01,663 --> 03:00:02,431
I honestly feel like

4112
03:00:02,687 --> 03:00:03,967
Twitter trolling as more

4113
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:08,319
Yeah well yeah that's Alex Alex

4114
03:00:08,575 --> 03:00:09,855
They just lashing out

4115
03:00:13,183 --> 03:00:15,999
The content of his show the narratives that he puts out or so.

4116
03:00:16,255 --> 03:00:20,095
Pendant on whatever he's lashing out to whatever the stimulus is

4117
03:00:20,351 --> 03:00:22,911
But he's mad at or he's responding to

4118
03:00:23,167 --> 03:00:24,959
Dictate the entire world

4119
03:00:25,215 --> 03:00:27,519
Right that he presents to his audience

4120
03:00:28,031 --> 03:00:29,311
And it's deeply unfair

4121
03:00:30,335 --> 03:00:31,103
It's not fair

4122
03:00:31,615 --> 03:00:34,943
Not allow your audience to have a consist

4123
03:00:35,199 --> 03:00:37,759
Thread of reality

4124
03:00:38,015 --> 03:00:42,623
Mysterious bad guy that dropped needs to murder

4125
03:00:43,903 --> 03:00:44,927
I think

4126
03:00:45,695 --> 03:00:46,719
I think one thing

4127
03:00:47,231 --> 03:00:47,743
That

4128
03:00:49,279 --> 03:00:50,815
Is is very clear about the

4129
03:00:51,327 --> 03:00:52,095
Is that we are

4130
03:00:52,351 --> 03:00:53,119
Incapable of him

4131
03:00:53,375 --> 03:00:55,935
Handling we are incapable of handling the way these

4132
03:00:57,471 --> 03:00:58,751
It is simply like

4133
03:00:59,007 --> 03:00:59,775
This type of

4134
03:01:00,031 --> 03:01:00,543
S*** like

4135
03:01:00,799 --> 03:01:03,615
It's so terrifying to listen to those that first days

4136
03:01:04,127 --> 03:01:05,151
Episode of him

4137
03:01:05,663 --> 03:01:06,687
Calling from murder

4138
03:01:07,199 --> 03:01:07,967
And then

4139
03:01:08,479 --> 03:01:08,991
Like that

4140
03:01:09,247 --> 03:01:09,759
Terrified

4141
03:01:10,527 --> 03:01:11,807
And then the next day it's just

4142
03:01:12,063 --> 03:01:13,087
Oh William bars

4143
03:01:13,855 --> 03:01:14,623
You know like

4144
03:01:15,647 --> 03:01:17,183
He was just lashing out

4145
03:01:17,439 --> 03:01:18,207
Like a child having a

4146
03:01:18,463 --> 03:01:18,975
Tantrum

4147
03:01:19,231 --> 03:01:21,023
And it's hard not to take that serious

4148
03:01:21,535 --> 03:01:22,303
Because he has such

4149
03:01:22,559 --> 03:01:23,071
High platform

4150
03:01:23,327 --> 03:01:27,935
Yeah in the same way with the reactionary right-wing going after whomever

4151
03:01:28,447 --> 03:01:28,959
And

4152
03:01:29,215 --> 03:01:30,239
It's just them lashing out

4153
03:01:30,495 --> 03:01:31,263
And because

4154
03:01:31,519 --> 03:01:33,055
Is weird so used to

4155
03:01:33,567 --> 03:01:36,127
Accepting their behavior as being something we should

4156
03:01:36,383 --> 03:01:39,199
Talk about we're covering lashing out as if it

4157
03:01:40,479 --> 03:01:42,271
Like it's so frustrating me

4158
03:01:42,527 --> 03:01:44,063
How many times have I opened the

4159
03:01:44,319 --> 03:01:44,831
F****** Guardian

4160
03:01:45,343 --> 03:01:46,879
And seen them cover some headline

4161
03:01:47,391 --> 03:01:49,695
And it's like oh that's just a child lashing out

4162
03:01:50,207 --> 03:01:50,975
Don't give that a

4163
03:01:51,231 --> 03:01:53,535
Attention

4164
03:01:54,047 --> 03:01:56,863
I think it's something we talked about a lot like in the

4165
03:01:57,119 --> 03:01:58,911
Earlier days of the show was this

4166
03:01:59,935 --> 03:02:00,703
Feeling of like

4167
03:02:01,727 --> 03:02:03,263
Adults have to show up event

4168
03:02:03,775 --> 03:02:05,055
Liquor needs to be adults

4169
03:02:05,311 --> 03:02:06,847
Dealing with this

4170
03:02:07,103 --> 03:02:09,151
Toward showing up in the realization set in

4171
03:02:09,663 --> 03:02:10,431
Gradually the like

4172
03:02:10,943 --> 03:02:14,783
Nope that's not going to happen or not

4173
03:02:15,551 --> 03:02:16,063
It almost

4174
03:02:16,319 --> 03:02:17,343
You need parents

4175
03:02:18,623 --> 03:02:22,975
Transcended for or escalated from just like we need adults in the room

4176
03:02:23,231 --> 03:02:23,743
Till like

4177
03:02:23,999 --> 03:02:26,047
Really, this s*** down and settle it

4178
03:02:26,303 --> 03:02:26,815
And now

4179
03:02:27,327 --> 03:02:27,839
The kids

4180
03:02:28,351 --> 03:02:30,143
And the childish petulant Behavior

4181
03:02:30,655 --> 03:02:32,703
Is kind of running things it's the only life

4182
03:02:32,959 --> 03:02:34,751
Being rewarded

4183
03:02:35,007 --> 03:02:36,287
Describing that like don't

4184
03:02:36,543 --> 03:02:38,591
Don't reward this tantrum with behavior

4185
03:02:38,847 --> 03:02:39,871
Exactly

4186
03:02:42,943 --> 03:02:44,479
And that's important

4187
03:02:44,735 --> 03:02:46,271
And I don't know how you do that

4188
03:02:46,527 --> 03:02:48,831
Because you start acting like a child

4189
03:02:49,087 --> 03:02:51,391
Acting like a parent towards other adults

4190
03:02:51,647 --> 03:02:54,975
And generally that puts them in a position where they

4191
03:02:55,231 --> 03:02:55,743
End up

4192
03:02:55,999 --> 03:02:57,023
Precipitating the exact

4193
03:02:57,279 --> 03:02:57,791
They think you're trying to

4194
03:02:58,047 --> 03:02:58,815
Stop them

4195
03:02:59,071 --> 03:03:01,119
I don't I don't know there's an easy answer but

4196
03:03:02,143 --> 03:03:03,167
I mean to me

4197
03:03:03,423 --> 03:03:04,447
Kind of what I'm

4198
03:03:04,703 --> 03:03:05,471
What I'm taking

4199
03:03:05,727 --> 03:03:06,239
Is

4200
03:03:06,495 --> 03:03:07,007
It's

4201
03:03:07,263 --> 03:03:07,775
Time to just

4202
03:03:08,799 --> 03:03:09,311
Ignore

4203
03:03:09,823 --> 03:03:11,103
I mean I've said this

4204
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:12,639
Before but it's really like

4205
03:03:12,895 --> 03:03:14,687
We just can't involve them in the

4206
03:03:15,967 --> 03:03:17,503
They just can't beat we can't talk

4207
03:03:18,015 --> 03:03:22,623
About what it is they have to say I don't give a s*** about kellyanne Conway has to

4208
03:03:23,391 --> 03:03:24,415
She's not involved in

4209
03:03:24,671 --> 03:03:27,999
In the conversation he doesn't get to be in the news

4210
03:03:28,255 --> 03:03:30,047
You have to be clear though it's

4211
03:03:30,303 --> 03:03:31,071
Specific people

4212
03:03:31,583 --> 03:03:33,887
Their behavior apps

4213
03:03:34,143 --> 03:03:37,215
Absolutely not people who have conservative politics Reddit

4214
03:03:37,471 --> 03:03:38,751
Kellyanne Conway doesn't

4215
03:03:39,007 --> 03:03:39,775
You don't get to talk.

4216
03:03:40,031 --> 03:03:40,543
She's gone

4217
03:03:40,799 --> 03:03:43,103

No not at all just like

4221
03:03:48,223 --> 03:03:51,807
Fine if you want to if she wants to say this s*** you know it

4222
03:03:52,831 --> 03:03:55,647
You know she's going to blindly defend Trump with some people

4223
03:03:57,439 --> 03:04:02,815
The even if you're even if you want don't even get a comment from her just say kellyanne Conway would probably defend Trump lie

4224
03:04:03,327 --> 03:04:03,839
It's f****** move on

4225
03:04:04,351 --> 03:04:04,863
We're done

Guessing

4228

What they will say if you ask

4229
03:04:12,543 --> 03:04:14,079
I don't know if that would work but

4230
03:04:14,847 --> 03:04:15,359
Suggestion

03:04:16,127 --> 03:04:17,663
