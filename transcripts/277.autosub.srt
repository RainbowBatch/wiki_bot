00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alex

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104
Just a tiny

3
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:20,992
Arizona

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,976
Most people would describe an unhealthy amount

5
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,584
Stream beverage

6
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
Yeah

7
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,776
Maybe I don't know your back but it's all signs are pointing

8
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,360
On Saturday

9
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,384
Apartment places

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
Are closed over the

11
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,712
Weekend but the final like application

12
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,504
Everything went in on Friday

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,064
So I'm expecting all your back on Monday

14
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,880
But I have a lot less stress

15
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,720
On that front perfect I appreciate you asking and I'm sure the listener is a very

16
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
Interested

17
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,280
On your news front

18
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,840
We can't talk about it

19
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
Wanting to know how that story

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,264
In your your situation

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
But

22
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
We can't talk about it

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
Until there's some resin

24
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
What's up

25
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:27,040
Maybe we probably shouldn't

26
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,832
Smarter not to I think so

27
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,208
I'm moving into your new space

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,256

30
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,680
Okay

31
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
Maybe remove a box

32
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:50,848
For my room Ono

33
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:59,040
You've just taken away your own free will

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
And I'd like to take a moment

35
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Before we get going

36
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
Do I get a shout-out

37
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
So first

38
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,912
You know I'm bad with names

39
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,496
If I'm just going phonetically it's merging

40
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,592
I can't I don't think that's right I'm sure I mispronouncing it probably Miriam

2

61
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416

That's delicious

00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Incredible

67
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
That is 2 letters no.

68
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,847
Call Blaine

69
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,663
For an address to send

70
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,735
And unfortunately I'm not at the point where I'm willing

71
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Give out alright

72
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,855
Because yeah I think we're in a position where it's at

73
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
But Ian has our address from before when

74
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,727

Inside of a place

78
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Because I really do appreciate it and I think

79
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,695
It's that really cool impulse I don't want

80
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Respect

81
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
People's generosity or anything

82
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Today

83
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
We are going over the

84
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
The day

85
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
What is March 15th

86
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
20

87
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
Before our time

88
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
United States

89
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Previous night

90
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Christchurch

91
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
49 people are dead

92
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
The results of the

93
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Fired on

94
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
People

95
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
A couple bosque's

96
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
Gauging their Friday prayers

97
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
I don't want to get too much

98
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
To that story specifically because as a

99
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
Is the case

100
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
There are developing

101
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Elements of

102
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
We know the basics

103
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,415
Certainly

104
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
In terms of

105
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
Got you know

106
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
Did he have accomplished

107
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
All the other

108
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
I don't think every record this year on Saturday

109
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
I don't feel like

110
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
We have

111
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,103
Reporting reporting has not been not going to make any claims

112
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
Enough to talk

113
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
About what's going on

114
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
But we don't know enough

115
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
To pretend that we're experts

116
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Absolutely not

117
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
Alex

118
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
T.i.

119
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,999
Well we're in an interesting situation because I know

120
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:00,095
Rush Limbaugh has already claimed

121
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
False flag

122
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Right

123
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,495
With a little bit we're on a

124
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
I'm not sure if

125
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
He is a committed

126
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Holy

127
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,295
To that line

128
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:27,487
Assume that we're in a situation where Alex is going to be

129
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
Oh God no

130
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,679
He might be getting sued more goddamn

131
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,287
Legally actionable

132
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Probably

133
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
2 scale

134
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
It's worse than whatever Rush Limbaugh said

135
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
Couldn't you have learned

136
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,135
Nope cuz pathological

137
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,975
Alex starts to show on what I would describe as a rocky footing

138
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
This is not good

139
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
The show start

140
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,447
The music plays for about a minute a whole minute and Alex comes running into

141
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
Restart when it's normal

142
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
Comes in

143
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
Real power

144
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,223
Whatever

145
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,439
2000 plus years ago

146
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:35,839
Okay

147
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:42,239
Launch new movements or revolutions

148
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
Butchering Sharon body

149
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,951
Okay see you little bit

150
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:08,863
I mean I don't think he's being very subtle

151
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
F****** rock

152
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Do you start

153
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,287
He's trying to imply that the globalist like to launch these false flags on March 15th

154
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,687
I guess yeah

155
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
From the beginning who knows

156
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:29,343
One of the main problems with pretty much

157
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,439
We have enough recorded history enough a really wild s*** that's happened could absolutely

158
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,255
Conspiracy out of just about any date

159
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
I imagine the fake terrorist attack happening on May 23rd a random random number generator

160
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,007
And now I will pretend to be alexcraft

161
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,335
The speculation about this terrorist attack

162
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
On May 23rd

163
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,967
Globus love to attack Crescent about May 23rd because it's

164
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:02,367
Mirror

165
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:09,279
The only one who can defeat the Muslims

166
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
Why do you think creating a false flag Pizza in Northern Ireland

167
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,479
Started with the first few world

168
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:33,087
34 on the real life Bonnie and Clyde by the globalist police

169
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,159
A they were free for all those strong armed robberies and murders

170
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
Well this is all good fun

171
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,799
But the way I imagined it going is that I come up with a random date

172
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
Pretend that there'd been a terrorist attack on that day

173
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,919
Unfortunately I don't think that game is even possible to

174
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Play

175
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:05,087
On May 23rd 2014 Elliot Rodger killed six people in a murder spree their Isla Vista California motivated by

176
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
Feelings of rejection

177
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
By women he found attractive

178
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,511
You go on to become a meme in a bit of a hero to the online world

179
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,583
I promise you I didn't cheat like a date

180
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,887
And just work backwards from this

181
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,703
I chose a random date to make a joke

182
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Out of this

183
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
Inevitably you fine

184
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
You know

185
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,223
Terrorist attack that is real on

186
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
We should probably think about that

187
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,671
It's a it was a grim.

188
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,839
Also important point the Manson family murders in 1969 happened on the night of August 8th

189
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
And nights

190
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
And it literally nothing to do with you guys

191
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,471
Alec has no idea what he's talking about just connect

192
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
Completely unrelated things together

193
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,847
He doesn't care about doing good job you didn't care about having any information

194
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,663
All he cares about is justify and white terrorism

195
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
Private Muslim victims

196
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
Attack any empathy

197
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
Human decency

198
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
He's a complete monster

199
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Anytime in space

200
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
30 seconds of starting a

201
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,695
Yeah you got out strong

202
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:25,727
Restrained reporting make sure that we have all the facts

203
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,543
And then he literally says we don't want to be sued

204
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
Let's not do it

205
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Let's knock

206
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,343
He says that to everybody in the office

207
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
No you don't do any of that stuff

208
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:52,095
You were you're pointing out the first-of-its-kind

209
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
This is a false flag

210
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
And all that s***

211
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Jesus

212
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
Sedative

213
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,591
But okay that's good is a false flag

214
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:10,527
Investigate

215
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Shooting

216
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
More than 20 years ago

217
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:20,255
Semi-auto and then

218
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,839
Single-shot shotguns and rifles

219
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
Special licenses

220
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,031
That doesn't sound right newzealand

221
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
You take everyone's gone

222
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,151
And it's important to investigate all the angles of this current issue

223
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
Is really rough position to be

224
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:44,319
To be honest like it's really not good if it's as if this is where he's coming from

225
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,391
There's a bad starting position

226
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,975
There were the gun laws in New Zealand are incredibly Lacks

227
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:55,327
That's one problem that we're going to get to

228
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,655
My first point in a bad bad start here

229
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
Is that nothing Alex has done or does about a mass shooting or even a complete

230
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,847
Could rightly be called investigator

231
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
All he does is obscure things

232
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:13,503
Anything other than blindly embarrassingly covering of white terrorism

233
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Disgusting

234
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,135
Secondly they didn't want to rightly pointed out

235
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,255
Making s*** up about gun laws

236
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:30,655
Which will see a demonstration of later in this episode

237
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,727
The legal actions he's talking about happened in 1990

238
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
Me too

239
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,127
Altitude was really a greater registration requirements for gun owners

240
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,455
Among the changes were adding

241
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,319
Requiring that license holders reapply after 10 years

242
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,647
Making it so only licensed gun owners

243
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,511
The amendment also created a new category of gun from a legal standpoint

244
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,839
That was a military-style semi-automatic

245
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
At all

246
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
Making that up

247
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Yeah that sounds right

248
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
Thirdly and most importantly

249
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,103
This wasn't the result of a stage 2

250
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,687
This is a response to be very real arawana Massacre

251
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,247
That took place on November 13th and 14th night

252
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
1890

253
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
It all started when local a****** David Greg with his neighbor allegedly about the guy's dog being too loud

254
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:30,559
By arguing gray went over to the guy's house and shot him multiple times with semi-automatic rifle

255
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:35,167
The neighbors 2 daughters were in the house along with the daughter of the neighbors girlfriend

256
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,751
Gray found one of the girls named Chiquita age 9

257
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
And shot her in the chest

258
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,639
She would survive but the other two young girls who he found later

259
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
I'm shot died on the spot

260
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Griffin set the house on fire

261
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,391
The girlfriend's daughter was in the house was shot at

262
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
Approach the situation

263
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
The help

264
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
People who stopped their cars to try and help

265
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,047
With what they thought was just a burning house we're fired on

266
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
He killed more kids will happen just be out on the street

267
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
One of them was out looking for his lost dog

268
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:13,311
This all led to a standoff with which ended with him being shot by the police the next day after he charged out of the house

269
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Magellan

270
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
F****** kill me you bastards

271
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,735
You didn't actually die immediately

272
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,015
Turn off successfully killing him

273
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,575
He will get his wish though and he died from his wounds

274
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Before arriving

275
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Hospital

276
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:31,231
When was all said and done grade killed 13 people for 11 years old or younger

277
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
One of them was a police sergeant

278
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,095
This wasn't a false flag this wasn't a staged event

279
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,911
This was the destruction of many many people's lives

280
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
At the hands of one man with a bunch of

281
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,287
And just because they should so stupid is a globalist

282
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,895
Did like somehow plan this arm Awana Massacre just to grab everyone's gone

283
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
Why the fuk didn't they do the second part of the plan

284
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,855
Why are they so competent about the part of this with a pull off elaborate Act of terrorism in order to steal people's gone

285
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
But they can't f****** finish Step 2

286
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
It's impressively shity

287
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Did Alex to be working today

288
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Deprive people of their grief

289
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,559
Inability to heal in the present

290
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,863
While still having time to be complete

291
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
Inhuman monster

292
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
People who lost their loved ones

293
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
29 years ago

294
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
He is so bad

295
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
This is so bad

296
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
This episode

297
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
He sucks

298
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:26,783
At your Plex faith not

299
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:35,743
I believe I'm really frustrated with this guy today I'll be honest with you

300
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:42,143
I don't know I might end up a little bit on the nose

301
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
Brutal

302
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
That's f****** brutal

303
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,567
I don't know about

304
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,919
Right lying about a guy who for no reason other than he was mad at his neighbor

305
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
Ended up killing

306
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,271
Four children and nine other people

307
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,087
Over a two-day Massacre

308
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
It's f***** up

309
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,183
He's allowed to lie about

310
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
No one thinks that was a false flag

311
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
Except Alex

312
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,607
Swag

313
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Didn't happen

314
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
You just making that part up

315
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,543
Sorry I'm a bit

316
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,127
I'm trying to I mean I'm still trying to put together my

317
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
My feelings on

318
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,455
Everything that's going on right now and I'm

319
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
I'm trying to avoid

320
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
The the biggest trap

321
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
But like

322
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
To sensitize

323
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Like I'm decent

324
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Like I just

325
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,999
I don't even know how to process this is a

326
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
The tragedy

327
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
That much anymore

328
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Become

329
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
So commonplace

330
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,679
And I don't know how to process rape

331
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Because it's

332
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Become

333
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
So wrote

334
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,799
It's almost like he's not even

335
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
He's not even performing

336
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
He's just reading a script from the last

337
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
White terrorist attack

338
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Which was probably yesterday

339
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,039
I honestly think there are some differences

340
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
The end

341
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
I

342
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
I know what you mean

343
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
And it's really it's really hard to fight back

344
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
Against that

345
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
Complacency

346
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,999
Normalizing

347
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
Horror

348
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,327
That is such a part of Modern Life

349
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
You bought

350
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
You have to fight

351
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Absolutely

352
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:22,239
But I am I'm not

353
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
As a prescriptive thing

354
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
Like we have to

355
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,615
Force ourselves

356
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
You feel

357
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Anu

358
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
If you don't

359
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
You you minimize

360
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,831
The reality of what's going on in the world

361
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,879
That makes things easier

362
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
For people like Alex

363
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Play their game

364
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
Alex Britt start to talk

365
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
About the manifesto

366
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
This guy

367
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,679
Right there's some issues this

368
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
Then we'll talk about some of that

369
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
On the other side of the

370
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
Clip but

371
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Here is how Alex decide

372
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
To start covering

373
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
That

374
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,183
Newswars.com

375
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
Praises coming

376
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
Call short

377
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
Socialism

378
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,383
Find Candace Owen

379
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
By praising them

380
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
So

381
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,039
There's something really weird going on with his terrorist Manifesto

382
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,111
Doesn't pick up on for almost the entirety of the

383
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
The show while he's talking about it

384
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,951
Towards the end Harrison Smith comes in

385
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,303
And he's trying to warn Alex that there's a lot of Fortune 8chan type

386
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
Trolling stop

387
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,119
In the text of it

388
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
Emory's be careful about like

389
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,983
What things actually need water inside

390
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
Alex has no

391
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
That stuff

392
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
And just keep barreling forward with the

393
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
Position

394
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,663
I think even shut off.

395
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,295
In the middle I don't know exactly

396
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,416
Harrison's in the middle of a sentence

397
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
Oh boy

398
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
I'm not entirely sure

399
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,304
Be straightforward argument

400
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,072
Being nice

401
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
But other parts

402
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,912
The corners of the internet that we don't live in

403
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
Like trapped

404
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,056
People to report on which media coverage of

405
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,872
Robert Evans Road

406
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
Explain this better than I can

407
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
But I recommend that everyone

408
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Very well.

409
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,856
I do want to point out that this is an impressively unfair acts for Alex

410
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,928
Claim it this Manifesto is pro China and socialism

411
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,976
Because it says positive things about them

412
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:55,840
I've been in the same breath claim that is anti Candace Owens and Pewdiepie because it says positive

413
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
Things about them

414
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
This is very literally doublespeak

415
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
What else is doing

416
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
For two conflicting

417
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
Sausage with audiences head at the same time

418
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
And it's an abusive Act

419
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,408
If positive things being said about someone in a terrorist Manifesto

420
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Either mean that

421
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
He's very into those things

422
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,272
Who was the Beast demonizing them by association

423
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,320
Then the only truth that remains

424
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,880
Is that only Alex's judgment can be trusted

425
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,208
Anyone attempting to cover reality would never behave like

426
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,024
It's the exclusive action of a propaganda

427
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
And given the

428
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Constanta

429
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,840
It's an activist

430
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
Cruelty towards

431
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:34,752
I read over most of the manifesto of what I come away from it is this isn't even close to us

432
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,288
The power with what I expect out of a man

433
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
It's not like a brother

434
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:44,224
Manifest content

435
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,272
But wasn't

436
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
You're almost to a fault

437
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,928
He's very clear about what he was doing and how others could do what he did to

438
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,256
Included excerpts from his diary

439
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
Jarringly up

440
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,656
This Manifesto is clearly someone who has inspired in a big way by brevik

441
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,728
But is also someone who's lived on online World 8:02

442
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
And that online Manor

443
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
Communicating

444
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
From time to time

445
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,664
And those insincere Trolli aspects of the manifesto make it

446
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,456
Very difficult to assess tone

447
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Even the parts

448
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,272
Entirely sincere and literal

449
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,600
That said if Alex wants to cherry-pick lines but

450
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
Ecofascism and liking

451
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,440
China that sword Cuts both directions

452
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,744
For example the Coast Guard terrorist

453
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,352
Liberalist globalist ideology

454
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
Especially White

455
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,704
Which is basically a guiding principle

456
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
Editorial

457
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
Infowars editorial Department

458
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
Such a thing even exists

459
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,408
The title of the current terrorist Manifesto was the great replacement

460
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:50,272
Which is a reference to the white genocide almost all of Alex's reporting

461
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,088
All the time nationalist South

462
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,392
All the times he's gal'd about the dangers

463
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,184
Is a variable birthrates a demographic

464
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
The cliff Alex's deep

465
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
Deeply invested in the Great

466
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:03,840
Replacement narrative that is the title of this guy's Manifesto

467
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,704
I'm not saying anything other than the games

468
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
You playing isn't

469
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,520
It goes both directions

470
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,128
I think it's absolutely had blood on his hands

471
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,224
This attack anyway because of anything I read Manifesto

472
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,528
Discounted most of that document

473
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,064
Is being unreliable narration

474
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,624
Alex has blood on his hands

475
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:32,000
Constant irresponsible excessive and disgusting demonization of Islam that he carries out in the way

476
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
Perpetuates the idea

477
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,816
That there is no moderate

478
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
Alex's blood on his hands

479
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,936
For the way that he incessantly called immigrants and Muslims Invaders

480
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:44,544
Alex's blood on his hands for normalizing

481
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,616
Existential fear it is dumb listen

482
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,200
The information ecosystem that he's a part of its not okay

483
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,528
And attacks like this are the natural fruit of that ecosystem

484
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Alex has blood on his hands

485
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
And we focus on him

486
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,416
Cuz the show is about him but he's far from the only one

487
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,792
Ignore the dump manifest overtaking cautiously with a grain of salt because ultimately it doesn't matter

488
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,424
Doing everything in their power to insist that Muslims are incompatible with freedom

489
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,216
And white people

490
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,288
Everyone from Sam Harris

491
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
Ben Shapiro

492
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,872
Tucker and Bill Maher

493
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,456
From every dumb f*** with a struggling YouTube goddamn present

494
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,040
I think Islam hates us

495
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,856
There's something there that is a tremendous hatred there

496
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,952
We can't allow people coming into this country we have this hatred of the United States

497
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,488
And the people who are not Muslim

498
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,072
When you ask yourself what happened here the answer is really simple

499
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,448
Just get another person who took right

500
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,496
If you believe the words

501
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
Zippy's monster say

502
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:53,408
I think it's only a matter of time until there's too many of them to stop them from dominating white people

503
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
Killing Muslims is one of the

504
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
Predictable outcome

505
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,528
And there's literally no chance I would ever believe

506
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,856
50 islamophobic media chorus doesn't understand that fully

507
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,672
This attack was a natural endpoint of that rhetoric

508
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
It's been allowed to

509
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
Metastasize

510
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,024
It's eggs are not going to get better until that is a

511
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,328
Very seriously

512
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Frankly

513
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Very honest

514
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
Very

515
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,472
People need to understand

516
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
The parts of this

517
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
They are complicit

518
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
I take it you're a humble

519
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
Fearless moral inventory

520
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
Centauri

521
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
I don't think

522
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
That a lot of people

523
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,296
Specifically the people I just named

524
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
To do that

525
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,856
And therefore they will continue to

526
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
Part of the

527
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
The process that feeds

528
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
And that is nothing to do

529
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
I don't give a s***

530
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
Do with the world we live in

531
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,400
There's a little

532
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Denim

533
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
My mother

534
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
I'm in a mood

535
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,336
People people come to me for yelling but today you're all about it

536
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
I'm I'm good

537
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Got a lot of

538
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
So

539
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,552
Alex isn't doing good today now I doubt it

540
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,440
I started going through this episode I have

541
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Of note about like

542
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
Points that he's making

543
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
Anime

544
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,168
I'll go f*** yourself Alex

545
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
MMA

546
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,984
3 hours later I realized

547
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
3 minutes

548
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,312
Episode

549
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,872
That's not good

550
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
Call bad

551
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664
Anita's

552
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
Is unfair

553
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
The idea

554
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
What are you trying to do with

555
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
He's pro-china but

556
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
Because you praise both of them

557
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
Play abusive

558
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,816
That made me want to lose my mind I don't know how you can

559
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:52,448
Because what he's trying to say there is he's trying to say that

560
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,752
The manifesto

561
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,312
Right wing

562
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,640
Figures right because the only

563
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,456
Is if you was also attacking right-wing fig

564
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:09,344
Right so in the manifesto raises all of this stuff because

565
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Love

566
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
And he has to say that

567
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,184
He's praising right-wingers

568
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
As part of the plot

569
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:20,096
Otherwise so he's going to be like exactly

570
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
Meanwhile everybody

571
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
I took any time

572
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,960
Like really look at it

573
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
Understand

574
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
Contacts

575
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
The came out in

576
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
You get aftermath

577
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,784
Yes talks about the being radicalized by Candace Owens but it's

578
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Clearly a joke

579
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,112
Yeah like everyone who was a

580
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,672
The joke

581
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
Trying to make some

582
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,280
The defensive propagandist

583
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,328
Or the overzealous over

584
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
Eager presumably

585
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,680
People on the left who want to attack him

586
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,984
Like whatever it is is exactly

587
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
An instance of the

588
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,568
The thing that is in that Manifesto as

589
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:06,176
And it played out exactly how it probably was supposed to

590
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,504
Yeah pretty much so there are these sorts of things where I

591
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,320
I don't care to engage with most of the

592
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
The text

593
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Lest we

594
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
Possibly fall into

595
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Trap like that

596
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,464
I would rather look at the larger contacts

597
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
And the parts of

598
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
Absolutely

599
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
Arson

600
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,888
I really don't care about manifestos except as a

601
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,544
Learning tool

602
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,592
To anyone matters

603
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,896
Is that you

604
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:43,296
This is what you want exactly

605
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
The real

606
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,856
Text means nothing

607
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,648
Because we know why you did it

608
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,928
Because of what you did

609
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,280
I don't give a s*** about the Unabomber Manifesto

610
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,632
The only thing is

611
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
What do we need

612
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
To do to keep people like you from

613
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,032
What is the environment later understanding

614
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
The text

615
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
What's wrong

616
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,176
You don't get any credibility

617
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:14,016
Then a f****** self-published Amazon author just because you

618
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,040
You kill people

619
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,832
Reading Anders Breivik

620
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,904
Manifesto in 2011 probably wouldn't have been

621
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,440
Deeply affected

622
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,000
As it was when I read it for a podcast

623
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,816
6 months ago

624
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,864
And the reason wasn't because of what he

625
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,960
He was saying it was because we now live in a world where you feel

626
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:38,848
How's that manifest exactly clearly motivated

627
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:44,480
The manifesto that came out 78 years ago

628
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,552
You probably be very

629
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,112
Pesto from present day

630
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
Deeply affecting

631
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
Because I would see

632
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,976
The Shockwave

633
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,536
Specifically by him

634
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
You can very clearly see

635
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,400
That he was inspired by a

636
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
A project

637
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:09,568
You're only provide

638
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,408
Fighting more space for the people who are not going to listen to you say

639
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Look at how bad this is

640
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
Says they're going to read it inside

641
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,576
Who gives a s*** about what he has to say

642
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,648
I don't think it's

643
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,696
I don't think it's the right thing to do

644
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,816
Is appropriate

645
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
Assume that

646
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
Gospel

647
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,264
That's one of the things I don't try

648
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:46,688
Absolutely

649
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,736
Trip over their own tickets

650
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:56,416
The documentarian 20 years from now combing through the through the manifesto and

651
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Doing a whole like

652
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:02,048
Post-mortem on life in general through this manifest

653
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,864
I don't want anybody talking about it right now cuz

654
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,472
It's just pointless

655
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,752
But not a ton

656
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
Because I don't

657
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,384
Uses something

658
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,664
Ann Arbor contacts

659
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,944
Profound from

660
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
The manifestor

661
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
About who he thinks

662
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,928
I don't know all the

663
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
In the shooting video

664
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,584
Internet

665
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
That's a boy

666
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,496
Coming up the TV

667
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,288
What the f*** are you doing

668
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,336
He's a weird leftist

669
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,360
Ecofash

670
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
His words

671
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
Exactly

672
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:55,040
Mosteiros described himself as an Eco fascist

673
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,720
Call Joseph quotes

674
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
Manifesto

675
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
Make you laugh

676
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
I mean he's a fascist

677
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
41

678
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,704
Texiko however you want to take

679
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
Presumably

680
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,312
Admirers

681
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,408
Because they are because they're currently

682
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,480
Well no not just that

683
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,272
They're currently holding

684
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
Muslims in

685
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
Concentration

686
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,624
They're doing this concurrently

687
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,000
With this guy hundreds of thousands of people disappear

688
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,304
Right right

689
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,120
Piece of his support of China or

690
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:46,240
I think it's probably more from the context clues up

691
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,264
Right

692
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
It's boards

693
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
Just the idea.

694
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,104
Country for Chinese people

695
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
As opposed to

696
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,432
Open Annex

697
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,504
Alex wants

698
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,528
It says like

699
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:03,392
Yeah course the globalist love China this guy loves giant liberal

700
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
Do you like to eat

701
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
Costa

702
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:12,352
You know what some f****** people on the far right also really like

703
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Fries

704
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
8

705
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,336
The moment he's like

706
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,432
Weird leftist

707
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,760
You can just say what you want

708
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,856
That means

709
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,952
In the same way if I say

710
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
Nationalist terrorist

711
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:45,376
Coronavirus

712
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:51,776
My instincts say okay

713
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,568
But that's the wrong answer

714
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,616
Take left and right out of this

715
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
This is a

716
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
Network

717
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:01,504
This is a concerted effort

718
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
People

719
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
Who are white

720
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:08,160
I think you can't take that lesson right out of

721
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
Because they're closed

722
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
Honky definition

723
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:14,560
Now that's sort of thing because I think you get caught up in too much of the minutiae

724
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
And people are able to

725
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,144
You crafty Dodges in order to get around

726
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,192
The guy in the manifesto

727
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
Hates conservative

728
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,008
Biggest conservatism

729
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Corporatist

730
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,088
Because of other reasons

731
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:43,744
You talk about

732
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
Box

733
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,328
It's a mess and this is one of the

734
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
The issues that like

735
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,680
It's impossible to mail anything down

736
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
Who knows how much

737
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,544
So it's best

738
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
Engaged

739
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Watch outside

740
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,360
Just

741
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
Alex

742
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
Is trying to prepare

743
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
That's about all we can do

744
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,320
If we can't nail down any larger conclusion

745
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,856
About his word

746
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
One thing

747
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,232
Frustrates me so much

748
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,584
I don't understand

749
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,376
What they would think if it works

750
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
To go the other way

751
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Do you know what I mean

752
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
Not exactly like

753
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,104
How many terrorist event

754
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
Have we had this f******

755
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,456
Already this year

756
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
Right

757
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,320
What if we had the same cluster of

758
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,160
I don't know any difference

759
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,512
What day event how many before they would start saying wait let's

760
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
Start limiting guns

761
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,424
Let themselves die over and over again they would just want a war right

762
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
I don't know

763
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,288
I'm not entirely sure but

764
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,384
Application of

765
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Attack

766
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
That

767
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
Done

768
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
Themselves

769
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
Conversation

770
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,112
They create the world

771
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Idea

772
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,952
Grayslake

773
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
Them

774
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,168
Complicit in helping absolutely

775
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,448
Text there we go

776
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:40,480
But when it's a Muslim

777
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
Shooting people

778
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,344
Akbar

779
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,392
Frustration

780
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
Control Islam

781
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:00,448
Practitioner

782
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
Hernandez being reported

783
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
They call it a good Revolution

784
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,360
Clip is really revealing

785
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:13,248
We've always known that Alex thinks that Islam is all one does something bad

786
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
Expect a conversation

787
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,552
Be about how Islam is

788
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,112
He's always disappointed that's not enough

789
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,392
People having a conversation

790
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,952
That's what he's describing is my big frustration

791
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
You never understand

792
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
The people who are saying

793
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,048
This wasn't

794
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
The people like you

795
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
We told you almost ones are evil

796
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,984
He doesn't understand

797
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
Have to defend

798
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
The entirety of Islam

799
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,896
If propagandist an anti-islam forces

800
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
Trying to attack

801
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
It's the Fox News

802
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,400
When it comes to White

803
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:08,544
Be able to see the difference between criticism of white supremacy

804
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,592
Nyt

805
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,896
That's troubling

806
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:19,296
It's almost like the default position for white people it's just never

807
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:25,696
Expressed almost does feel like that's a late belief that he has fit colors

808
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,720
He relates to this stuff

809
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,328
Also a recent study published in Justice quarterly found that attacks carried out by Muslim

810
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:35,680
Receive on average 357% more media coverage

811
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,960
Then those committed by other group

812
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,872
The study found quote out of 136 Terror attacks in the United States

813
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,992
Muslim committed on average 12.5% of the attacks get received

814
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,016
More than half

815
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:50,784
Of the news cap

816
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
White terrorist conversely received

817
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
Proportionately little mediator

818
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,720
Because of this disproportional coverage many people are duped into thickness

819
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280
The far greater threat to them

820
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,072
When in reality this is far from the

821
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,400
People like Alex Jones serve to make that Gap in perception

822
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,424
Versus reality

823
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,312
And ideally they want to make it so wide that it's impossible for that Gap ever to be bridged

824
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,384
Leaving you with no other answer than to take matters into your own hands

825
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,712
It's really hard to look at the reporting that Alex is doing

826
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
Today

827
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,272
In the circumstances that the world is

828
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
Anak think

829
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,064
But he's trying to

830
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
It really is

831
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,416
The way he's behaving

832
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,976
When the reality is so very clear

833
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,304
Absolutely

834
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,912
Your move there though is

835
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,448
What he saying

836
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,240
Is

837
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
I don't think it's okay

838
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
2

839
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
Have a white supremacist

840
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
Terrorist attack

841
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,920
But what about other terrorists

842
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,480
Seaweed

843
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,784
So we shouldn't do anything about the white supremacist

844
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,696
And only focus on the ones in Egypt or whatever

845
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,000
The whataboutism there

846
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
Is just too

847
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,352
A posture in action toward the

848
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,632
Inciting event

849
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,216
Don't deal with white supremacist

850
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:20,640
Call El white man white man white man

851
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,688
What are we thinking about drugs

852
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,736
What about this

853
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Don't worry about it

854
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,880
Never deal with the problem at hand

855
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,000
Well

856
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
Guess what

857
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,144
What about everything and every further action is going to be that problem and it

858
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,424
It's never going to be white

859
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
Supremacist

860
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,752
Terror

861
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:51,616
Has Alex

862
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
Like going to church

863
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:12,863
If your argument about why people should be upset about a shooting in a mosque

864
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,911
Is that Isis attacked churches

865
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,959
You are playing from behind

866
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,495
Your argument is terrible

867
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
And here's a big reason why

868
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,079
Eustis is a terrorist group

869
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,615
And they're treated like one

870
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,919
Our country is literally at war with them

871
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:32,319
So if you want to justify a white nationalist shooting up a mosque

872
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,343
The only real way

873
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,391
Avoid sounding like a fuking idiot

874
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,695
Is a white nationalist

875
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,999
Constitutive legitimate terrorism problem

876
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
Except

877
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Be treated this.

878
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
Otherwise

879
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,631
So f****** stupid conversation you're trying to have

880
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,447
Also I said find a church in the Philippines

881
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,727
In January this year

882
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
20 people

883
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,775
But it didn't happen on Easter

884
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,615
Last Easter ISIS attack of Church of Pakistan

885
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
And for people workout

886
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,735
These attacks are awful but it's just a blip in the news

887
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,783
Mainstream media Outlets covered both of us

888
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:08,415
Interesting Lee a search of Infowars archives actually fails to turn up stories but either of those attacks

889
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,463
But a simple Google search brings up stories

890
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
From The New York Times about both

891
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:18,655
So really I'm not sure what point Alex is trying to illustrate out here other than he's a f****** idiot needs a job

892
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:23,007
Define irony for everybody in

893
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,567
Did you cover it

894
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,759
Wars is faulty

895
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,063
Whatever what the f*** ever

896
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,135
I'm certain that those attacks were like mentioned in some like

897
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:45,535
Larger article about something else like in paragraph 20 or whatever

898
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,375
Nothing

899
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
It's all bulshit

900
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
You babe

901
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,871
Like we were just sort of talking about

902
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,431
Making fun of the idea of a little bit ago

903
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,991
The idea here is to

904
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
Deal with the fact

905
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:09,599
This is white supremacist white nationalist

906
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,927
Has been a problem for a while and it's rearing its head Missouri

907
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
Shocking

908
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,975
The awful way

909
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Again

910
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
Texas

911
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,375
To describe it as terrorism

912
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
And that's what I think because

913
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,959
Does open up that idea that we

914
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,543
In the same way we treat other terrorist organization

915
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,079
Trying to disrupt their

916
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
Communication

917
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
Filtrate

918
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,175
How to figure out how they operate

919
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
I'm figuring out ways

920
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:41,343
To neutralize social media platform

921
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
All that stuff

922
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
He doesn't want

923
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,719
That conversation to start

924
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
So he

925
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,255
He calls them

926
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
That's bees

927
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,863
This was a crazy guy

928
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,447
You said that Miss next clip

929
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,471
Migos down

930
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
A road that I'm

931
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,519
So fucken glad

932
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,871
This guy was a crazy person

933
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:17,183
Muslim groups decrying Islamic Terror attacks on Christians and others

934
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,487
F*** you

935
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:27,167
Truck attack in Nice France in 2016

936
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:34,335
Released a statement such ugly crimes are corrupt of the Earth

937
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,127
And follow in the footsteps of Satan

938
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,943
Cursed out in this life after

939
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:44,575
After that attack the Arab League chief

940
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,879
And called it an act of terrorism

941
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,999
Do United Arab Emirates foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al nahyan

942
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,791
I'm not yet said

943
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
Terrorist

944
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,679
Crime makes it imperative for all to work decisively and without hesitation

945
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
The counterterrorism

946
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
All its form

947
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
And manifestations

948
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,079
Clubs in Orlando

949
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:09,919
That was at a gay club there's no way Muslims would speak out against that

950
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,711
According to Alex

951
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:18,879
Najee toward from the Council of american-islamic relations said quote we condemn it in the strongest possible terms

952
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,927
It violates our principles of American

953
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:27,583
I have a word for Isis and their supporters you did not speak for us you do not represent us you were an aberration

954
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,399
Afghan president Ashraf ghani

955
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,983
The quote I unequivocally condemn the horrific attack on Orlando Florida

956
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,031
Nothing can justify killing of

957
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,383
Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hassan

958
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:45,503
Who's one of the female Muslims in elected office that Alex pretends don't exist

959
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,807
I condemn this dastardly Act

960
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,087
To tear in the strongest pop

961
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,415
Apple term and reiterate my government's zero-tolerance policy again

962
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
Any form

963
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
Terrorism and violence

964
00:46:55,743 --> 00:47:00,095
London mayor Sadiq Khan said quote this heinous and cowardly act impact on LGB

965
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
Key people in Orlando

966
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:05,727
Is an attack on our freedoms and values We Stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Orlando

967
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,055
Hey what about that

968
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,127
There's no way Muslims looking down that right

969
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,967
They should all be for it because it was that you know about the drama mohabbat know that

970
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,039
Muslim Cadet that attack

971
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,391
The Council on american-islamic relations

972
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
Statements quotes

973
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:30,303
We strongly condemn this brutal and cowardly attack and reiterate our repudiation of any such a salt on freedom of speech

974
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,095
Even speech that mocks faith

975
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
And religious figures

976
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,983
The proper response to such attacks on the freedoms we hold dear is not to vilify any faith

977
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,055
But instead to marginalize extremists of all backgrounds

978
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
Who seek to stifle freedom

979
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,663
Extra created wine social

980
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,247
The Arab League Chief Nabil al-arabi

981
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:54,879
Terrorist attack on Charlie have those newspaper in Paris

982
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,671
I could literally do this all day

983
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,719
Impart consider doing exactly

984
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:02,303
Just going through every major terrorist attacks committed by Muslims

985
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,607
A listing of condemnation after condemnation

986
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,399
Influential Muslim

987
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,191
Islamic organizations around the world

988
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
But ultimately

989
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
I realize there wasn't much point

990
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:15,871
The perception exists that Muslims are speaking

991
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,175
The contrary is going to change his mind

992
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,967
Has been closed off by Propaganda

993
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,015
However their two important points

994
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,039
Need to be Broad

995
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:29,951
The first is that it's a little insulting that so many people seem to insist on making Muslims apologize for and denounce things

996
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
Nothing to do

997
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,999
That seems very

998
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,839
The more abusive aspect is that Muslim

999
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,631
Are speaking up about this job

1000
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,679
The people like Alex aren't listening

1001
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,471
Muslim leaders could denounce

1002
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,007
Violence all day long

1003
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:49,407
What is the only place Alex gets any of his information from is the Drudge Report good luck ever learn about the larger Muslim War

1004
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:54,015
Ifucking wrote that at the very top whenever

1005
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
He said

1006
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:01,695
Where are the Muslim voice is it

1007
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:05,279
What you're going to say is oh well they're just saying that because they have to

1008
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,679
These people do exist

1009
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:15,519
You're always going to say where are the Muslim boys

1010
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:20,639
It's an insane level of gaslighting to complain all day that you're being blamed for the actions

1011
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:27,039
Another white guy at the same time to call Muslims condemn the actions of another Muslim

1012
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,879
I literally cannot imagine a less

1013
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,671
Responsible way to carry oneself

1014
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,695
As a broadcaster

1015
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:37,279
Particularly on a day like this

1016
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
Well

1017
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
I mean

1018
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,911
If you're just doing it in your day-to-day life you're piece of s*** you don't have tons of people listening

1019
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,215
That's the part of this petition

1020
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:51,615
Insane he's reinforcing this idea like a lot of his listeners probably like yeah you know what I haven't heard any Muslim

1021
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:58,015
Speak out about that cuz they're not listening either

1022
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,831
It's not it's not a healthy ecosystem

1023
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,111
It's a place where

1024
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,647
Wounds Fester

1025
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,695
Wounds and in deception

1026
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,743
Inspector

1027
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:15,167
You get you get into informational gangrene

1028
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:20,287
Along the line where you guys think something terrible happened to you

1029
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
And that is just

1030
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
Countenance

1031
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,127
It is just

1032
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:28,735
Puss covered wound white supremacy is the pus covered wound of America

1033
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
The Beast of metaphor

1034
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,087
Disgusting

1035
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
Next clip

1036
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,863

Love you too

1038
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:05,855
One word stead condemnation

1039
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,879
L

1040
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,975
Because

1041
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,279
Everything outside

1042
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:20,447
And the Muslims

1043
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,519
Okay so there aren't any normal Modern Love

1044
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:36,319

00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,959

Gourmets the head of the religious Affairs directorate the highest religious Authority in Turkey

Sad quotes

1053
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:02,175
The statement made against Christians is truly awful

1054
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,455
Islamic scholars needs

1055
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:07,551
The focus on this because an inability to

1056
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,855
Harold's the collapse of civilization

1057
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:14,207
After the 2017 bombing of churches in Egypt by ISIS

00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,839

If you chipped in an assault Claim by the Islamic State

1064
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,711
The timing and brutality of the attacks

1065
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,735
Particularly shocking

1066
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,271
Violated

1067
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,855
Christian houses of worship and holy holy day as well

Again this list goes on and on and on

1074
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
He's not listening

1075
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
If you did you would

1076
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
Lose

1077
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943

00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,319
Also

00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:15,647
If you want to get really sad about a website

Condemn

1088
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:30,239
Do you know what's not on the list

1089
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:40,223
List of things that white people as a whole don't have to f****** apologize for it doesn't seem like

1090
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:43,039
Going on TV apologizing for

1091
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,135
You said it wasn't great

1092
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
Great

1093
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,231
Imany called Mexican spiders

1094
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,767
About the f******

1095
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:56,863
The f****** president of the United States condemnation of white Terror

1096
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:03,007
It's not even close to be concept that the condemnations of Islamic Terror

1097
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:06,335
From the people that are full throat

1098
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,383
He can't even do that

1099
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,735
He can't even do that and most of the condemnations of these attacks don't even

1100
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,271
Do the thing that Alex

1101
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
Pretending

1102
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,343
Condemnation

1103
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:24,255
Hiding behind like this isn't Islam

1104
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,279
Yeah.

1105
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,583
Go the sword thing is not acceptable

1106
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
So

1107
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,167
Look I'm done now I'm done with that game let's get on to this next

1108
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:37,823
Warehouse comedy

00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,247
Christian

1110
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,111
He called himself an Eco fascist that thinks

1111
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,423
The right question

1112
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,007
Show you and I and all of us can blank

1113
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,031
That's why

1114
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,591
That's the big takeaway they want you to have well

1115
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,663
Takeaway here is they're covering up

1116
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,943
And you don't ever hear

1117
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,855
Muslim group math killing

1118
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:33,375
Whoops I'm not done with that game

1119
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:39,775
Remember the terror attack in Paris back in November 2015 the one that involves suicide bombers and hostages at the bataclan theater

1120
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,591
It eventually ended up in 130

1121
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,895
Eagles of Death Metal concert

1122
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,199

Released a statement quote

00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:56,415
Despicable attacks on civilians

1125
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,743
We condemn these horrific crimes in the strongest term

1126
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:05,375
Indonesia condemns the violence

1127
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,399
What's the temp place in Paris

1128
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:10,495
Sheikh Ahmed al-tayeb the grand Imam of off

1129
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,031
I was Harvard University

1130
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:17,663
Center for Sunni Muslim scholarships we condemn this odious attack

1131
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:21,247
The time has come for the whole world to unite in order to face this monster

1132
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:26,879
According to ABC News the world responded to the Paris attack

1133
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,927
Quote by India

1134
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:33,791
Muslim gathered Monday to protest the violence

1135
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,071
And we stand with

1136
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:35,839
Parrot

1137
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:38,655
Protesters also trampled on an effigy of a member of ice

1138
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,727
Even though people like Alex consistently refused

1139
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,543
Heroes of the Muslims the world were trying really hard to

1140
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,359
MSNBC

1141
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,663
From right after that to terrorist attack in Paris

1142
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:55,551
Mission of eight leading national and local American Muslim groups held a press conference at washing

1143
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,343
DC to condemn the Carnage

1144
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,159
The Paris attack was on a vet Friday

1145
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,463
The next day Muslim groups held a press conference

1146
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:06,047
And still Alex pretend there isn't any moderate voices in

1147
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,095
Just pathetic

1148
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,143
And now I probably actually I'm done

1149
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:12,959
I'm done

1150
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,007
I told you

1151
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,055
Do you know when you look into the sort of thing you can

1152
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,847
Can find so many confirmations

1153
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,895
Strong and meeting

1154
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,663
Fall end

1155
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,199
I come from a real place

1156
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,247
I why you look into that sort of thing

1157
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,807
You can also find tons of article

1158
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,623
From people in communities were like

1159
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,903
I don't know why everybody

1160
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,719
Keep asking us to do things when we are in no one's list

1161
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,999
Right

1162
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,815
Extra painful level for a lot of people in

1163
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,423
In these organizations that are about Islamic America

1164
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,191
Relationship

1165
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:49,055
Like the idea of it like we're doing exactly what you're claiming we aren't

1166
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,335
And it's not good enough for you

1167
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,127
It's really paint

1168
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,199
Victim-blaming

1169
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,735
To gross

1170
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,271
The other thing is

1171
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:05,695
When you on the date you find those strenuous than strident condemnations of those attacks

1172
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
You can also find

1173
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,815
That same day an article written by one of these guys

1174
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,399
Where are the Islamic voices

1175
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:21,055
3:20

1176
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:26,431
Episode

1177
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,479
Avenida same breath saying

1178
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,247
Why are these

1179
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,831
These people politicizing this is in order to take

1180
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,391
Politicizing

1181
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,159
Assertive

1182
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,463
Side

1183
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,511
Where is he thinks that everyone else is

1184
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:46,911
It's just a stupid game then

1185
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
He's playing

1186
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:54,079
Because he only really just outlined the globalist want to put these labeled conservative

1187
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,127
They want to put these labels on there

1188
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,431
So they're larger community

1189
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,503
Conservative has to accept blame for what happened

1190
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,295
I haven't heard anybody talking about him

1191
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,319
Kris Jenner

1192
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,903
Projector

1193
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,463
Obviously saying though is when he puts

1194
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,487
Islamic

1195
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,255
Terrorist

1196
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,303
Labels onto anybody

1197
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,583
He's obviously say

1198
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,607
That he wants

1199
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,143
The entire group

1200
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,447
To be labeled and accountable for the ax

1201
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:23,519
Actions of one person

1202
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:27,871
You think that their equivalent words terrorist

1203
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:31,455
So he's he's even putting out the Playbook Vicky uses

1204
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,247
As well as a way to

1205
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,063
He's woefully Tramp

1206
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,879
It's bad

1207
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,439
Any other day

1208
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,719
Two things could probably

1209
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,255
We could cover it and it wouldn't

1210
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,631
They know given the circumstances it's just

1211
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,399
I'm sick of

1212
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:56,287
It's going to be an episode where I'm just like I'm not playing around

1213
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,311
You dumbass hole

1214
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,615
I hate you

1215
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,407
You suck what you're doing is dangerous

1216
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,431
Let's stop

1217
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,711
Let's stop the pretense

1218
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:08,831
And getting worse

1219
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,367
But this is

1220
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,999
But if not it's it's

1221
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:21,119
A previously reached career-low

1222
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:27,519
He scored 45 points in a game before but that's a career-high you know what I mean is the literal opposite of a triple-double

1223
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,663
Club 1010 turnover

1224
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,271
He's trying to play a full game with no static

1225
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,575
Are all turnovers

1226
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,391
I'm so in the next Club Alex

1227
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,671
Like descends into

1228
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,463
What I would describe as just like

1229
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,999
I think this is really

1230
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Gross

1231
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,559
Florida

1232
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,471
Watch this one side

1233
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:01,055
Start watch again

1234
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:01,823
The first time you

1235
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
F*****

1236
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,383
Are you f******

1237
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:08,735
I don't understand why anybody would watch that

1238
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
I understand

1239
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,039
People have

1240
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,063
From a forensic

1241
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:12,831
Perspective

1242
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,855
Stuff like that

1243
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:17,951
Researchers things like that I kind of understand from that aspect

1244
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,975
I'm not even close

1245
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:27,423
I would never consider even to like make our analysis more robot or whatever

1246
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:33,823
Audio

1247
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,359
Play blurred vision of it

1248
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,127
Is

1249
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:36,895
Abusive

1250
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,943
That is something that is inappropriate

1251
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,015
I really can't put that strongly enough

1252
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,551
The kind of show that

1253
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,319
He does

1254
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,855
Playing something like that

1255
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,159
Devastatingly inappropriate

1256
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
And I would even say the same thing like

1257
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,719
I don't think

1258
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:53,023
I don't know what they have I certainly hope they haven't

1259
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,815
But if Lexie

1260
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,215
Fairly similar

1261
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,495
Criticisms of them

1262
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,335
Just stop and think about why

1263
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,151
Sensationalize make people

1264
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:09,919
Soufeel

1265
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,455
Because he

1266
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,247
What's 2

1267
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,039
Like there's no there's no

1268
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:15,807
Positive

1269
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,367
No news

1270
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,647
He wants to watch it

1271
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:23,231
Like that really is that really has to be it

1272
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,279
This is some sort of torture

1273
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,935
Just just playing actual gun violence

1274
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:35,007
What would people even his listeners what are they

1275
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:38,847
It's going to make them think this was a globalist

1276
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,383
There's no reason

1277
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:43,711
Especially for blurry

1278
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,991
That's all he wants to see

1279
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:51,647
They just want to see his literal fantasy come true

1280
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,927
But that's something

1281
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,695
Who is audience

1282
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,743
Quite well right

1283
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,303
Is fetish this is a fetish

1284
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,351
I'm not that far but it's

1285
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,447
We find Alex using a

1286
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,727
Previous narrative

1287
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
Built

1288
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
As a waiter

1289
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,311
Enforce his

1290
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,079
Anti-itch

1291
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,871
Islam mentality

1292
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,407
Hey because we do the show the

1293
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,943
We already talked about this

1294
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,479
Narrative

1295
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,759
Will you be able to tell why this

1296
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,159
Lesbos

1297
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,023
Add

1298
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,375
Mexico summer name

1299
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,679
The island of women

1300
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,727
Isla Mujeres

1301
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,263
But

1302
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:51,295
Incompatible

1303
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:57,439
And we wonder why

1304
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,767
He has a long

1305
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:03,839
The other long there because I think he realized

1306
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:08,703
Sounding like I support what this guy did

1307
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:11,775
Islam

1308
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,871
What's that

1309
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:19,455
The killer was justified because

1310
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:23,039
I'm nodding slowly yes that is what he saying

1311
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:27,903
He said quite literally

1312
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,695
Because Islam

1313
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
It is

1314
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:33,791
Quotes

1315
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:40,447
Heavy scare quotes

1316
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:43,519
It was

1317
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,567
Architectural protected list

1318
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,591
Yeah

1319
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,455
Or anything like that

1320
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,247
Alex

1321
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:58,111
Of how incompatible because you left

1322
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:01,183
Are letting these people into our country

1323
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:07,583
Then what do you expect coming up hours

1324
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:19,615
Oh boy I'm really sounded like I like this guy that's why there was a long line

1325
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:26,015
He called himself because

1326
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,319
This comes into a bigger conversation

1327
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,159
Alex is struggling

1328
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,695
With how closely

1329
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,487
What if

1330
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,767
The world

1331
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,047
View that he puts into

1332
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,351
I think that's an important thing

1333
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,631
Clearly Abbott

1334
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Texans

1335
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,983
Turn on some level

1336
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
He realizes

1337
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,871
I do want this guy did he showed up

1338
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,967
And that isn't dangerous f***** up line

1339
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:57,503
Time to walk if you get it

1340
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
Compass 2G

1341
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,135
You want

1342
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:12,863
Next

1343
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,143
Discusses how do you have them

1344
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:27,967
Sarcastic

1345
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,671
If some of this is jokes

1346
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,463
Controlling and stuff like that

1347
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,583
Dedicated

1348
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,863
To marxists communists

1349
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,679
He calls them anti-white

1350
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Murder

1351
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,007
So I don't know how much the

1352
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,287
The guy actually sounds like

1353
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:01,759
He's just going to lay doesn't matter it's just like when we're talking about Muslims decrying

1354
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:07,391
It doesn't matter it doesn't matter what the Manifest says he's going to say what

1355
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:13,535
Paddock shot up the Las Vegas

1356
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,583
Alex

1357
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:22,239
Getting stuff like that whatever your enemy is that

1358
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,519
Things Declassified

1359
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,847
Yes sources in the DHS and blah blah blah blah

1360
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,383
Knowing

1361
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,175
So Alex Costa calls

1362
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,199
Tries

1363
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:31,967
Take calls from

1364
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,991
Specifically Newsela

1365
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,015
Australia

1366
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
And

1367
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,367
The only gets a few callers

1368
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,719
Sleepy boxes idea

1369
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,119
People who know

1370
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:53,471
He goes to brings up the idea that the

1371
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
The shooter

1372
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,031
A terrorist was

1373
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,055
To climate change

1374
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,103
Eventbrite

1375
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:03,199
Earlier

1376
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,223
He doesn't think the climate

1377
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:10,623
Sophomore slump

1378
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,183
No that's how he describes

1379
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,999
And so like that

1380
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,023
Does mention

1381
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,559
Manifesto

1382
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,607
And so this caller has a dumb question

1383
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,287
However

1384
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,895
Climate protest going on

1385
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,175
Current vehicle

1386
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:43,135
If you want

1387
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,999
That's a good question

1388
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,023
Not

1389
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,559
No

1390
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:55,935
College breaking up because then we really understand what

1391
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:58,495
You think that there was a climate change

1392
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,519
Protest

1393
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:04,639
A student walkout some stuff like they cared about

1394
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,407
And climate

1395
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,711
News coverage

1396
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,015
That would have been going to the protest

1397
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:14,623
So the guy's point is that he didn't really care that much about climate change

1398
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,951
According to the range

1399
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:21,023
Broadcast is supposed to have access to

1400
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:24,095
The question that this caller is asking is already

1401
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:27,679
Again I don't know how much of this guy's Manifesto to read is sincere

1402
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:31,007
But Alex is already tried to use the manifesto as a source

1403
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,799
So it's part of what's being covered

1404
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,591
In the manifesto the terrorist

1405
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:37,151
Makes totally clear

1406
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,455
Was entirely about killing minority

1407
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,247
Who have to higher birth rates

1408
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:47,647
He believes the climate change is a problem but it's one that would automatically be solved if all the quote Invaders as he

1409
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:53,535
He calls them were killed because they're the ones who were reproducing too much which he seems to think is the totality of the

1410
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,583
I believe Alex just said that

1411
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:01,727
Argument that he makes all the f****** time

1412
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,495
Thank you sayings

1413
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,263
We are also

1414
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,103
Reproducing

1415
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,919
If the guy is being serious

1416
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:14,015
Manifesto

1417
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:14,783
Climate change

1418
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,343
Or he doesn't really know anything about the actual science

1419
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,135
Behind it

1420
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,671
Most likely this is

1421
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,231
Probably a sarcastic answer in the manifesto

1422
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,279
Or equally likely a belief

1423
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,303
Incorporated into

1424
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,071
Worldview

1425
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:33,471
As a way to make it look like a picture of Muslim wasn't based on pure visceral fear and insecurity was actually rude

1426
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,775
Burdensome for 10 tomorrow concern for the planet

1427
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,055
Just like some people

1428
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,847
Pretend racial science

1429
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,663
Can black people have lower IQs

1430
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:45,247
Either way Alexandra crawler have zero idea what they're even

1431
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,527
Pretending to talk about

1432
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,111
Is the show is just an exercise

1433
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:50,879
Futility

1434
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:51,903
It's nonsense

1435
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,695
Complete nonsense

1436
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,767
Alex finally gets the manifesto

1437
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,815
Looking at the cover

1438
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,119
I'm cover as a design on it says

1439
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,143
Does the great replacement

1440
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,959
And then has a bunch of pictures

1441
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,751
Issues

1442
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,799
Alex

1443
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
And Noda

1444
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,359
The ones that are

1445
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,895
Convenient for Alex to talk about

1446
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,431
He pretends are a joke

1447
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,735
The things that are convenient for him

1448
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,015
He uses

1449
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
Of the great replacement

1450
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,351
Workers rights

1451
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:38,495
Protection of Heritage and culture that's a sucker but again

1452
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,335
Addiction free community

1453
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:50,015
See what he's doing there this is nonsense

1454
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,831
This is the end result of him trying to

1455
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
Horse those cans

1456
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,367
Collecting ideas

1457
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,463
All that matters is his analysis

1458
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,511
Having not looked at this before

1459
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,791
Looks at the cover of it

1460
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:02,815
Cheat codes it

1461
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,607
In a way that means nothing

1462
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,679
It's a meaningless exercise in symbology

1463
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,215
It's like he's got

1464
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:15,103
It seems like he's a child in the doctor's office in like a pediatric

1465
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:19,711
And you got the three-year-old there who's putting squares through the the square hole

1466
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,247
And circle through the circle horror

1467
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,783
And he's looking at that kid

1468
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,855
Just like all right so this is a square and that goes through the circle

1469
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:32,255
Now they tell you that it doesn't go through the circle whole but that's because they don't believe it

1470
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:35,071
Because it's the same size but it doesn't have the edges

1471
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:43,263
V2

1472
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:49,663
Trying to protect the culture of the

1473
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:58,111
So it wasn't a real terrorist

1474
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,391
Yeah

1475
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:05,791
He only opened strongly insinuating that the globalist

1476
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:08,351
Cichlids

1477
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:14,751
I'm just saying that as a whole throughout the entirety of every year the global stage of terror attack

1478
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:18,079
On March 15th

1479
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:29,087
Kind of makes it a little more over naturally suggest

1480
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,623
Not a real thing

1481
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,775
As journalists and reporters

1482
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,847
This thing is a trap

1483
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,551
Exactly

1484
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,111
What he says he wants to do

1485
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,535
Terrific

1486
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:13,119
Is there an available close to Shooters radicalization

1487
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,167
Great deal

1488
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,959
Black

1489
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,983
Better word

1490
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,079
Posting

1491
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,127
Those last three

1492
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,175
Do you know what he's reading

1493
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,503
Somebody else's analysis of the

1494
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:41,791
Robert his post on telling cat got reprinted

1495
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,351
Imitate

1496
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,399
His primary article

1497
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,423
Alex Jones

1498
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,447
We're just read

1499
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:55,103
The first person to be on both hours

1500
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:58,175
Amazing

1501
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:10,719
I wish there was some sort of an air horn we could fire off for that

1502
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:17,119
Real

1503
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:21,471
Contribute

1504
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:29,151
Reading the bios for his guests from your Wiki

1505
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,687
Anything

1506
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,735
It brought like a little bit of a

1507
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:40,415
But I was accidentally quoting Robert

1508
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:45,023
Nextcloud we get to that caller who explains done

1509
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:47,839
Wheatley opposite

1510
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:57,823
It's a very strict meeting I had to go through a 2-hour interview

1511
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,687
How to renew my gun license in Ansonville the family then what's that but you need to help those and down

1512
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,479
It's very strict

1513
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:12,415
A person with a license can buy a semi-automatic

1514
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
Alex Azar

1515
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:17,791
Narrative that first of all there was that attacked

1516
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:20,607
20 years ago where they then got rid of all

1517
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:30,079
Also the idea that outlawed semi-automatic

1518
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:37,247
What about right now is that

1519
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,903
The thing that he just describes a license

1520
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,927
The person not the gun

1521
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:48,255
Like one of the things that the guy was like holyshit

1522
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,839
The Gun 2

1523
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:54,143
Need to register everywhere

1524
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,007
I'm not sure exactly I don't like that

1525
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
I don't know enough

1526
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,407
Possibility

1527
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,175
He had was

1528
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,015
Like there is a possibility

1529
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,295
I don't know

1530
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,575
Recording this on Saturday

1531
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,695
Or Monday before this comes out maybe we will look

1532
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:19,999
Naive or unaware

1533
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:24,095
Hey guys wearing tonight

1534
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:26,143
So I'm Alex has

1535
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
Comes on sometimes

1536
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
Girl

1537
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:36,639
She comes on for the woman named Syrian girl

1538
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,687
Partisan girl

1539
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:45,599
Okay but is from Syria

1540
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,903
Everything I understand

1541
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,207
He's kind of Bashar al-assad apology

1542
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:52,511
Like

1543
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,535
Chemical weapons attack

1544
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,351
Volkswagen

1545
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,119
Back to her

1546
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,911
Reporting

1547
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,935
Infowars

1548
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
Is

1549
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,055
Reason

1550
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,335
Appearance

1551
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:15,295
I don't want

1552
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,855
She is just saying like hey

1553
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:23,487
Seems like f****** around

1554
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,047
Be careful about it

1555
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:27,839
Goes right

1556
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,375
There's almost no contest

1557
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,751
To even accept the idea

1558
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,567
Disabled

1559
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,871
Literal concrete

1560
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:44,223
I'm so whatever is difficult because the manifesto is written

1561
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:47,039
What amounts to an entirely different language

1562
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:53,439
That people that because we can understand the words we think the words mean thing

1563
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:56,767
And they just redefined words so they don't

1564
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:57,791
Anyting

1565
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:01,119
Who is not interesting

1566
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,215
Especially because Alex

1567
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,031
Get another gas

1568
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:09,823
Who

1569
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,639
Matt Bracken

1570
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,431
He showed up a number of times

1571
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:17,503
Run the website called enemies foreign and domestic

1572
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:20,831
Nick.com

1573
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,647
He has some history in

1574
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,183
The service is

1575
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,207
Also has written about

1576
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,231
Starbucks

1577
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:32,607
C4c the race war

1578
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:35,679
Is worldview about what's coming

1579
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,703
I think we've actually

1580
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,727
Gotten fairly in

1581
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,519
Is s***

1582
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,591
Love gun

1583
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:43,871
And is

1584
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,151
I would say

1585
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:50,527
More extreme than Alex and he brings to the preceding

1586
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,063
He's got a sword

1587
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,599
Oh God no

1588
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,135
Dog

1589
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:58,207
He says the guy sounds like a Serbian to him

1590
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:03,071
The Cyrillic writing on the on the weapons even using old church Cyrillic

1591
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:07,679
This is Extreme

1592
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,567
Wow

1593
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,104
Wow

1594
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:22,016
Wow please please tell me that he's in actual islamists please that's what I want to hear please give me that

1595
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,440
Pretend I didn't say exactly

1596
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:31,232
Videos of CIA

1597
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,000
Who is

1598
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,352
I'm at

1599
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,448
When they come back from break

1600
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,264
Manifest

1601
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,824
He's doing a hypothetical

1602
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,872
What's the question

1603
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:50,176
European heritage

1604
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:50,944
She's Australia

1605
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:53,760
And the answer that he provides never specific

1606
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,296
He says that he is Austria

1607
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:59,136
You just point out that Australia is an offshoot of Europe

1608
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:01,696
Like of the penal colony all that stuff yeah

1609
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:03,488
Based on this bracket

1610
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,536
Arises that he might be Serbian

1611
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,912
The problem is that another in another Point spells things out more clearly

1612
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:15,008
I was born in Australia to working-class lower-income family

1613
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,800
My parents are Scotch-Irish

1614
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,568
English stock

1615
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,128
This is shity work on Brackenridge Park

1616
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,664
Is self-contradictory

1617
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,968
He's his speculation or whatever he

1618
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:28,576
He's reading into the manifesto by something that is literally in it

1619
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,136
He's doing a really bad job and if

1620
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:31,904
I don't know

1621
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,720
Just a second or Serbian writing on the Gundam

1622
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,816
Colluding in

1623
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:39,840
Bugging

1624
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,656
The fact that two like the lot of

1625
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,680
People in the right wing

1626
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,776
Are inspired or

1627
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,800
Inspiration from

1628
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,872
That doesn't mean that you Serbia

1629
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,432
Anders Breivik was very inspired by the same

1630
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,200
Yeah

1631
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,504
None of it

1632
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,040
Irresponsible

1633
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,344
To the table

1634
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,136
Irresponsible

1635
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:07,488
Irresponsible about being a f****** monster

1636
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:09,536
Boutonniere

1637
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,376
Further irresponsible because

1638
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,400
Adjusting

1639
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,216
That maybe he's a crypto

1640
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,264
Do you know that different kind of his llamas

1641
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,568
F*** off

1642
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,848
So here's my bracket

1643
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:23,872
One-upping himself

1644
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,640
What stupidity

1645
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:29,248
To be effective than infowar you use the ammunition that's on the table

1646
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,088
And the ammunition on the table is to call this the Facebook Massacre

1647
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:36,160
Penis right on Mark Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg

1648
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,208
He's the guy that made the tool

1649
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:40,768
That instigated

1650
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:44,096
Promoted it if not for Facebook live streaming

1651
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:48,960
He might have done something else or Nothing at All

1652
01:22:55,872 --> 01:23:02,016
Murder there we go.

1653
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,464
So f*** off you're an idiot.

1654
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,256
Totally

1655
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:17,120
If your oil if you're if you're willing to allow that

1656
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,400
Avocado

1657
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,192
What you're saying

1658
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,216
Cause this

1659
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:25,824
You are a strong connection is better

1660
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:32,224
You have completely ruined whatever foot you're trying to stand on

1661
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,272
Is that argument could be twisted that way

1662
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,320
They never do

1663
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,344
Against

1664
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:40,416
Very much against that

1665
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,720
I don't understand why he hates Facebook

1666
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,000
Like that ft

1667
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,536
He's taking the line that's like

1668
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,608
If you do that sort of thing

1669
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,912
It's not Facebook's fault

1670
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,704
Fitbit's person live streams

1671
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:58,336
Facebook where they do they make it so no one can lights to

1672
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:01,152
And then people can't get their messages out

1673
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:09,344
I see what you're doing but that's only because you're being confronted by

1674
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,672
I think it's because he's being confronted by

1675
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,768
The fact that he was kicked off Facebook isn't it isn't allowed to do Facebook live in

1676
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:23,424
He knows the pain he's literally like it's almost like if you shutdown

1677
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,192
On my face

1678
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:29,312
If you shut down Facebook live there's no chance I'll be able to eventually

1679
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,336
Exact

1680
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:32,384
But for now I can still

1681
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,688
So you might be asking yourself

1682
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:40,832
What's going on with Rodger Stone in the middle of this episode

1683
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,744
Nice person

1684
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:54,144
Not enough

1685
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:59,264
Rogers

1686
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:05,152
Obviously enjoy men

1687
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,992
She won't even talk to me

1688
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,296
Featherstonhaugh

1689
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,976
Rogers gone

1690
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:25,376
She's gone.

1691
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:30,240
An amicable parting

1692
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,544
To be fair his operation

1693
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,312
Launch

1694
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:38,176
So that that could just be the interim. Specially while Alex is so

1695
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,456
Preoccupied

1696
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,224
Lawsuit

1697
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:43,296
He starts complaining about how Jerome corsi suing

1698
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:47,648
Little bit later

1699
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:51,488
Max Wright

1700
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:53,792
Matt Bracken

1701
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,584
Cuz that guy is

1702
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,168
It is analysis of this attack is

1703
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,704
If you

1704
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,520
And I thought that was as bad as it

1705
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,288
Could get

1706
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:10,432
How could it possibly get worse while Alex wants to make this a three-way dance

1707
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:17,344
Stewart Road

1708
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:21,184
Warning about false flag

1709
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,264
But he got caught

1710
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,592
Stroud's what's your first approximated

1711
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:44,224
What's a video video online

1712
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,528
I think this guy was a

1713
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,088
Believer

1714
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,880
Apparently

1715
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:54,208
He wanted to start a race war

1716
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:05,728
The same it's going to be used to attempt to

1717
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:08,288
Disarm

1718
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:11,872
And also to censor us

1719
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:17,504
So I'm actually being like this guy is

1720
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,808
Cuz you don't expect to hear that

1721
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:26,720
Stewart Rhodes

1722
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:30,816
Why does not surprise me later use the term us

1723
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,120
What he said

1724
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:39,008
Pronoun

1725
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,544
Alex

1726
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:46,432
This guy is a True Believer white supremacy

1727
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:49,760
And regardless of whether or not he was mine controlled

1728
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:52,064
It's going to be used to demonize us

1729
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,136
White supremacist

1730
01:27:55,648 --> 01:28:00,256
White supremacist and I'll allow you

1731
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,024
You two have that right

1732
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,632
Biggest grape

1733
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,936
. possible or whatever the biggest

1734
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:12,288
Benefit of the doubt and assume

1735
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:17,664
If only because that doesn't make enough batter

1736
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:20,224
That is all

1737
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,016
The care about is this idea of like

1738
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:22,784
It's going to

1739
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,320
Argon

1740
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,088
Being gone and

1741
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,696
Later

1742
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:30,464
Society

1743
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:36,608
Like a released a statement condemning White

1744
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:39,424
Keepers releases statement

1745
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,472
White nationalist

1746
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:47,872
Some people have no

1747
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,456
Committing the same fallacy

1748
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
Alex

1749
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,992
Muslims

1750
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,272
Just because we didn't hear

1751
01:28:54,528 --> 01:29:00,416
Their condemnation of it doesn't mean it doesn't exist

1752
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,328
Like he's crazy

1753
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:13,984
Well he also said of course this was going to happen because of Muslim so I didn't really bring the store next one

1754
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:20,384
Even in his condemnation of white nationalist terrorism it's really in condemnation of Islamic terrorists

1755
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:26,016
They're not even that it's an insinuation that all things are because of Islamic

1756
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:30,880
Sort of caught himself

1757
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,928
Sort of agreeing with

1758
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:34,976
Motivate

1759
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,280
This terrorist Act

1760
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:40,864
Rhodes falls into the same trap that no one set for him

1761
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,632
Innocent

1762
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:53,152
When I was worried about her concern about masturbation

1763
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,984
We can't

1764
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,312
Hold on I don't agree with the way this guy did it

1765
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,128
Yeah

1766
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:29,760
You saw a very real problem we can't

1767
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:32,832
Yeah I mean that's close to

1768
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,112
Like

1769
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:40,512
Non condemnation

1770
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:46,912
That's really close to her right at guys in it

1771
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:49,472
Society

1772
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:52,032
It's like running a very serious risk of like

1773
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:52,800
Well

1774
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,336
What you do is

1775
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,104
You are

1776
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,384
Encouraging

1777
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:02,784
You crossed the line of what is appropriate

1778
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:07,648
He had a meeting with the HR of white supremacist than they were like hold on

1779
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:11,488
You need to give a speech to the all the white supremacist then you have to say

1780
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:15,328
Listen we all agree with this guy but we don't like what he

1781
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:17,632
Did we think what he should have done

1782
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,936
Is just been really really racist

1783
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:22,496
And make sure that all of our policies were racist

1784
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,264
Estes Park

1785
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:24,800
What are you f******

1786
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,336
Doing

1787
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,896
Concern

1788
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,688
All

1789
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,456
Totally

1790
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:36,832
Cool method

1791
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,392
Because their fears

1792
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,416
The method

1793
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,952
Interconnect

1794
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,488
Absolutely

1795
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,280
I'm going to lay out my thoughts about

1796
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,304
The end of the episode

1797
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,840
But you cannot believe

1798
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:48,608
The things

1799
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:50,144
That this guy believe

1800
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,936
And then Alex Jones

1801
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,984
And Nazi where Italy

1802
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,288
Do that

1803
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,824
It is impossible

1804
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,592
To escape

1805
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,616
The natural

1806
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,640
End result

1807
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,920
Of this rhetoric

1808
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,968
And we'll get to that his his

1809
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,784
The only way to read what he said is

1810
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,344
He was talking to the victims at the mosque

1811
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:12,928
Said what was going to happen you moved here

1812
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,696
Bright

1813
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:16,000
You built that what did you think was going to have

1814
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,792
That's what he said

1815
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,584
What was it

1816
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:20,864
That's exactly

1817
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,936
Alex realizes maybe she's getting a little too hot

1818
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:27,520
I'm so he's got to tell a very not true story

1819
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:31,104
This is up there with the Nazi hat on Halloween

1820
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:35,968
Okay this is up there with the globalist to the hot tub haha

1821
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,368
Yes

1822
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,952
This is up there in the pantheon of not true Alex story

1823
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,232
Details that are

1824
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:54,144
Oh I was it I was in a hotel Mexico

1825
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:00,800
Hotel

1826
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,872
I was watching

1827
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:07,456
Jeb

1828
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,784
So is Muslim

1829
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,344
Hijabs

1830
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:32,288
Friend

1831
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:45,600
About what

1832
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,648
So the

1833
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:49,184
Wrong response

1834
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,232
To Muslims is saying

1835
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,512
Be my friend

1836
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,816
Guess that I mean

1837
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,096
The story didn't happen

1838
01:33:56,352 --> 01:34:01,472
Happened but it is kind of try

1839
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:06,592
Yeah they all hate you should never

1840
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,128
Muslims that are Resort

1841
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,664
Mexico

1842
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,784
They hate your beautiful supply shop in Austin

1843
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:20,416
They hate you

1844
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:31,168
Depends if you committed against them

1845
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:34,240
Leanne killing

1846
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,056
Even

1847
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:40,640
Justifying murdering Muslim

1848
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:49,088
I need some ways because you deserve

1849
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,112
You get

1850
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:56,000
This entire show so far has been him trying to say

1851
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
Him

1852
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:00,096
It reinforcing the things that are behind

1853
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:03,168
What is terrorizing Muslims around the world

1854
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:06,496
Like no matter what event

1855
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,776
First attack outage

1856
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,592
If you just looked at this show and the rhetoric of

1857
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:11,360
He's putting forth

1858
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,152
It is what leads

1859
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,432
People to attack mode

1860
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,480
There is no way around that

1861
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,248
Nothing

1862
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,296
So already hurt Alex

1863
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:21,856
Kind of accidentally

1864
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,136
Start talking about how we

1865
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:23,904
Agrees with

1866
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,184
What the terrorists

1867
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,976
Yeah I've already heard

1868
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:29,792
Roads are exactly the same

1869
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:31,584
And now it's Matt bracken's turn

1870
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,120
To basically agree

1871
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,448
I've been reading the manifesto and

1872
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,008
You know there's a there's a lot of what

1873
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,336
The shooter says that is on point

1874
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:47,968
And some of it isn't about the decadence of the West. We've been discussing the

1875
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,528
Are the eleven-year-old drag queen in

1876
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,576
This is a society that's intended

1877
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:57,696
You're on his side a******

1878
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:04,352
All three of you motherfukers are justifying

1879
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,656
Equivocate

1880
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,192
And making okay

1881
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:10,752
What was done to these 49 people

1882
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:13,312
And countless others who survived

1883
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:16,384
And the victims family members and their loved one

1884
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,944
Traumatized because

1885
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,736
That is all

1886
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:24,832
They're getting on air in blaming their perceived enemies

1887
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:27,392
And then at the same time in the same breath

1888
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,696
I mean it makes a lot of great points

1889
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:32,512
This isn't someone at a cocktail party

1890
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:35,584
Years later telling you about how the Unabomber had good point

1891
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:41,728
This is the day after father situation is still broiling

1892
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:44,032
Bobby situation

1893
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,824
Crisis it's a life-or-death

1894
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,360
Situation for tons of people

1895
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,384
He

1896
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:51,456
Said parentheses

1897
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,528
I mean who hasn't thought about doing this before

1898
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:58,880
If you look I read his Manifesto he's made a lot of great points

1899
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:01,440
I'm just saying I thought about doing what he did

1900
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,768
If you mix a lot of grateful

1901
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,328
It's hard not to hear some of it

1902
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,400
So in the next with Alex makes

1903
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,936
F****** bold pronounce

1904
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:28,832
The entire Manifesto on air

1905
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,136
Heart attack

1906
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,672
Thrice

1907
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:44,192
I love you like selected little blurb that is in Turnbull.

1908
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,592
Come at me bro

1909
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:54,176
Laugh at him

1910
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:56,736
You are Icarus flying too close to the Sun

1911
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:59,040
With your bold pronouncements of reading

1912
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:02,880
It's ridiculous I would love to

1913
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:09,280
Ariel

1914
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:15,424
You're hooked on Whiskey not Sonic literally impossible for him to read entire page

1915
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,216
So he doesn't

1916
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:17,984
Get into the

1917
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,336
He starts talking about how these Mass Shooters aren't Brave

1918
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:29,504
Islamic

1919
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,808
Whatever

1920
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:46,144
Warriors

1921
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:51,264
Islam

1922
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:03,040
Not good

1923
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:05,856
But before we go

1924
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:07,136
F****** awful it is

1925
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,672
That stuff over

1926
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:09,696
Policy of

1927
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:10,464
Fruit

1928
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:20,960
Yes never again is what you swore the time before is underneath like that

1929
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,984
Awesome

1930
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,264
Just like underneath

1931
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,288
His

1932
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,568
Horribly

1933
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,336
Casting

1934
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:28,896
Lake desire for a actual

1935
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:30,176
I guess

1936
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,968
And then this condemnation

1937
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,248
Audit Muslims

1938
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,784
Attack women and children

1939
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,624
Here's a shortlist of white terrorists in the United States who targeted women and children

1940
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,648
Which is not

1941
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:42,208
Surprising at all because they're terrorists

1942
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:49,120
Timothy McVeigh intentionally chose a federal building with the daycare center in it because he believed he was getting revenge for Ruby Ridge

1943
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,912
Randy Weaver son was killed by the police

1944
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:51,936
He wasn't opposed

1945
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:57,312
Dylann roof killed Six Women in his church shooting two of them were older than 70 years old

1946
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,336
He wasn't a Muslim

1947
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:01,408
Robert Gregory Bowers the terrorists who killed 11 people at the

1948
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:03,712
The Tree of Life synagogue killed three women

1949
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:05,504
None younger than 75

1950
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,320
One of them was 97 years old he wasn't a Muslim

1951
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:13,440
Patrick Kelly the Devin Patrick Kelley the terrorist behind

1952
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:15,488
Springs mass shooting back in 2017

1953
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:19,072
Kill 10 women and children and one unborn child

1954
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:19,840
He wasn't the most

1955
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:24,960
Elliot Rodger of the 2014 Isla Vista Shooting

1956
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:25,984
Dudes

1957
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:29,056
He felt didn't deserve the women who had chosen to them over him

1958
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:32,384
He killed two women but definitely was trying to kill one more

1959
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,408
He wasn't a Muslim

1960
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:37,248
This list could go on and on just like my Muslim condemnation

1961
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,016
Terrorism

1962
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,576
Alex is

1963
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,880
Like making definition

1964
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,160
Of Islam

1965
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:45,952
Buy a definition of terrorist

1966
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:49,536
And refusing to accept that it is not a one-to-one parallel

1967
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,840
He is demonizing an entire community

1968
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,888
By making

1969
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,424
This is

1970
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,448
The dangerous red

1971
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,472
That existed

1972
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,264
In the world that is unfounded

1973
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,544
Not based on any

1974
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:01,824
And only leads

1975
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:04,128
And putting people's lives at

1976
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,176
Let's let's

1977
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,456
What you talk about him

1978
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:14,112
How many times how many times does

1979
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:18,720
The government said he loved so much run by Trump

1980
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,256
How many times

1981
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,792
Women and children specific

1982
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:26,144
Do you think Christianity is anti-abortion

1983
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:37,920
They're so against really want women and children

1984
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:46,624
Let's talk about him I don't give a s*** about terrorist about people

1985
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,672
People

1986
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:50,720
Christianity really loves

1987
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:51,744
Women and

1988
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:58,400
Alex supports the children locked up

1989
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,192
Women and children

1990
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:01,472
Concentration camp

1991
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,496
Stan bright

1992
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:03,776
Grateful

1993
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,336
Love women f******

1994
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:10,432
Alex makes a Target out of that child

1995
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:23,488
Survivor and now he's working his way up to making a Target

1996
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:27,840
I mean the entire Community of Christ Church to some extent in New Zealand

1997
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:33,472
If you were a Muslim and you were to listen

1998
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:35,776
I don't know how you would

1999
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,104
Like with this sort of rhetoric being put forth

2000
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,408
By someone who has a large audience

2001
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:47,040
And knowing that whatever is being said on the radio show.

2002
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:47,808
Comparison

2003
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,088
What's being said

2004
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:49,856
Off-air

2005
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:56,512
Places of the internet I don't understand how you could not feel

2006
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:57,792
Completely threatened

2007
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,328
If you were like

2008
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,376
I don't know for 12 year olds

2009
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:02,912
Just wants to live their license

2010
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,704
All that stuff I don't know

2011
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,752
I don't know how you couldn't feel like you were a Target

2012
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,288
What

2013
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:09,824
What b*******

2014
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,872
Is obvious

2015
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,920
Is that with these things

2016
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:14,944
Is it used to be

2017
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:17,504
You would have to go to 40

2018
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,296
Two Fine people

2019
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,856
Essentially praising this guy

2020
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,648
For doing what he did

2021
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:24,672
The day off

2022
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,232
Exactly

2023
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,512
They used to take awhile

2024
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:35,168
The GOP and Fox News and Alex Jones all used to have two grand Stanford

2025
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:40,288
Yes we do decry this and then a week later they could go back to the Muslims

2026
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,568
Because everybody kind of forgot

2027
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:45,152
Now they do it the next day they don't know they don't even wait

2028
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,688
Until the end of the event

2029
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,224
To say that Muslims fault

2030
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,040
Can you really grow shortcut

2031
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:52,576
Anyways

Stomach

2034
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:09,216
Does it mean to be a

2035
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,496
There needs to be

2036
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,800
Some sort of holding people accountable

2037
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,848
For what they put into the world

2038
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:15,616
Leads to

2039
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,384
Right

2040
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:20,224

When you can get you married who you bye

2047

The wife at the girl has nothing to say but who's she married

And if she doesn't do what you like her to do

2056
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:22,176
47 months

2057
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,272
You cannot

2058
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:28,064
You can Lobby in be associated with

2059
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:28,832
With jeffry Epps

2060
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,112
Literally

2061
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,904
And still not have any consequence

2062
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:37,536
You can literally be Jeffrey Epstein and have very limited consequences for your pickaxe

2063
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:44,192
I mean this is all this is but I hate him

2064
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,776
Alex

2065
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:52,384
Pretty much says that the attack on Christchurch was a false flag

2066
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,176
And then you're going to love what happens right after that

2067
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,224
I've been saying

2068
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,344
Invasion going on

2069
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,904
The attacks on mosques and I said they're coming

2070
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:06,976
Here

2071
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:09,792

Do you know where

2080
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:57,152
It somehow almost

2081
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:03,552
It's almost comforting for him to call it a cost as opposed to blaming Muslims themselves

2082
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,600
For making it happen

2083
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:12,000
American Auto Sale in Faribault us need to have a false-flag I guess

2084
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:18,912
Interesting

2085
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:25,312
This is entirely Islam's.

2086
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:30,688
Which state

2087
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:32,224

In our two years with

01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:44,512
Regal

2092
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:51,424
So

2093
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,448
In terms of

2094
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:55,264
If he's blaming Islam or if he's

2095
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,288
Volkswagen

2096
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:00,896
Whatever the case may be

2097
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:01,664
Behind it

2098
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,944
And that is the Alex's

2099

2104
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:18,560
As white people

2105
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:19,840
Are the real victims

2106
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:21,632
Of the Christchurch

2107
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:32,128
That you don't use the paralyzer on me imma be pissed

Manhattan bottles

2110
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:45,952
I'm good but

2111
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:48,000
What it is what it is

2112
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:50,304
Down in New Zealand

2113
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,680
See if not a capitalist American

2114
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,704
You know what

2115
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:00,544
They're coming for it that's an attack on US America directly

2116
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:14,880
Do super smart

2117
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,008
Girls

2118
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,032
Gross

2119
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,080
Next level

2120
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:36,384
In terms of

2121
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:39,712
That's just

2122
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,784
If you take

2123
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:47,136
Do you know Tony radical man

2124
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:51,232
He'll have a great business

2125
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,304
But if you take an Egyptian man

2126
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:57,120
Turn him Muslim

2127
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,960
Well then he's going to start acting like an animal

2128
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:05,824
This is dehumanizing

2129
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:10,688
Yeah I mean this is

2130
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:11,968
Next Level over

2131
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:14,016
In terms of what he's putting in

2132
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,808
To the world like there's no excuse

2133
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:21,952
If you're if you're putting stuff out

2134
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:26,304
Cannot be broadcast in the lead-up to

2135
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,072
World War

2136
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:29,888
Yeah what you're doing is you're saying that all

2137
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:32,192
Muslims share quality that is

2138
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:33,472
And inhumanity

2139
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,496
Yep

2140
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:36,032
And that is never accepted

2141
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:36,800
They're animals

2142
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:38,336
And that is that is not okay

2143
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:40,384
Circumstances

2144
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:41,664
Particularly

2145
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,688
After

2146
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:44,224
Water

2147
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,016
Of people because

2148
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:46,784
They were Muslim

2149
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,832
Happening in the world

2150
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:50,880
This is

2151
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:51,648
Insane

2152
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:58,048
This is really insane like me

2153
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,328
F****** prayers

2154
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,608
We're not even there

2155
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:05,984
We went from a massacre happening to out-and-out defending wire Massacre

2156
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,008
Should happen

2157
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:09,056
And

2158
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,080
Ascribing blame

2159
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:10,848
Do the victims

2160
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:12,384
Insinuating

2161
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:13,664
Because of

2162
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:16,992
They are capable of

2163
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:20,576
This is just

2164
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:21,344
F******

2165
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:28,512
I just I just don't know whether it was

2166
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:31,072
10 years ago when people

2167
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:32,608
Said this without saying it

2168
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,168
Do you think so

2169
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:41,568
Cuz this is not a crime show that yet

2170
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:43,616
Variable

2171
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:45,920
Perspective

2172
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:47,968
If you're looking at how you would love the world

2173
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:51,040
Secretly believe these

2174
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:54,368
But aren't allowed to save them

2175
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:55,648
Freely in public

2176
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:59,488
It's not that much better you wish that everybody understood each other

2177
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:01,536
And cared about each other on it

2178
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:03,584
Obviously

2179
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,376
Right

2180
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:08,192
But it is in the real world

2181
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:10,240
IFixit

2182
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,008
You would rather

2183
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,032
People

2184
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,872
Right

2185
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:17,152
Destroy entire

2186
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,688
Community

2187
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:19,968
Hates that

2188
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:25,088
It's a ad like I suppose the only thing is what stage of dealing with

2189
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,112
Cancer are we at

2190
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,392
Because

2191
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:33,792
Where is Extreme right

2192
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:39,680
Search for Oliver goddamn

2193
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:42,240
Collagist

2194
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:55,296
They're just trying to demonize these wonderful cells

2195
01:52:55,552 --> 01:53:01,696
Yeah

2196
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:07,584
They grow faster and you can't kill him

2197
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,888
That sounds good

2198
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:18,592
See that's up on some level this metaphor.

2199
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:20,896
Because there were warning signs in

2200
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,688
Dupree metastasizing

2201
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:23,456
FaZe

2202
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,760
And the people who were

2203
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,368
We're the ones who got those signs

2204
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:32,160
And retractor

2205
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:34,208
Stuff like that

2206
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:37,024
And what's interesting about that

2207
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,328
You look back at Alex

2208
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:40,352
2000

2209
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:42,656
Wasn't

2210
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:43,936
Hedonism

2211
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:45,216
Like what he's

2212
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:47,520
Become Now isn't

2213
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:48,288
Is that

2214
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:51,104
All of this stuff is that world change

2215
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:53,664
Yeah the militia Patriot

2216
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:55,968
Jaheim some way

2217
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:02,368
Predominantly

2218
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,648
I'm anti

2219
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:04,928
And it's

2220
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,512
It's troubling because all of the other stuff

2221
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:10,304
Before informed

2222
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:15,680
DHHS

2223
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:16,960
Bia taking

2224
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,752
White

2225
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,544
Seriously has aided

2226
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:23,360
In the world

2227
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,200
You did

2228
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,736
Previous

2229
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:30,528
Even believe in these things

2230
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:32,320
Is a part of

2231
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,624
What would the present reality

2232
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:40,000
Traps them in this current ideologies because if they were to accept

2233
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:43,840
I changed now they would have they would have to accept that they were

2234
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:44,608
Wrong

2235
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:45,376
To change that

2236
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,680
Yeah

2237
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:51,520
Let's break

2238
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,312
Heavy stuff

2239
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:54,336
Because Alex

2240
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:57,408
He starts getting really

2241
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,944
If you ever need a

2242
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,248
Assertive glimpse

2243
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:02,528
At his narcissist

2244
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:03,552
How it works

2245
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,344
This next clip is Xzibit

2246
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:10,464
We're going on behind the scenes around here

2247
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:24,544
Power structure has figured out that

2248
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:27,104
He's not going to work the people are against it

2249
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:29,664
Hit the people that run

2250
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:32,224
Salons compartmentalize

2251
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,136
Avengers

2252
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:44,256
Scramble to figure out what

2253
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:48,096
We have reached here

2254
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,144
And I'll just leave it at that

2255
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:58,336
Different level

2256
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:01,408
Government military

2257
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,992
Literally

2258
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:10,112
I'll just how about we don't model everything up after time to shine

2259
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:11,648
Let's start

2260
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:13,440
Do you understand what he's saying

2261
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:15,232
Cuz I'll spell it out for you

2262
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,072
Do you think he had globalist

2263
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:21,120
To the table to be like

2264
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,168
Should be on our team

2265
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:26,752
Now things have gone so bad for the globalist

2266
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:29,312
Did he have globalist that are coming up to him in there like

2267
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:32,128
He is now the oracle

2268
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:36,224
They could tell the globalist out of right the ship

2269
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:38,528
He is acting like he is now

2270
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:46,464
No because he's getting a consultant

2271
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,232
He's not working

2272
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:53,888
But the approach that they're having his different apps

2273
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:58,240
They're like this dark side

2274
01:56:58,496 --> 01:56:59,264
Don't you love Satan

2275
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,288
Don't You Love

2276
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:05,920
Not anymore

2277
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:11,552
Alex

2278
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:17,952
We don't know how to take

2279
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:26,656
Is a pathetic level of narcissism like just

2280
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:28,192
I would love

2281
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:30,240
To talk to someone who listens to Alex

2282
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:31,008
What's the show Hoopa

2283
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,032
Give that

2284
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:34,080
Yeah like I would love to

2285
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:35,872
Figure out what it would take for

2286
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:37,408
YouTube

2287
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,944
Yeah

2288
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:41,504
Phrase it I asked

2289
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:46,624
The hike-and-bike trail

2290
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:49,184
That is crazy.

2291
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:55,584
Lifelong enemies

2292
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,168
It's no good we better call in Alex for a consult

2293
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:03,776
It's nice to take that little moment

2294
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:05,312
To enjoy Alex's

2295
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:06,080
Is narcissism

2296
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:12,480
Because now we get to the point where Alex

2297
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,344
Like just generally

2298
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:20,672
Don't do that even if you are a mainstay

2299
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:21,952
News source

2300
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:24,768
Probably not in anyone's best interest

2301
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:26,304
To read this guy's

2302
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,632
If you're Alex it's certainly going

2303
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,936
A productive exercise

2304
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:35,520
If you're a researcher

2305
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:37,568
With full understanding of

2306
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:38,336
The contacts

2307
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:41,152
And you're trying to put this in a larger

2308
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,176
I like

2309
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:46,016
A larger world that explains.

2310
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:52,416
This event but so many and how it ties all that together and you're going to put this together over this over that

2311
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,440
Like a year

2312
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:55,488
Read the hell out of that Manifesto

2313
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:57,024
If a murderer

2314
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,048
If a mass

2315
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,840
Murder happened yesterday

2316
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:00,864
Delray

2317
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:05,216
Let it go. Now

2318
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:07,008
I mean like really though

2319
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:11,104
No matter who you are no matter what the

2320
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,152
What time frame is

2321
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:14,176
Be careful

2322
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:15,968
Because you might be

2323
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:16,992
Helping

2324
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,784
What the terrorists wanted

2325
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,320
Yeah I know I mean

2326
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,600
Like

2327
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:23,648
That we've already talked over and over again about some

2328
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:25,184
Trolli

2329
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:27,232
Clearly jokes

2330
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:28,000
Sarcastic

2331
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:29,536
Attempt

2332
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:31,328
8 people into X wires

2333
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:33,376
If you don't know what you're doing

2334
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:34,400
And you just read the

2335
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:37,984
You run the very serious risk

2336
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:39,776
Terrorist

2337
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:41,824
In the end goal that they

2338
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:48,736
To write it's a game that you shouldn't play unless you are very certain you know what you're doing

2339
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:52,064
One of the reasons why anytime that we talked about any

2340
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:52,832
Anything from

2341
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:54,368
The manifesto on this episode

2342
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:55,136
I tried to

2343
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:56,160
Clear

2344
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:57,440
I have no idea

2345
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,720
Serious about this

2346
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:00,768
The only use Bing

2347
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:01,536
As like

2348
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:05,120
Well let's what Alex's say

2349
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,424
I don't know where

2350
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,960
Does not what he has to say

2351
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:09,984
Right

2352
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,008
Alex

2353
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:13,056
But he also clearly has

2354
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:13,824
Red

2355
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:15,104
And is just

2356
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:16,384
Getting these texts

2357
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,408
From his

2358
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:18,944
And ask

2359
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:20,736
He starts to

2360
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:21,504
Respond

2361
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,576
Is in his normal by

2362
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:25,856
That's very interesting

2363
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:27,136
Something to see how that happen

2364
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:28,160
And what

2365
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:29,184
Because of that

2366
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,208
I think you know what's

2367
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:35,328
I chose firearms for the fact that it would have a social discourse

2368
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:44,544
United States situation the world

2369
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:48,896
You should just got it feel like you had a home as a man to show you were successful

2370
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:55,040
Analogous

2371
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,088
Just talkin about

2372
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:58,880
And also

2373
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:01,696
You clearly talk

2374
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:08,608
Using people like Alex

2375
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:09,888
Use all of these guns

2376
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:13,472
Because I know that people are going to have a conversation about

2377
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:17,824
The last is going to move gun regulation

2378
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:21,664
People like

2379
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,944
Some sort of 8

2380
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:23,968
Further conflict

2381
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,016
I don't know if that's actually

2382
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:30,368
But that is what

2383
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,136
Alex

2384
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:32,416
Not realizing

2385
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,512
The side

2386
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,280
That the right

2387
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:38,048
Plays

2388
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:40,864
In the manifestos conception of the back

2389
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:43,168
That will come from this attack

2390
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:44,960
Next clip

2391
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:47,008
I think

2392
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:47,776
He starts

2393
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:48,544
To get

2394
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:53,152
Maybe a little bit jealous

2395
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:56,480
What about the shooting and more about have better aim

2396
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:57,760
It's more about the ideas

2397
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:01,344
Fractions

2398
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:09,280
Set up pressure left-wing the United States

2399
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:10,048
Speak

2400
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:11,072
Abolish

2401
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:13,632
Liberty

2402
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:18,752
Wright's by The Leftovers ultramatic station

2403
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:24,640
She's all written

2404
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:34,368
What's going on there there's a sense of Alex being like I already know

2405
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:35,904
Which is not something you wanted

2406
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:40,512
Here be to a terrorist

2407
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:43,584
Sincere or not like whatever is writing you don't want to be like

2408
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,888
I've been saying that forever man

2409
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:48,448
Later when I

2410
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:51,008
Keepsake

2411
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:54,336
Moringa terrorist Manifesto

2412
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:59,968
I would want that I would want that

2413
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:04,832
But you understand his insecurities and pettiness require

2414
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:05,856
This is

2415
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,392
Is my s*** right

2416
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:12,000
I didn't get it from him he got it for me and his biggest problem with the mass shooting is

2417
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:12,768
Is plagiarism

2418
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:16,096
Something like this on here when you're out

2419
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:18,656
Probably a bad idea

2420
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:20,960
Anybody

2421
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:21,984
Exactly what

2422
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:26,336
Alex

2423
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:29,408
You listen to

2424
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:33,248
Alex

2425
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:34,272
Pull up

2426
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:40,672
Do you know you're heading into a tailspin man

2427
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:43,744
He kills people you think he came up with it no

2428
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:50,144
You just see Harrison Smith put his head down and walk out the door like that I tried.

2429
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,936
Oh well

2430
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:53,984
Galaxy

2431
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,264
Expressing that he's mad that he

02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:56,288
Get a shout-out

2433
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:02,944
Honestly believe that was going to happen

2434
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:07,040
I mean

2435
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:08,064
Quickly save that

2436
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:10,624
Like that but it's sort of the sense that I get

2437
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,392
Behind his word

2438
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:37,760
Is it

2439
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:41,344
From there

2440
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:44,928
What the f***

2441
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:48,512
Worse than him not wanting a

2442
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:53,632
He's talking about like all these ideas

2443
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:54,400
Guys putting

2444
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:01,568
Like I rebooted 1776

2445
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:06,176
Where is the real leaders

2446
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:07,712
And I never was going to act like

2447
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:13,856
Forever

2448
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,904
My reading is

2449
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:16,928
He is saying

2450
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:21,792
This guy's attack was unnecessary

2451
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:27,168
Because we've already started the process by which we're going to get rid of and solve all the problems

2452
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:29,216
Manifest

2453
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:35,872
It's already been triggered the the movement to get rid of all Muslims that's already started

2454
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:38,944
Ivan bear

2455
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:40,480
I've been telling people to

2456
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:43,296
To do what you what you told them to do

2457
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:46,112
For such a long time we've already got the ball rolling

2458
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:47,392
What are you doing

2459
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:49,696
You don't even bring anything to this table

2460
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:57,376
But a better reading of it is possibly

2461
02:05:57,632 --> 02:05:58,144
Like

2462
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:00,960
Speaking as Alex

2463
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:02,496
I am afraid

2464
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:05,568
People are going to look at him

2465
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:09,152
Figure in some sort of a pushback

2466
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:11,456
Against invading Muslim hordes

2467
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:16,832
When they may be wild

2468
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,392
An immediate response

2469
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:22,976
To first of all the aftermath like the day after

2470
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:26,048
A terrorist

2471
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:26,816
Like this

2472
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:30,400
Like

2473
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:31,936
You are so

2474
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:32,704
Beyond

2475
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:33,472
Bucked up

2476
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:42,944
Expresses are entirely expresses jealousy of him

2477
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:47,552
Is attained by the dirt

2478
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:48,832
If I'd killed

2479
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:51,648
I think there's a

2480
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:55,232
I think there's a little bit but that's not that's

2481
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,304
Alex

2482
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:02,656
Look into the like the actual

2483
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:06,496
You kind of

2484
02:07:07,008 --> 02:07:08,800
People are going to give credit

2485
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:11,104
For a movement that I started

2486
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:11,872
If the

2487
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:13,408
The push-and-pull

2488
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:15,200
Between the

2489
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:17,248
The surface world

2490
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:19,552
Of all this stuff like Alex

2491
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:21,856
Tucker

2492
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:25,696
Really disgusting

2493
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:26,976
Islam

2494
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:28,512
Display on the rig

2495
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:30,304
All of whom are hilarious

2496
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:33,376
They do all this stuff on the

2497
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:34,144
Publicly

2498
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:35,936
And then there are

2499
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:38,496
People like this guy who shot up these

2500
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:41,312
Who are doing the the other part

2501
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:44,896
Which is The Logical extension of exact

2502
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:46,176
Most people

2503
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:48,224
Like the Ben Shapiro show

2504
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:48,992
The world

2505
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:51,296
Whenever these terrorist attacks happen

2506
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:54,880
Clearly an offshoot of what they put into the world

2507
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,160
Rhetoric

2508
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:58,208
Like holyshit

2509
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:01,280
I'm not involved how dare you say I am

2510
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:06,400
Write analysis like for this

2511
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:07,680
That's where Alex lives

2512
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:08,448
And I think it's

2513
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:10,752
The Peace of the militia.

2514
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:13,312
That he kind

2515
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:14,336
Resents the fact

2516
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:15,616
The part of the info

2517
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:23,808
He recognizes on some level he wants to be part of that Michigan militia baby there on the front lines

2518
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:26,368
Uno's

2519
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:29,184
Reclaim more like

2520
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:32,768
The person who put the

2521
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:34,048
Anti-immigrant

2522
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:37,888
Rhetoric into if you go shoot

2523
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,472
Is

2524
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:42,496
Be the guy

2525
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:43,264
Who

2526
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:46,336
Sounds the alarm it is always antivirus

2527
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:52,736
Which informs color honor last episode

2528
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:56,064
I'm in the Splinter Cell

2529
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:04,000
I wish I could be there

2530
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:09,888
You don't think I do anything because I don't kill people man what makes your s*** possible

2531
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:13,728
Iridescent

2532
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:16,544
He's not getting the facilitator

2533
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,848
He doesn't like being

2534
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:19,872
John Stockton

2535
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:22,688
Absolutely

2536
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:25,504
He knows his place and he understands

2537
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:26,528
Cosmology

2538
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:31,648
Subconscious or conscious

2539
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:33,440
Do you understand

2540
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:35,232
The structure and

2541
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:36,512
Because it's

2542
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:37,536
The place that doesn't

2543
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:39,072
If a place that takes the most

2544
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:42,400
Because there

2545
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:44,704
And it's the place that doesn't

2546
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:47,264
Real crazy

2547
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:49,056
Susie Astic

2548
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:51,872
Doesn't want to be the shield he wants to be the sword

2549
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,408
Is there something to

2550
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:56,736
This guy

2551
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:01,600
Are you

2552
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:04,416
His responses along the lines of

2553
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,256
Given the resurgence

2554
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:10,304
And that's what

2555
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,120
Has policymaker absolute

2556
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:14,656
Here's Alex's

2557
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:15,936
Attempt

2558
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:17,472
And response

2559
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:22,336
Where are you a supporter of Donald Trump supporter as a symbol of

2560
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:26,688
Which is not for Trump

2561
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:28,480
A free market Americana

2562
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:30,528
Unify

2563
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:36,672
Okay

2564
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:39,232
Full on false flag

2565
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,632
Professors wrote this manifest

2566
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:47,936
Requires that

2567
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:52,544
They were strong

2568
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,336
And research

2569
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:56,640
All of their possible ratings

2570
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:57,664
In order to

2571
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:58,944
Perfectly

2572
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:03,808
Create a facsimile of what a right-wing person would say

2573
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:15,072
Professors nefarious

2574
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:18,144
Manifesto did research

2575
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,704
Found out what

2576
02:11:21,216 --> 02:11:21,984
I don't believe that that's

2577
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:23,008
Hard to believe

2578
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:26,592
No matter either way

2579
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:32,480
Travelodge

2580
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:37,600
Only because they know what that they would

2581
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:39,136
What you know

2582
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:41,440
I'm talking about something

2583
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:44,000
Okay

2584
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:46,560
If these leftist professors wrote that

2585
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:48,608
It necessarily requires

2586
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:51,168
That they also had a hand in the actual shooting

2587
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:57,568
Or they were at least aware of how the shoot 20 minutes after

2588
02:11:57,824 --> 02:11:59,872
The shooting happened being larray

2589
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:01,920
Brett

2590
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:02,688
Create

2591
02:12:02,944 --> 02:12:03,456
Zach

2592
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:08,832
Right they didn't

2593
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:12,672
What it would require is an Unsinkable

2594
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:13,952
Ability

2595
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:17,024
Control coincidence

2596
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:18,304
From the beginning

2597
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:20,864
End of the world

2598
02:12:30,592 --> 02:12:33,408
So in this next clip Alex talks about Howard

2599
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:34,688
Manifesto

2600
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:36,736
He talks about how

2601
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:38,528
Candace Owens radical

2602
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:40,320
Now

2603
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:42,368
All the reporting that I've seen

2604
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:43,904
Outside

2605
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:49,280
Directions to recording every article that I

2606
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:50,560
Like this is clearly a joke

2607
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:51,840
Alex

2608
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:52,864
In this next clip

2609
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:54,400
Clearly recognizes

2610
02:12:54,912 --> 02:12:55,424
That it is a

2611
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:57,984
But he refuses to accept that

2612
02:12:58,496 --> 02:12:59,776
As a part of his narrative

2613
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:02,336
You listen very closely

2614
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:04,128
Read about that closely

2615
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:05,152
You will see

2616
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:05,920
But he knows it was a

2617
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:10,528
Yes

2618
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:20,256
Agnus help push me further and further into the

2619
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:22,560
Violence

2620
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:25,888
Trolling

2621
02:13:26,144 --> 02:13:27,168
So I

2622
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:31,776
Extreme Action she calls for too much

2623
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:33,312
Even provide text

2624
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:37,664
Is a total satanic inversion of reality

2625
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:41,248
Devil note

2626
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:44,576

No it's it's

2628
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:49,696
Devilry

2629
02:13:49,952 --> 02:13:50,976
Patrolling it

2631
02:13:52,256 --> 02:13:53,024

02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:56,096
He's right

2635
02:13:56,864 --> 02:13:57,376
I got

2636
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:58,400
Candace Owens

2637
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:00,960
Radicalized

2638
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:01,728
Because he's

2639
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:03,520
Influence by state

2640
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:06,592
I think it's super unlikely someone's writing something

2648
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,000
Radicalization

2649
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:26,304
You can't take that serious

2650
02:14:27,072 --> 02:14:28,608
Like it did just ended

2651
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:29,888
Nonsense

2652
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:32,192
And frolics to record

2653
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:33,472
Recognize that it is

2654
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:38,080
F****** around on some level and then refused to accept what that implies

2655
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:39,872
Is just

2656
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:45,504
Matt Bracken

2657
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:48,064
Kind of

2658
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:49,600
March

02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:56,768
Closest

2661
02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:57,536
With us

2662
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:02,912
You're a golfer from

2663
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:05,472
Yes

2664
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,640
Welsh

2665
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:14,688
Oops, time

2666
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:22,112
Oh no that's you shouldn't you shouldn't murders

2667
02:15:22,624 --> 02:15:24,160
Manifesto

2668
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:25,440
Out loud and say

2669
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:28,512
That's what I

2670
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:33,120
Nope that is s***

2671
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:37,984
The time on this episode

2672
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:38,752
Because he has someone else

2673
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,032
Flower

2674
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:43,616
Weaver is coming off it so I turned off the episode

2675
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,384
Google

2676
02:15:46,176 --> 02:15:49,504
Whatever rainbow snatch

2677
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:53,344
No not

2678
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:55,648
So Alex closes at his analysis with

2679
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:56,928
With this

2680
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:00,256
Strong were very generous

2681
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:05,632
Close out his support for a white nationalist terrorist

2682
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:08,960
I was going to say his b*******

2683
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:09,984
Similar

2684
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:10,752
Tumblr

2685
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:13,312
Ways to characterize this

2686
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:16,384
At the end

2687
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:18,944
This Friday episode

2688
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:24,576
Globalism wrote Lodge

2689
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:37,376

God help

2692
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:52,480
We don't know there are other people I don't know

2693
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,576
Synthetic

2694
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:03,744
Again with the caveat that there's possible in sincerity in the

2695
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:06,048
Needs to be comped

2696
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:12,192
It says the writer is definitely explicitly

2697
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:16,032
Do use of the Fourteen Points

2698
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:16,800
In the document

2699
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:17,568
He also uses

2700
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:18,592
The 14 words

2701
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:22,688
And he uses that word nationalist

2702
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:23,712
Contacts

2703
02:17:24,992 --> 02:17:29,344
I'm not a direct member of any organization or group is all I've donated to many nationalist groups

2704
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:30,112
Interacted

2705
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:30,880
With many more

2706
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:36,000
In response to his own question quote were you or are you in National St replies quote

2707
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:38,048
Yes predominately in Death Note

2708
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:41,632
Later he says quote I am an ethno-national

2709
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:42,912
She's pretty over

2710
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:48,288
The only information

2711
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,824
This possibly

2712
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:51,104
A dubious Manifesto

2713
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:52,896
But if you goes on it

2714
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:54,432
The guide the very literally

2715
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:55,968
He's National

2716
02:17:56,992 --> 02:18:00,832
Do you know what I think I think the reason that I don't care what he has

2717
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:01,600
To say

2718
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:03,136
The

2719
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:04,160
The manifesto

2720
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:06,464
I think the main reason

2721
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:09,792
Is the same reason I don't care

2722
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:12,864
You know somebody

2723
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:13,632
Some

2724
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:16,192
GOP senator says that they're not a racist

2725
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:20,032
Care what you say because everything you do

2726
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:21,312
Specifically

2727
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:24,384
Targeted Lee effects minority

2728
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:27,200
Define racist

2729
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:31,040
Whether or not

2730
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:32,832
You are self-reporting as a race

2731
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:34,880
Definition of

2732
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:36,928
I don't

2733
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:40,256
But this guy has to say I don't care about anything that guy

2734
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:42,048
Because he went to a mosque

2735
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:43,584
And he murdered

2736
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:46,400
And that explains itself

2737
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:47,936
Done

2738
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:51,520
Don't know why he killed people

2739
02:18:51,776 --> 02:18:53,824
You're saying

2740
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:54,592
Reinforce

2741
02:18:55,104 --> 02:18:56,128
I also don't care

2742
02:19:00,992 --> 02:19:02,528
Bring up stuff from it

2743
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:04,832
Because Alex is bringing up stuff from

2744
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:05,856
And I'm responding

2745
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:09,952
You're doing good

2746
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:10,720
And maybe there's a

2747
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:12,512
Engaged

2748
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:16,352
Find hearing it if someone

2749
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:19,168
The only reason I felt

2750
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:20,192
To bring anything

2751
02:19:21,472 --> 02:19:22,240
I think

2752
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:23,008
Calling out

2753
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:24,032
Uno's

2754
02:19:24,288 --> 02:19:27,104
This is sincere or not

2755
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:29,408
But if Alex is going to

2756
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:30,944
Play that

2757
02:19:31,968 --> 02:19:32,992
I know it behooves me

2758
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:37,600
No

2759
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:41,696
I will not be swayed or influence or

2760
02:19:42,208 --> 02:19:44,000
Consider any argument

2761
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:46,304
That involve something within that manifest

2762
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:48,608
I don't give a s*** about

2763
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:52,192
You can tell me what is Manifesto said so cool with that

2764
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:55,520
But if you say because his Manifesto said this

2765
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:56,544
You should

2766
02:19:57,824 --> 02:20:02,688
That's why I tried to make it very clear to in my

2767
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:03,968
About this

2768
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:05,504
Absolutely

2769
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:09,600
Absolutely

2770
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:11,904
Yeah

2771
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:13,184
Here we go all right

2772
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:15,232
It's all too clear to see what's happening here

2773
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:16,000
On this episode

2774
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:17,792
To the end of it

2775
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:21,632
And he knows that he has to fight back

2776
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:25,216
To get the idea that this really was a xenophobic Muslim terrorist

2777
02:20:25,728 --> 02:20:26,240
Because of course

2778
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:28,800
But there's a part of me that suspect he doesn't

2779
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:29,568
Even understand

2780
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:30,592
The scope of what he

2781
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:31,360
He's dealing with

2782
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:38,016
Every touchdown of the last episode of major element of the undoing of the militia Patriot community

2783
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:38,784
Was Timothy McVeigh

2784
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:43,392
The ugly face of what was being preached on shortwave radio and on hidden message

2785
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:45,184
Or just put on full display

2786
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:47,232
If people had to deal with what was in front of them

2787
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:51,584
When shown in the full light of day became inclimate incredibly clear to everyone

2788
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:54,144
Radicalizing crazy

2789
02:20:54,912 --> 02:21:00,800
And it was an inevitable conclusion that eventually someone was going to follow through with their life they kill tons of people

2790
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:03,360
If you truly believe that a global Italy

2791
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:04,384
Group

2792
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:08,992
Are planning on bringing an oppressive worldwide involves Universal pressure

2793
02:21:09,248 --> 02:21:09,760
Forever

2794
02:21:10,016 --> 02:21:11,040
It stands to reason

2795
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:12,320
That you might consider option

2796
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:17,696
Other than I don't know starting an absurdly dumb radio show and then eventually selling

2797
02:21:17,952 --> 02:21:18,976
Is your plan of action

2798
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:22,048
A certain amount of people who truly believe that message

2799
02:21:23,328 --> 02:21:23,840
Some terrorists

2800
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:26,656
And they're going to believe that they're Justified to do so

2801
02:21:27,168 --> 02:21:28,448
Hey Timothy McVeigh for Speed

2802
02:21:28,704 --> 02:21:30,752
To see what was really going on

2803
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:31,776
That they didn't have to

2804
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:32,544
Previous

2805
02:21:35,104 --> 02:21:35,616
Christchurch

2806
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:36,640
Has the potential to

2807
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:38,432
To be the same sort of watershed moment

2808
02:21:38,944 --> 02:21:40,224
For what the militia Patriot

2809
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:41,248
Has become

2810
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:43,040
They still love their guns

2811
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:46,368
Danielle about the new world order but the primary preoccupation of

2812
02:21:46,624 --> 02:21:47,392
People in that community

2813
02:21:47,648 --> 02:21:50,208
Is a hatred of an education towards Muslim

2814
02:21:50,976 --> 02:21:53,536
Everyone kind of knows that most

2815
02:21:53,792 --> 02:21:57,632
People are going about their daily lives and they don't have to know about white genocide narrative

2816
02:21:57,888 --> 02:21:58,656
They're pushed in these

2817
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:00,704
Or the idea of a demographic

2818
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:01,984
Quit in the

2819
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:04,288
A terrorist act like this makes

2820
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:05,312
Some have to look at it

2821
02:22:05,568 --> 02:22:11,712
In a way that Timothy McVeigh forced normal people to learn about the New World Order

2822
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:13,504
The idea that replaced

2823
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:14,784
Siri

2824
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:16,064
The idea of the replacing

2825
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:18,624
Theory is one that ultimately by definition

2826
02:22:19,136 --> 02:22:20,672
Must lead to violence and murder

2827
02:22:21,184 --> 02:22:22,720
There's just no other way around

2828
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:25,792
If your problem is that and I'm just making up these number

2829
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:28,096
Muslims in America have twice

2830
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:29,120
The birth rate of

2831
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:31,680
And you're scared that eventually that will lead

2832
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:34,240
Them having the numbers required to take over the country

2833
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:36,544
You have an unsolvable problem

2834
02:22:37,056 --> 02:22:40,128
Well you have a horrendous horrendous biggity besides

2835
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:41,408
People based on one attribute

2836
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:43,456
But you also have an unsolvable problem

2837
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:48,064
Relative birth rates become except

2838
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:51,136
Can it be 121

2839
02:22:51,392 --> 02:22:52,928
Can you only accept 2.7

2840
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:55,488
521 birth rate between non-whites and white

2841
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,792
How are you going to enforce that sort of plan

2842
02:22:58,304 --> 02:23:04,448
Before you can touch on the logistics of what these people are complaining about and pushing for your already at the point of racial quotas

2843
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:07,776
When a person isn't as valid blinded by hate

2844
02:23:08,032 --> 02:23:10,848
Constantly reinforced by manipulative propaganda

2845
02:23:11,104 --> 02:23:12,640
Is exposed to these sorts of ideas

2846
02:23:13,152 --> 02:23:14,688
The Logical endpoint

2847
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:15,712
Of this thinking

2848
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:16,992
Comes clear

2849
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:19,552
The first suggestion that probably be made

2850
02:23:19,808 --> 02:23:21,856
Beautiful sweet Deport all people who don't fit

2851
02:23:22,112 --> 02:23:22,624
Conception

2852
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:23,392
What you want

2853
02:23:23,648 --> 02:23:24,416
The population to be

2854
02:23:25,184 --> 02:23:26,208
Many of those people

2855
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:30,560
Airforce deportation would necessarily economically crippled

2856
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:31,328
If not

2857
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:33,120
Put them in legitimate Danger

2858
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:35,936
Dependent

2859
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:41,312
And then you have to consider the fact that at least some of those people that you want to deport wouldn't agree to go along with it

2860
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,592
Possibly many

2861
02:23:44,128 --> 02:23:45,920
Well I guess you'd have to put them in

2862
02:23:46,688 --> 02:23:49,760
And before you know it we're already at the first stages of another Holocaust

2863
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:52,064
And we're not even talking about the point where

2864
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:53,344
What kills

2865
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:54,880
Justin logista

2866
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:56,160
Physical aspects of

2867
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:57,440
What this world

2868
02:23:57,696 --> 02:23:58,464
View implies

2869
02:23:58,976 --> 02:23:59,488
Leave YouTube

2870
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:00,512
First steps

2871
02:24:00,768 --> 02:24:01,280
Of the Hulk

2872
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:02,560
Absolutely

2873
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:03,840
Without exception

2874
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:05,120
There's no way around

2875
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:08,192
Thought about this a great deal

2876
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:10,240
If you are obsessed

2877
02:24:10,752 --> 02:24:11,520
With demographic

2878
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:12,544
Idea

2879
02:24:13,312 --> 02:24:14,848
Any sort of variable birth rate idea

2880
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:16,384
The Next Step

2881
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,152
Conversation

2882
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:18,688
That you have to have

2883
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:20,224
Basically this

2884
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:22,784
At what point is it okay

2885
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:23,808
Right

2886
02:24:24,064 --> 02:24:26,368
If your problem is Muslim breeding

2887
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:27,648
Or something like that

2888
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:32,000
What level of Muslim

2889
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:34,048
Having kids are you okay

2890
02:24:35,072 --> 02:24:36,096
Where is the line

2891
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:36,864
Well

2892
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:39,680
I mean I suppose the only difference

2893
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:41,728
White nationalist Nazis

2894
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:42,752
Now

2895
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:44,544
Attempt

2896
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:45,568
To claim from

2897
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:47,360
Nothing

2898
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:48,384
Not the nothing

2899
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:50,432
Is that

2900
02:24:50,688 --> 02:24:52,992
They don't want to create the Holocaust

2901
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,552
They want to look

2902
02:24:55,808 --> 02:24:59,392
Hey look if we were running Germany in the 1930s

2903
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:05,792
We would have just moved all the Jews to Israel we wouldn't kill them Israel's Forge

2904
02:25:06,048 --> 02:25:08,096
Arabia's for Muslims

2905
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:10,144
America's for white folk

2906
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:18,336
We want you to have a whole let's not deal with the fact

2907
02:25:18,592 --> 02:25:24,736
Totally fine with Germans Living in America

2908
02:25:24,992 --> 02:25:28,064
FedEx

2909
02:25:28,576 --> 02:25:32,672
I know they would do something like that allowed to carry

2910
02:25:32,928 --> 02:25:35,744
Through to its next

2911
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:49,568
Implicit

2912
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:51,360
Behind

2913
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:53,920
Absolutely

2914
02:25:54,176 --> 02:25:55,968
They will understand I hope

2915
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:56,992
Phil understands that a live

2916
02:25:57,248 --> 02:26:01,344
Little better at this is not some kind of liberals just call everything to disagree with

2917
02:26:02,112 --> 02:26:05,696
This is a very batural extension where the logic of demographic anxiety

2918
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:06,976
And what are the reasons

2919
02:26:09,024 --> 02:26:14,656
Is because the idea of following through with its ideology

2920
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:16,960
If you can think about it for a short amount of time

2921
02:26:17,216 --> 02:26:19,008
You start to realize how f****** stupid

2922
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:20,800
The ideas of trying to put this in action

2923
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:22,080
Any other way

2924
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:25,920
So if you are someone who believes in these idea probably start thinking about it like

2925
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:39,488
Are then going to go out of their way to create

2926
02:26:39,744 --> 02:26:41,024
A humane

2927
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:43,328
Ethnostate

2928
02:26:47,936 --> 02:26:49,216
As it trickles down into

2929
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:53,312
Ends up

2930
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:57,920
Because that is always end up

2931
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:58,944
Easiest

2932
02:26:59,456 --> 02:26:59,968
The cheapest

2933
02:27:00,224 --> 02:27:03,296
But it is also what logically consistent with this world

2934
02:27:03,808 --> 02:27:04,320
Like

2935
02:27:04,576 --> 02:27:06,880
I don't mean to say that it makes

2936
02:27:07,648 --> 02:27:09,696
I just booked

2937
02:27:11,744 --> 02:27:13,280
Extension in the next step

2938
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:14,304
Next Step

2939
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:16,352
It is not

2940
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:17,120
Absurd

2941
02:27:17,376 --> 02:27:19,168
If you agree with the first premise

2942
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:20,448
To get to the king

2943
02:27:21,472 --> 02:27:22,752
That murder is okay

2944
02:27:23,008 --> 02:27:23,776
For these

2945
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:24,544
Exact

2946
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:31,968
Even if you say you agree with the premise but then you say well but we would never let it

2947
02:27:33,504 --> 02:27:34,272
You're full of s***

2948
02:27:34,528 --> 02:27:35,296
You would

2949
02:27:35,552 --> 02:27:37,600
Well and you couldn't control it even if you wanted to

2950
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:43,232
In the same way that I'm sure a lot of

2951
02:27:43,488 --> 02:27:45,024
People who are making good money also

2952
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,048
The militia stop

2953
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:52,448
In the 90s were like actually bombing Federal Building

2954
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:53,472
You can't do it

2955
02:27:53,728 --> 02:27:55,520
You can't control this Beast

2956
02:27:55,776 --> 02:27:57,568
That you put out into the world

2957
02:27:57,824 --> 02:27:59,872
Because there were people who will hear you

2958
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:01,920
Take you seriously and think

2959
02:28:02,176 --> 02:28:02,688
Well

2960
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:04,480
I'm going to be a hero by doing

2961
02:28:06,272 --> 02:28:08,576
In a way that no one else will

2962
02:28:09,344 --> 02:28:09,856
People who

2963
02:28:10,112 --> 02:28:11,136
Agitate toward

2964
02:28:11,392 --> 02:28:11,904
Things that

2965
02:28:13,696 --> 02:28:14,720
Need to be dealt with

2966
02:28:14,976 --> 02:28:15,744
As accessories

2967
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:18,560
I don't know how you do that

2968
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:21,888
I'm not entirely sure what policy exactly need

2969
02:28:22,144 --> 02:28:24,448
So we need to start having that conversation

2970
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:25,472
And I'm just sick of

2971
02:28:26,496 --> 02:28:27,008
So

2972
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:28,032
I said my peace

2973
02:28:29,056 --> 02:28:30,080
Haven't got the

2974
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:32,896
Sorry to yell at you

2975
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:35,968
No no what what you're going to apologize to me

2976
02:28:37,504 --> 02:28:40,320
Auto Parts

2977
02:28:43,136 --> 02:28:45,184
I think I think what's amazing

2978
02:28:45,696 --> 02:28:46,208
This Epic

2979
02:28:47,232 --> 02:28:47,744
Is

2980
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:48,512
How

2981
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:52,096
Many candidates we have for the people

2982
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:53,376
Who have not killed the guy

2983
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:55,680
And I'm going to go with

2984
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:59,008
Literally every Muslim organization that you said

2985
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:02,080
Terrorism

2986
02:29:02,336 --> 02:29:08,480
We have 100 Muslim organizations

2987
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:11,040
You're f****** kill the guy Dan

2988
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:12,064
We probably had

2989
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:14,368
Is the guy who

2990
02:29:25,632 --> 02:29:29,216
Alexandra Thurston color
