Skittles gummies

12
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
Just discovered these at the store and I dried them as I

13
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,248
You're better than Skittles

14
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,064
Probably

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,184
It's hard for me to tell me though I am a fan of

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,792
When is Skittles going to get into the THC gummies

17
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,608
Yeah it's a bootleg one I'm sure

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,936
That will be good people who enjoy that

19
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
You know it's funny what I like

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
But I don't like sneezing

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Not funny

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104

I finally

28
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,928
Got a new coffee maker

29
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,512

30
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,096
$15 Mr Coffee

31
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
Copious amounts of coffee

32
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,240
At least

33
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
Because I got the new coffee maker

34
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,592
Cuz I only work

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
Set timer

36
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,040
Because my coffee makers so garbage I haven't I didn't

37
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,112
Use that coffee

38
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Because it would have

39
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Just come

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
Garbage

41
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,304
So the first thing I did with the new coffee maker had some of that Kona coffee that you got for me

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
Fantastic

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,144

I like

47
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,128
Good coffee but if I'm going to drink a pot of it you know you might as well drink

48
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,456
I guess I mean I disagree but I I guess it's next

49
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Where you want to be at

50
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:05,856

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760

Who sent a couple of guys

74
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
Propaganda posters

75
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,839
I have got those are really cool

76
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:24,447
Unbelievably awesome I've made a point that I do really enjoy that art style

77
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,031
And I think of something really cool about communist propaganda posters and also answer

78
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
Communist propaganda posters

79
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
And if

80
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,919
Just so cool thank you so much time I can't wait to

81
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
Get those framed and put up on the wall

82
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,551
Something if you put those right next to each other there's almost like a

83
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
Duality of man

84
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:47,487
Metaphor there

85
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
Pro-communist

86
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
Posters themselves

87
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,655
Although I do have some that I found

88
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
Various places

89
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,799
Is there antique

90
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
Particular I think we're both

91
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
But communist

92
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Destination

93
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Thank you Tom

00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Today Show

95
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,791
Mi mi mi mi mi mi mi

96
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
What, what

97
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Fun

98
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
You can tell he's having a great time

99
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
Mama mama mama

100
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
My fight song

101
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,199
He didn't even have the energy to do

102
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Brutal

103
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,295
We start off the show with Alex

104
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,343
Just getting back to Studio A

105
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,439
If I understand correctly he's so he made great time back from McAllen

106
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,255
Implied that you made it back of this morning

107
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
Yeah

108
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
Owen is in studio with him

109
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:00,703
I think because there was a chance he wasn't going to make it in time them

110
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,263
Shotgun for the first bit of the show and that

111
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Does not

112
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,335
Doesn't make for good listening oh no

113
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
But they do touch early on

114
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
On the

115
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,711
Indictment of trump organization

116
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
CFO

117
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Now

118
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
Beyond from company has been indicted

119
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
But not guilty.

120
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
During a divorce

121
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
What might have let one of his children

122
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
Who's getting divorced

123
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Stay in a condo

124
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:35,007
And maybe they really use company card maybe company pencils to Owen

125
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
No and if

126
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,639
You know cut a check it may have been a pain Alex I mean God forbid

127
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
Alexander Evans

128
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
Some fun here but the reality of this case is a little bit different than the

129
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Picture there painting

130
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
The case has its roots in some questions about the Trump organization CFO Allen weisselberg son who lived

131
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,255
Apartment in paid quote far below typical Manhattan prices for it

132
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
This was

133
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
Between the years of 2005

134
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
June 2012

135
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
Oh I thought it would have been like the 9th

136
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,471
1830s when he could have been like 60 bucks more

137
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
It was not

138
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
More recently

139
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
Additionally they found that weisselberg

140
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
Self-report

141
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Headed to be a resident of Long Island

142
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,175
But in fact lived in a company paid apartment in Manhattan

143
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Thereby avoiding quote

144
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,527
Paying hundreds of thousands in federal state and city income

145
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
Come taxes

146
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,111
About 133,000 in refunds

147
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
For which he was not entitled

148
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Prosecutor set

149
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,975
This is essentially an allegation of committing

150
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,535
Fraud by paying someone under the table so there's a bunch

151
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Two things that are alike

152
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,143
Your payments and kind

153
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,519
Not reporting on your entire thing of like we're not going to pay the government

154
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:44,639
Well do anything we'll see how it shakes out as more details

155
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
A tray of this is

156
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Complete nonsense

157
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
Yeah

158
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
I mean I just

159
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,551
I I don't understand even from their kind of

160
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
Ideological

161
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
The perspective

162
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
What is

163
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
The percentage

164
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
Do you think of businesses

165
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
At bat

166
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Size

167
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,815
Don't have some sort of criminal

168
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Indictment

169
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Available

170
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,655
Eligible for one

171
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,823
Teams in all this stuff going on all the time even if you're even if you're retarded

172
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
What you should be like

173
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Is hay

174
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:21,247
This is the cfo's been doing all this stuff the whole time Trump is clean

175
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,343
These clean mayonnaise businesses clean the cfo's embezzling man

176
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
Really is he

177
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
That's an interesting

178
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:33,023
Angle that you're taking on this and have a kind of similar spin

179
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,351
Obviously there's the you could indict a ham sandwich

180
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
Define totally.

181
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:43,263
And then there was the also

182
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,871
Rodger Stone comes on defense

183
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
Basically their argument is that like

184
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
Bruise that Trump is

185
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
The cleanest business man ever tells me about Trump he's got to be one of the cleanest people that has ended

186
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,695
Everybody doing

187
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Something wrong

188
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,583
I mean it letting people use a condo during a family problem or letting someone use a company car

189
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
We have a couple company cars does that mean

190
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Company car

191
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,263
Does that mean that I paid you off in some criminal action I mean

192
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
This shows me

193
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,199
Yeah I mean if you use the fake version of the story that Alex's

194
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,015
Does television does look like

195
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
Such as driving a company car it's

196
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
Payment in the form of

197
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
That's not report

198
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,695
Yeah it's it's also a little bit like

199
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
To your question

200
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
It depends

201
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:42,655
Right but it's the context of is giving Owen a company car payment and time

202
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
Well if you gave him a couple

203
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
Pretty car in order to avoid tax

204
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
Pictures of some kind

205
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
Howard Ward is the company

206
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,895
The car is huge and it's a payment

207
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
Exactly

208
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
Maybe

209
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,111
Analysis of this case

210
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
And it does not

211
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Takeout mugshot

212
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,535
Almost no conversation conversation

213
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
Pass

214
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,983
I was kind of shocked actually like to dance on the graves of the people he doesn't like when they die

215
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Yeah

216
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:26,175
I didn't even hear anybody bring up that Errol Morris documentary where he just talk directly to Rumsfeld through

217
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
It was

218
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:32,063
Like you know with terrifying genocide all Psychopaths you know like George W bush

219
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,647
He still got that kind of charm that down-home folksy charm

220
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
And when you are just listening to Donald Rumsfeld talk

221
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
And looking into his eyes your life

222
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,559
This is the most terrifying serial killer in the history of this place

223
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
Can plan it like that guy is

224
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,191
Verify Marissa's is feta

225
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,263
It helps him and it's just like that

226
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
Space don't rub smells go ahead and talk

227
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
Present yourself to the world

228
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Old and he's just like

229
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,943
I am a very normal person and I have of course

230
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
7 million Muslims

231
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
It's no big deal sometimes you kill

232
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
People you know like he's just terrified

233
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,391
Yeah I know I would have thought that I would say something to bring up buddy I got nothing

234
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
Then that's kind of because you know this Trump indictment along with

235
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
All sorts of other

236
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
B a business

237
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
They are

238
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Indications

239
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
In this clip

240
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,335
I think if you read this very unfairly

241
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:31,455
It's very unfair reading of this globe is inciting people to Suicide bomb

242
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
Dracula's lunging arthro right now

243
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
So the analogy of

244
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
The flame of Liberty

245
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
You know

246
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,463
People going to drop whatever the numbers are

247
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:48,863
The Communists going towards the light of Liberty that torture

248
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
Freedom on a Kamikaze mission

249
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,703
Do the

250
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,263
Flame of Liberty to do anything to keep it

251
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
Going even at that

252
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,103
That means jumping into it themselves to spontaneously combust

253
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
Because we know we're about to

254
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
To do end of the tunnel we're about to be under

255
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Take over

256
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,039
We education Bachelor playing

257
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
Very ungenerous reading of that

258
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,647
What is Owen saying people need to

259
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,463
Commit suicide bombing attack

260
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,023
He's just basically saying freedom lovers

261
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Suicide bomber

262
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Duh

263
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,887
There's nothing more free than

264
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
Your body being

265
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
Small bits all over the

266
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,543
But not

267
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,383
Not an impossible one from molarity

268
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
No not good no that's not good

269
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
Not good

270
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
You know that's one option

271
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,343
You could throw yourself into the flame of Liberty

272
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Or

273
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,439
I don't know do a show on Saturday

274
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
Special

275
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
Transmission

276
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,327
I'm seriously considering it so much news is breaking

277
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,631
I'm coming in Saturday and doing a special

278
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
Broadcast on Sunday

279
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
Damn baby but on Monday

280
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
Understand

281
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,871
Last July 4th ever in this country affect you could stay

282
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
Last year was we really are

283
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
A conquered Nation or not

284
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
Honest with ourselves

285
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
How much trouble we're in

286
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,855
We have no hope so I'm just asking was realize that

287
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
This Is The Moment of Truth

288
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,975
Last 4th of July

289
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
Yeah this is definitely all about

290
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:27,167
Having our last Fourth of July and not at all about exploiting a holiday for sales

291
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
That sounds good Fourth of July sale going on

292
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
The irons

293
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
Pretty severe

294
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
So I don't know

295
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,367
Pride before the parade yes absolutely

296
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
Sometimes

297
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Alex

298
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Interesting thoughts about what

299
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
What might or might not go down

300
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,327
Suicide

301
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
No

302
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,959
Gross

303
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,543
And it's just gotten too over-the-top disgusting

304
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
We're going to hit this coming up next

305
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
Yes kick belongs

306
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Pride

307
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
I want my kids to see it

308
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
Eating feces drinking urine

309
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
Having sex in public

310
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,415
That's what goes on at the Gay Pride Parade I never been to one but I've seen the videos

311
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
Maybe.

312
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:29,375
What group far-right propaganda videos

313
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,959
About it so I'm pretty sure I have a clear-eyed view

314
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Wow

315
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
It is so

316
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Heartless

317
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
That

318
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
Everyone turns into Footloose

319
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
John Lithgow

320
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,271
The moment gay people are like let's have a party

321
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
They're just like no parties

322
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
Listen

323
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,135
Even he's even just like it's gotten

324
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
Too over-the-top like hey

325
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
I used to be a huge Pride fan

326
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:01,375
15 years ago no way I do my God

327
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,215
Oh my God there's an op-ed in the Washington Post

328
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Furious

329
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,799
They eat poop

330
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
The pride parade since its Inception

331
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,151
Now it's just gotten

332
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,223
I'm too excited I've been real chill

333
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
Anais

334
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,367
Whatever anyway Alex

335
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Is a report

336
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,463
I'm going to Pride for the first time

337
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
I barely have a great

338
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
Time

339
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
A terrible time on air but

340
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
Keep the whole time until I got you fracture an entire

341
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,055
Situation where you saw a blond blue-eyed kid

342
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:46,687
That's true being kidnapped that's true you would make up if you went to

343
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,991
Isn't it amazing how short of

344
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,575
Time. Ago we discovered that blond-haired and blue-eyed children were being

345
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,975
Kidnapped at the border and now it seems like we're not talking about it at all I don't think Alex is even talking about it on this episode

346
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,119
Nothing so important was yesterday for the Delta variant covid-19

347
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,935
Because

348
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,823
Well that's the problem is you know just like the media is 10 or 20 years

349
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Find Infowars

350
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Play just because they don't

351
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Want to be fully honest with

352
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Their audience

353
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
Did Alex talk about on air

354
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,319
The person the average person on Fox news or whatever we'll talk about behind-the-scenes with their

355
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
Family at the bar at dinner whatever they know it's all going on

356
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,207
There is not going to talk about it on TV so that causes the public

357
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
In 20 years behind

358
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,655
Why they're so stunned when they see Infowars reports from 10 years ago or whatever they're calling out everything that's happening now

359
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,215
No we're just being real about what's going on it's not

360
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
That hard to predict

361
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
The Ava

362
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
White papers 10 years ago

363
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,271
Watch this virus will have new variants to keep people lockdown

364
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
Didn't get any of that from

365
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,767
Some kind of evil globalist plan that he's red

366
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
Anyone could predict it if an outbreak isn't

367
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,399
Contained quickly the underlying virus will evolve as

368
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,823
Everytime it replicates is a chance for a mutation that could result in a new more dangerous version of it had that something that pretty much

369
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
Everybody

370
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
Was discussing in the early times

371
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
The covid pandemic

372
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,527
Biological reality around

373
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,831
When the inevitable variants arrive

374
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
If you prepare the audience

375
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,671
Interpret

376
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
As opposed to what they really are

377
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
A tragic reality of us not dealing with

378
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
Does Public Health crisis in a responsible fashion

379
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
You know if you let

380
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
Anything reproduce

381
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
Trillions of times

382
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
It's going to make a new very

383
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
Thanks kind of how everything got

384
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,823
The odds of it are greatly in

385
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Increase

386
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,919
And I mean obviously not for nothing

387
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
Alex is rhetoric

388
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
And the worldview that he's espoused

389
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Greatly

390
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
I'll contribute towards

391
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
People behaving in ways that

392
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
Increase transmission

393
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
So

394
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
I don't know

395
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,255
No it's not even it's about self-fulfilling prophecy

396
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,863
We make sure wanted to express something

397
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
Close to that without using

398
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
The term selfie.

399
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Quite right but it

400
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,263
It's in there it's in the ballpark

401
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
But it is it's

402
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,127
It's an outcome that he is warning against

403
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Wasp

404
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Torts

405
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
So he is

406
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Essentially saying

407
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,295
Don't respect the lockdowns

408
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,599
Yeah and they're going to create more various

409
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
But by not

410
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,927
Acting lockdowns you create more varied

411
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:42,047
And so on and so forth Lee at very least the odds are increased that outcome will be

412
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,143
Exactly

413
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
Creates the feedback loop that lie

414
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
Lead us to where you say that

415
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,055
10 years later Fox News is finally catching up no my friend

416
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
It's just an open Rebellion now

417
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Bien

418
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
So Alex went down to the Border

419
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Cuz he was looking for some

420
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
Footage the stereo is in a bind

421
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Is way behind

422
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
I can't do this on the Fly

423
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,927
So you went and got that video and

424
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
He has a

425
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Appointments

426
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
Right now

427
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
The Border Patrol

428
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
They are involved

429
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
Did human smuggling

430
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
That's what they need to go

431
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
On strike

432
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,495
What what's this

433
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,799
What is happening on a meditation app

434
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,127
The Border Patrol

435
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
I become the facilitator of the smuggling

436
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
We need the Border Patrol

437
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
Completely walk off because right now

438
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,831
They're the ones that organized it and bring it across actually

439
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,183
Or find a bus or go anywhere

440
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
How much the border patrol does it

441
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,791
And so the border patrol needs to have a strike

442
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
Because because

443
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
They are facilitating

444
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
The breeze

445
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,055
This is a tough this is a tough thing to workout

446
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
How to because

447
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127
Get to the larger issue of the Fiat

448
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,687
Currency and how that used to control us a new study came out

449
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
It's not what

450
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,063
Obviously it's like I give the trillions of dollars

451
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
Eschew a week

452
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
To themselves

453
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,951
But what I'm saying most Americans are still living paycheck to

454
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Paycheck and

455
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
Shmoney

456
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,607
Illegal alien you get $15,000

457
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
I'm saying

458
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,983
Some border patrol agents probably going on strike and not getting that paper

459
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
Paycheck is not an option they've got

460
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,615
Family that got mortgages

461
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
Is the fiat currency slavery

462
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
They're all enduring right now

463
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
Interesting

464
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
Is an interesting Prospect

465
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
So what he wants

466
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
Labor to do

467
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,879
Is organized

468
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
Collectively

469
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
And take

470
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Action

471
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,743
Against management

472
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Swishes

473
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Which

474
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,631
According to Alex the management has a human smuggling which I disagree with

475
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
Naturally

476
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
Yes in his

477
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
You would like to use laborers power again

478
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
I guess the manager

479
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
My class

480
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
This is a real sticky situation because

481
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
You know these people need

482
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
Evil job there

483
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,343
So their power as workers

484
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,672
Threatened by not being able to collect

485
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,440
Actively Act

486
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
Yeah this is

487
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
This is like

488
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Conversate

489
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Asian from anyone

490
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:28,704
Who's not full of s*** this is Drew Michaels bit about

491
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,264
Being so racist you go to the other side

492
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
You know like I've just

493
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Spin I'm so

494
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,616
Furious and racist in mad at

495
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,664
F****** s*** that now I'm a

496
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
Collective social

497
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,528
Goddamnit yeah

498
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Yeah what an awful

499
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,672
Well I mean it's the same thing that happens so often with Alex's rhetoric he's like you know

500
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:53,024
Complaining about stuff that like government regulation would solve

501
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Nope

502
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:01,216
I don't have a solution for this problem I'm just mad at the solution is the prop is the thing that I'm telling you is bad

503
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,312
And I'm also telling you that the thing is bad and the only real solution

504
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Is give me

505
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
Complete and total power over all

506
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,968
Anyway Alex Hudson white papers

507
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,016
Sure but he's he's found

508
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,552
These are all public

509
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,880
Available on the world economic forum's website

510
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,696
And

511
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,768
And I could tell immediately that he did not read it

512
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,864
Global governance toolkit

513
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
Mental Health

514
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
Building Trust

515
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,032
Indestructible technology for mental health

516
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,944
Control them and help them

517
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,784
You don't understand what you just read

518
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Wither disrupt

519
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,416
Pokemon takeover they're going to make you feel good and enjoy

520
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,768
And love your servitude

521
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:02,656
Alex obviously didn't read this papers

522
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
Technology even meme

523
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,264
He's interpreting the word in a way you might if you didn't.

524
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,616
Understand the concept and then you were just cold reading a headline had to come up with a meeting for it on the

525
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:18,016
Applied technology technology that disrupts things very simple if you actually read the paper you would

526
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
This is about a specific

527
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,136
Ectopic mainly disruptive technology and it's possible applications

528
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
And helping address mental health issues

529
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,744
Disruptive technology is a term that's used

530
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
To describe things

531
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
Almost

532
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Upending scale

533
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,376
Logitech startup same to be disruptive

534
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424
If you look at something like uber that's

535
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Kind of an incident of really

536
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
Disruptive innovation

537
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
Famous previous status quo

538
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
The taxi in Des

539
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:45,920
This white paper is looking at ethical implications and other issues surrounding the emerging

540
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,480
Disruptive Technologies aimed at Mental Health

541
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
Quote

542
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
From simple Edge

543
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,624
Educational websites to Virtual Reality avatars delivering cognitive behavioral therapy

544
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,488
Who's the wide-ranging subject and honestly some of the stuff I think is a little unnerving

545
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
Like a conversation about using digital phenotype

546
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
Quote where phone's watches

547
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
Computers measure everything

548
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,192
Thing from Behavior language facial expressions and post

549
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:08,960
Tonality

550
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
Been helping to make diagnosis

551
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
But that's not

552
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,360
Being forced upon people

553
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,408
About tech innovation in the mental health

554
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
Fright

555
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,528
Another thing that they bring up his how quote augmented and virtual reality are enabling

556
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,344
Consumers to experience and practice real life scenarios with

557
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,648
Open the safe confines of a visit to their psychology

558
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:32,256
Which seems like a pretty amazing possibility for a disruptive technology breakthrough

559
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
Then Mental Health

560
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
Incredibly helpful

561
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
Pulling a lot of

562
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
Circumstances

563
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Anyway

564
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
Alexandria this paper

565
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,008
He has no idea what it's about music making up a story based on what you think

566
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
What's the headline news

567
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
Which is pretty much what he always does

568
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
But in this case

569
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,176
The headline is far too complex for him to even understand

570
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,272
I need to watch him drive

571
00:24:54,528 --> 00:25:00,672
Yeah it is it is like giving a child a cookie and being I'd like I've never seen a cookie before what do I do

572
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:05,792
My mouth technology

573
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:12,192
Somebody who really likes Alex to take a look

574
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
And be like

575
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,496
Yeah he read it

576
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,872
Like defend defend him doing any preparation based on

577
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,432
Is that reading of the headline

578
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,296
Guest on the show

579
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
Rodger Stone

580
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,112
I just dropped in for a couple of minutes to be like

581
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,464
Buy trumpsc

582
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
We're all purse

583
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,024
Security

584
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Gaston this is a woman who

585
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
For Congress

586
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
Failed

587
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
It is now

588
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,984
No

589
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,544
Lauren whiskey has been a

590
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,896
Presently on shows. Infowars as well

591
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,016
All over the place jobs standing up

592
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
The freedom

593
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,552
No freedom

594
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Freedom

595
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,624
So she ran for a senate seat in Delaware

596
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,024
2020 GOP Primary but lost the general election against Chris Coons

597
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,072
Probably cuz of cheating

598
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,632
Globalist

599
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
So there's a

600
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:21,056
This is an interesting incidents of a basically like an Ouroboros have an eye on Infowars

601
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,640
Our Alex himself probably had a huge handed radicalizing Lauren

602
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
And who he's now interview

603
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,480
As if she's some kind of an independent expert in things

604
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:33,088
He wants that in the podcast that watching Loose Change 911 documentary that Alex

605
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,392
Produced was her quote Great Awakening

606
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,464
They had a 90% Awakening out of that

607
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,488
Yeah

608
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,144
She was a big qanon booster and an article in The Daily Beast by will summer does a pretty good job of racking up some of her greatest hits

609
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
From the past

610
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,472
Princeton she stated that you believe the Earth is

611
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
B flat

612
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,544
I also she posted an image on Pinterest

613
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
Over 600

614
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,896
20000 white people died to free blacks

615
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,944
Slaves and still to this day not one

616
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Thank you

617
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:07,648
Wow it's another appearance she was asked if she would be into Trump being the king of the United States

618
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
This was her response

619
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:14,048
You know that would be really cool because I really think that he's a man who puts America first

620
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,376
Who's the first president I've seen in my lifetime it really puts America first

621
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
People of America first

622
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
I guess I could get behind Trump

623
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,240
Life long-term I guess

624
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
She's either trolling or she's a lunatic

625
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Right-wing extremist

626
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,896
The matter really care which it is it doesn't really matter to me anymore

627
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,832
Sure sure it well if she really was she would have suicide bomber according to Owen so

628
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
I guess he's not really fighting

629
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
For freedom

630
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,696
The reason that she's on is that she had her bank

631
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,744
Account closed by Wells Fargo

632
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
Apparently recently

633
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
I don't know the details of this

634
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
I have no idea

635
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
She is made

636
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,168
Accusations that it

637
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
It's political

638
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
Sure I don't know

639
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,288
She hasn't she has a reason

640
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
This happened

641
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,104
Haha it was because she had

642
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
Guest-hosted

643
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,896
Good for Rick Wiles

644
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
All-night prunus show

645
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,784
Yeah that sounds like one thing that a Wells Fargo is always monitor

646
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
And she said something on that show that I

647
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
She's think

648
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,648
Retaliation

649
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,232
Warren thank you for joining us give us the latest on what's happened to you

650
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
Play so much for having me back on

651
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
To listen

652
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,656
It's no coincidence that they did this to me.

653
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
The same day

654
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,264
That I suppose the equality act I was filling in for Trunews

655
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,800
Host Rick Wiles

656
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
And I went on

657
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,616
Their show and I talked about

658
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
The equality act now

659
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,456
There is a war on Christians they did this

660
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,272
They targeted me and they made an example out of me

661
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,576
Because I'm an outspoken Christian

662
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,136
Vocally opposes the equality Act

663
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,440
I don't know if you know much about it

664
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
They're trying to legalize

665
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Jesus Christ

666
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:53,376
But trying to legalize Jesus Christ I mean I'm surprised

667
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
It didn't work

668
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:00,800
The first time

669
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,104

674
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
And equality Act

675
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,880

676
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,904

Deposing the left taking away free speech authoritarian

The churches will stop groveling mostly churches institutions aren't on board with evil they're just

694
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
Bully

695
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,128
What do you say to that

696
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,664
But also they've been

697
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,992
Cowardly they've been spineless they've been so afraid

698
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,320
The evil vile people who hate us and want us dead

699
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,344
Calling them names

700
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,160
Do they have refused to speak out against things like

701
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
Gay marriage

702
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,952
And now look at this

703
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,512
What do we have what if we seen all last month

704
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,840
I know 10 years ago we talked about the slippery slope

705
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,888
Purchase remain silent did nothing but

706
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,240
But in the end we saw that the

707
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
Angle with always the children

708
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,080
Please watch

709
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:44,736
Plies pedophilia they're pushing that normalization of pedophilia

710
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
In children shows

711
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Drag queens

712
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
Blue's Clues

713
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344

00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,672
Paraphernalia all over

00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:58,560
A discount this little clip in Blue's Clues for children

716
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,144
Yes yeah they did and they're not even hiding it anymore

717
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:06,240
You remember how when Alex is on a podcast flagrant 2 he was trying to

718
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,776
He pretended his problem with things like

719
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,848
The pride flag in Black lives matter where they corporations are

720
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
The master evil actions

721
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,432
But hiding behind socially-conscious signals

722
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
Remember how we had a conversation about that about now

723
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,296
That's something that is used in public

724
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
Because it makes sense

725
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,392
Better than just being an out-and-out bigot

726
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
Right

727
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696

00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
I miss you

729
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
This is what Alex actually

730
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,840
This is what his actual content to entails and is made up of

731
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:36,704
Blue's Clues put out a clip on their YouTube channel where blue sings alphabet song where

732
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
The pee and it stood for

733
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
Propride

Swag princess

738
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,968
Alex is not concerned with

739
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,760
The corporate Corruption of lgbtq

740
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Q+ identity

741
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,344

742
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,160
Hydrazone / bigotries Wendy's

743
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
Conversation

744
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:01,024
Like it would come off as being wildly unacceptable normal

745
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
Yeah like

746
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,584
Flagrant 2 is

747
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632

You can bro out talk about I got a trick

749
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
In what have you

750
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,776
But if you start going down there like

751
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:18,176
Gay people exist to corrupt our children or something

752
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,456
Chords a little too much

753
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,016
And so you hide behind this respectable facade

754
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,832
That is I'm just not into corporations

755
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,392
Doing this pridemonth thing where you

756
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,232
You put up a logo and then all of your past sins are forgotten

757
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
This is this is the real face of what

758
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,376
I do like the

759
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
The Reckoning

760
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
A video

761
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Christian Movement

762
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,544
Reviewer refusing to speak out again

763
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
Landscape marriage

764
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:49,920
I remember when gay marriage was trying when they were trying to legalize gay marriage

765
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,224
That was that the churches were also

766
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,296
The Christians didn't hear a people silent

767
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,392
There were too cowardly because then somebody might call them a bigot

768
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
Hushed

769
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:08,096
And that's why that's why they were so silent gay marriage was passed without any objections at all

770
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:14,496
Call and then now look at us we got Pride we got slippery slope

771
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,032
Argument and it's all because

772
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
Christians have been

773
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
2

774
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,104
Quiet

775
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,176
About lgbtq issues

776
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
It makes sense

777
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
Yeah

778
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
Nope nope

779
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
So Lauren is a big news

780
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
Actually

781
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
I think it started

782
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,464
Let's dominate Alex's coverage

783
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
Smell up for the end of the week

784
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,048
In regards to the vaccine

785
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
Did you know that likes I just

786
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
Percent

787
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
Miscarriage rates

788
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,056
Why is nobody talking about

789
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:54,944
Deletion agenda this new variants are going to be pushing fear on the American people again and us

790
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,736
Sensory information about these

791
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,576
82% of women are having miscarriages

792
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,904
Killing babies is Mormonism

793
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
Dead babies

794
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,488
They love that baby alive dead babies

795
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:12,352
So lifesitenews is a pretty bad out late with dogshit editorial standards and I don't usually

796
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
You trust them for s***

797
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:17,216
Damn you always hear things being side it's like natural news and life cider

798
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,496
To like headers always

799
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,032
I don't know about that

800
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:25,408
If you try to find this article that Lauren is telling Alex about you'll find the headline

801
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,968
Huge red flag medical researchers

802
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,808
Berry data showing 82% miscarriage rate in vaccinated with

803
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,136
This is followed by no actual article but

804
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,184
But instead there's an editor's note that says quote

805
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,232
This article has been temporary pulled

806
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
Temporarily pulled

807
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:45,120
For further review so life's I can make adjustments and provide additional clarification regarding the data

808
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
We apologize for the inconvenience

809
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,240
You could do for your understanding and patience as we speak

810
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Maintain accurate and honest

811
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,568
You can leave that

812
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,616
Headline up apparently

813
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,408
Wow

814
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:03,808
Unfortunately the damage has already been done and the talking point is reached Alex by way of this Flat Earth qanon homophobe

815
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:10,208
Even though they've taken down the article gas what it's still the number one article listed on the sites must-read list so that's

816
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Cool

817
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:17,632
Article in the way-back machine and a relies on comments from an oncologist and a quote reader who described herself

818
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,680
Self is a teacher of medical research

819
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,008
They insisted in New England Journal of Medicine paper was lying about the

820
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,800
Conclusions that its data found

821
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,616
The paper is easily accessible if anybody wants

822
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
Sarita

823
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
What the researchers did was use self-reported information

824
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,760
Come to assess the outcomes of vaccinations on

825
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:39,392
They found that quote preliminary findings did not show obvious AP signals among pregnant person

826
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,440
Who received mRNA covid

827
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
They also found that there seem to be very low-risk

828
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,560
Biscayne people who were

829
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,096
Vaccinated in later terms

830
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,864
Like third trimester

831
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,960
Wow I mean 82% miscarriage rate is low-risk

832
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:58,336
That's the cover up what they said in the paper was a cover-up

833
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:04,736
There's some concern in the data about how many people who got vaccinated early in her pregnancy did not end up in a live birth however

834
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,040
The data is unclear about exactly the circle

835
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
Everything was self-reported there's

836
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
There is a possibility of user error for example

837
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,000
Another issue is that this study that we need to wait

838
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,816
Need to get more info than obvious read

839
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,144
People who are vaccinated in their first trimester might not have reached

840
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
The point where they would be

841
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
Be giving birth yet

842
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:28,288
And that's this day does not going to be particularly useful in terms of assessing those outcomes

843
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,872
In terms of people who are vaccinated in their third trimester most

844
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
Those pregnancies have come to

845
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,200
The term so there's a more useful metric

846
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
For the purposes of what

847
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
What is paper good hope

848
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
The capture

849
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,296
The paper literally says

850
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:44,928
Whereas some pregnancies with vaccinations in the first and early second trimester have been completed

851
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,208
The majority are ongoing

852
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:50,304
And the direct comparison of outcomes on the basis of timing of vaccination is needed

853
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,608
Did you find the proportion of spontaneous abortion

854
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,632
In this cohort

855
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,192
I'm going to wait and see what comes out on this subject

856
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,264
Because he Fuller scope of information becomes available but for now

857
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,848
I can say with some certainty and lifesitenews seems to agree

858
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,640
The diversion it's being cuddled by Lauren is

859
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
Talking nonsense

860
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
This so dumb

861
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,224
Yeah I mean

862
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
Even if it was

863
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
In the sky

864
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,808
Even if we weren't

865
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Studying

866
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,880
82%

867
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
Of pregnant women

868
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
Getting this

869
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,464
Vaccine

870
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Having a missed

871
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,072
Would already have been very

872
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,864
Very very obvious

873
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:29,216
And everyone would know about it everyone would be

874
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,520
We talkin about it constantly because

875
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,592
The government and science would have been murdering children

876
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,640
At an 82% clip

877
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
Yeah that would have been an issue

878
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
Yeah it'd be very

879
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,248
The impossible to hide

880
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,624
Just at any given moment how many women are pregnant

881
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,952
At any given out any given day how many women are pregnant

882
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:57,376
Varying stages of a long enough time that enough of them worrying

883
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
Actually White

884
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,936
Winding up in a miscarriage

885
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,240
I can explain this to tistic and I will

886
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
Get to it

887
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:09,664
The Order of the Phoenix

888
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
But just

889
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
Bearface

890
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,504
You cannot trust that

891
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
Even a little bit

892
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
No no

893
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
Silly

894
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:22,720
It's it's a it's an exaggeration 22nd

895
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
It's a parody of

896
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
Avast at

897
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Hideaway

898
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,376
This is all this is all about

899
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
Well

900
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
Yeah

901
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:38,336
He knows that the easiest way to destroy something is when it's in seed

902
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,152
That's why they try to murder babies in the womb

903
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,248
What

904
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
Yes

905
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,184
After that then they tried in document doctor enables children by smearing their identities we don't really know if you

906
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,536
Your boy or a girl hey you're a boy that identifies as a girl.

907
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,352
That's smearing the identity apparently

908
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,168
Who much I hate it when people

909
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,264
The slander my gender by me saying that I don't like it

910
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,616
Fairly convinced that she's not troll

911
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
The cheese just

912
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,224
Not so this is this is like

913
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,784
This is the exploitation of an insane person

914
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,576
It does seem that way

915
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:25,952
This is not a person that can be taken as anything other than completely deluded

916
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,256
I think that one of the issues with Alex's

917
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,048
Like she'll be coming so

918
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,840
Stupid in the present day

919
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:35,424
Isn't the conversation that other way other circles are just be like

920
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:41,568
Alright I can't listen to this because you think I'm really wants to kill babies alright I got to go

921
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,848
Totally normalized

922
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,384
It's a totally like

923
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,528
It fits in no context that this person is

924
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,320
Even crazier than what you could imagine

925
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,880
Yeah

926
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,184
Can seriously as a commentator on

927
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Yeah

928
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,072
Dismiss that idea Satan knows

929
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,120
That the easiest way to

930
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
The kill thing

931
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
Is when it's a seed

932
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,704
What are you

933
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,728
Walking talking about

934
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,008
What are you

935
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,288
F****** talking about

936
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:18,432
Why it's actually harder to kill it whenever it's inside a woman cuz that's a full-grown woman there to protect it

937
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:26,624
That's true you just throw a stone at it no problem easy to kill their outside

938
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
They can't fight back

939
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,304
You need to talk to the devil serious problem

940
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,352
Lord I will get

941
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,376
To you

942
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
When we

943
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,960
Figure this out Lauren brings up this study

944
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
Alex and he has not heard of it

945
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:47,104
This is the first teaser

946
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
And he understands it

947
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,712
Sowell

948
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
Ladies and gentlemen

949
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,648
Mainline Federal numbers

950
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,536
Journal of Medicine 10 most prestigious journals in the world

951
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,632
Population alert the article from infowars.com

952
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,680
Shocking study reveals

953
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
Treatments

954
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,872
Five pregnancies

955
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,664
Be a spontaneous abortion

956
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,504
So what's going on here is that the anavex folks have glommed onto his

957
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Specific data

958
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
Point from this report

959
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:31,392
Madison and they're using it to argue that covid vaccine results

960
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
In 80 or soap

961
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
Percent death rate for brake

962
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:40,096
This New England Journal of Medicine article include the table where they list the number of spontaneous abortions

963
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,144
Observed as a percentage of the total price

964
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
Penzeys

965
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,216
Completed captured in the register

966
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
There were 800

967
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,288
27 total

968
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
100

969
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,616
Four of which resulted in spontaneous

970
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,199
This number is in line with the expected incident

971
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
Just based on

972
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,271
General population

973
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
The mix-up intuitive

974
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,367
The reason why it's a little murky

975
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:07,487
Lookie here is it it it comes from the definition of spontaneous abortion only being relevant until week

976
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
20

977
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Of pregnancy

978
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,559
Past that point it's

979
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,583
Considered a stillbirth

980
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,655
So the folks like Alex and said Steven sister what should be done

981
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
Is to not consider the

982
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:19,007
The total number of completed pregnancies as the denominator of the

983
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
The fraction

984
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,591
Instead it should be the number of people who got vaccinated in the fur

985
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
First trimester

986
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:30,527
So there's never one

987
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,855
You guys should use the numbers that I choose

988
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,647
I'm not the ones that you

989
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
Specifically designed for this study

990
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,255
And since you didn't use the numbers that I chose

991
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,815
For the study you designed that I was not

992
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,583
Involved in

993
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
That means you're lying

994
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,887
Both are also being

995
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,447
His friends are also being kind of dishonest

996
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,471
About what these numbers

997
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,007
Capture because bees Arkham

998
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
Pleated bregman

999
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:57,663
If you want to use the argument that they haven't stay honest with it you can scroll up

1000
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:02,271
On the paper and find that 1132 people were vaccinated in their first trimester

1001
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
So

1002
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:09,951
The proportion of spontaneous abortions there would be lower than the figure that they usually actual paper

1003
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,279
Is a 27 as opposed to 1132

1004
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:18,143
Issue is the 827 that number is all completed pregnant

1005
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,959
Which includes no live births and spontaneous abortion

1006
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,727
Stillbirths

1007
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,543
Many of the people who are vaccinated in the first trimester have

1008
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
Have Nots

1009
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,591
Completed their pregnancies are

1010
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,127
The point when the data was compiled

1011
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,687
So the stats look a lot worse in that column

1012
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,735
For reasons that should be really obvious

1013
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,039
If you think about it for any stretch of time longer

1014
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,831
The one of Alex's stupid commercial break

1015
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,367
Makes total sense

1016
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
Later there will be

1017
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
More

1018
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,231
Full information we can make a better

1019
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
Assessment

1020
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,583
This paper is useful in as much

1021
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,375
As it captures

1022
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
Some

1023
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
Information

1024
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,239
About late trimester

1025
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
Outcomes

1026
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
In vaccines

1027
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:01,151
Stuff about the beginning of the first and second trimester is a little bit murky

1028
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,455
Due to availability of information

1029
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
18 complete

1030
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,039
And this isn't something that is address

1031
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,063
They mentioned it in

1032
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,831
Biscotti

1033
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,855
It makes

1034
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
Total sense

1035
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
It is

1036
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,207
Hard to learn information

1037
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
That you don't

1038
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,511
Have already

1039
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,559
It takes a while

1040
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
It's not easy

1041
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
You have to

1042
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,679
The time to spread it out

1043
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,263
To learn overtype and these people are just like

1044
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Reaction

1045
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,407
I wondered why this would be report why would this be

1046
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,687
Be published as it is

1047
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
With

1048
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,039
The other information being forthcoming

1049
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,831
I think probably the

1050
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
Just because the what

1051
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879
Profound

1052
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,415
Third trimester

1053
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
Outcome

1054
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,303
Yeah I think that might be part of why they're like there's

1055
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
Strong indications

1056
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
Instead

1057
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,935
That this might be

1058
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,263
You know what sign that we're on the right track

1059
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,079
We'll see one more information

1060
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:06,687
Alex reporting this is 82% miscarriage ratings

1061
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,343
Mike Adams wrote an article about it

1062
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,903
I think it's all natural news so I assume it's like Adam

1063
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,695
A that amount in Alice

1064
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,047
The study authors apparently sought to deliberately office.

1065
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
The truth

1066
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,607
About the vaccine

1067
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,655
Causing spontaneous abortion

1068
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,847
Calculations

1069
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,639
Science news article

1070
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
We checked with our own science

1071
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,759
Contacts review the data and double-check

1072
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,087
And doing

1073
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:50,463
Yes the study shows that 82% right or spontaneous abortion

1074
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,535
Mothers giving covid vaccines during their first

1075
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
Second trimester

1076
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,887
Give me the lucky ones

1077
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,495
Yes the study authors either deliberately sought to hide the fact

1078
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:06,335
Dishonest obvious Casey's Pueblo or they are incompetent

1079
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,151
That brings into question The credibility

1080
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,687
Another word for study

1081
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,479
Was almost certainly

1082
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,807
Animated women

1083
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
That actually shows the opposite

1084
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,719
A lot of a lot of assumptions in there that are unfounded

1085
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:27,071
There was a lot of claims that I don't

1086
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
He could back up with

1087
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
Hard evidence

1088
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,911
Snow

1089
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,543
The Story Goes Around

1090
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
It'll be

1091
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:41,151
You know I'm sure a lot of people have been bombarded with chain emails and

1092
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,687
Social media post

1093
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Surrounding

1094
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
Miss talking point

1095
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271
And it's a load of b*******

1096
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,367
I mean I really feel like it must

1097
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
Chocolat

1098
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,439
To just not know anything about science

1099
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
And actively

1100
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,975
I hate it

1101
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,023
Just to the point where somebody can be like

1102
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:02,143
These scientists were clearly obfuscating deliberately this information and just say

1103
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
Sounds true to me

1104
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,727
You know just like that reactionary

1105
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:09,311
Hatred of people who have dedicated their lives to learning

1106
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
Pizza it's a

1107
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
Strange response

1108
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
Just be like

1109
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,199
This makes me angry

1110
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:21,599
Deliberate obfuscation

1111
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
And therefore

1112
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,159
It is true

1113
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
Yep

1114
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
So Alex gets a surprise guest

1115
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,559
Sherri Tenpenny

1116
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:35,935
Okay do you know Sherry 10.0 know she might have talked about her too much weirdo

1117
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,239
She's pretty Promenade

1118
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,823
She's pretty big name in the anti-vax game right now

1119
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,151
Wow I think he's got kicked off Twitter

1120
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,175
A f******

1121
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:50,527
British Barrister is huge in the anti-vax community

1122
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,063
No I think your name

1123
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,879
Moneypenny

1124
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:58,719
Protect native area British

1125
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
Type

1126
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,791
But she does have a webinar

1127
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,911
You can hopefully still keep people from getting the shot

1128
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,959
Keep them from getting the second shot

1129
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,007
If they start to have side effects

1130
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,823
You know what to look for

1131
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,711
We're going to talk about

1132
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,015
Tissue modification

1133
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:22,783
Oh boy

1134
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,575
She's into magnetism

1135
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,159
Just pretty big into the vaccines make you a magnet

1136
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
That thing

1137
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,487
I cannot have a webinar where they do

1138
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,279
Discuss becoming a magnet

1139
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,351
I guess that other the two things pull

1140
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,631
You know towards each other

1141
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,679
Or away from each other without touching

1142
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,703
So that's

1143
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
Got to be the highest

1144
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,263
As for magic that she

1145
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
How do they work

1146
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,311
How do they work

1147
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:50,175
So is cheetahs got kicked off Twitter and I don't know exactly why but

1148
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,711
Anyone's guess

1149
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,783
Invested

1150
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
This idea of

1151
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:00,671
Teaching people how to teach other people to be

1152
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,695
Oppositional

1153
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,463
Defiant again

1154
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:07,327
Text medicine okay so she's she's got a bulshit pyramids a pyramid scheme of b*******

1155
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
It does feel that way yeah

1156
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,703
Alex

1157
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,239
I took our webinar the first time

1158
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:26,015
I had no idea

1159
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,023
So perhaps

1160
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,839
Keep more of them from being injected

1161
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,399
Education technology

1162
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:45,727
That will permanently the irreversibly change your genes

1163
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,127
Give us the Prelude of the

1164
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,407
My point you're going to help me come back

1165
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
Okay

1166
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
Alright

1167
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,999
I would I would talk about the genetic modifications that will forever will destroy the genetic modification

1168
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,303
That you're going to turn into a f****** mind

1169
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:18,495
I don't know you know that this is what I've been saying I'm fine with GMOs as long as I can glow-in-the-dark like

1170
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:24,639
Scientifically superpower out of it become Magneto

1171
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,967
She doesn't really talk too much about the actual

1172
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,807
Science behind

1173
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:37,439
Correctly I cooked this is me being stupid

1174
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,767
The vaccines end goal is

1175
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,327
It's two teacher white blood cells

1176
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,887
How to make antibodies

1177
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,191
For a virus that you have another already

1178
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,287
I undo that advisor heard we haven't already developed an immunity

1179
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
Right

1180
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,591
Amira magnets

1181
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:58,943
I think magnets might be the only way you could do that

1182
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,015
Perfect alright

1183
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,295
That sounds right

1184
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,599
Obviously everybody who gets vaccinated

1185
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,367
Is going to die

1186
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,159
This is everybody

1187
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,207
There's also going to die on point

1188
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,999
But that's not the conversation we're having

1189
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,863
Tenpenny believes that everybody is going to die to kill off everybody

1190
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,399
Except

1191
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
Some people

1192
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,727
And you know why

1193
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,007
Because they got ceiling

1194
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,031
Shots

1195
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:27,359
Can you know it's interesting that we just got some

1196
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,639
Vacation yesterday

1197
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,855
And it's because

1198
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:44,767
Good opinion

1199
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,375
Category

1200
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:55,007
420 mechanisms of injury schedule

1201
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
Which is anaphylactic shock

1202
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,383
You can have one of those so that doesn't mean

1203
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,431
Free

1204
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,479
Yeah you got to go through one of those

1205
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:10,879
20 mechanisms you have to go through all 20 mechanisms to be fine

1206
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,671
You maybe got a saline shot

1207
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:17,279
There are a couple new stories that I was able to find people who are active

1208
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
So that we were given

1209
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,095
It does happen

1210
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,119
Sometime soon

1211
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,679
Add the numbers of people were very low

1212
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,215
And

1213
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,495
These news reports are saying

1214
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,543
These people went back and got

1215
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,871
Not on purpose

1216
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,919
Was not to make sure they did

1217
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,735
Died at the same time as everybody else

1218
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
I mean look

1219
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,575
Tenpenny got a meme about

1220
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,135
I'm so maybe and argue with memes

1221
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:47,743
Alex

1222
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,583
It's for screenshots I'm looking at it on my computer right now

1223
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,119
For screenshots

1224
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,167
From Newsweek magazine

1225
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:02,079
April 21st Wednesday

1226
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,711
Group of Canadians

1227
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,527
Accidentally receive saline injections

1228
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,807
Covid-19

1229
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:16,415
And the global still want to promote that stores injects people with saline

1230
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,327
Number 360

1231
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,887
Scene in South Carolina

1232
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:30,751
Is that an accident or is that intentionally misleading to what you just said

1233
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,311
Clusters are they sending

1234
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,615
Boxes of files that are just normal

1235
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
Places in

1236
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,431
Cluster

1237
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
Boxes

1238
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,503
Of the places

1239
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,343
So that they

1240
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,671
Who has a senator and a special operation

1241
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,511
We're just giving you saline don't worry

1242
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,631
The exact same thing

1243
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
Exactly

1244
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,007
Oh yeah

1245
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,031
Okay that's

1246
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
That's probably

1247
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:10,431
Vaccine

1248
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:16,831
Tucker Carlson got the vaccine all of their Republican politicians got the wedding

1249
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,231
Oh no

1250
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:29,375
Brick shocked reaction on there to have her tell him about that

1251
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,167
20 mechanisms that he's about to

1252
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,191
To go through

1253
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,239
Jesus

1254
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,823
I was reading a little bit about these

1255
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,151
These alien shots that have happened and part of the reason is

1256
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
Speak Australian

1257
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,711
Who's used as

1258
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,247
Get to dilute the shot

1259
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,527
And so some people

1260
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,111
Accidentally got the unactivated

1261
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:57,279
Yeah I don't know I don't know why this retired Colonel guy is son who's in Special Forces

1262
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,839
Get the shot in the guy tells him don't worry we're just

1263
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
Giving you sailing

1264
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,703
Why would they even go through that the playacting of it

1265
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,495
No no

1266
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,287
I just don't know

1267
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,311
Just tell me when you got a shot

1268
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
Yeah

1269
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,639
Yeah or just not tell book

1270
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:19,039
You were just not tell them why would you give rank-and-file people that kind of information going to file any special force

1271
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
Fine

1272
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,695
Yeah I mean if it's

1273
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,511
If you're giving this kind of information to someone who's

1274
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
Special Forces

1275
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,351
He's going to tell his dad was going to tell Alex

1276
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:40,287
Got to be careful special forces guy if you don't ever

1277
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,079
Alex

1278
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
Jokes

1279
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,735
People are being magnetized or saline shops

1280
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:52,831
Are being given out in order to make sure that some people survive

1281
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,623
Construction.

1282
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,159
I have bad news for you

1283
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,975
If you are parents

1284
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,511
And you vaccinate your child

1285
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
They'll Never Grow Up

1286
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,399
Indiana came out with a couple weeks ago

1287
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,703
If you're vaccinated

1288
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:12,287
Engrave

1289
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823
Haven't even got

1290
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:14,847
That point yet

1291
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,663
Kindergarteners

1292
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,199
The 7th grade

1293
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:25,343
Did children who are now marked forever and forever will have

1294
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,791
As they grow up

1295
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,143
Adult

1296
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
Haha

1297
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,823
Children with these Technologies

1298
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,359
Golden that will give them

1299
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,383
Privileges

1300
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,695
They won't be able to do any

1301
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,799
It was really happening

1302
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,103
I think the

1303
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,991
I think that living through a global pandemic is just the subject of a

1304
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,015
Nightmarish

1305
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,807
Movie and we've gotta movies

1306
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:30,111
Lot of movies and we lived through it

1307
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,135
Yeah

1308
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671
Yeah

1309
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,719
I look there's a lot of tough

1310
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,767
Tough conversations in tough decision

1311
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,583
I'm really glad on

1312
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,607
Some level that

1313
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,631
I don't have any kids

1314
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,167
And I don't have

1315
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,959
Involvement in those

1316
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,495
Those sorts of decisions

1317
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,031
I'm not a teacher and I work at a

1318
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
School

1319
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,591
Any of that

1320
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,895
Figuring out exactly how to navigate this is

1321
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,919
Incredibly challenge

1322
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,711
And I do not

1323
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:00,319
I envy no one with actual power in this situation

1324
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:03,135
I have zero nvim like

1325
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,927
Yeah would you guys

1326
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:09,023
Good luck I'm not even going to be like hey this is what you have to do you got to make that

1327
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
Isaac

1328
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,351
Conversations about it our challenge

1329
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,143
And I think that there's a lot of

1330
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:14,911
Morelos

1331
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,191
Invoice has been Alex Jones

1332
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
Tenpenny

1333
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,751
Yeah

1334
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,031
If you're listening

1335
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,055
You're going out the window

1336
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,847
That's defenestration

1337
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,663
Going to grow up

1338
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:29,503
I don't know if there's anything I can think of that's funnier

1339
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:34,367
Then them believing that 10 years we're going to have a generation of 8

1340
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:40,255
18 year old tiny people just wandering around like with their tiny little high-pitched voices

1341
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,303
Experience of

1342
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,631
Real life. I was honestly wondering if that's what she meant

1343
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,399
Because it makes

1344
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,423
It's very little sense

1345
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,751
No and it turns out I think that is what you meant

1346
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:54,335
It's what you said if parents get their kids

1347
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,015
Dota 2 ever wanting to become a grandparent

1348
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,207
Who's already started her periods

1349
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,023
Is anybody going to keep to see whether or not she

1350
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,863
If she hasn't started up yet

1351
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,703
She will

1352
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:23,519
About the little boy

1353
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,359
Will never grow into

1354
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,295
Is anybody

1355
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,343
If we give this to 12 year old boys

1356
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,623
Children's Choir

1357
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,447
They certainly don't want to

1358
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,263
Have their children these children

1359
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:01,407
Humans

1360
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,431
What

1361
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,455
What the

1362
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,503
Book are you talkin about

1363
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,343
I don't even know what to do anymore like

1364
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,927
There's there's a certain amount of stuff that can be like disgust

1365
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:19,071
In terms of like okay this study is something with being misrepresented blah blah blah

1366
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
Alex

1367
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,887
Didn't read this white paper

1368
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:26,239
And it's funny that he called read it and came up with a completely different version

1369
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,775
I don't know what

1370
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,055
To do with

1371
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,847
Peter Pan

1372
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,383
I don't know what to do

1373
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,663
I don't know what to do with this

1374
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,943
Because it's nonsense

1375
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,735
First of all I don't know what you talk

1376
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,807
Secondarily

1377
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,087
What you saying

1378
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,391
If this happens

1379
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,927
Will anyone notice

1380
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,351
I don't understand

1381
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,167
She thinks that like science doesn't have a vested interest in keeping

1382
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:56,959
Things

1383
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,775
A data for longitudinal studies and

1384
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:00,799
You know

1385
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,639
This will be something could be closely monitored

1386
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
Don't stop

1387
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,455
Non-Stop

1388
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:11,295
Don't stop even if even if it's 30 years from now

1389
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:17,695
There's still going to be like we we got one study that's been going on tracking how vaccines work over 40 years

1390
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,487
Will anybody notice if

1391
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,887
There are boys generation of twelve-year-old girl suddenly stop having their periods at the same time

1392
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,007
Are the boys don't grow and have no body hair

1393
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,055
We've got a bucket

1394
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:37,151
Entire generation of Castro's with beautiful voices that people are going to notice

1395
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,431
Yeah

1396
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,991
Seems like one of the more

1397
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,015
Obvious

1398
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,343
These

1399
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
Also

1400
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:46,879
Also

1401
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,671
Obvious anger

1402
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,719
Cuz her ankle is f******

1403
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,279
The obvious angle for Alec

1404
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,047
Sixto

1405
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,607
Is to say that the reason the elites are doing this

1406
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,423
It's so they can have an infinite amount of head

1407
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,191
Pedophile

1408
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,215
Children around

1409
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,519
You know they never grow up

1410
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,079
That's the only angle that makes

1411
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,919
Since I really I guess I'm glad that he didn't do that

1412
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:12,223
Really glad that he didn't do that

1413
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:16,319
That you did I'm not selfish about it but I mean what and what else is there

1414
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:21,439
They're not going to let them grow up because they don't want grandchildren

1415
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,535
I think that was more her saying that if

1416
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:30,399
You get your children that you won't have breakfast

1417
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:34,751
Maybe

1418
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
I don't know

1419
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,311
Maybe

1420
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,615
Well there's so many more

1421
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,895
Easy ways to do it

1422
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,919
Yeah like

1423
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:47,039
Alex's talked about like Plan B

1424
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:52,671
And it seems like it could backfire if it's giving people magnet powers

1425
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:59,327
So bad what if it accidentally turns people into like they never go up but also they can never die

1426
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,655
Okay here's what I would do

1427
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,703
If this is what I thought my

1428
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,263
Sworn enemy was doing

1429
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,311
Would feel shame for them and

1430
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,591
Inform me for having

1431
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,639
This is pathetic

1432
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,175
This is a dumb plan

1433
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:17,503
I can I can end of this plan all tell you one way to end this plan

1434
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,551
I'm going to tell the special forces guy

1435
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,343
That I gave him a saline shot

1436
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,623
Hanover

1437
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,439
Defeated player

1438
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,023
Silliness

1439
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,303
Some of the

1440
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,327
The attacks on

1441
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,351
Vaccine

1442
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,399
Reality

1443
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,935
Growing

1444
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,959
Of its

1445
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,055
More nonsensical than usual certainly check

1446
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,335
I was shocked

1447
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,871
There's no no real rum

1448
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
Conversation on this app

1449
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
Episode butts

1450
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:52,831
You know when you get breaking news like this study that Lauren witzke brings to his attention and sometimes it'll catch you off-guard

1451
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,623
Ignore the whole room

1452
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,903
Spell

1453
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,927
Special drop in

1454
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,951
In from

1455
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,535
No that'll that'll take up

1456
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,655
Talk to Tenpenny whenever 10 pennies around breaking news about

1457
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,447
Grown up

1458
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,055
So I can't get out of my head

1459
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,335
The idea that

1460
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,615
When I'm like 90

1461
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,407
I'm going to be hanging out

1462
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,431
With this child

1463
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,455
Who is

1464
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,223
80 South

1465
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,623
With all the weird world-weariness it comes with that age

1466
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:27,903
Perfect

1467
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,695
Skin

1468
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,231
Just perfect child

1469
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,535
Ibtech

1470
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,815
That's going to happen

1471
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,375
I guess we'll see you

1472
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,935
70 years old

1473
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:43,263
This is the end of this episode

1474
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,287
2 nonsense

1475
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,591
Project Camelot

1476
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:53,759
Kind of semblance of reality

1477
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,783
Deteriorated

1478
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,063
Like even without us knowing

1479
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,623
Like it's just gotten nonsense

1480
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,647
This is too much

1481
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:03,743
Just say is aliens trying to keep our children the same age and that's

1482
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,511
It's the same

1483
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:08,095
It would it would have the same amount of grounding

1484
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
And support

1485
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,679
Zia

1486
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:18,079
See what happened to in the future with Alex but I think he's going to be talked about this 82% number probably for the foreseeable future

1487
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,359
Which will be annoyed

1488
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:23,455
I wonder if it's going to make it all the way on on the talk show

1489
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,479
I don't know I think

1490
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:28,575
I think someone would be able to

1491
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,391
We can't back this up

1492
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,719
Yeah it was taken down on life

1493
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:39,839
A little bit

1494
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,655
It's cuz also wanted

1495
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:45,983
One of the problems with it is it's pretty easily explainable based on the context

1496
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,775
The conclusion

1497
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,799
Trying to be pushy

1498
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,823
By Alex

1499
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,359
Incendiary

1500
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
That like

1501
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,967
If you actually believe that 82%

1502
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,271
People who got vaccinated

1503
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,831
Lost their pregnancy

1504
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:02,623
That's

1505
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,439
I don't know what you would be drugging to do

1506
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,975
Yeah I know I mean resolved

1507
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
To fight back again

1508
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,815
Baby jump into the fire of Liberty

1509
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
I mean

1510
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:16,191
Okay million pregnant women who got the shot just

1511
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,983
Let's just say that number

1512
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,775
And you're going to tell me

1513
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,823
Everyone now knows

1514
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,407
820000 of those women will have a

1515
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
F******

1516
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:30,015
Miscarriage or abortion

1517
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:33,855
And

1518
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135
That it wouldn't

1519
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,903
Start a war

1520
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:41,279
That would that there's no way that that wouldn't start a war

1521
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:45,119
How incendiary that idea is Rebecca

1522
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,399
Conclusion is

1523
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,423
I mean

1524
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,959
I've always been wrong when I say

1525
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,495
People will have more restraint

1526
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,543
I would

1527
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,847
I think the Tucker would know enough to be like

1528
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,127
This could get somebody

1529
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:59,455
This is I don't I don't like Alex

1530
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:03,295
This is what this is What Separates Me from him all the little bit

1531
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,111
I don't know

1532
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,135
Where the right-wing

1533
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,671
We've killed abortion.

1534
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,463
We know how this works

1535
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,255
If we go that hard

1536
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,023
It's

1537
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
Bloodbath

1538
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,071
For any doctor

1539
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:18,143
Yeah I don't I don't I don't know I mean like I said

1540
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,167
That I hope you would have the

1541
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,191
Restraint to realize

1542
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,495
Like the danger of playing with that kind of fire but

1543
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:23,775
Very wrong

1544
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,567
About sibo and the

1545
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
But everything

1546
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,871

1547

We'll see what's going on in

1549
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,223

01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,039
